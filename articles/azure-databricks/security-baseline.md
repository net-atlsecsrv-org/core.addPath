# Azure security baseline for Azure Databricks

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Databricks contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Databricks in your own Azure virtual network (VNet). The default deployment of Azure Databricks is a fully managed service on Azure: all data plane resources, including a VNet that all clusters will be associated with, are deployed to a locked resource group. If you require network customization, however, you can deploy Azure Databricks data plane resources in your own virtual network (VNet injection), enabling you to implement custom network configurations. You can apply your own network security group (NSG) with custom rules to specific egress traffic restrictions.

Additionally, you can configure NSG rules to specify egress traffic restrictions on the subnet that your Azure Databricks instance is deployed to. Azure Firewall can be configured for VNET injected workspaces.

* [How to manage NSGs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICS

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Databricks in your own Azure virtual network (VNet). A network security group (NSG) is not created automatically. You are required to create a baseline NSG with default Azure rules only. When you deploy a workspace, rules required by Databricks are added. You can also start with an empty NSG and the appropriate rules will be added automatically. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic audits. You may also send flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.5: Record network packets and flow logs

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Databricks in your own Azure virtual network (VNet). A Network Security Group (NSG) is not created automatically. You are required to create a baseline NSG with default Azure rules only. When you deploy a workspace, rules required by Databricks are added. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic audit. You may also send flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Implement an IDP/IPS capable network virtual appliance (NVA) from the Azure Marketplace to create a virtual network-integrated workspace in which all Azure Databricks clusters have a single IP outbound address. The single IP address can be used as an additional security layer with other Azure services and applications that allow access based on specific IP addresses. You can use an Azure firewall, or other 3rd party tools like NVA, to manage ingress and egress traffic.

If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups that are attached to the Subnets your Azure Databricks instance is associated with. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change. Service tags are not supported with non-injected VNET workspaces.

* [Understand Service Tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement network security configurations for your Azure Databricks instances with Azure Policy. You may use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Databricks" namespace to define custom policy definitions. Policies wonâ€™t apply to resources within the managed resource group.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Management templates, Role-based access control (RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.
