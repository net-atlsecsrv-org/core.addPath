# Azure Germany web and mobile services

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since [August 2018](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2018/08/31/microsoft-to-deliver-cloud-services-from-new-datacentres-in-germany-in-2019-to-meet-evolving-customer-needs/), we have not been accepting new customers or deploying any new features and services into the original Microsoft Cloud Germany locations.
>
> Based on the evolution in customers’ needs, we recently [launched](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-azure-available-from-new-cloud-regions-in-germany/) two new datacenter regions in Germany, offering customer data residency, full connectivity to Microsoft’s global cloud network, as well as market competitive pricing. 
>
> Take advantage of the breadth of functionality, enterprise-grade security, and comprehensive features available in our new German datacenter regions by [migrating](germany-migration-main.md) today.
