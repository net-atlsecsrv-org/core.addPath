# Deploy an Azure App Service app by using Visual Studio 2015
This article describes how to deploy an Azure App Service app (API app, web app, or mobile app) to Azure Germany by using Visual Studio 2015.

## Prerequisites
* See [Visual Studio prerequisites](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md#prerequisites) to install and configure Visual Studio 2015 and the Azure SDK.
* Follow [these instructions](./germany-get-started-connect-with-vs.md) to configure Visual Studio to connect to an Azure Germany account. 

## Open an app project in Visual Studio
Open an existing app solution or project in Visual Studio or [create a project](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet-framework.md#create-and-publish-the-web-app). Then, run the app in Visual Studio to make sure it works locally.

## Deploy to Azure Germany
After Visual Studio is configured to connect to your Azure Germany account (which you already did as a prerequisite), [instructions to deploy an App Service app](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md) are exactly same as they are for global Azure.

## Next steps
* [Deploy an ASP.NET web app to Azure App Service by using Visual Studio](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md).
* For general App Service information, see [App Service - API Apps documentation](../app-service/index.yml).
* For supplemental information and updates, subscribe to the 
[Azure Germany blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuregermany/).
