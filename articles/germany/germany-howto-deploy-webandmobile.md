# Deploy an Azure App Service app by using Visual Studio 2015

[!INCLUDE [closureinfo](../../includes/germany-closure-info.md)]

This article describes how to deploy an Azure App Service app (API app, web app, or mobile app) to Azure Germany by using Visual Studio 2015.

## Prerequisites
* See [Visual Studio prerequisites](../app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore.md#prerequisites) to install and configure Visual Studio 2015 and the Azure SDK.
* Follow [these instructions](./germany-get-started-connect-with-vs.md) to configure Visual Studio to connect to an Azure Germany account. 

## Open an app project in Visual Studio
Open an existing app solution or project in Visual Studio or [create a project](../app-service/quickstart-dotnet-framework.md#create-and-publish-the-web-app). Then, run the app in Visual Studio to make sure it works locally.

## Deploy to Azure Germany
After Visual Studio is configured to connect to your Azure Germany account (which you already did as a prerequisite), [instructions to deploy an App Service app](../app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore.md) are exactly same as they are for global Azure.

## Next steps
* [Deploy an ASP.NET web app to Azure App Service by using Visual Studio](../app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore.md).
* For general App Service information, see [App Service - API Apps documentation](../app-service/index.yml).
