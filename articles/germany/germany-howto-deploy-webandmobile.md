# Deploy an Azure App Service app by using Visual Studio 2015

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since [August 2018](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2018/08/31/microsoft-to-deliver-cloud-services-from-new-datacentres-in-germany-in-2019-to-meet-evolving-customer-needs/), we have not been accepting new customers or deploying any new features and services into the original Microsoft Cloud Germany locations.
>
> Based on the evolution in customers’ needs, we recently [launched](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-azure-available-from-new-cloud-regions-in-germany/) two new datacenter regions in Germany, offering customer data residency, full connectivity to Microsoft’s global cloud network, as well as market competitive pricing.

> Take advantage of the breadth of functionality, enterprise-grade security, and comprehensive features available in our new German datacenter regions by [migrating](germany-migration-main.md) today.

This article describes how to deploy an Azure App Service app (API app, web app, or mobile app) to Azure Germany by using Visual Studio 2015.

## Prerequisites
* See [Visual Studio prerequisites](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md#prerequisites) to install and configure Visual Studio 2015 and the Azure SDK.
* Follow [these instructions](./germany-get-started-connect-with-vs.md) to configure Visual Studio to connect to an Azure Germany account. 

## Open an app project in Visual Studio
Open an existing app solution or project in Visual Studio or [create a project](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet-framework.md#create-and-publish-the-web-app). Then, run the app in Visual Studio to make sure it works locally.

## Deploy to Azure Germany
After Visual Studio is configured to connect to your Azure Germany account (which you already did as a prerequisite), [instructions to deploy an App Service app](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md) are exactly same as they are for global Azure.

## Next steps
* [Deploy an ASP.NET web app to Azure App Service by using Visual Studio](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md).
* For general App Service information, see [App Service - API Apps documentation](../app-service/index.yml).
* For supplemental information and updates, subscribe to the 
[Azure Germany blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuregermany/).
