# Device Update for IoT Hub update manifest

## Overview

Device Update for IoT Hub uses an _update manifest_ to communicate actions and also metadata supporting those actions through the
 [AzureDeviceUpdateCore.OrchestratorMetadata:4](./device-update-plug-and-play.md)interface properties.
 This document describes the fundamentals of how the `updateManifest` property, in the
 `AzureDeviceUpdateCore.OrchestratorMetadata:4` interface, is used by the Device Update Agent. The
 `AzureDeviceUpdateCore.OrchestratorMetadata:4` interface properties are sent from the Device Update for IoT Hub service
 to the Device Update Agent. The `updateManifest` is a serialized JSON Object that is parsed by the Device Update Agent.

### An example update manifest

```JSON
{
    "manifestVersion": "1",
    "updateId": {
        "provider": "DuTest",
        "name": "DuTestUser",
        "version": "2020.611.534.16"
    },
    "updateType": "microsoft/swupdate:1",
    "installedCriteria": "1.0",
    "files": {
        "00000": {
            "fileName": "image.swu",
            "sizeInBytes": 256000,
            "hashes": {
                "sha256": "IhIIxBJpLfazQOk/PVi6SzR7BM0jf4HDqw+6gdZ3vp8="
            }
        }
    },
    "createdDateTime": "2020-06-12T00:38:13.9350278"
}
```

The purpose of the update manifest is to describe the contents of an update, namely its identity, type,
installed criteria, and update file metadata. In addition, the update manifest is cryptographically signed to
allow the Device Update Agent to verify its authenticity. Refer to the [Device Update security](./device-update-security.md) documentation for more information on how the update manifest is used to securely import content.

## Import manifest vs update manifest

It is important to understand the differences between the import manifest and the update manifest concepts in Device Update for IoT Hub. 
* The [import manifest](./import-concepts.md) is created by whoever creates the corresponding update. It describes the contents of the update that will be imported into Device Update for IoT Hub. 
* The update manifest is automatically generated by the Device Update for IoT Hub service, using some of the properties that were defined in the import manifest. It is used to communicate relevant information to the Device Update Agent during the update process. 

Each manifest type has its own schema and schema version.

## Update manifest properties

The high-level definitions of the update manifest properties can be found in the interface definitions found
[here](./device-update-plug-and-play.md). To provide deeper context, let's take a closer look
at the properties and how they are used in the system.

### updateId

Contains the `provider`, `name`, and `version`, which represents the exact Device Update for IoT Hub update identity used
to determine compatible devices for the update.

### updateType

Represents the type of update which is handled by a specific type of update handler. It follows the form
of `microsoft/swupdate:1` for an image-based update and `microsoft/apt:1` for a package-based update (see `Update Handler Types` section below).

### installedCriteria

A string that contains information needed by Device Update Agent's Update Handler to determine whether the update is
installed on the device. The `Update Handler Types` section documents the format of the `installedCriteria`,
for each update type supported by Device Update for IoT Hub.

### files

Tells the Device Update Agent which files to download, and the hash that will be used to use to verify the files were downloaded correctly.
Here's a closer look at the `files` property contents:

```json
"files":{
        <FILE_ID_STRING>:{
            "fileName":<STRING>,
            "sizeInBytes":<INTEGER>,
            "hashes":{
                <HASH-TYPE>:<HASH-STRING>
            }
        }
    }
```

Outside of the `updateManifest` is the `fileUrls` array of JSON Object.

```json
"fileUrls":{
      <FILE_ID_STRING>: <URL-in-String-Format>
 }
```

Both the `FILE_ID_STRING`, within `fileUrls`, and `files` are the same (for example, "0000" in `files` has the url
at "0000" within `fileUrls`).

### manifestVersion

A string that represents the schema version.

## Update Handler Types

|Update Method|Update Handler Type|Update Type|Installed Criteria|Expected Files for Publishing|
|-------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
|Image-based|SWUpdate|"microsoft/swupdate:version"|The reference image saves the hint of its version in the /etc/adu-version file.  |.swu file that contains SWUpdate image|
|Package-based|APT|"microsoft/apt:version"|`<name>` + "-" + `<version>` (defined properties in the APT Manifest file|`<APT Update Manifest>`.json that contains the APT configuration and package list|
