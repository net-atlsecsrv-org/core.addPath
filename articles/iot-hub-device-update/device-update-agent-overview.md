# Device Update for IoT Hub Agent Overview

The Device Update Agent consists of two conceptual layers:

* The Interface Layer builds on top of [Azure IoT Plug and Play
(PnP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play)
allowing for messaging to flow between the Device Update Agent and Device Update Services.
* The Platform Layer is responsible for the high-level update actions of Download, Install, and Apply that may be platform, or device specific.

## The Interface Layer

The Interface layer is made up of the [ADU Core Interface](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/tree/main/src/agent/adu_core_interface) and the [Device Information Interface](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/tree/main/src/agent/device_info_interface).

These interfaces rely on a configuration file for default values. The default values include aduc_manufacturer and aduc_model for the AzureDeviceUpdateCore interface and model and manufacturer for the DeviceInformation interface. [Learn More](device-update-configuration-file.md) the configuration file.

### ADU Core Interface

The 'ADU Core' interface is the primary communication channel between Device Update Agent and Services. [Learn More](device-update-plug-and-play.md#adu-core-interface) about this interface.

### Device Information Interface

The Device Information Interface is used to implement the `Azure IoT PnP DeviceInformation` interface. [Learn More](device-update-plug-and-play.md#device-information-interface) about this interface.

## The Platform Layer

There are two implementations of the Platform Layer. The Simulator Platform
Layer has a trivial implementation of the update actions and is used for quickly
testing and evaluating Device Update for IoT Hub services and setup. When the Device Update Agent is built with
the Simulator Platform Layer, we refer to it as the Device Update Simulator Agent or just
simulator. [Learn More](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/docs/agent-reference/how-to-run-agent.md) about how to use the simulator
agent. The Linux Platform Layer integrates with [Delivery Optimization](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client) for
downloads and is used in our Raspberry Pi reference image, and all clients that run on Linux systems.

### Simulator Platform Layer

The Simulator Platform Layer implementation can be found in the
`src/platform_layers/simulator_platform_layer` and can be used for
testing and evaluating Device Update for IoT Hub.  Many of the actions in the
"simulator" implementation are mocked to reduce physical changes to experiment with Device Update for IoT Hub.  An end to end
"simulated" update can be performed using this Platform Layer. [Learn
More](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/docs/agent-reference/how-to-run-agent.md) about running the simulator agent.

### Linux Platform Layer

The Linux Platform Layer implementation can be found in the
`src/platform_layers/linux_platform_layer` and it integrates with the [Delivery Optimization Client](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/releases) for downloads and is used in our Raspberry Pi reference image, and all clients that run on Linux systems.

This layer can integrate with different Update Handlers to implement the
installer. For
instance, the `SWUpdate` Update Handler invokes a shell script to call into the
`SWUpdate` executable to perform an update.

## Update Handlers

Update Handlers are components that handle content or installer-specific parts
of the update. Update Handler implementations are in `src/content_handlers`.

### Simulator Update Handler

The Simulator Update Handler are used by the Simulator Platform Layer and can
be used with the Linux Platform Layer to fake interactions with a Content
Handler. The Simulator Update Handler implements the Update Handler APIs with
mostly no-ops. The implementation of the Simulator Update Handler can be found below:
* [Image update simulator](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/src/content_handlers/swupdate_handler/inc/aduc/swupdate_simulator_handler.hpp)
* [Package update apt simulator](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/src/content_handlers/apt_handler/inc/aduc/apt_simulator_handler.hpp)

Note: The InstalledCriteria field in
the AzureDeviceUpdateCore PnP interface should be the sha256 hash of the
content. This is the same hash that is present in the [Import Manifest
Object](import-update.md#create-device-update-import-manifest). [Learn
More](device-update-plug-and-play.md) about `installedCriteria` and the `AzureDeviceUpdateCore` interface.

### `SWUpdate` Update Handler

The `SWUpdate` Update Handler" integrates with the `SWUpdate` command-line
executable and other shell commands to implement A/B updates specifically for
the Raspberry Pi reference image. Find the latest Raspberry Pi reference image [here](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases). The `SWUpdate` Update Handler is implemented in [src/content_handlers/swupdate_content_handler](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/tree/main/src/content_handlers/swupdate_handler).

### APT Update Handler

The APT Update Handler processes an APT-specific Update Manifest and invokes APT to
install or update the specified Debian package(s).

## Self-update Device update agent

The device update agent and its dependencies can be updated through the Device Update for IoT Hub pipeline. If you are using an image-based update, include the latest device update agent in your new image. If you are using a package-based update, include the device update agent and its desired version in the apt manifest like any other package. [Learn more](device-update-apt-manifest.md) about apt manifest. You can check installed version of the Device Update agent and the Delivery Optimization agent in the Device Properties section of your [IoT device twin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins). [Learn more about device properties under ADU Core Interface](device-update-plug-and-play.md#device-properties).
