# Device Update Agent Provisioning

The Device Update Module agent can run alongside other system processes and [IoT Edge modules](../iot-edge/iot-edge-modules.md) that connect to your IoT Hub as part of the same logical device. This section describes how to provision the Device Update agent as a module identity. 


## Module identity vs device identity

In IoT Hub, under each device identity, you can create up to 50 module identities. Each module identity implicitly generates a module twin. On the device side, the IoT Hub device SDKs enable you to create modules where each one opens an independent connection to IoT Hub. Module identity and module twin provide the similar capabilities as device identity and device twin but at a finer granularity. [Learn more about Module Identities in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-module-twins.md)


## Support for Device Update

The following IoT device types are currently supported with Device Update:

* Linux devices (IoT Edge and Non-IoT Edge devices):
    * Image A/B update:
        - Yocto - ARM64 (reference image), extensible via open source to [build you own images](device-update-agent-provisioning.md#how-to-build-and-run-device-update-agent) for other architecture as needed.
        - Ubuntu 18.04 simulator
       
    * Package Agent supported builds for the following platforms/architectures:

## Prerequisites  

If you're setting up the IoT device/IoT Edge device for [package based updates](./understand-device-update.md#support-for-a-wide-range-of-update-artifacts), add packages.microsoft.com to your machine’s repositories by following these steps:

1. Log onto the machine or IoT device on which you intend to install the Device Update agent.

1. Open a Terminal window.

1. Install the repository configuration that matches your device’s operating system.
    ```shell
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/multiarch/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list
    ```
    
1. Copy the generated list to the sources.list.d directory.
    ```shell
    sudo cp ./microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    ```
    
1. Install the Microsoft GPG public key.
    ```shell
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
    ```

    ```shell
    sudo cp ./microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
    ```

## How to provision the Device Update agent as a Module Identity

This section describes how to provision the Device Update agent as a module identity on IoT Edge enabled devices, non-Edge IoT devices, and other IoT devices.


### On IoT Edge enabled devices

Follow these instructions to provision the Device Update agent on [IoT Edge enabled devices](../iot-edge/index.yml).

1. Follow the instructions to [Install and provision the Azure IoT Edge runtime](../iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge.md?preserve-view=true&view=iotedge-2020-11).

1. Install the Device Update image update agent
    - We provide sample images in [Artifacts](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases), the swUpdate file is the base image that you can flash onto a Raspberry Pi B3+ board, and the .gz file is the update you would import through Device Update for IoT Hub. See example of [how to flash the image to your IoT Hub device](/azure/iot-hub-device-update/device-update-raspberry-pi#flash-sd-card-with-image).  

1. Install the Device Update package update agent  
    - For latest agent versions from packages.miscrosoft.com: Update package lists on your device and install the Device Update agent package and its dependencies using:	
		```shell
		sudo apt-get update
		```
	
		```shell
		sudo apt-get install deviceupdate-agent deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt
		```
	
    - For upcoming release candidate versions from [Artifacts](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) : Download the .dep file to the machine you want to install the Device Update agent on, then:
	 	```shell
		sudo apt-get install -y ./"<PATH TO FILE>"/"<.DEP FILE NAME>"
	 	```
	
1. You are now ready to start the Device Update agent on your IoT Edge device. 

### On non-Edge IoT Linux devices

Follow these instructions to provision the Device Update agent on your IoT Linux devices.

1. Install the IoT Identity Service and add the latest version to your IoT device. 
    1. Log onto the machine or IoT device.
    1. Open a terminal window.
    1.	Install the latest [IoT Identity Service](https://github.com/Azure/iot-identity-service/blob/main/docs/packaging.md#installing-and-configuring-the-package) on your IoT device using this command:
    
        ```shell
        sudo apt-get install aziot-identity-service
        ```
        
1. Provisioning IoT Identity service to get the IoT device information.
    1. Create a custom copy of the configuration template so we can add the provisioning information. In a terminal, enter the below command.
      
        ```shell
        sudo cp /etc/aziot/config.toml.template /etc/aziot/config.toml 
        ```
   
1. Next edit the configuration file to include the connection string of the device you wish to act as the provisioner for this device or machine. In a terminal, enter the below command.

    ```shell
    sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```
   
1. You should see a message like the following example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/understand-device-update/config.png" alt-text="Diagram of IoT Identity Service config file." lightbox="media/understand-device-update/config.png":::

    1. In the same nano window, find the block with “Manual provisioning with connection string”.
    1. In the window, delete the “#” symbol ahead of 'provisioning'
    1. In the window, delete the “#” symbol ahead of 'source' 
    1. In the window, delete the “#” symbol ahead of 'connection_string'
    1. In the window, delete the string within the quotes to the right of 'connection_string' and then add your connection string there 
    1. Save your changes to the file with 'Ctrl+X' and then 'Y' and hit the 'enter' key to save your changes. 
    
1.	Now apply and restart the IoT Identity service with the command below. You should now see a “Done!” printout that means you have successfully configured the IoT Identity Service.

    > [!Note]
    > The IoT Identity service registers module identities with IoT Hub by using symmetric keys currently.
    
    ```shell
    sudo aziotctl config apply
    ```
    
1.	Finally install the Device Update agent. We provide sample images in [Artifacts](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases), the swUpdate file is the base image that you can flash onto a Raspberry Pi B3+ board, and the .gz file is the update you would import through Device Update for IoT Hub. See example of [how to flash the image to your IoT Hub device](/azure/iot-hub-device-update/device-update-raspberry-pi#flash-sd-card-with-image).

1.	You are now ready to start the Device Update agent on your IoT device. 

### Other IoT devices

The Device Update agent can also be configured without the IoT Identity service for testing or on constrained devices. Follow the below steps to provision the Device Update agent using a connection string (from the Module or Device).


1.	We provide sample images in [Artifacts](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases), the swUpdate file is the base image that you can flash onto a Raspberry Pi B3+ board, and the .gz file is the update you would import through Device Update for IoT Hub. See example of [how to flash the image to your IoT Hub device](/azure/iot-hub-device-update/device-update-raspberry-pi#flash-sd-card-with-image).

1.	Log onto the machine or IoT Edge device/IoT device.
	
1.	Open a terminal window.

1.	Add the connection string to the [Device Update configuration file](device-update-configuration-file.md):
    1. Enter the below in the terminal window:
        - [For Package updates](device-update-ubuntu-agent.md) use: sudo nano /etc/adu/adu-conf.txt
        - [For Image updates](device-update-raspberry-pi.md) use: sudo nano /adu/adu-conf.txt
       
    1. You should see a window open with some text in it. Delete the entire string following 'connection_String=' the first-time you provision the Device Update agent on the IoT device. It is just place holder text.
    
    1. In the terminal, replace "<your-connection-string>" with the connection string of the device for your instance of Device Update agent.
    
        > [!Important]
        > Do not add quotes around the connection string.
        ```shell
        connection_string=<ADD CONNECTION STRING HERE>
        ```
       
    1. Enter and save.
    
1.	Now you are now ready to start the Device Update agent on your IoT device. 


## How to start the Device Update Agent
