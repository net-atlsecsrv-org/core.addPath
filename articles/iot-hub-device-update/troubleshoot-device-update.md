# Device Update for IoT Hub Troubleshooting Guide

This document lists some common questions and issues Device Update users have reported. As Device Update progresses through Public Preview, this troubleshooting guide will be updated periodically with new questions and solutions. If you encounter an issue that does not appear in this troubleshooting guide, refer to the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to document your situation.

## <a name="import"></a>Importing updates

### Q: I'm having trouble connecting my Device Update instance to my IoT Hub instance.
_Please ensure your IoT Hub message routes are configured correctly, as per the [Device Update resources](./device-update-resources.md) documentation._

### Q: I'm encountering a role-related error (error message in Azure portal or a 403 API error).
_You may not have access permissions configured correctly. Please ensure you have configured access permissions correctly as per the [Device Update access control](./device-update-control-access.md) documentation._

### Q: I'm encountering a 500-type error when importing content to the Device Update service.
_An error code in the 500 range may indicate an issue with the Device Update service. Please wait 5 minutes, then try again. If the same error persists, please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft._

### Q: I'm encountering an error code when importing content and would like to parse it.
_Please refer to the [Device Update Error Codes](./device-update-error-codes.md) documentation for information on parsing error codes._

## <a name="device-failure"></a>Device failures

### Q: How can I ensure my device is connected to Device Update for IoT Hub?
_You can verify that your device is connected to Device Update by checking if it shows up under the "Ungrouped" devices section in the compliance view of Azure portal._

### Q: One or more of my devices is failing to update.
_There are many possible root causes for a device update failure. Please validate that the device is: 1) connected to your IoT Hub instance, 2) connected to your Device Update instance, and 3) the Delivery Optimization (DO) service is running. If all three are true for your device, please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft._

## <a name="deploy"></a> Deploying an update

### Q: I've deployed an update to my device(s), but the compliance status says it isn't on the latest update. What should I do?
_The device compliance status can take up to 5 minutes to refresh. Please wait, then check again._
### Q: My device's deployment status shows incompatible, what should I do?
_The manufacturer and model properties of a targeted device may have been changed after connecting the device to IoT Hub, causing the device to now be considered incompatible with the update content of the current deployment._

_Check the [ADU Core Interface](./device-update-plug-and-play.md) to see what manufacturer and model your device is reporting to the Device Update service, and make sure it matches the manufacturer and model you specified in the [import manifest](./import-concepts.md) of the update content being deployed. You can change these properties for a given device using the [Device Update configuration file](./device-update-configuration-file.md)._

### Q: I see my deployment is in "Active" stage but none of my devices are "In progress" with the update. What should I do?
_Ensure that your deployment start date is not set in the future. When you create a new deployment, the deployment start date is defaulted to the next day as a safeguard unless you explicitly change it. You can either wait for the deployment start date to arrive, or cancel the ongoing deployment and create a new deployment with the desired start date._

### Q: I'm trying to group my devices, but I don't see the tag in the drop-down when creating a group.
_Ensure that you have correctly configured the message routes in your IoT Hub as per the [Device Update resources](./device-update-resources.md) documentation. You will have to tag your device again after configuring the route._

_Another root cause could be that you applied the tag before connecting your device to Device Update for IoT Hub. Ensure that your device is already connected to Device Update. You can verify that your device is connected to Device Update for IoT Hub by checking if it shows up under “Ungrouped” devices in the compliance view. Temporarily add a tag of a different value, and then add your intended tag again once the device is connected._

_If you are using Device Provisioning Service (DPS), then ensure that you tag your devices after they are provisioned and not during the Device creation process. If you have already tagged your device during the Device creation step, then you will have to temporarily tag your device with a different value after it is provisioned, and then add your intended tag again._

### Q: My deployment completed successfully, but some devices failed to update.
_This may have been caused by a client-side error on the failed devices. Please see the Device Failures section of this troubleshooting guide._

### Q: I encountered an error in the UX when trying to initiate a deployment.
_This may have been caused by a service/UX bug, or by an API permissions issue. Please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft._

### Q: I started a deployment but it isn’t reaching an end state.
_This may have been caused by a service performance issue, a service bug, or a client bug. Please retry your deployment after 10 minutes. If you encounter the same issue, please pull your device logs and refer to the Device Failures section of this troubleshooting guide. If the same issue persists, please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft._

## <a name="download"></a> Downloading updates onto devices

### Q: How do I resume a download when a device has reconnected after a period of disconnection?
_The download will self-resume when connectivity is restored within a 24-hour period. After 24 hours, the download will need to be reinitiated by the user._
## <a name="mcc"></a> Using Microsoft Connected Cache (MCC)

### Q: I am encountering an issue when attempting to deploy the MCC module on my IoT Edge device.
_Refer to the [IoT Edge documentation]() for deploying Edge modules to IoT Edge devices. You can check if the MCC module is running successfully on your IoT Edge device by navigating to http://localhost:5100/Summary._
### Q: One of my IoT devices is attempting to download an update through MCC, but is failing.
_There are several issues that could be causing an IoT device to fail in connecting to MCC. In order to diagnose the issue, please collect the DO client and Nginx logs from the failing device (see the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section for instructions on gathering client logs)._

_Your device may be failing to pull content from the Internet to pass to its MCC module because the URL it’s using isn’t allowed. To determine if so, you will need to check your IoT Edge environment variables in Azure portal._
## <a name="contact"></a> Contacting Microsoft Support

If you run into issues that can't be resolved using the FAQs above, you can file a support request with Microsoft Support through the Azure portal interface. Depending on which category you indicate your issue belongs to, you may be asked to gather and share additional data to help Microsoft Support investigate your issue. 

Please see below for instructions on how to gather each data type. You can use [getDevices]() to check for
additional information in the payload response of the API.

In addition, the following information can be useful for narrowing down the root cause of your issue:
* What type of device you are attempting to update (Azure Percept, IoT Edge Gateway, other)
* What Device Update client type you are using (Image-based, Package-based, Simulator)
* What OS your device is running
* Details regarding your device's architecture
* Whether you have successfully used Device Update to update a device before

If you have any of the above information available, please include it in your description of the issue.

### Collecting client logs

* On the Raspberry Pi Device there are two sets of logs found here:

    ```markdown
    /adu/logs
    ```

    ```markdown
    /var/cache/do-client-lite/log
    ```

* For the packaged client the logs are found here:

    ```markdown
    /var/log/adu
    ```

    ```markdown
    /var/cache/do-client-lite/log
    ```

* For the Simulator, the logs are found here:

    ```markdown
    /tmp/aduc-logs
    ```
