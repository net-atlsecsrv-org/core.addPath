# Device Update for IoT Hub Resource Management

To get started with Device Update you'll need to create a Device Update account, instance and set access control roles. 

## Prerequisites

* Access to an IoT Hub. It is recommended that you use a S1 (Standard) tier or above. 
* Supported browsers:
  * [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
  * Google Chrome

## Create a device update account

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

2. Click Create a Resource and search for "Device Update for IoT Hub"

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/device-update-marketplace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Device Update for IoT Hub resource." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/device-update-marketplace.png":::

3. Click Create -> Device Update for IoT Hub

4. Specify the Azure Subscription to be associated with your Device Update Account and Resource Group

5. Specify a Name and Location for your Device Update Account

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/account-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of account details." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/account-details.png":::

 > [!NOTE]
 > You can go to [Azure Products-by-region page](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=iot-hub) to discover the regions where Device Update for IoT Hub is available. If Device Update for IoT Hub is not available in your region you can choose to create an account in an available region closest to you. 

6. Click "Next: Review + create>"

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/account-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot of account details review." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/account-review.png":::

7. Review the details and then select "Create". You will see your deployment is in progress. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/account-deployment-inprogress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of account deployment in progress." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/account-deployment-inprogress.png":::

8. You will see the deployment status change to "complete" in a few minutes. Click "Go to resource"

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/account-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of account deployment complete." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/account-complete.png":::

## Create a device update instance 

An instance of Device Update is associated with a single IoT hub. Select the IoT hub that will be used with Device Update. We will create a new Shared Access policy during this step to ensure Device Update uses only the required permissions to work with IoT Hub (registry write and service connect). This policy ensures that access is only limited to Device Update.

To create a Device Update instance after an account has been created.

1. Once you are in your newly created account resource, go to the Instance Management "Instances" blade

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/instance-blade.png" alt-text="Screenshot of instance management within account." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/instance-blade.png":::

2. Click "Create and specify an instance name and select your IoT Hub

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/instance-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of instance details." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/instance-details.png":::

   > [!NOTE] 
   > The IoT Hub you link to your Device Update resource, doesn't need to be in the same region as your Device Update Account. However, for better performance it is recommended that your IoT Hub be in a region same as or close to the region of your Device Update account. 

3. Click "Create". You will see the instance in a "Creating" state. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/instance-creating.png" alt-text="Screenshot of instance creating." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/instance-creating.png":::

4. Allow 5-10 mins for the instance deployment to complete. Refresh the status till you see the "Provisioning State" turn to "Succeeded".

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/instance-succeeded.png" alt-text="Screenshot of instance creation succeeded." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/instance-succeeded.png":::

## Configure IoT Hub 

In order for Device Update to receive change notifications from IoT Hub, Device Update integrates with the "Built-In" Event Hub. Clicking the "Configure IoT Hub" button configures the required message routes and access policy required to communicate with IoT devices. 

To configure IoT Hub

1. Once the Instance "Provisioning State" turns to "Succeeded", select the instance in the Instance Management blade. Click "Configure IoT Hub"

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/instance-configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring IoT Hub for an instance." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/instance-configure.png":::

2. Select "I agree to make these changes"

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/instance-configure-selected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of agreeing to configure IoT Hub for an instance." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/instance-configure-selected.png":::

3. Click "Update"

## Configure access control roles

In order for other users to have access to Device Update, users must be granted access to this resource. 

1. Go to Access control (IAM) within the Device Update account

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/account-access-control.png" alt-text="Screenshot of access Control within Device Update account." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/account-access-control.png":::

2. Click "Add role assignments"

3. Under "Select a Role", select a Device Update role from the given options
     - Device Update Administrator
     - Device Update Reader
     - Device Update Content Administrator
     - Device Update Content Reader
     - Device Update Deployments Administrator
     - Device Update Deployments Reader
     
   :::image type="content" source="media/create-device-update-account/role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of access Control role assignments within Device Update account." lightbox="media/create-device-update-account/role-assignment.png":::

4. Assign access to a user or Azure AD group
5. Click Save
6. You are now ready to use the Device Update experience from within your IoT Hub
