# Quickstart: Deploy a Managed Apache Spark Cluster (Preview) with Azure Databricks

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra provides automated deployment and scaling operations for managed open-source Apache Cassandra datacenters, accelerating hybrid scenarios and reducing ongoing maintenance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure portal to create a fully managed Apache Spark cluster inside the Azure Virtual Network of your Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster. You will create the Spark cluster in Azure Databricks. Later you can create or attach notebooks to the cluster, read data from different data sources, and analyze insights.

You can also learn more with detailed instructions on [Deploying Azure Databricks in your Azure Virtual Network (Virtual Network Injection)](/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/vnet-inject).

## Create an Azure Databricks cluster

Follow these steps to create an Azure Databricks cluster in a Virtual Network that has the Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the left nav, locate **Resource groups** and navigate to your resource group that contains the Virtual Network where your managed instance is deployed.

1. Open the **Virtual Network** resource, and make a note of the **Address space**:

1. From the resource group, select **Add** and search for **Azure Databricks** in the search field:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-cluster-databricks/databricks.png" alt-text="Search for Azure Databricks." border="true":::

1. Select **Create** to create an Azure Databricks account:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-cluster-databricks/databricks-create.png" alt-text="Create an Azure Databricks account." border="true":::

1. Fill out the following values:

   * **Workspace name** - Provide a name for your Databricks workspace.
   * **Region** - Make sure to select the same region as your Virtual Network.
   * **Pricing Tier** - Choose between Standard, Premium, or Trial. For more information on these tiers, see [Databricks pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/databricks/).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-cluster-databricks/select-name.png" alt-text="Fill out workspace name, region, and pricing tier for the Databricks account." border="true":::

1. Next, select the **Networking** tab, and fill the following details:

   * **Deploy Azure Databricks workspace in your Virtual Network (VNet)** - Select **Yes**.
   * **Virtual Network** - From the dropdown, choose the Virtual Network where your managed instance exists.
   * **Public Subnet Name** - Enter a name for the public subnet.
   * **Public Subnet CIDR Range** - Enter an IP range for the public subnet.
   * **Private Subnet Name** - Enter a name for the private subnet.
   * **Private Subnet CIDR Range** - Enter an IP range for the private subnet.

   To avoid range collisions, ensure that you select higher ranges. If necessary, use a [visual subnet calculator](https://www.fryguy.net/wp-content/tools/subnets.html) to divide the ranges:

   The following screenshot shows example details on the networking pane:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-cluster-databricks/subnets.png" alt-text="Specify public and private subnet names." border="true":::

1. Select **Review and create** and then **Create** to deploy the workspace.

1. **Launch Workspace** after it's created.

1. You are redirected to the Azure Databricks portal. From the portal, select **New Cluster**.

1. In the **New cluster** pane, accept default values for all fields other than the following fields:

   * **Cluster Name** - Enter a name for the cluster.
   * **Databricks Runtime Version** - Select Scala 2.11 or lower version that is supported by the Cassandra Connector.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-cluster-databricks/spark-cluster.png" alt-text="Select the Databricks runtime version and the Spark Cluster." border="true":::

1. Expand **Advanced Options** and add the following configuration. Make sure to replace the node IPs and credentials:

    ```java
    spark.cassandra.connection.host <node1 IP>,<node 2 IP>, <node IP>
    spark.cassandra.auth.password cassandra
    spark.cassandra.connection.port 9042
    spark.cassandra.auth.username cassandra
    spark.cassandra.connection.ssl.enabled true
    ```

1. From the **Libraries** tab, install the latest version of spark connector for Cassandra(*spark-cassandra-connector*) and restart the cluster:

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this managed instance cluster, delete it with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu of Azure portal, select **Resource groups**.
1. From the list, select the resource group you created for this quickstart.
1. On the resource group **Overview** pane, select **Delete resource group**.
3. In the next window, enter the name of the resource group to delete, and then select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to create a fully managed Apache Spark cluster inside the Virtual Network of your Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster. Next, you can learn how to manage the cluster and datacenter resources:
