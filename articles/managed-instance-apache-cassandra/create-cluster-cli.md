# Quickstart: Create an Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster using Azure CLI (Preview)

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra provides automated deployment and scaling operations for managed open-source Apache Cassandra datacenters. This service helps you accelerate hybrid scenarios and reduce ongoing maintenance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure CLI commands to create a cluster with Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra. It also shows to create a datacenter, and scale nodes up or down within the datacenter.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

* [Azure Virtual Network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) with connectivity to your self-hosted or on-premise environment. For more information on connecting on premises environments to Azure, see the [Connect an on-premises network to Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/) article.

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.17.1 or higher. If you are using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## <a id="create-cluster"></a>Create a managed instance cluster

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

1. Set your subscription ID in Azure CLI:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az account set -s <Subscription_ID>
   ```

1. Next, create a Virtual Network with a dedicated subnet in your resource group:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network vnet create -n <VNet_Name> -l eastus2 -g <Resource_Group_Name> --subnet-name <Subnet Name>
   ```

1. Apply some special permissions to the Virtual Network and the subnet, which are required by the managed instance. Use the `az role assignment create` command, replacing `<subscription ID>`, `<resource group name>`, `<VNet name>`, and `<subnet name>` with the appropriate values:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az role assignment create --assignee e5007d2c-4b13-4a74-9b6a-605d99f03501 --role 4d97b98b-1d4f-4787-a291-c67834d212e7 --scope /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<VNet name>/subnets/<subnet name>
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `assignee` and `role` values in the previous command are fixed values, enter these values exactly as mentioned in the command. Not doing so will lead to errors when creating the cluster. If you encounter any errors when executing this command, you may not have permissions to run it, please reach out to your admin for permissions.

1. Next create the cluster in your newly created Virtual Network by using the [az managed-cassandra cluster create](/cli/azure/ext/cosmosdb-preview/managed-cassandra/cluster?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#ext_cosmosdb_preview_az_managed_cassandra_cluster_create) command. Run the following command the value of `delegatedManagementSubnetId` variable:

   > [!NOTE]
   > The value of the `delegatedManagementSubnetId` variable you will supply below is exactly the same as the value of `--scope` that you supplied in the command above:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   resourceGroupName='<Resource_Group_Name>'
   clusterName='<Cluster_Name>'
   location='eastus2'
   delegatedManagementSubnetId='/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<VNet name>/subnets/<subnet name>'
   initialCassandraAdminPassword='myPassword'
    
   az managed-cassandra cluster create \
      --cluster-name $clusterName \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --location $location \
      --delegated-management-subnet-id $delegatedManagementSubnetId \
      --initial-cassandra-admin-password $initialCassandraAdminPassword \
      --debug
   ```

1. Finally, create a datacenter for the cluster, with three nodes by using the [az managed-cassandra datacenter create](/cli/azure/ext/cosmosdb-preview/managed-cassandra/datacenter?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#ext_cosmosdb_preview_az_managed_cassandra_datacenter_create) command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   dataCenterName='dc1'
   dataCenterLocation='eastus2'
    
   az managed-cassandra datacenter create \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --cluster-name $clusterName \
      --data-center-name $dataCenterName \
      --data-center-location $dataCenterLocation \
      --delegated-subnet-id $delegatedManagementSubnetId \
      --node-count 3 
   ```

1. Once the datacenter is created, if you want to scale up, or scale down the nodes in the datacenter, run the [az managed-cassandra datacenter update](/cli/azure/ext/cosmosdb-preview/managed-cassandra/datacenter?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#ext_cosmosdb_preview_az_managed_cassandra_datacenter_update) command. Change the value of `node-count` parameter to the desired value:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   resourceGroupName='<Resource_Group_Name>'
   clusterName='<Cluster Name>'
   dataCenterName='dc1'
   dataCenterLocation='eastus2'
    
   az managed-cassandra datacenter update \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --cluster-name $clusterName \
      --data-center-name $dataCenterName \
      --node-count 9 
   ```

## Connect to your cluster

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra does not create nodes with public IP addresses. To connect to your newly created Cassandra cluster, you must create another resource inside the virtual network. This resource can be an application, or a virtual machine with Apache's open-source query tool [CQLSH](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/tools/cqlsh.html) installed. You can use a [Resource Manager template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-vm-simple-linux/) to deploy an Ubuntu virtual machine. After it's deployed, use SSH to connect to the machine and install CQLSH as shown in the following commands:

```bash
# Install default-jre and default-jdk
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre

# Install the Cassandra libraries in order to get CQLSH:
echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 311x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
curl https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cassandra

# Export the SSL variables:
export SSL_VERSION=TLSv1_2
export SSL_VALIDATE=false

# Connect to CQLSH (replace <IP> with the private IP addresses of the nodes in your Datacenter):
host=("<IP>" "<IP>" "<IP>")
cqlsh $host 9042 -u cassandra -p cassandra --ssl
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error when applying permissions to your Virtual Network, such as *Cannot find user or service principal in graph database for 'e5007d2c-4b13-4a74-9b6a-605d99f03501'*, you can apply the same permission manually from the Azure portal. To apply permissions from the portal, go to the **Access control (IAM)** pane of your existing virtual network and add a role assignment for "Azure Cosmos DB" to the "Network Administrator" role. If two entries appear when you search for "Azure Cosmos DB", add both the entries as shown in the following image: 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-cluster-cli/apply-permissions.png" alt-text="Apply permissions" lightbox="./media/create-cluster-cli/apply-permissions.png" border="true":::

> [!NOTE] 
> The Azure Cosmos DB role assignment is used for deployment purposes only. Azure Managed Instanced for Apache Cassandra has no backend dependencies on Azure Cosmos DB.  

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the `az group delete` command to remove the resource group, the managed instance, and all related resources:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name <Resource_Group_Name>
```
