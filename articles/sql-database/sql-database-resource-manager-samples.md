# Azure Resource Manager templates for Azure SQL Database

Azure Resource Manager templates enable you to define your infrastructure as code and deploy your solutions to Azure cloud.

## [Single database & elastic pool](#tab/single-database)

The following table includes links to Azure Resource Manager templates for Azure SQL Database.

| |  |
|---|---|
| [Single database](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-sql-database-transparent-encryption-create) | This Azure Resource Manager template creates a single Azure SQL Database with logical server and configures firewall rules. |
| [Logical server](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-sql-logical-server) | This Azure Resource Manager template creates a logical server for Azure SQL Database. |
| [Elastic pool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-sql-elastic-pool-create) | This template allows you to deploy a new Elastic pool with its new associated SQL Server and new SQL Databases to assign to it. |
| [Failover groups](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-sql-with-failover-group) | This template creates two Azure SQL logical servers, a SQL database, and a failover group.|
| [Threat Detection](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-sql-threat-detection-db-policy-multiple-databases) | This template allows you to deploy an Azure SQL logical server and a set of Azure SQL Databases with Threat Detection enabled, with an email address for alerts for each database. Threat Detection is part of the SQL Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) offering and provides a layer of security that responds to potential threats over SQL servers and databases.|
| [Auditing to Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-sql-auditing-server-policy-to-blob-storage) | This template allows you to deploy an Azure SQL logical server with Auditing enabled to write audit logs to a blob storage. Auditing for Azure SQL Database tracks database events and writes them to an audit log that can be placed in your Azure storage account, OMS workspace, or Event Hubs.|
| [Auditing to Azure Event Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-sql-auditing-server-policy-to-eventhub) | This template allows you to deploy an Azure SQL server with Auditing enabled to write audit logs to an exiting Event Hub. In order to send audit events to Event Hub, set auditing settings with `Enabled` `State` and set `IsAzureMonitorTargetEnabled` as `true`. Also, configure Diagnostic Settings with `SQLSecurityAuditEvents` diagnostic logs category on the `master` database (for serve level auditing). Auditing for Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse tracks database events and writes them to an audit log that can be placed in your Azure storage account, OMS workspace, or Event Hubs.|
| [Azure Web App with SQL Database](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-web-app-sql-database) | This sample creates a free Azure Web App and SQL Database at the "Basic" service level.|
| [Azure Web App and Redis Cache with SQL Database](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-web-app-redis-cache-sql-database) | This template creates a Web App, Redis Cache, and SQL Database in the same resource group, and creates two connection strings in the Web App for the SQL Database and Redis Cache.|
| [Import data from blob storage using ADF V2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-data-factory-v2-blob-to-sql-copy) | This Azure Resource Manager template creates Azure Data Factory V2 that copies data from Azure Blob Storage to SQL Database.|
| [HDInsight cluster with a SQL Database](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-hdinsight-linux-with-sql-database) | This template allows you to create a HDInsight cluster, a SQL Database server, a SQL Database, and two tables. This template is used by the [Use Sqoop with Hadoop in HDInsight article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/hdinsight-use-sqoop) |
| [Azure Logic App that runs a SQL Stored Procedure on a schedule](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-logic-app-sql-proc) | This template allows you to create a Logic App that will run a SQL stored procedure on schedule. Any arguments for the procedure can be put into the body section of the template.|

## [Managed Instance](#tab/managed-instance)

The following table includes links to Azure Resource Manager templates for Azure SQL Database - Managed Instance.

| |  |
|---|---|
| [Managed Instance in a new VNet](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-sqlmi-new-vnet) | This Azure Resource Manager template creates a new configured Azure VNet and Managed Instance in the VNet. |
| [Network environment for Managed Instance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-sql-managed-instance-azure-environment) | This deployment will create a configured Azure Virtual Network with two subnets - one that will be dedicated to your Managed Instances, and another one where you can place other resources (for example VMs, App Service environments, etc.). This template will create a properly configured networking environment where you can deploy Managed Instances. |
| [Managed Instance with P2S connection](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-sqlmi-new-vnet-w-point-to-site-vpn) | This deployment will create an Azure Virtual Network with two subnets `ManagedInstance` and `GatewaySubnet`. Managed Instance will be deployed in ManagedInstance subnet. Virtual network gateway will be created in `GatewaySubnet` subnet and configured for Point-to-Site VPN connection. |
| [Managed Instance with Virtual machine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-sqlmi-new-vnet-w-jumpbox) | This deployment will create an Azure Virtual Network with two subnets `ManagedInstance` and `Management`. Managed Instance will be deployed in `ManagedInstance` subnet. Virtual machine with the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) will be deployed in `Management` subnet. |
