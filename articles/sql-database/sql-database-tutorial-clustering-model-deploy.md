# Tutorial: Deploy a clustering model in R with Azure SQL Database Machine Learning Services (preview)

In part three of this three-part tutorial series, you'll deploy a clustering model, developed in R, into a SQL database using Azure SQL Database Machine Learning Services (preview).

You'll create a stored procedure with an embedded R script that performs clustering. Because your model executes in the Azure SQL database, it can easily be trained against data stored in the database.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a stored procedure that generates the model
> * Perform clustering in SQL Database
> * Use the clustering information

In [part one](sql-database-tutorial-clustering-model-prepare-data.md), you learned how to prepare the data from an Azure SQL database to perform clustering.

In [part two](sql-database-tutorial-clustering-model-build.md), you learned how to create and train a K-Means clustering model in R.

[!INCLUDE[ml-preview-note](../../includes/sql-database-ml-preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Part three of this tutorial series assumes you have completed [**part one**](sql-database-tutorial-clustering-model-prepare-data.md) and [**part two**](sql-database-tutorial-clustering-model-build.md).

## Create a stored procedure that generates the model

Run the following T-SQL script to create the stored procedure. The procedure recreates the steps you developed in parts one and two of this tutorial series:

* classify customers based on their purchase and return history
* generate four clusters of customers using a K-Means algorithm

The procedure stores the resulting customer cluster mappings in the database table **customer_return_clusters**.

```sql
USE [tpcxbb_1gb]
DROP PROC IF EXISTS generate_customer_return_clusters;
GO
CREATE procedure [dbo].[generate_customer_return_clusters]
AS
/*
  This procedure uses R to classify customers into different groups
  based on their purchase & return history.
*/
BEGIN
    DECLARE @duration FLOAT
    , @instance_name NVARCHAR(100) = @@SERVERNAME
    , @database_name NVARCHAR(128) = db_name()
-- Input query to generate the purchase history & return metrics
    , @input_query NVARCHAR(MAX) = N'
SELECT ss_customer_sk AS customer,
    round(CASE 
            WHEN (
                    (orders_count = 0)
                    OR (returns_count IS NULL)
                    OR (orders_count IS NULL)
                    OR ((returns_count / orders_count) IS NULL)
                    )
                THEN 0.0
            ELSE (cast(returns_count AS NCHAR(10)) / orders_count)
            END, 7) AS orderRatio,

                    )

    , @database_name = @database_name
    , @input_query = @input_query
    , @duration = @duration OUTPUT;
END;

GO
```

## Perform clustering in SQL Database

Now that you've created the stored procedure, execute the following script to perform clustering.

```sql
--Empty table of the results before running the stored procedure
TRUNCATE TABLE customer_return_clusters;

--Execute the clustering
--This will load the table customer_return_clusters with cluster mappings
EXECUTE [dbo].[generate_customer_return_clusters];
```

Verify that it works and that we actually have the list of customers and their cluster mappings.

```sql
--Select data from table customer_return_clusters
--to verify that the clustering data was loaded
SELECT TOP (5) *
FROM customer_return_clusters;
```

```result
cluster  customer  orderRatio  itemsRatio  monetaryRatio  frequency
1        29727     0           0           0              0
4        26429     0           0           0.041979       1
2        60053     0           0           0.065762       3
2        97643     0           0           0.037034       3
2        32549     0           0           0.031281       4
```

## Use the clustering information

Because you stored the clustering procedure in the database, it can perform clustering efficiently against customer data stored in the same database. You can execute the procedure whenever your customer data is updated and use the updated clustering information.

Suppose you want to send a promotional email to customers in cluster 3, the group that has more active return behavior (you can see how the four clusters were described in [part two](sql-database-tutorial-clustering-model-build.md#analyze-the-results)). The following code selects the email addresses of customers in cluster 3.

```sql
USE [tpcxbb_1gb]

SELECT customer.[c_email_address],
    customer.c_customer_sk
FROM dbo.customer
JOIN [dbo].[customer_return_clusters] AS r ON r.customer = customer.c_customer_sk
WHERE r.cluster = 3
```

You can change the **r.cluster** value to return email addresses for customers in other clusters.

## Clean up resources

When you're finished with this tutorial, you can delete the tpcxbb_1gb database from your Azure SQL Database server.

From the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **All resources** or **SQL databases**.
1. In the **Filter by name...** field, enter **tpcxbb_1gb**, and select your subscription.
1. Select your **tpcxbb_1gb** database.
1. On the **Overview** page, select **Delete**.

## Next steps
