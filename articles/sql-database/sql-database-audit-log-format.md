# SQL Database Audit Log Format

[Azure SQL Database auditing](sql-database-auditing.md) tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure storage account, or sends them to Event Hub or Log Analytics for downstream processing and analysis.

## Naming Conventions

### Blob Audit

Audit logs stored in Blob storage are stored in a container named `sqldbauditlogs` in the Azure Storage account. The directory hierarchy within the container is of the form `<ServerName>/<DatabaseName>/<AuditName>/<Date>/`. The Blob filename format is `<CreationTime>_<FileNumberInSession>.xel`, where `CreationTime` is in UTC `hh_mm_ss_ms` format, and `FileNumberInSession` is a running index in case session logs spans across multiple Blob files.

For example, for database `Database1` on `Server1` the following is a possible valid path:

    Server1/Database1/SqlDbAuditing_ServerAudit_NoRetention/2019-02-03/12_23_30_794_0.xel

### Event Hub

Audit events are written to the namespace and event hub that was defined during auditing configuration, and are captured in the body of [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) events and stored using JSON formatting with UTF-8 encoding. To read the audit logs, you can use [Avro Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-capture-overview#use-avro-tools) or similar tools that process this format.

### Log Analytics

Audit events are written to Log Analytics workspace defined during auditing configuration, to the `AzureDiagnostics` table with the category `SQLSecurityAuditEvents`. For additional useful information about Log Analytics search language and commands, see [Log Analytics search reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-log-search).
