# Azure SQL Database Advanced Threat Protection for single or pooled databases

[Advanced Threat Protection](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md) for single and pooled databases detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. Advanced Threat Protection can identify **Potential SQL injection**, **Access from unusual location or data center**, **Access from unfamiliar principal or potentially harmful application**, and **Brute force SQL credentials** - see more details in [Advanced Threat Protection alerts](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md#advanced-threat-protection-alerts).

You can receive notifications about the detected threats via [email notifications](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md#explore-anomalous-database-activities-upon-detection-of-a-suspicious-event) or [Azure portal](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md#explore-advanced-threat-protection-alerts-for-your-database-in-the-azure-portal)

[Advanced Threat Protection](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md) is part of the [advanced data security](sql-database-advanced-data-security.md) (ADS) offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Advanced Threat Protection can be accessed and managed via the central SQL ADS portal.

## Set up Advanced Threat Protection in the Azure portal

1. Launch the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to the configuration page of the Azure SQL Database server you want to protect. In the security settings, select **Advanced Data Security**.
3. On the **Advanced Data Security** configuration page:

   - Enable Advanced Data Security on the server.
