# Manage Transparent Data Encryption in a Managed Instance using your own key from Azure Key Vault

This Azure CLI script example configures Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with customer-managed key for Azure SQL Managed Instance, using a key from Azure Key Vault. This is often referred to as a Bring Your Own Key scenario for TDE. To learn more about the TDE with customer-managed key, see [TDE Bring Your Own Key to Azure SQL](../../azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-byok-overview.md).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

### Prerequisites

An existing Managed Instance, see [Use Azure CLI to create an Azure SQL Managed Instance](sql-database-create-configure-managed-instance-cli.md).

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
$subscription = "<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

### Run the script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption/setup-tde-byok-sqlmi.sh "Set up BYOK TDE for SQL Managed Instance")]

### Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resource
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| | |

| [az sql db](/cli/azure/sql/db) | Database commands. |
| [az sql failover-group](/cli/azure/sql/failover-group) | Failover group commands. |
