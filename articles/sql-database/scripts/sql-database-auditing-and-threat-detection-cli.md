# Use CLI to configure SQL Database auditing and Advanced Threat Protection

This Azure CLI script example configures SQL Database auditing and Advanced Threat Protection.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
$subscription = "<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

### Run the script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/database-auditing-and-threat-detection/database-auditing-and-threat-detection.sh "Configure auditing and threat detection")]

### Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resource
```
