# Use CLI to configure active geo-replication for a single database in Azure SQL Database

This Azure CLI script example configures active geo-replication for a single database and fails it over to a secondary replica of the database.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
$subscription = "<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

### Run the script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/setup-geodr-and-failover/setup-geodr-and-failover-single-database.sh "Set up active geo-replication for single database")]

### Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resource
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
