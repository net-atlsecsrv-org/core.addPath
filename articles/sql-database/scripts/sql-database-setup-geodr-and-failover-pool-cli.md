# Use CLI to configure active geo-replication for a pooled database in Azure SQL Database

This Azure CLI script example configures active geo-replication for a pooled database in Azure SQL Database and fails it over to the secondary replica of the database.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
$subscription = "<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

### Run the script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/setup-geodr-and-failover/setup-geodr-and-failover-elastic-pool.sh "Set up active geo-replication for elastic pool")]

### Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resource
az group delete --name $secondaryResource
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| [az sql elastic-pool](/cli/azure/sql/elastic-pool) | Elastic pool commands |
| [az sql db replica](/cli/azure/sql/db/replica) | Database replication commands. |
