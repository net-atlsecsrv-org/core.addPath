## Contribute to content improvement

The Azure SQL documentation set is open source. Working in the open provides several advantages:

- Open source repos plan in the open to get feedback on what docs are most needed.
- Open source repos review in the open to publish the most helpful content on our first release.
- Open source repos update in the open to make it easier to continuously improve the content.

To contribute to Azure SQL Database documentation content, see the [Microsoft Docs contributor guide overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/).
