# Choose among the vCore service tiers and migrate from DTU service tiers

The vCore-based purchasing model enables you to independently scale compute and storage resources, match on-premises performance, and optimize price. It also enables you to choose generation of hardware:

- Gen4 - Up to 24 logical CPUs based on Intel E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) 2.4 GHz processors, vCore = 1 PP (physical core), 7 GB per core, attached SSD
- Gen5 - Up to 80 logical CPUs based on Intel E5-2673 v4 (Broadwell) 2.3 GHz processors, vCore=1 LP (hyper-thread), 5.1 GB per core, fast eNVM SSD


Gen4 hardware offers substantially more memory per vCore. However, Gen5 hardware allows you to scale up compute resources much higher.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about DTU-based service tiers, see [DTU-based service tiers](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md). For information about differentiating DTU-based service tiers and vCore-based service tiers, see [Azure SQL Database purchasing models](sql-database-purchase-models.md).

## Service tier characteristics

The vCore model provides three service tiers General Purpose, Hyperscale and Business Critical. Service tiers are differentiated by a range of compute sizes, high availability design, fault isolation, types and size of storage and IO range. You must separately configure the required storage and retention period for backups. In the Azure portal, go to Server (not the database) > Managed Backups > Configure Policy > Point In Time Restore Configuration > 7 - 35 days.

The following table helps you understand the differences between the three tiers:

||**General Purpose**|**Business Critical**|**Hyperscale**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Best for|Most business workloads. Offers budget oriented balanced and scalable compute and storage options.|Business applications with high IO requirements. Offers highest resilience to failures using several isolated replicas.|Most business workloads with highly scalable storage and read-scale requirements|
|Compute|**Provisioned compute**:<br/>Gen4: 1 to 24 vCore<br/>Gen5: 2 to 80 vCore<br/>**Serverless compute**<br/>Gen5: 0.5 - 4 vCore|**Provisioned compute**:<br/>Gen4: 1 to 24 vCore<br/>Gen5: 2 to 80 vCore|**Provisioned compute**:<br/>Gen4: 1 to 24 vCore<br/>Gen5: 2 to 80 vCore|
|Memory|**Provisioned compute**:<br/>Gen4: 7 GB per vCore<br/>Gen5: 5.1 GB per vCore<br/>**Serverless compute**<br/>Gen5: 3 GB per vCore|**Provisioned compute**:<br/>Gen4: 7 GB per vCore<br/>Gen5: 5.1 GB per vCore |**Provisioned compute**:<br/>Gen4: 7 GB per vCore<br/>Gen5: 5.1 GB per vCore|

## Azure Hybrid Benefit

In the provisioned computer tier of the vCore-based purchasing model, you can exchange your existing licenses for discounted rates on SQL Database using the [Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/). This Azure benefit allows you to use your on-premises SQL Server licenses to save up to 30% on Azure SQL Database using your on-premises SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance.

With the Azure Hybrid Benefit, you can choose to only pay for the underlying Azure infrastructure using your existing SQL Server license for the SQL database engine itself (**BasePrice**) or pay for both the underlying infrastructure and the SQL Server license (**LicenseIncluded**).


You can choose or change your licensing model using the Azure portal or using one of the following APIs.

- To set or update the license type using PowerShell:

  - [New-AzSqlDatabase](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqldatabase):

## Migration from DTU model to vCore model

### Migration of a database

Migrating a database from the DTU-based purchasing model to the vCore-based purchasing model is similar to upgrading or downgrading between Standard and Premium databases in the DTU-based purchasing model.

### Migration of databases with geo-replication links

Migrating from the DTU-based model to the vCore-based model is similar to upgrading or downgrading the geo-replication relationships between Standard and Premium databases. It does not require terminating geo-replication but the user must observe the sequencing rules. When upgrading, you must upgrade the secondary database first, and then upgrade the primary. When downgrading, reverse the order: you must downgrade the primary database first, and then downgrade the secondary.

When using geo-replication between two elastic pools, it is recommended that you designate one pool as the primary and the other – as the secondary. In that case, migrating elastic pools should use the same guidance.  However, it is technically it is possible that an elastic pool contains both primary and secondary databases. In this case, to properly migrate you should treat the pool with the higher utilization as “primary” and follow the sequencing rules accordingly.  

The following table provides guidance for the specific migration scenarios:

|Current service tier|Target service tier|Migration type|User actions|
|---|---|---|---|
|Standard|General purpose|Lateral|Can migrate in any order, but need to ensure an appropriate vCore sizing*|
|Premium|Business Critical|Lateral|Can migrate in any order, but need to ensure appropriate vCore sizing*|
|Standard|Business Critical|Upgrade|Must migrate secondary first|
|Business Critical|Standard|Downgrade|Must migrate primary first|
|Premium|General purpose|Downgrade|Must migrate primary first|
|General purpose|Premium|Upgrade|Must migrate secondary first|
|Business Critical|General purpose|Downgrade|Must migrate primary first|
|General purpose|Business Critical|Upgrade|Must migrate secondary first|
||||

\* Each 100 DTU in Standard tier requires at least 1 vCore and each 125 DTU in Premium tier requires at least 1 vCore

### Migration of failover groups

Migration of failover groups with multiple databases requires individual migration of the primary and secondary databases. During that process, the same considerations and sequencing rules apply. After the databases are converted to the vCore-based model, the failover group will remain in effect with the same policy settings.

### Creation of a geo-replication secondary

You can only create a geo-secondary using the same service tier as the primary. For database with high log generation rate, it is advised that the secondary is created with the same compute size as the primary. If you are creating a geo-secondary in the elastic pool for a single primary database, it is advised that the pool has the `maxVCore` setting that matches the primary database compute size. If you are creating a geo-secondary in the elastic pool for a primary in another elastic pool, it is advised that the pools have the same `maxVCore` settings

### Using database copy to convert a DTU-based database to a vCore-based database

You can copy any database with a DTU-based compute size to a database with a vCore-based compute size without restrictions or special sequencing as long as the target compute size supports the maximum database size of the source database. The database copy creates a snapshot of data as of the starting time of the copy operation and does not perform data synchronization between the source and the target.
