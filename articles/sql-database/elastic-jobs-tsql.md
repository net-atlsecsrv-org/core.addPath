# Use Transact-SQL (T-SQL) to create and manage Elastic Database Jobs

This article provides many example scenarios to get started working with Elastic Jobs using T-SQL.

The examples use the [stored procedures](#job-stored-procedures) and [views](#job-views) available in the [*job database*](sql-database-job-automation-overview.md#job-database).

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is used to create, configure, execute, and manage jobs. Creating the Elastic Job agent is not supported in T-SQL, so you must first create an *Elastic Job agent* using the portal, or [PowerShell](elastic-jobs-powershell.md#create-the-elastic-job-agent).


## Create a credential for job execution

The credential is used to connect to your target databases for script execution. The credential needs appropriate permissions, on the databases specified by the target group, to successfully execute the script. When using a server and/or pool target group member, it is highly suggested to create a master credential for use to refresh the credential prior to expansion of the server and/or pool at time of job execution. The database scoped credential is created on the job agent database. The same credential must be used to *Create a Login* and *Create a User from Login to grant the Login Database Permissions* on the target databases.


```sql
--Connect to the job database specified when creating the job agent

-- Create a db master key if one does not already exist, using your own password.  
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD='<EnterStrongPasswordHere>';  
  
-- Create a database scoped credential.  
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL myjobcred WITH IDENTITY = 'jobcred',
    SECRET = '<EnterStrongPasswordHere>'; 
GO

-- Create a database scoped credential for the master database of server1.
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL mymastercred WITH IDENTITY = 'mastercred',
    SECRET = '<EnterStrongPasswordHere>'; 
GO
```

## Create a target group (servers)

The following example shows how to execute a job against all databases in a server.  
Connect to the [*job database*](sql-database-job-automation-overview.md#job-database) and run the following command:


```sql
-- Connect to the job database specified when creating the job agent

-- Add a target group containing server(s)
EXEC jobs.sp_add_target_group 'ServerGroup1'

-- Add a server target member
EXEC jobs.sp_add_target_group_member
'ServerGroup1',
@target_type = 'SqlServer',
@refresh_credential_name='mymastercred', --credential required to refresh the databases in server
@server_name='server1.database.windows.net'

--View the recently created target group and target group members
SELECT * FROM jobs.target_groups WHERE target_group_name='ServerGroup1';
SELECT * FROM jobs.target_group_members WHERE target_group_name='ServerGroup1';
```


## Exclude an individual database

The following example shows how to execute a job against all databases in a SQL Database server, except for the database named *MappingDB*.  
Connect to the [*job database*](sql-database-job-automation-overview.md#job-database) and run the following command:

```sql
--Connect to the job database specified when creating the job agent

-- Add a target group containing server(s)
EXEC [jobs].sp_add_target_group N'ServerGroup'
GO

-- Add a server target member
EXEC [jobs].sp_add_target_group_member
@target_group_name = N'ServerGroup',
@target_type = N'SqlServer',
@refresh_credential_name=N'mymastercred', --credential required to refresh the databases in server
@server_name=N'London.database.windows.net'
GO

-- Add a server target member
EXEC [jobs].sp_add_target_group_member
@target_group_name = N'ServerGroup',
@target_type = N'SqlServer',
@refresh_credential_name=N'mymastercred', --credential required to refresh the databases in server
@server_name='server2.database.windows.net'
GO

--Exclude a database target member from the server target group
EXEC [jobs].sp_add_target_group_member
@target_group_name = N'ServerGroup',
@membership_type = N'Exclude',
@target_type = N'SqlDatabase',
@server_name = N'server1.database.windows.net',
@database_name =N'MappingDB'
GO

--View the recently created target group and target group members
SELECT * FROM [jobs].target_groups WHERE target_group_name = N'ServerGroup';
SELECT * FROM [jobs].target_group_members WHERE target_group_name = N'ServerGroup';
```


## Create a target group (pools)

The following example shows how to target all the databases in one or more elastic pools.  
Connect to the [*job database*](sql-database-job-automation-overview.md#job-database) and run the following command:

```sql
--Connect to the job database specified when creating the job agent

-- Add a target group containing pool(s)
EXEC jobs.sp_add_target_group 'PoolGroup'

-- Add an elastic pool(s) target member
EXEC jobs.sp_add_target_group_member
'PoolGroup',
@target_type = 'SqlElasticPool',
@refresh_credential_name='mymastercred', --credential required to refresh the databases in server
@server_name='server1.database.windows.net',
@elastic_pool_name='ElasticPool-1'

-- View the recently created target group and target group members
SELECT * FROM jobs.target_groups WHERE target_group_name = N'PoolGroup';
SELECT * FROM jobs.target_group_members WHERE target_group_name = N'PoolGroup';
```


## Deploy new schema to many databases

The following example shows how to deploy new schema to all databases.  
Connect to the [*job database*](sql-database-job-automation-overview.md#job-database) and run the following command:


```sql
--Connect to the job database specified when creating the job agent

--Add job for create table
EXEC jobs.sp_add_job @job_name='CreateTableTest', @description='Create Table Test'

-- Add job step for create table
EXEC jobs.sp_add_jobstep @job_name='CreateTableTest',
@command=N'IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.tables 
           	WHERE object_id = object_id(''Test''))
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Test]([TestId] [int] NOT NULL);',
@credential_name='myjobcred',
@target_group_name='PoolGroup'
```


## Data collection using built-in parameters

In many data collection scenarios, it can be useful to include some of these scripting variables to help post-process the results of the job.

- $(job_name)
- $(job_id)
- $(job_version)
- $(step_id)
- $(step_name)
- $(job_execution_id)
- $(job_execution_create_time)
- $(target_group_name)

For example, to group all results from the same job execution together, use the *$(job_execution_id)* as shown in the following command:


```sql
@command= N' SELECT DB_NAME() DatabaseName, $(job_execution_id) AS job_execution_id, * FROM sys.dm_db_resource_stats WHERE end_time > DATEADD(mi, -20, GETDATE());'
```


## Monitor database performance

The following example creates a new job to collect performance data from multiple databases.

By default, the job agent will create the output table to store returned results. Therefore, the database principal associated with the output credential must at a minimum have the following permissions: `CREATE TABLE` on the database, `ALTER`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE` on the output table or its schema, and `SELECT` on the [sys.indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-indexes-transact-sql) catalog view.

If you want to manually create the table ahead of time then it needs to have the following properties:
1. Columns with the correct name and data types for the result set.
2. Additional column for internal_execution_id with the data type of uniqueidentifier.
3. A nonclustered index named `IX_<TableName>_Internal_Execution_ID` on the internal_execution_id column.
4. All permissions listed above except for `CREATE TABLE` permission on the database.

Connect to the [*job database*](sql-database-job-automation-overview.md#job-database) and run the following commands:

```sql
--Connect to the job database specified when creating the job agent

-- Add a job to collect perf results
EXEC jobs.sp_add_job @job_name ='ResultsJob', @description='Collection Performance data from all customers'

-- Add a job step w/ schedule to collect results
EXEC jobs.sp_add_jobstep
@job_name='ResultsJob',
@command= N' SELECT DB_NAME() DatabaseName, $(job_execution_id) AS job_execution_id, * FROM sys.dm_db_resource_stats WHERE end_time > DATEADD(mi, -20, GETDATE());',
@credential_name='myjobcred',
@target_group_name='PoolGroup',
@output_type='SqlDatabase',
