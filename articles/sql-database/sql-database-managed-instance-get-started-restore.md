# Quickstart: Restore a database to a Managed Instance

In this quickstart, you'll use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to restore a database (the Wide World Importers - Standard backup file) from Azure Blob storage into an Azure SQL Database [Managed Instance](sql-database-managed-instance.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on migration using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS), see [Managed Instance migration using DMS](../dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance.md).
> For more information on various migration methods, see [SQL Server instance migration to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](sql-database-managed-instance-migrate.md).

## Prerequisites

This quickstart:

- Uses resources from the [Create a Managed Instance](sql-database-managed-instance-get-started.md) quickstart.
- Requires your computer have the latest [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms) installed.
- Requires using SSMS to connect to your Managed Instance. See these quickstarts on how to connect:
  - [Connect to an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance from an Azure VM](sql-database-managed-instance-configure-vm.md)
  - [Configure a point-to-site connection to an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance from on-premises](sql-database-managed-instance-configure-p2s.md).
- Requires Azure Blob Storage Account (for example Standard_LRS V2) on **public IP** protected with **SAS credential** that has `rw` permission. [Private IPs for blob storage protected by firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security) and Azure Blob Storage service endpoints are currently not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on backing up and restoring a SQL Server database using Azure Blob storage and a [Shared Access Signature (SAS) key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1), see [SQL Server Backup to URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url?view=sql-server-2017).

## Restore the database from a backup file

In SSMS, follow these steps to restore the Wide World Importers database to your Managed Instance. The database backup file is stored in a pre-configured Azure Blob storage account.

1. Open SMSS and connect to your Managed Instance.
2. From the left-hand menu, right-click your Managed Instance and select **New Query** to open a new query window.
3. Run the following SQL script, which uses a pre-configured storage account and SAS key to [create a credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-credential-transact-sql) in your Managed Instance.

   ```sql
   CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://mitutorials.blob.core.windows.net/databases]
   WITH IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE'
   , SECRET = 'sv=2017-11-09&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2028-09-06T02:52:55Z&st=2018-09-04T18:52:55Z&spr=https&sig=WOTiM%2FS4GVF%2FEEs9DGQR9Im0W%2BwndxW2CQ7%2B5fHd7Is%3D'
   ```

    ![create credential](./media/sql-database-managed-instance-get-started-restore/credential.png)

4. To check your credential, run the following script, which uses a [container](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances/) URL to get a backup file list.

   ```sql
   RESTORE FILELISTONLY FROM URL =
      'https://mitutorials.blob.core.windows.net/databases/WideWorldImporters-Standard.bak'
   ```

    ![file list](./media/sql-database-managed-instance-get-started-restore/file-list.png)

5. Run the following script to restore the Wide World Importers database.

   ```sql
   RESTORE DATABASE [Wide World Importers] FROM URL =
     'https://mitutorials.blob.core.windows.net/databases/WideWorldImporters-Standard.bak'
   ```

    ![restore](./media/sql-database-managed-instance-get-started-restore/restore.png)

6. Run the following script to track your restore's status.

   ```sql
   SELECT session_id as SPID, command, a.text AS Query, start_time, percent_complete
      , dateadd(second,estimated_completion_time/1000, getdate()) as estimated_completion_time
   FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
   CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) a
   WHERE r.command in ('BACKUP DATABASE','RESTORE DATABASE')
   ```

7. When the restore completes, view it in Object Explorer.
