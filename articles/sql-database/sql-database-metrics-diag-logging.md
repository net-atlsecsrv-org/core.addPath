# Azure SQL Database metrics and diagnostics logging

In this topic, you will learn how to configure logging of diagnostics telemetry for Azure SQL Database through the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure Monitor REST API, and Azure Resource Manager template. These diagnostics can be used to gauge resource utilization and query execution statistics.

Single databases, pooled databases in elastic pools, and instance databases in a managed instance can stream metrics and diagnostics logs for easier performance monitoring. You can configure a database to transmit resource usage, workers and sessions, and connectivity to one of the following Azure resources:

- **Azure SQL Analytics**: to get intelligent monitoring of your Azure SQL databases that includes performance reports, alerts, and mitigation recommendations.
- **Azure Event Hubs**: to integrate SQL Database telemetry with your custom monitoring solutions or hot pipelines.
- **Azure Storage**: to archive vast amounts of telemetry for a fraction of the price.

    ![Architecture](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/architecture.png)

For more information about the metrics and log categories supported by the various Azure services, see:

- [Overview of metrics in Microsoft Azure](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics.md)
- [Overview of Azure diagnostics logs](../azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-overview.md)

This article provides guidance to help you enable diagnostics telemetry for Azure SQL databases, elastic pools, and managed instances. It also can help you understand how to configure Azure SQL Analytics as a monitoring tool for viewing database diagnostics telemetry.

## Enable logging of diagnostics telemetry

You can enable and manage metrics and diagnostics telemetry logging by using one of the following methods:

- Azure portal
- PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- Azure Monitor REST API
- Azure Resource Manager template

When you enable metrics and diagnostics logging, you need to specify the Azure resource destination for collecting the diagnostics telemetry. Available options include:

- Azure SQL Analytics
- Azure Event Hubs
- Azure Storage

You can provision a new Azure resource or select an existing resource. After you choose a resource by using the **Diagnostic settings** option, specify which data to collect.

## Supported diagnostic logging for Azure SQL databases, and instance databases

Enable the metrics and diagnostics logging on SQL databases - they're not enabled by default.

You can set up Azure SQL databases, and instance databases to collect the following diagnostics telemetry:

| Monitoring telemetry for databases | Single database and pooled database support | Instance database support |
| :------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| [Basic metrics](#basic-metrics): Contains DTU/CPU percentage, DTU/CPU limit, physical data read percentage, log write percentage, Successful/Failed/Blocked by firewall connections, sessions percentage, workers percentage, storage, storage percentage, and XTP storage percentage. | Yes | No |
| [Instance and App Advanced](#advanced-metrics):  Contains tempdb system database data and log file size and tempdb percent log file used. | Yes | No |
| [QueryStoreRuntimeStatistics](#query-store-runtime-statistics): Contains information about the query runtime statistics such as CPU usage and query duration statistics. | Yes | Yes |
| [QueryStoreWaitStatistics](#query-store-wait-statistics): Contains information about the query wait statistics (what your queries waited on) such are CPU, LOG, and LOCKING. | Yes | Yes |
| [Errors](#errors-dataset): Contains information about SQL errors on a database. | Yes | Yes |
| [DatabaseWaitStatistics](#database-wait-statistics-dataset): Contains information about how much time a database spent waiting on different wait types. | Yes | No |
| [Timeouts](#time-outs-dataset): Contains information about timeouts on a database. | Yes | No |
| [Blocks](#blockings-dataset): Contains information about blocking events on a database. | Yes | No |
| [Deadlocks](#deadlocks-dataset): Contains information about deadlock events on a database. | Yes | No |
| [AutomaticTuning](#automatic-tuning-dataset): Contains information about automatic tuning recommendations for a database. | Yes | No |
| [SQLInsights](#intelligent-insights-dataset): Contains Intelligent Insights into performance for a database. To learn more, see [Intelligent Insights](sql-database-intelligent-insights.md). | Yes | Yes |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Elastic pools and managed instances have their own separate diagnostics telemetry from databases they contain. This is important to note as diagnostics telemetry is configured separately for each of these resources, as documented below.

> [!NOTE]
> Security Audit and SQLSecurityAuditEvents logs can't be enabled from the database diagnostics settings (although showing on the screen). To enable audit log streaming, see [Set up auditing for your database](sql-database-auditing.md#subheading-2), and [auditing logs in Azure Monitor logs and Azure Event Hubs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-SQL-Database/SQL-Audit-logs-in-Azure-Log-Analytics-and-Azure-Event-Hubs/ba-p/386242).

## Azure portal

You can use the **Diagnostics settings** menu for each single, pooled, or instance database in Azure portal to configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry. In addition, diagnostic telemetry can also be configured separately for database containers: elastic pools and managed instances. You can set the following destinations to stream the diagnostics telemetry: Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Monitor logs.

### Configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for elastic pools

   ![Elastic pool icon](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/icon-elastic-pool-text.png)

You can set up an elastic pool resource to collect the following diagnostics telemetry:

| Resource | Monitoring telemetry |
| :------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Elastic pool** | [Basic metrics](sql-database-metrics-diag-logging.md#basic-metrics) contains eDTU/CPU percentage, eDTU/CPU limit, physical data read percentage, log write percentage, sessions percentage, workers percentage, storage, storage percentage, storage limit, and XTP storage percentage. |

To configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for elastic pools and databases in elastic pools, you will need to separately configure **both** of the following:

- Enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for an elastic pool, **and**
- Enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for each database in elastic pool

This is because elastic pool is a database container with its own telemetry being separate from an individual database telemetry.

To enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for an elastic pool resource, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **elastic pool** resource in Azure portal.
1. Select **Diagnostics settings**.
1. Select **Turn on diagnostics** if no previous settings exist, or select **Edit setting** to edit a previous setting.

   ![Enable diagnostics for elastic pools](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-container-elasticpool-enable.png)

1. Enter a setting name for your own reference.
1. Select a destination resource for the streaming diagnostics data: **Archive to storage account**, **Stream to an event hub**, or **Send to Log Analytics**.
1. For log analytics, select **Configure** and create a new workspace by selecting **+Create New Workspace**, or select an existing workspace.
1. Select the check box for elastic pool diagnostics telemetry: **Basic** metrics.
   ![Configure diagnostics for elastic pools](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-container-elasticpool-selection.png)

1. Select **Save**.
1. In addition, configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for each database within the elastic pool you want to monitor by following steps described in the next section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to configuring diagnostics telemetry for an elastic pool, you also need to configure diagnostics telemetry for each database in elastic pool, as documented below.

### Configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for single database, or database in elastic pool

   ![SQL Database icon](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/icon-sql-database-text.png)

To enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for single or pooled databases, follow these steps:

1. Go to Azure **SQL database** resource.
1. Select **Diagnostics settings**.
1. Select **Turn on diagnostics** if no previous settings exist, or select **Edit setting** to edit a previous setting.
   - You can create up to three parallel connections to stream diagnostics telemetry.
   - Select **Add diagnostic setting** to configure parallel streaming of diagnostics data to multiple resources.

   ![Enable diagnostics for single, pooled, or instance databases](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-database-sql-enable.png)

1. Enter a setting name for your own reference.
1. Select a destination resource for the streaming diagnostics data: **Archive to storage account**, **Stream to an event hub**, or **Send to Log Analytics**.
1. For the standard, event-based monitoring experience, select the following check boxes for database diagnostics log telemetry: **SQLInsights**, **AutomaticTuning**, **QueryStoreRuntimeStatistics**, **QueryStoreWaitStatistics**, **Errors**, **DatabaseWaitStatistics**, **Timeouts**, **Blocks**, and **Deadlocks**.
1. For an advanced, one-minute-based monitoring experience, select the check box for **Basic** metrics.
   ![Configure diagnostics for single, pooled, or instance databases](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-database-sql-selection.png)
1. Select **Save**.
1. Repeat these steps for each database you want to monitor.

> [!NOTE]
> Security Audit and SQLSecurityAuditEvents logs can't be enabled from the database diagnostics settings (although shown on the screen). To enable audit log streaming, see [Set up auditing for your database](sql-database-auditing.md#subheading-2), and [auditing logs in Azure Monitor logs and Azure Event Hubs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-SQL-Database/SQL-Audit-logs-in-Azure-Log-Analytics-and-Azure-Event-Hubs/ba-p/386242).

> [!TIP]
> Repeat these steps for each Azure SQL Database you want to monitor.

### Configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for managed instances

   ![Managed instance icon](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/icon-managed-instance-text.png)

You can set up a managed instance resource to collect the following diagnostics telemetry:

| Resource | Monitoring telemetry |
| :------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Managed instance** | [ResourceUsageStats](#resource-usage-stats-for-managed-instance) contains vCores count, average CPU percentage, IO requests, bytes read/written, reserved storage space, and used storage space. |

To configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for managed instance and instance databases, you will need to separately configure **both** of the following:

- Enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for managed instance, **and**
- Enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for each instance database

This is because managed instance is a database container with its own telemetry, separate from an individual instance database telemetry.

To enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for a managed instance resource, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **managed instance** resource in Azure portal.
1. Select **Diagnostics settings**.
1. Select **Turn on diagnostics** if no previous settings exist, or select **Edit setting** to edit a previous setting.

   ![Enable diagnostics for managed instance](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-container-mi-enable.png)

1. Enter a setting name for your own reference.
1. Select a destination resource for the streaming diagnostics data: **Archive to storage account**, **Stream to an event hub**, or **Send to Log Analytics**.
1. For log analytics, select **Configure** and create a new workspace by selecting **+Create New Workspace**, or use an existing workspace.
1. Select the check box for instance diagnostics telemetry: **ResourceUsageStats**.

   ![Configure diagnostics for managed instance](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-container-mi-selection.png)

1. Select **Save**.
1. In addition, configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for each instance database within the managed instance you want to monitor by following the steps described in the next section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to configuring diagnostics telemetry for a managed instance, you also need to configure diagnostics telemetry for each instance database, as documented below.

### Configure streaming of diagnostics telemetry for instance databases

   ![Instance database in managed instance icon](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/icon-mi-database-text.png)

To enable streaming of diagnostics telemetry for instance databases, follow these steps:

1. Go to **instance database** resource within managed instance.
1. Select **Diagnostics settings**.
1. Select **Turn on diagnostics** if no previous settings exist, or select **Edit setting** to edit a previous setting.
   - You can create up to three (3) parallel connections to stream diagnostics telemetry.
   - Select **+Add diagnostic setting** to configure parallel streaming of diagnostics data to multiple resources.

   ![Enable diagnostics for instance databases](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-database-mi-enable.png)

1. Enter a setting name for your own reference.
1. Select a destination resource for the streaming diagnostics data: **Archive to storage account**, **Stream to an event hub**, or **Send to Log Analytics**.
1. Select the check boxes for database diagnostics telemetry: **SQLInsights**, **QueryStoreRuntimeStatistics**, **QueryStoreWaitStatistics** and **Errors**.
   ![Configure diagnostics for instance databases](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/diagnostics-settings-database-mi-selection.png)
1. Select **Save**.
1. Repeat these steps for each instance database you want to monitor.

> [!TIP]
> Repeat these steps for each instance database you want to monitor.

### PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PowerShell Azure Resource Manager module is still supported by Azure SQL Database, but all future development is for the Az.Sql module. For these cmdlets, see [AzureRM.Sql](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureRM.Sql/). The arguments for the commands in the Az module and in the AzureRm modules are substantially identical.

You can enable metrics and diagnostics logging by using PowerShell.

- To enable storage of diagnostics logs in a storage account, use this command:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId [your resource id] -StorageAccountId [your storage account id] -Enabled $true
   ```

   The storage account ID is the resource ID for the destination storage account.

- To enable streaming of diagnostics logs to an event hub, use this command:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId [your resource id] -ServiceBusRuleId [your service bus rule id] -Enabled $true
   ```

   The Azure Service Bus rule ID is a string with this format:

   ```powershell
   {service bus resource ID}/authorizationrules/{key name}
   ```

- To enable sending diagnostics logs to a Log Analytics workspace, use this command:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId [your resource id] -WorkspaceId [resource id of the log analytics workspace] -Enabled $true
   ```

- You can obtain the resource ID of your Log Analytics workspace by using the following command:

   ```powershell
   (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace).ResourceId
   ```

You can combine these parameters to enable multiple output options.

### To configure multiple Azure resources

To support multiple subscriptions, use the PowerShell script from [Enable Azure resource metrics logging using PowerShell](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msoms/20../../enable-azure-resource-metrics-logging-using-powershell/).

Provide the workspace resource ID \<$WSID\> as a parameter when executing the script `Enable-AzureRMDiagnostics.ps1` to send diagnostic data from multiple resources to the workspace.

- To get the workspace ID \<$WSID\> of the destination for your diagnostic data, use the following script:

    ```powershell
    $WSID = "/subscriptions/<subID>/resourcegroups/<RG_NAME>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/<WS_NAME>"
    .\Enable-AzureRMDiagnostics.ps1 -WSID $WSID
    ```

   Replace \<subID\> with the subscription ID, \<RG_NAME\> with the resource group name, and \<WS_NAME\> with the workspace name.

### Azure CLI

You can enable metrics and diagnostics logging by using the Azure CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> Scripts to enable diagnostics logging are supported for Azure CLI v1.0. Please note that CLI v2.0 is unsupported at this time.

- To enable the storage of diagnostics logs in a storage account, use this command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   azure insights diagnostic set --resourceId <resourceId> --storageId <storageAccountId> --enabled true
   ```

   The storage account ID is the resource ID for the destination storage account.

- To enable the streaming of diagnostics logs to an event hub, use this command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   azure insights diagnostic set --resourceId <resourceId> --serviceBusRuleId <serviceBusRuleId> --enabled true
   ```

   The Service Bus rule ID is a string with this format:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   {service bus resource ID}/authorizationrules/{key name}
   ```

- To enable the sending of diagnostics logs to a Log Analytics workspace, use this command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   azure insights diagnostic set --resourceId <resourceId> --workspaceId <resource id of the log analytics workspace> --enabled true
   ```

You can combine these parameters to enable multiple output options.

### REST API

Read about how to [change diagnostics settings by using the Azure Monitor REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/diagnosticsettings).

### Resource Manager template

Read about how to [enable diagnostics settings at resource creation by using a Resource Manager template](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings-template.md).

## Stream into Azure SQL Analytics

Azure SQL Analytics is a cloud solution that monitors the performance of Azure SQL databases, elastic pools, and managed instances at scale and across multiple subscriptions. It can help you collect and visualize Azure SQL Database performance metrics, and it has built-in intelligence for performance troubleshooting.

![Azure SQL Analytics Overview](../azure-monitor/insights/media/azure-sql/azure-sql-sol-overview.png)

SQL Database metrics and diagnostics logs can be streamed into Azure SQL Analytics by using the built-in **Send to Log Analytics** option in the diagnostics settings tab in the portal. You can also enable log analytics by using a diagnostics setting via PowerShell cmdlets, the Azure CLI, or the Azure Monitor REST API.

### Installation overview

You can monitor a SQL Database fleet with Azure SQL Analytics. Perform the following  steps:

1. Create an Azure SQL Analytics solution from the Azure Marketplace.
2. Create a monitoring workspace in the solution.
3. Configure databases to stream diagnostics telemetry into the workspace.

If you're using elastic pools or managed instances, you also need to configure diagnostics telemetry streaming from these resources.

### Create Azure SQL Analytics resource

1. Search for Azure SQL Analytics in Azure Marketplace and select it.

   ![Search for Azure SQL Analytics in portal](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/sql-analytics-in-marketplace.png)

2. Select **Create** on the solution's overview screen.

3. Fill in the Azure SQL Analytics form with the additional information that is required: workspace name, subscription, resource group, location, and pricing tier.

   ![Configure Azure SQL Analytics in portal](./media/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging/sql-analytics-configuration-blade.png)

4. Select **OK** to confirm, and then select **Create**.

### Configure databases to record metrics and diagnostics logs

The easiest way to configure where databases record metrics is by using the Azure portal. As previously described, go to your SQL Database resource in the Azure portal and select **Diagnostics settings**.

If you're using elastic pools or managed instances, you also need to configure diagnostics settings in these resources to enable the diagnostics telemetry to stream into the workspace.

### Use the SQL Analytics solution for monitoring and alerting

You can use SQL Analytics as a hierarchical dashboard to view your SQL Database resources.

- To learn how to use the SQL Analytics solution, see [Monitor SQL Database by using the SQL Analytics solution](../log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-sql.md).
- To learn how to setup alerts for SQL Database and managed instance based on SQL Analytics, see [Creating alerts for SQL Database and managed instance](../azure-monitor/insights/azure-sql.md#analyze-data-and-create-alerts).

## Stream into Event Hubs

You can stream SQL Database metrics and diagnostics logs into Event Hubs by using the built-in **Stream to an event hub** option in the Azure portal. You also can enable the Service Bus rule ID by using a diagnostics setting via PowerShell cmdlets, the Azure CLI, or the Azure Monitor REST API.

### What to do with metrics and diagnostics logs in Event Hubs

After the selected data is streamed into Event Hubs, you're one step closer to enabling advanced monitoring scenarios. Event Hubs acts as the front door for an event pipeline. After data is collected into an event hub, it can be transformed and stored by using a real-time analytics provider or a storage adapter. Event Hubs decouples the production of a stream of events from the consumption of those events. In this way, event consumers can access the events on their own schedule. For more information on Event Hubs, see:

- [What are Azure Event Hubs?](../event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md)
- [Get started with Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted.md)

You can use streamed metrics in Event Hubs to:

- **View service health by streaming hot-path data to Power BI**

   By using Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, and Power BI, you can easily transform your metrics and diagnostics data into near real-time insights on your Azure services. For an overview of how to set up an event hub, process data with Stream Analytics, and use Power BI as an output, see [Stream Analytics and Power BI](../stream-analytics/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard.md).

- **Stream logs to third-party logging and telemetry streams**

   By using Event Hubs streaming, you can get your metrics and diagnostics logs into various third-party monitoring and log analytics solutions.

- **Build a custom telemetry and logging platform**

   Do you already have a custom-built telemetry platform or are considering building one? The highly scalable publish-subscribe nature of Event Hubs allows you to flexibly ingest diagnostics logs. See [Dan Rosanova's guide to using Event Hubs in a global-scale telemetry platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/build-2015-designing-and-sizing-a-global-scale-telemetry-platform-on-azure-event-Hubs/).

## Stream into Storage

You can store SQL Database metrics and diagnostics logs in Azure Storage by using the built-in **Archive to a storage account** option in the Azure portal. You  can also enable Storage by using a diagnostics setting via PowerShell cmdlets, the Azure CLI, or the Azure Monitor REST API.

### Schema of metrics and diagnostics logs in the storage account

After you set up metrics and diagnostics logs collection, a storage container is created in the storage account you selected when the first rows of data are available. The structure of the blobs is:

```powershell
insights-{metrics|logs}-{category name}/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscription ID}/ RESOURCEGROUPS/{resource group name}/PROVIDERS/Microsoft.SQL/servers/{resource_server}/ databases/{database_name}/y={four-digit numeric year}/m={two-digit numeric month}/d={two-digit numeric day}/h={two-digit 24-hour clock hour}/m=00/PT1H.json
```

Or, more simply:

```powershell
insights-{metrics|logs}-{category name}/resourceId=/{resource Id}/y={four-digit numeric year}/m={two-digit numeric month}/d={two-digit numeric day}/h={two-digit 24-hour clock hour}/m=00/PT1H.json
```

For example, a blob name for Basic metrics might be:

```powershell
insights-metrics-minute/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/s1id1234-5679-0123-4567-890123456789/RESOURCEGROUPS/TESTRESOURCEGROUP/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.SQL/ servers/Server1/databases/database1/y=2016/m=08/d=22/h=18/m=00/PT1H.json
```

A blob name for storing data from an elastic pool looks like:

```powershell
insights-{metrics|logs}-{category name}/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscription ID}/ RESOURCEGROUPS/{resource group name}/PROVIDERS/Microsoft.SQL/servers/{resource_server}/ elasticPools/{elastic_pool_name}/y={four-digit numeric year}/m={two-digit numeric month}/d={two-digit numeric day}/h={two-digit 24-hour clock hour}/m=00/PT1H.json
```

## Data retention policy and pricing

If you select Event Hubs or a Storage account, you can specify a retention policy. This policy deletes data that is older than a selected time period. If you specify Log Analytics, the retention policy depends on the selected pricing tier. In this case, the provided free units of data ingestion can enable free monitoring of several databases each month. Any consumption of diagnostics telemetry in excess of the free units might incur costs. Be aware that active databases with heavier workloads ingest more data than idle databases. For more information, see [Log analytics pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

If you are using Azure SQL Analytics, you can monitor your data ingestion consumption in the solution by selecting **OMS Workspace** on the navigation menu of Azure SQL Analytics, and then selecting **Usage** and **Estimated Costs**.

## Metrics and logs available

Monitoring telemetry available for Azure SQL Database, elastic pools and managed instance is documented below. Collected monitoring telemetry inside SQL Analytics can be used for your own custom analysis and application development using [Azure Monitor log queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/query-language/get-started-queries) language.
