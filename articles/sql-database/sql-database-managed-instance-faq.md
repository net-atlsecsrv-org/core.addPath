# SQL Database managed instance frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article contains many of the most common questions about [SQL Database managed instance](sql-database-managed-instance.md).

## Supported features

**Where can I find a list of features supported on managed instance?**

For a list of supported features in managed instance, see [Azure SQL Database versus SQL Server](sql-database-features.md).

For differences in syntax and behavior between Azure SQL Database managed instance and on-premises SQL Server, see [T-SQL differences from SQL Server](sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information.md).


## Tech spec & resource limits
 
**Where can I find technical characteristics and resource limits for managed instance?**

For available hardware generation characteristics, see [technical differences in hardware generations](sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits.md#hardware-generation-characteristics).
For available service tiers and their characteristics, see [technical differences between service tiers](sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits.md#service-tier-characteristics).

## Known issues & bugs

**Where can I find known issues and bugs?**

For bugs and known issues see [known issues](sql-database-release-notes.md#known-issues).

## New features

**Where can I find latest features and the features in public preview?**

For new and preview features see [release notes](sql-database-release-notes.md?tabs=managed-instance).

## Deployment times 

**How much time takes to create or update instance, or to restore a database?**

Expected time to create new managed instance or change service tier (vCores, storage) depend on several factors. Take a look at the [Management operations](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance#managed-instance-management-operations) 

## Naming convention

**Can a managed instance have the same name as on-premises SQL Server?**

Changing managed instance name is not supported.

Managed instance default DNS zone *.database.windows.net* could be changed. 

To use another DNS zone instead of the default, for example, *.contoso.com*: 
- Use CliConfig to define an alias. The tool is just a registry settings wrapper, so it could be done using group policy or script as well.
- Use *CNAME* with *TrustServerCertificate=true* option.

## Move DB from MI 

**How can I move database from managed instance back to SQL Server or Azure SQL Database?**

You can [export database to BACPAC](sql-database-export.md) and then [import the BACPAC file]( sql-database-import.md). This is a recommended approach if your database is smaller than 100 GB.

Transactional replication can be used if all tables in the database have primary keys.

Native `COPY_ONLY` backups taken from managed instance cannot be restored to SQL Server because managed instance has a higher database version compared to SQL Server.

## Migrate instance DB

**How can I migrate my instance database to a single Azure SQL Database?**

One option is to [export the database to a BACPAC](sql-database-export.md) and then [import the BACPAC file](sql-database-import.md). 

This is the recommended approach if your database is smaller than 100 GB. Transactional replication can be used if all tables in the database have primary keys.

## Switch hardware generation 

**Can I switch my managed instance hardware generation between Gen 4 and Gen 5 online?**

Automated online switching between hardware generations is possible if both hardware generations are available in the region where your managed instance is provisioned. In this case, you can check [vCore model overview page](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md) explaining how to switch between hardware generations.

This is a long-running operation as a new managed instance will be provisioned in the background and databases automatically transferred between the old and new instance with a quick failover at the end of the process. 

**What if both hardware generations are not supported in the same region?**

If both hardware generations are not supported in the same region, changing the hardware generation is possible but must be done manually. This requires you to provision a new instance in the region where the wanted hardware generation is available, and manually back up and restore data between the old and new instance.

**What if there are no enough IP addresses for performing update operation?**

In case there is no enough IP addresses in the subnet where your managed instance is provisioned, you will have to create new subnet and new managed instance inside it. We also suggest that new subnet is created with more IP addresses alocated so future update operations will avoid similar situation (for propper subnet size, check [how to determine size of vnet subnet](sql-database-managed-instance-determine-size-vnet-subnet.md). After new instance is provisioned, you can manually back up and restore data between the old and new instance or perform cross-instance [point-in-time restore](sql-database-managed-instance-point-in-time-restore.md?tabs=azure-powershell). 


## Tune performance

**How do I tune performance of my managed instance?**

General Purpose managed instance uses remote storage due to which size of data and log files matters to performance. For more information, see [Impact of log file size on General Purpose Managed Instance performance](https://medium.com/azure-sqldb-managed-instance/impact-of-log-file-size-on-general-purpose-managed-instance-performance-21ad170c823e).

If your workload consists of lots of small transactions, consider switching the connection type from proxy to redirect mode.

## Maximum storage size

**What is the maximum storage size for managed instance?**

Storage size for managed instance depends on the selected service tier (General Purpose or Business Critical). For storage limitations of these service tiers, see [Service tier characteristic](sql-database-service-tiers-general-purpose-business-critical.md).

## Back up storage cost 

**Is the backup storage deducted from my managed instance storage?**

No, backup storage is not deducted from your managed instance storage space. The backup storage is independent from the instance storage space and it is not limited in size. Backup storage is limited by the time period to retain the backup of your instance databases, configurable from 7 to 35 days. For details, see [Automated backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups).

## Track billing

**Is there a way to track my billing cost for my managed instance?**

You can do so using the [Azure Cost Management solution](/azure/cost-management/). Navigate to **Subscriptions** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Cost Analysis**. 

Use the **Accumulated costs** option and then filter by the **Resource type** as `microsoft.sql/managedinstances`. 
  
## Inbound NSG rules

**How can I set inbound NSG rules on management ports?**

Managed instance control plane maintains NSG rules that protect management ports.

Here is what management ports are used for:

Ports 9000 and 9003 are used by Service Fabric infrastructure. Service Fabric primary role is to keep the virtual cluster healthy and keep goal state in terms of number of component replicas.

Ports 1438, 1440, and 1452 are used by node agent. Node agent is an application that runs inside the cluster and is used by the control plane to execute management commands.

In addition to NSG rules the built-in firewall protects the instance on the network layer. On the application layer communication is protected with the certificates.
  
For more information and how to verify the built-in firewall, see [Azure SQL Database managed instance built-in firewall](sql-database-managed-instance-management-endpoint-verify-built-in-firewall.md).


## Mitigate data exfiltration risks  

**How can I mitigate data exfiltration risks?**

To mitigate any data exfiltration risks, customers are recommended to apply a set of security settings and controls:

- Turn on [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql) on all databases.
- Turn off Common Language Runtime (CLR). This is recommended on-premises as well.
- Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication only.
- Access instance with low privileged DBA account.
- Configure JiT jumpbox access for sysadmin account.
- Turn on [SQL auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-database-engine), and integrate it with alerting mechanisms.
- Turn on the [Threat Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection) from the [Advanced Data Security (ADS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security) suite.


## Cost saving use cases

**Where can I find use cases and resulting cost savings with managed instance?**

Managed instance case studies:

- [Komatsu](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/komatsu-australia-manufacturing-azure)
- [KMD](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-ca/story/kmd-professional-services-azure-sql-database)
- [PowerDETAILS](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/powerdetails-partner-professional-services-azure-sql-database-managed-instance)
- [Allscripts](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/allscripts-partner-professional-services-azure)
  
To get a better understanding of the benefits, costs, and risks associated with deploying Azure SQL Database managed instance, there's also a Forrester’s study: [Total Economic Impact of MI](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/forrester-tei-sql-database-managed-instance).


## DNS Refresh 

**Can I do DNS refresh?**

Currently, we don't provide a feature to refresh DNS server configuration for managed instance.

DNS configuration is eventually refreshed:

- When DHCP lease expires.
- On platform upgrade.

As a workaround, downgrade the managed instance to 4 vCore and upgrade it again afterward. This has a side effect of refreshing the DNS configuration.


## IP address

**Can I connect to managed instance using IP address?**

Connecting to managed instance using IP address is not supported. Managed instance host name maps to load balancer in front of managed instance virtual cluster. As one virtual cluster could host multiple managed instances connection could not be routed to proper managed instance without specifying its name.

For more information on managed instance virtual cluster architecture, see [Virtual cluster connectivity architecture](sql-database-managed-instance-connectivity-architecture.md#virtual-cluster-connectivity-architecture).

**Can a managed instance have a static IP address?**

In rare but necessary situations, we might need to do an online migration of a managed instance to a new virtual cluster. If needed, this migration is because of changes in our technology stack aimed to improve security and reliability of the service. Migrating to a new virtual cluster results in changing the IP address that is mapped to the managed instance host name. The managed instance service doesn't claim static IP address support and reserves the right to change it without notice as a part of regular maintenance cycles.

For this reason, we strongly discourage relying on immutability of the IP address as it could cause unnecessary downtime.

## Change time zone

**Can I change the time zone for an existing managed instance?**

Time zone configuration can be set when a managed instance is provisioned for the first time. Changing the time zone of the existing managed instance isn't supported. For details, see [time zone limitations](sql-database-managed-instance-timezone.md#limitations).

Workarounds include creating a new managed instance with the proper time zone and then either perform a manual backup and restore, or what we recommend, perform a [cross-instance point-in-time restore](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlserverstorageengine/2018/06/07/cross-instance-point-in-time-restore-in-azure-sql-database-managed-instance/).


## Resolve performance issues

**How do I resolve performance issues with my managed instance?**

For a performance comparison between managed instance and SQL Server, a good starting point is [Best practices for performance comparison between Azure SQL managed instance and SQL Server](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-SQL-Database/The-best-practices-for-performance-comparison-between-Azure-SQL/ba-p/683210) article.

Data loading is often slower on managed instance than in SQL Server due to mandatory full recovery model and [limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits#service-tier-characteristics) on transaction log write throughput. Sometimes, this can be worked around by loading transient data into tempdb instead of user database, or using clustered columnstore, or memory-optimized tables.


## Restore encrypted backup

**Can I restore my encrypted database to managed instance?**

Yes, you don't need to decrypt your database to be able to restore it to managed instance. You do need to provide a certificate/key used as an encryption key protector in the source system to the managed instance to be able to read data from the encrypted backup file. There are two possible ways to do it:

- *Upload certificate-protector to the managed instance*. It can be done using PowerShell only. The [sample script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-migrate-tde-certificate) describes the whole process.
- *Upload asymmetric key-protector to Azure Key Vault (AKV) and point managed instance to it*. This approach resembles bring-your-own-key (BYOK) TDE use case that also uses AKV integration to store the encryption key. If you don't want to use the key as an encryption key protector, and just want to make the key available for managed instance to restore encrypted database(s), follow instructions for [setting up BYOK TDE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql#manage-transparent-data-encryption), and don’t check the checkbox *Make the selected key the default TDE protector*.

Once you make the encryption protector available to managed instance, you can proceed with the standard database restore procedure.

## Migrate from single DB 

**How can I migrate from Azure SQL Database single or elastic pool to managed instance?**

Managed instance offers the same performance levels per compute and storage size as other deployment options of Azure SQL Database. If you want to consolidate data on a single instance, or you simply need a feature supported exclusively in managed instance, you can migrate your data by using export/import (BACPAC) functionality.
