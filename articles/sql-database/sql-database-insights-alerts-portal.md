# Create alerts for Azure SQL Database and Data Warehouse using Azure portal

## Overview
This article shows you how to set up Azure SQL Database and Data Warehouse alerts using the Azure portal. Alerts can send you an email or call a web hook when some metric (for example database size or CPU usage) reaches the threshold. This article also provides best practices for setting alert periods.    

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is not yet available in Managed Instance. As an alternative, you can use SQL Agent to send email alerts for some metrics based on [Dynamic Management Views](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/system-dynamic-management-views).

You can receive an alert based on monitoring metrics for, or events on, your Azure services.

* **Metric values** - The alert triggers when the value of a specified metric crosses a threshold you assign in either direction. That is, it triggers both when the condition is first met and then afterwards when that condition is no longer being met.    
* **Activity log events** - An alert can trigger on *every* event, or, only when a certain number of events occur.

You can configure an alert to do the following when it triggers:

* send email notifications to the service administrator and co-administrators
* send email to additional emails that you specify.
* call a webhook

You can configure and get information about alert rules using

* [Azure portal](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-alerts-portal.md)
* [PowerShell](../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-classic-portal.md)
* [command-line interface (CLI)](../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-classic-portal.md)
* [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn931945.aspx)

## Create an alert rule on a metric with the Azure portal
1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), locate the resource you are interested in monitoring and select it.
2. Select **Alerts (Classic)** under the MONITORING section. The text and icon may vary slightly for different resources.  
   
     ![Monitoring](media/sql-database-insights-alerts-portal/AlertsClassicButton.JPG)
  
   - **SQL DW ONLY**: Click the **DWU Usage** graph. Select **View classic alerts**

3. Select the **Add metric alert (classic)** button and fill in the fields.
   
    ![Add Alert](media/sql-database-insights-alerts-portal/AddDBAlertPageClassic.JPG)
4. **Name** your alert rule, and choose a **Description**, which also shows in notification emails.
5. Select the **Metric** you want to monitor, then choose a **Condition** and **Threshold** value for the metric. Also choose the **Period** of time that the metric rule must be satisfied before the alert triggers. So for example, if you use the period "PT5M" and your alert looks for CPU above 80%, the alert triggers when the **average** CPU has been above 80% for 5 minutes. Once the first trigger occurs, it again triggers when the average CPU is below 80% over 5 minutes. The CPU measurement occurs every 1 minute. Consult the table below for supported time windows and the aggregation type that each alert uses- not all alerts use the average value.   
6. Check **Email owners...** if you want administrators and co-administrators to be emailed when the alert fires.
7. If you want additional emails to receive a notification when the alert fires, add them in the **Additional Administrator email(s)** field. Separate multiple emails with semi-colons - *email\@contoso.com;email2\@contoso.com*
8. Put in a valid URI in the **Webhook** field if you want it called when the alert fires.
9. Select **OK** when done to create the alert.   

Within a few minutes, the alert is active and triggers as previously described.

## Managing your alerts
Once you have created an alert, you can select it and:

* View a graph showing the metric threshold and the actual values from the previous day.
* Edit or delete it.
* **Disable** or **Enable** it if you want to temporarily stop or resume receiving notifications for that alert.
