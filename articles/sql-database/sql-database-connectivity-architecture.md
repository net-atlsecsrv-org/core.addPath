# Azure SQL Connectivity Architecture
> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Azure SQL server, and to both SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse databases that are created on the Azure SQL server. For simplicity, SQL Database is used when referring to both SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article does *not* apply to **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance**. Refer to [Connectivity architecture for a managed instance](sql-database-managed-instance-connectivity-architecture.md).

This article explains architecture of various components that direct network traffic to the Azure SQL Database or SQL Data Warehouse. It also explains different connection policies and how it impacts clients connecting from within Azure and clients connecting from outside of Azure. 

## Connectivity architecture

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the Azure SQL Database connectivity architecture.

![architecture overview](./media/sql-database-connectivity-architecture/connectivity-overview.png)

The following steps describe how a connection is established to an Azure SQL database:

- Clients connect to the gateway, that has a public IP address and listens on port 1433.
- The gateway, depending on the effective connection policy, redirects or proxies the traffic to the right database cluster.
- Inside the database cluster traffic is forwarded to the appropriate Azure SQL database.

## Connection policy

Azure SQL Database supports the following three options for the connection policy setting of a SQL Database server:

- **Redirect (recommended):** Clients establish connections directly to the node hosting the database, leading to reduced latency and improved throughput. For connections to use this mode, clients need to:
   - Allow outbound communication from the client to all Azure SQL IP addresses in the region on ports in the range of 11000 11999. Use the Service Tags for SQL to make this easier to manage.  
   - Allow outbound communication from the client to Azure SQL Database gateway IP addresses on port 1433.

- **Proxy:** In this mode, all connections are proxied via the Azure SQL Database gateways,leading to increased latency and reduced throughput. For connections to use this mode, clients need to allow outbound communication from the client to Azure SQL Database gateway IP addresses on port 1433.

- **Default:** This is the connection policy in effect on all servers after creation unless you explicitly alter the connection policy to either `Proxy` or `Redirect`. The default policy is`Redirect` for all client connections originating inside of Azure (for example, from an Azure Virtual Machine) and `Proxy`for all client connections originating outside (for example, connections from your local workstation).

 We highly recommend the `Redirect` connection policy over the `Proxy` connection policy for the lowest latency and highest throughput.However, you will need to meet the additional requirements for allowing network traffic as outlined above. If the client is an Azure Virtual Machine you can accomplish this using Network Security Groups (NSG) with [service tags](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags). If the client is connecting from a workstation on-premises then you may need to work with your network admin to allow network traffic through your corporate firewall.

## Connectivity from within Azure

If you are connecting from within Azure your connections have a connection policy of `Redirect` by default. A policy of `Redirect` means that after the TCP session is established to the Azure SQL database, the client session is then redirected to the right database cluster with a change to the destination virtual IP from that of the Azure SQL Database gateway to that of the cluster. Thereafter, all subsequent packets flow directly to the cluster, bypassing the Azure SQL Database gateway. The following diagram illustrates this traffic flow.

## Connectivity from outside of Azure

If you are connecting from outside Azure, your connections have a connection policy of `Proxy` by default. A policy of `Proxy` means that the TCP session is established via the Azure SQL Database gateway and all subsequent packets flow via the gateway. The following diagram illustrates this traffic flow.

> Additionally open TCP ports 1434 and 14000-14999 to enable [Connecting with DAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/diagnostic-connection-for-database-administrators?view=sql-server-2017#connecting-with-dac)


## Azure SQL Database gateway IP addresses

The table below lists the IP Addresses of Gateways by region. To connect to an Azure SQL Database, you need to allow network traffic to & from **all** Gateways for the region.

Details of how traffic shall be migrated to new Gateways in specific regions are in the following article: [Azure SQL Database traffic migration to newer Gateways](sql-database-gateway-migration.md)
