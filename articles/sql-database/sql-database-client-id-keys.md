# Get the required values for authenticating an application to access SQL Database from code

To create and manage SQL Database from code you must register your app in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) domain  in the subscription where your Azure resources have been created.

## Create a service principal to access resources from an application

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PowerShell Azure Resource Manager module is still supported by Azure SQL Database, but all future development is for the Az.Sql module. For these cmdlets, see [AzureRM.Sql](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureRM.Sql/). The arguments for the commands in the Az module and in the AzureRm modules are substantially identical.

The following PowerShell script creates the Active Directory (AD) application and the service principal that we need to authenticate our C# app. The script outputs values we need for the preceding C# sample. For detailed information, see [Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal to access resources](../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md).

    # Sign in to Azure.
    Connect-AzAccount

    # If you have multiple subscriptions, uncomment and set to the subscription you want to work with.
    #$subscriptionId = "{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}"
    #Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

    # Provide these values for your new AAD app.
    # $appName is the display name for your app, must be unique in your directory.
    # $uri does not need to be a real uri.
    # $secret is a password you create.

    $appName = "{app-name}"
    $uri = "http://{app-name}"
    $secret = "{app-password}"

    # Create an AAD app
    $azureAdApplication = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName $appName -HomePage $Uri -IdentifierUris $Uri -Password $secret

    # Create a Service Principal for the app
    $svcprincipal = New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId

    # To avoid a PrincipalNotFound error, I pause here for 15 seconds.
    Start-Sleep -s 15

    # If you still get a PrincipalNotFound error, then rerun the following until successful. 
    $roleassignment = New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Contributor -ServicePrincipalName $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid


    # Output the values we need for our C# application to successfully authenticate

    Write-Output "Copy these values into the C# sample app"

    Write-Output "_subscriptionId:" (Get-AzContext).Subscription.SubscriptionId
    Write-Output "_tenantId:" (Get-AzContext).Tenant.TenantId
    Write-Output "_applicationId:" $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid
    Write-Output "_applicationSecret:" $secret
