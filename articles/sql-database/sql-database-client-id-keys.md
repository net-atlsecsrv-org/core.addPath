# Get the required values for authenticating an application to access SQL Database from code

To create and manage SQL Database from code you must register your app in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) domain  in the subscription where your Azure resources have been created.

## Create a service principal to access resources from an application

The following examples create the Active Directory (AD) application and the service principal that we need to authenticate our C# app. The script outputs values we need for the preceding C# sample. For detailed information, see [Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal to access resources](../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md).

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PowerShell Azure Resource Manager (RM) module is still supported by Azure SQL Database, but all future development is for the Az.Sql module. The AzureRM module will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020.  The arguments for the commands in the Az module and in the AzureRm modules are substantially identical. For more about their compatibility, see [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).

```powershell
# sign in to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# for multiple subscriptions, uncomment and set to the subscription you want to work with
#$subscriptionId = "{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}"
#Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

$appName = "{app-name}" # display name for your app, must be unique in your directory
$uri = "http://{app-name}" # does not need to be a real uri
$secret = "{app-password}"

# create an AAD app
$azureAdApplication = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName $appName -HomePage $Uri -IdentifierUris $Uri -Password $secret

# create a Service Principal for the app
$svcprincipal = New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId

Start-Sleep -s 15 # to avoid a PrincipalNotFound error, pause here for 15 seconds

# if you still get a PrincipalNotFound error, then rerun the following until successful.
$roleassignment = New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Contributor -ServicePrincipalName $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid

# output the values we need for our C# application to successfully authenticate
Write-Output "Copy these values into the C# sample app"

Write-Output "_subscriptionId:" (Get-AzContext).Subscription.SubscriptionId
Write-Output "_tenantId:" (Get-AzContext).Tenant.TenantId
Write-Output "_applicationId:" $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid
Write-Output "_applicationSecret:" $secret
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azure-cli
# sign in to Azure
az login

# for multiple subscriptions, uncomment and set to the subscription you want to work with
#$subscriptionId = "{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}"
#az account set --subscription $subscriptionId

$appName = "{app-name}" # display name for your app, must be unique in your directory
$uri = "http://{app-name}" # does not need to be a real uri
$secret = "{app-password}"

# create an AAD app
$azureAdApplication = az ad app create --display-name $appName --homepage $Uri --identifier-uris $Uri --password $secret

# create a Service Principal for the app
$svcprincipal = az ad sp create --id $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId

Start-Sleep -s 15 # to avoid a PrincipalNotFound error, pause for 15 seconds

# if you still get a PrincipalNotFound error, then rerun the following until successful.
$roleassignment = az role assignment create --role "Contributor" --assignee $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid

# output the values we need for our C# application to successfully authenticate
Write-Output "Copy these values into the C# sample app"

Write-Output "_subscriptionId:" (az account show --query "id")
Write-Output "_tenantId:" (az account show --query "tenantId")
Write-Output "_applicationId:" $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid
Write-Output "_applicationSecret:" $secret
```
