# Automated backups

SQL Database automatically creates the database backups that are kept between 7 and 35 days, and uses Azure [read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) to ensure that they are preserved even if the data center is unavailable. These backups are created automatically. Database backups are an essential part of any business continuity and disaster recovery strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion. If your security rules require that your backups are available for an extended period of time (up to 10 years), you can configure a [long-term retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md) on Singleton databases and Elastic pools.

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## What is a SQL Database backup

SQL Database uses SQL Server technology to create [full backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/full-database-backups-sql-server) every week, [differential backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/differential-backups-sql-server) every 12 hours, and [transaction log backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/transaction-log-backups-sql-server) every 5-10 minutes. The backups are stored in [RA-GRS storage blobs](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) that are replicated to a [paired data center](../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md) for protection against a data center outage. When you restore a database, the service figures out which full, differential, and transaction log backups need to be restored.

You can use these backups to:

- **Restore an existing database to a point-in-time in the past** within the retention period using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. In Single database and Elastic pools, this operation will create a new database in the same server as the original database. In Managed Instance, this operation can create a copy of the database or same or different Managed Instance under the same subscription.
  - **[Change Backup Retention Period](#how-to-change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period)** between 7 to 35 days to configure your backup policy.
  - **Change long-term retention policy up to 10 years** on Single Database and Elastic Pools using [the Azure portal](sql-database-long-term-backup-retention-configure.md#configure-long-term-retention-policies) or [Azure PowerShell](sql-database-long-term-backup-retention-configure.md#use-powershell-to-manage-long-term-backups).
- **Restore a deleted database to the time it was deleted** or anytime within the retention period. The deleted database can only be restored in the same logical server or Managed Instance where the original database was created.
- **Restore a database to another geographical region**. Geo-restore allows you to recover from a geographic disaster when you cannot access your server and database. It creates a new database in any existing server anywhere in the world.
- **Restore a database from a specific long-term backup** on Single Database or Elastic Pool if the database has been configured with a long-term retention policy (LTR). LTR allows you to restore an old version of the database using [the Azure portal](sql-database-long-term-backup-retention-configure.md#view-backups-and-restore-from-a-backup-using-azure-portal) or [Azure PowerShell](sql-database-long-term-backup-retention-configure.md#use-powershell-to-manage-long-term-backups) to satisfy a compliance request or to run an old version of the application. For more information, see [Long-term retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md).
- To perform a restore, see [restore database from backups](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In Azure storage, the term *replication* refers to copying files from one location to another. SQL's *database replication* refers to keeping multiple secondary databases synchronized with a primary database.

## How long are backups kept

All Azure SQL databases (single, pooled, and managed instance databases) have a default backup retention period of  **seven** days. You can [change backup retention period up to 35 days](#how-to-change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period).

If you delete a database, SQL Database will keep the backups in the same way it would for an online database. For example, if you delete a Basic database that has a retention period of seven days, a backup that is four days old is saved for three more days.

If you need to keep the backups for longer than the maximum retention period, you can modify the backup properties to add one or more long-term retention periods to your database. For more information, see [Long-term retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete the Azure SQL server that hosts SQL databases, all elastic pools and databases that belong to the server are also deleted and cannot be recovered. You cannot restore a deleted server. But if you configured long-term retention, the backups for the databases with LTR will not be deleted and these databases can be restored.

## How often do backups happen

### Backups for point-in-time restore

SQL Database supports self-service for point-in-time restore (PITR) by automatically creating full backup, differential backups, and transaction log backups. Full database backups are created weekly, differential database backups are generally created every 12 hours, and transaction log backups are generally created every 5 - 10 minutes, with the frequency based on the compute size and amount of database activity. The first full backup is scheduled immediately after a database is created. It usually completes within 30 minutes, but it can take longer when the database is of a significant size. For example, the initial backup can take longer on a restored database or a database copy. After the first full backup, all further backups are scheduled automatically and managed silently in the background. The exact timing of all database backups is determined by the SQL Database service as it balances the overall system workload. You cannot change or disable the backup jobs. 

The PITR backups are geo-redundant and protected by [Azure Storage cross-regional replication](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)

For more information, see [Point-in-time restore](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md#point-in-time-restore)

### Backups for long-term retention

Single and pooled databases offer the option of configuring long-term retention (LTR) of full backups for up to 10 years in Azure Blob storage. If LTR policy is enabled, the weekly full backups are automatically copied to a different RA-GRS storage container. To meet different compliance requirement, you can select different retention periods for weekly, monthly and/or yearly backups. The storage consumption depends on the selected frequency of backups and the retention period(s). You can use the [LTR pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=sql-database) to estimate the cost of LTR storage.

Like PITR, the LTR backups are geo-redundant and protected by [Azure Storage cross-regional replication](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage).

For more information, see [Long-term backup retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md).

## Storage costs
For single databases, a minimum backup storage amount equal to 100% of database size is provided at no extra charge. For elastic pools, a minimum backup storage amount equal to 100% of the allocated data storage for the pool is provided at no extra charge. Additional consumption of backup storage will be charged in GB/month. This additional consumption will depend on the workload and size of the individual databases.

For more information about storage prices, see the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/single/) page. 

## Are backups encrypted

If your database is encrypted with TDE, the backups are automatically encrypted at rest, including LTR backups. When TDE is enabled for an Azure SQL database, backups are also encrypted. All new Azure SQL databases are configured with TDE enabled by default. For more information on TDE, see  [Transparent Data Encryption with Azure SQL Database](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql).

## How does Microsoft ensure backup integrity

On an ongoing basis, the Azure SQL Database engineering team automatically tests the restore of automated database backups of databases placed in Logical servers and Elastic pools (this is not available in Managed Instance). Upon point-in-time restore, databases also receive integrity checks using DBCC CHECKDB.

Managed Instance takes automatic initial backup with `CHECKSUM` of the databases restored using native `RESTORE` command or Data Migration Service once the migration is completed.

Any issues found during the integrity check will result in an alert to the engineering team. For more information about data integrity in Azure SQL Database, see [Data Integrity in Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/data-integrity-in-azure-sql-database/).

## How do automated backups impact compliance

When you migrate your database from a DTU-based service tier with the default PITR retention of 35 days, to a vCore-based service tier, the PITR retention is preserved to ensure that your application's data recovery policy is not compromised. If the default retention doesn't meet your compliance requirements, you can change the PITR retention period using PowerShell or REST API. For more information, see [Change Backup Retention Period](#how-to-change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period).

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## How to change the PITR backup retention period

You can change the default PITR backup retention period using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the REST API. The supported values are: 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35 days. The following examples illustrate how to change PITR retention to 28 days.

> [!WARNING]
> If you reduce the current retention period, all existing backups older than the new retention period are no longer available. If you increase the current retention period, SQL Database will keep the existing backups until the longer retention period is reached.

> [!NOTE]
> These APIs will only impact the PITR retention period. If you configured LTR for your database, it will not be impacted. For more information about how to change the LTR retention period(s), see [Long-term retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md).

### Change PITR backup retention period using Azure portal

To change the PITR backup retention period using the Azure portal, navigate to the server object whose retention period you wish to change within the portal and then select the appropriate option based on which server object you're modifying.

#### Single Azure SQL Database

Change of PITR backup retention for single Azure SQL Databases is performed at the server level. Change made at the server level applies to databases on that server. To change PITR for Azure SQL Database server from Azure portal, navigate to the server overview blade, click on Manage Backups on the navigation menu, and then click on Configure retention at the navigation bar.

#### Managed instance database

Change of PITR backup retention for SQL Database managed instance is performed at an individual database level. To change PITR backup retention for an instance database from Azure portal, navigate to the individual database overview blade, and then click on Configure backup retention at the navigation bar.

### Change PITR backup retention period using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PowerShell Azure Resource Manager module is still supported by Azure SQL Database, but all future development is for the Az.Sql module. For these cmdlets, see [AzureRM.Sql](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureRM.Sql/). The arguments for the commands in the Az module and in the AzureRm modules are substantially identical.

```powershell
Set-AzSqlDatabaseBackupShortTermRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName resourceGroup -ServerName testserver -DatabaseName testDatabase -RetentionDays 28
```
