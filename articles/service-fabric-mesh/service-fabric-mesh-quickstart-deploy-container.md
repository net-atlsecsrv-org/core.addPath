# Quickstart: Deploy Hello World to Service Fabric Mesh

[Service Fabric Mesh](service-fabric-mesh-overview.md) makes it easy to create and manage microservices applications in Azure, without having to provision virtual machines. In this quickstart, you will create a Hello World application in Azure and expose it to the internet. This operation is completed in a single command. Within just a couple minutes, you'll see this view in your browser:

![Hello world app in the browser][sfm-app-browser]

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/include-preview-note.md)]

If you don't already have an Azure account, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Set up Service Fabric Mesh CLI 
You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to complete this quickstart. Install Azure Service Fabric Mesh CLI extension module by following these [instructions](service-fabric-mesh-howto-setup-cli.md).

## Sign in to Azure
Sign in to Azure and set your subscription.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
az account set --subscription "<subscriptionID>"
```

## Create resource group
Create a resource group to deploy the application to. You can use an existing resource group and skip this step. 

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus 
```

## Deploy the application

>[!NOTE]
> Effective November 2, 2020, [download rate limits apply](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) to anonymous and authenticated requests to Docker Hub from Docker Free plan accounts and are enforced by IP address. 
> 
> These templates makes use of public images from Docker Hub. Please note that you may be rate limited. For more details, see [Authenticate with Docker Hub](../container-registry/buffer-gate-public-content.md#authenticate-with-docker-hub).

Create your application in the resource group using the `az mesh deployment create` command.  Run the following:

```azurecli-interactive
az mesh deployment create --resource-group myResourceGroup --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-mesh/master/templates/helloworld/helloworld.linux.json --parameters "{'location': {'value': 'eastus'}}" 
```

The preceding command deploys a Linux application using [linux.json template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-mesh/master/templates/helloworld/helloworld.linux.json). If you want to deploy a Windows application, use [windows.json template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-mesh/master/templates/helloworld/helloworld.windows.json). Windows container images are larger than Linux container images and may take more time to deploy.

This command will produce a JSON snippet that is shown below. Under the ```outputs``` section of the JSON output, copy the ```publicIPAddress``` property.

```json
"outputs": {
    "publicIPAddress": {
    "type": "String",
    "value": "40.83.78.216"
    }
}
```

This information comes from the ```outputs``` section in the ARM template. As shown below, this section references the Gateway resource to fetch the public IP address. 

```json
  "outputs": {
    "publicIPAddress": {
      "value": "[reference('helloWorldGateway').ipAddress]",
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
```

## Open the application
Once the application successfully deploys, copy the public IP address for the service endpoint from the CLI output. Open the IP address in a web browser. A web page with the Azure Service Fabric Mesh logo displays.

## Check the application details
You can check the application's status using the `az mesh app show` command. This command provides useful information that you can follow up on.

The application name for this quickstart is `helloWorldApp`, to gather the details on the application execute the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az mesh app show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name helloWorldApp
```

## See the application logs

Examine the logs for the deployed application using the `az mesh code-package-log get` command:

```azurecli-interactive
az mesh code-package-log get --resource-group myResourceGroup --application-name helloWorldApp --service-name helloWorldService --replica-name 0 --code-package-name helloWorldCode
```

## Clean up resources

When you are ready to delete the application, run the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command to remove the resource group and the application and network resources it contains.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
