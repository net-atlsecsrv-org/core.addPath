# Service Fabric Mesh application secrets
Service Fabric Mesh supports Secrets as Azure resources. A Service Fabric Mesh secret can be any sensitive text information such as storage connection strings, passwords, or other values that should be stored and transmitted securely.

## Mesh secrets resources
A Mesh application Secret consists of:
* A **Secrets** resource, which is a container that stores text secrets. Secrets contained within the **Secrets** resource are stored and transmitted securely.
* One or more **Secrets/Values** resources that are stored in the **Secrets** resource container. Each **Secrets/Values** resource is distinguished by a version number.
