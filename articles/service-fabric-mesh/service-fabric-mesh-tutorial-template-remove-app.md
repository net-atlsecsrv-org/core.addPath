## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* Open [Azure Cloud Shell](service-fabric-mesh-howto-setup-cli.md), or [install the Azure CLI and Service Fabric Mesh CLI locally](service-fabric-mesh-howto-setup-cli.md#install-the-azure-service-fabric-mesh-cli).

## Delete the resource group and all the resources

When no longer needed, delete all of the resources you created. Previously, you [created an new resource group](service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-template-deploy-app.md#create-a-container-registry) to host the Azure Container Registry instance and the Service Fabric Mesh application resources.  You can delete this resource group, which will delete all of the associated resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```

## Individually delete the resources
You can also delete the ACR instance, Service Fabric Mesh application, and network resources individually.

To delete the ACR instance:

```azurecli
az acr delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerRegistry
```

To delete the Service Fabric Mesh application:

```azurecli
az mesh app delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name todolistapp
```

To delete the network:
```azurecli
az mesh network delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name todolistappNetwork
```
