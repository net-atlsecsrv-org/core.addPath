## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Make sure that the subscription you use for Data Box service is one of the following types:
    - Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA). Read more about [EA subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).
    - Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). Learn more about [Azure CSP program](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-solution-provider/overview/azure-csp-overview).
    - Microsoft Azure Sponsorship. Learn more about [Azure sponsorship program](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). 

- Ensure that you have owner or contributor access to the subscription to create a Data Box order.
- Review the [safety guidelines for your Data Box](data-box-safety.md).
- You have a host computer that has the data that you want to copy over to Data Box. Your host computer must
    - Run a [Supported operating system](data-box-system-requirements.md).
    - Be connected to high-speed network. We strongly recommend that you have at least one 10 GbE connection. If a 10 GbE connection isn't available, a 1 GbE data link can be used but the copy speeds are impacted. 
- You must have access to a flat surface where you can place the Data Box. If you want to place the device on a standard rack shelf, you need a 7U slot in your datacenter rack. You can place the device flat or upright in the rack.
- You have procured the following cables to connect your Data Box to the host computer.
    - Two 10 GbE SFP+ Twinax copper cables (use with DATA 1, DATA 2 network interfaces)
    - One RJ-45 CAT 6 network cable (use with MGMT network interface)
    - One RJ-45 CAT 6A OR one RJ-45 CAT 6 network cable (use with DATA 3 network interface configured as 10 Gbps or 1 Gbps respectively)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you've:

1. Completed the [Tutorial: Order Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-ordered.md).
2. Received your Data Box and the order status in the portal is **Delivered**. 
3. Reviewed the [Data Box safety guidelines](data-box-safety.md).
4. Received one grounded power cord to use with your 100-TB storage device.
5. Access to a host computer that has the data that you want to copy over to Data Box. Your host computer must
    - Run a [Supported operating system](data-box-system-requirements.md).
    - Be connected to high-speed network. We strongly recommend that you have at least one 10-GbE connection. If a 10-GbE connection isn't available, a 1-GbE data link can be used but the copy speeds are impacted. 
6. Access to a flat surface to place the Data Box. To place the device flat or upright in a standard rack shelf, you need a 7U slot in your rack.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

## Order

This step takes roughly 5 minutes.

1. Create a new Azure Data Box resource in Azure portal.
2. Select an existing subscription enabled for this service and choose transfer type as **Import**. Provide the **Source country** where the data resides and **Azure destination region** for the data transfer.
3. Select **Data Box**. The maximum usable capacity is 80 TB and you can create multiple orders for larger data sizes.
4. Enter the order details and shipping information. If the service is available in your region, provide notification email addresses, review the summary, and then create the order.

Once the order is created, the device is prepared for shipment.



## Cable 

This step takes roughly 10 minutes.

When you receive the Data Box, do the following steps to cable, connect to and turn on the device. This step takes about 10 minutes.

1. If there is any evidence that the device is tampered with or damaged, do not proceed. Contact Microsoft Support to ship you a replacement device.
2. Before you cable your device, ensure that you have the following cables:
    
    - (Included) grounded power cord rated at 10 A or greater with an IEC60320 C-13 connector at one end to connect to the device.
    - One RJ-45 CAT 6 network cable (use with MGMT network interface)
    - Two 10 GbE SFP+ Twinax copper cables (use with 10 Gbps DATA 1, DATA 2 network interfaces)
    - One RJ-45 CAT 6A OR one RJ-45 CAT 6 network cable (use with DATA 3 network interface configured as 10 Gbps or 1 Gbps respectively)

3. Remove and place the device on a flat surface. 
	
4. Cable the device as shown below.  

    ![Data Box device backplane cabled](media/data-box-deploy-set-up/data-box-cabled-dhcp.png)  

    1. Connect the power cable to the device.
    2. Use the RJ-45 CAT 6 network cable to connect your host computer to the management port (MGMT) on the device. 
    3. Use the SFP+ Twinax copper cable to connect at least one 10 Gbps (preferred over 1 Gbps) network interface, DATA 1 or DATA 2 for data. 
    4. Turn on the device. The power button is on the front panel of the device.


## Connect

This step takes about 5-7 minutes to complete.

1. To get the device password, go to **General > Device details** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Assign a static IP address of 192.168.100.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0 to the Ethernet adapter on the computer you are using to connect to Data Box. Access the local web UI of the device at `https://192.168.100.10`. The connection could take up to 5 minutes after you turned on the device. 
3. Sign in using the password from the Azure portal. You see an error indicating a problem with the website’s security certificate. Follow the browser-specific instructions to proceed to the web page.
4. By default, the network settings for the 10 Gbps data interface (or 1 Gbps) are configured as DHCP. If needed, you can configure this interface as static and provide an IP address. 

## Copy data

The time to complete this operation depends upon your data size and network speed.
 
1. If using a Windows host, use an SMB compatible file copy tool such as Robocopy. For NFS host, use `cp` command or `rsync` to copy the data. Connect the tool to your device and begin copying data to the shares. For more information on how to use Robocopy to copy data, go to [Robocopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee851678.aspx).
2. Connect to the shares using the path:`\\<IP address of your device>\ShareName`. To get the share access credentials, go to the **Connect & copy** page in the local web UI of the Data Box.
3. Make sure that the share and folder names, and the data follow guidelines described in the [Azure Storage and Data Box service limits](data-box-limits.md).

## Ship to Azure 

This operation takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.

1. Go to **Prepare to ship** page in the local web UI and start the ship preparation. 
2. Turn off the device from the local web UI. Remove the cables from the device. 
3. The return shipping label should be visible on the E-ink display. If the E-ink display is not displaying the label, download shipping label from the Azure portal and insert in the clear sleeve attached to the device.
4. Lock the case and ship to Microsoft. 

## Verify data

The time to complete this operation depends upon your data size.

1. When the Data Box device is connected to the Azure datacenter network, the data upload to Azure starts automatically. 
2. Azure Data Box service notifies you that the data copy is complete via the Azure portal. 

    1. Check error logs for any failures and take appropriate actions.
    2. Verify that your data is in the storage account(s) before you delete it from the source.

## Clean up resources

This step takes 2-3 minutes to complete.

- You can cancel the Data Box order in the Azure portal before the order is processed. Once the order is processed, the order cannot be canceled. The order progresses until it reaches the completed stage. To cancel the order, go to **Overview** and click **Cancel** from the command bar.

- You can delete the order once the status shows as **Completed** or **Canceled** in the Azure portal. To delete the order, go to **Overview** and click **Delete** from the command bar.
