# Troubleshoot issues related to Azure Data Box and Azure Data Box Heavy

This article details information on how to troubleshoot issues you may see when using the Azure Data Box or Azure Data Box Heavy for import orders. The article includes the list of possible errors seen when data is copied to the Data Box or when data is uploaded from Data Box for an import order.

The information in this article does not apply to export orders created for Data Box.

## Error classes

The errors in Data Box and Data Box Heavy are summarized as follows:

| Error category*        | Description        | Recommended action    |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Container or share names | The container or share names do not follow the Azure naming rules.  |Download the error lists. <br> Rename the containers or shares. [Learn more](#container-or-share-name-errors).  |
| Container or share size limit | The total data in containers or shares exceeds the Azure limit.   |Download the error lists. <br> Reduce the overall data in the container or share. [Learn more](#container-or-share-size-limit-errors).|

| Non-critical blob or file errors  | The blob or file names do not follow the Azure naming rules or the file type is not supported. | These blob or files may not be copied or the names may be changed. [Learn how to fix these errors](#non-critical-blob-or-file-errors). |

\* The first four error categories are critical errors and must be fixed before you can proceed to prepare to ship.


## Container or share name errors

These are errors related to container and share names.

### ERROR_CONTAINER_OR_SHARE_NAME_LENGTH     

**Error description:** The container or share name must be between 3 and 63 characters. 

**Suggested resolution:** The folder under the Data Box or Data Box Heavy share(SMB/NFS) to which you have copied data becomes an Azure container in your storage account. 

- On the **Connect and copy** page of the device local web UI, download, and review the error files to identify the folder names with issues.
- Change the folder name under the Data Box or Data Box Heavy share to make sure that:

    - The name has between 3 and 63 characters.
    - The names can only have letters, numbers, and hyphens.
    - The names can’t start or end with hyphens.
    - The names can’t have consecutive hyphens.
    - Examples of valid names: `my-folder-1`, `my-really-extra-long-folder-111`
    - Examples of names that aren’t valid: `my-folder_1`, `my`, `--myfolder`, `myfolder--`, `myfolder!`

    For more information, see the Azure naming conventions for [container names](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names) and [share names](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-shares--directories--files--and-metadata#share-names).


### ERROR_CONTAINER_OR_SHARE_NAME_ALPHA_NUMERIC_DASH

**Error description:** The container or share name must consist of only letters, numbers, or hyphens.

**Suggested resolution:** The folder under the Data Box or Data Box Heavy share(SMB/NFS) to which you have copied data becomes an Azure container in your storage account. 

- On the **Connect and copy** page of the device local web UI, download, and review the error files to identify the folder names with issues.
- Change the folder name under the Data Box or Data Box Heavy share to make sure that:

## Container or share size limit errors

These are errors related to data exceeding the size of data allowed in a container or a share.

### ERROR_CONTAINER_OR_SHARE_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED

**Error description:** Azure file share limits a share to 5 TiB of data, and large file shares are not enabled on the storage account. This limit was exceeded for some shares.

**Suggested resolution:** On the **Connect and copy** page of the local web UI, download, and review the error files.

- Identify the folders that have this issue from the error logs and make sure that the files in that folder are under 5 TiB.
- The 5 TiB limit does not apply to a storage account that allows large file shares. However, you must have large file shares configured when you place your order. 
  - Contact [Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md) and request a new shipping label.
  - [Enable large file shares on the storage account.](../storage/files/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share.md#enable-large-files-shares-on-an-existing-account)
  - [Expand the file shares in the storage account](../storage/files/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share.md#expand-existing-file-shares) and set the quota to 100 TiB.
  
  
## Object or file size limit errors

These are errors related to data exceeding the maximum size of object or the file that is allowed in Azure. 

### ERROR_BLOB_OR_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT

**Error description:** The file size exceeds the maximum file size for upload.

**Suggested resolution:** The blob or the file sizes exceed the maximum limit allowed for upload.

- On the **Connect and copy** page of the local web UI, download, and review the error files.
- Make sure that the blob and file sizes do not exceed the Azure object size limits.

## Data or file type errors

These are errors related to unsupported file type or data type found in the container or share. 

### ERROR_BLOB_OR_FILE_SIZE_ALIGNMENT

**Error description:** The blob or file is incorrectly aligned.

**Suggested resolution:** The page blob share on Data Box or Data Box Heavy only supports files that are 512 bytes aligned (for example, VHD/VHDX). Any data copied to the page blob share is uploaded to Azure as page blobs.

Remove any non-VHD/VHDX data from the page blob share. You can use shares for block blob or Azure files for generic data.

For more information, see [Overview of Page blobs](../storage/blobs/storage-blob-pageblob-overview.md).

### ERROR_BLOB_OR_FILE_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED

**Error description:** An unsupported file type is present in a managed disk share. Only fixed VHDs are allowed.

**Suggested resolution:**

- Make sure that you only upload the fixed VHDs to create managed disks.
- VHDX files or **dynamic** and **differencing** VHDs are not supported.

### ERROR_DIRECTORY_DISALLOWED_FOR_TYPE

**Error description:** A directory is not allowed in any of the pre-existing folders for the managed disks. Only fixed VHDs are allowed in these folders.

**Suggested resolution:** For managed disks, within each share, the following three folders are created which correspond to containers in your storage account: Premium SSD, Standard HDD, and Standard SSD. These folders correspond to the performance tier for the managed disk.

- Make sure that you copy your page blob data (VHDs) into one of these existing folders.
- A folder or directory is not allowed in these existing folders. Remove any folders that you have created inside the pre-existing folders.

For more information, see [Copy to managed disks](data-box-deploy-copy-data-from-vhds.md#connect-to-data-box).

### REPARSE_POINT_ERROR

**Error description:** Symbolic links are not allowed in Linux. 

**Suggested resolution:** The symbolic links are usually links, pipes, and other such files. Either remove the links, or resolve the links and copy the data.


## Non-critical blob or file errors

All the non-critical errors related to names of blobs, files, or containers that are seen during data copy are summarized in the following section. If these errors are present, then the names will be modified to conform to the Azure naming conventions. The corresponding order status for data upload will be **Completed with warnings**.  

### ERROR_BLOB_OR_FILE_NAME_CHARACTER_CONTROL

**Error description:** The blob or file names contain unsupported control characters.
