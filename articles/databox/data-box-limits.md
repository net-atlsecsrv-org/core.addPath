# Azure Data Box limits

Consider these limits as you deploy and operate your Microsoft Azure Data Box. The following table describes these limits for the Data Box.

## Data Box service limits

[!INCLUDE [data-box-service-limits](../../includes/data-box-service-limits.md)]

## Data Box limits

- Data Box can store a maximum of 500 million files for both import and export.
- Data Box supports a maximum of 512 containers or shares in the cloud. The top-level directories within the user share become containers or Azure file shares in the cloud. 
- Data Box usage capacity may be less than 80 TB because of ReFS metadata space consumption.
- Data Box supports a maximum of 10 client connections at a time on an NFS share.

## Azure storage limits

[!INCLUDE [data-box-storage-limits](../../includes/data-box-storage-limits.md)]

## Data upload caveats


### For import order

Data Box caveats for an import order include:

[!INCLUDE [data-box-data-upload-caveats](../../includes/data-box-data-upload-caveats.md)]

## For export order

Data Box caveats for an export order include:

- Data Box is a Windows-based device and doesnâ€™t support case-sensitive file names. For example, you may have two different files in Azure with names that just differ in casing. Don't use Data Box to export such files as the files will be overwritten on the device.
- If you have duplicate tags in input files or tags referring to the same data, the Data Box export might skip or overwrite the files. The number of files and size of data that the Azure portal displays might differ from the actual size of data on the device. 
- Data Box exports data to Windows-based system over SMB and is limited by SMB limitations for files and folders. Files and folders with unsupported names aren't exported.
- There is a 1:1 mapping from prefix to container.
- Maximum filename size is 1024 characters. Filenames that exceed this length aren't exported.
- Duplicate prefixes in the *xml* file (uploaded during order creation) are exported. Duplicate prefixes are not ignored.
- Page blobs and container names are case-sensitive. If the casing is mismatched, the blob and/or container will not be found.
 

## Azure storage account size limits

[!INCLUDE [data-box-storage-account-size-limits](../../includes/data-box-storage-account-size-limits.md)]

## Azure object size limits

[!INCLUDE [data-box-object-size-limits](../../includes/data-box-object-size-limits.md)]

## Azure block blob, page blob, and file naming conventions

[!INCLUDE [data-box-naming-conventions](../../includes/data-box-naming-conventions.md)]
