This tutorial describes how to connect to and copy data from your host computer using the local web UI.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prerequisites
> * Connect to Data Box
> * Copy data to Data Box


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that:

1. You've completed the [Tutorial: Set up Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-set-up.md).
2. You've received your Data Box and the order status in the portal is **Delivered**.
3. You have a host computer that has the data that you want to copy over to Data Box. Your host computer must
    - Run a [Supported operating system](data-box-system-requirements.md).
    - Be connected to a high-speed network. We strongly recommend that you have at least one 10-GbE connection. If a 10-GbE connection isn't available, use a 1-GbE data link but the copy speeds will be impacted.

## Connect to Data Box

Based on the storage account selected, Data Box creates up to:
- Three shares for each associated storage account for GPv1 and GPv2.
- One share for premium storage.
- One share for blob storage account.

Under block blob and page blob shares, first-level entities are containers, and second-level entities are blobs. Under shares for Azure Files, first-level entities are shares, second-level entities are files.

The following table shows the UNC path to the shares on your Data Box and Azure Storage path URL where the data is uploaded. The final Azure Storage path URL can be derived from the UNC share path.
 
|                   |                                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Block blobs | <li>UNC path to shares: `\\<DeviceIPAddress>\<StorageAccountName_BlockBlob>\<ContainerName>\files\a.txt`</li><li>Azure Storage URL: `https://<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<ContainerName>/files/a.txt`</li> |  
| Azure Page blobs  | <li>UNC path to shares: `\\<DeviceIPAddres>\<StorageAccountName_PageBlob>\<ContainerName>\files\a.txt`</li><li>Azure Storage URL: `https://<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<ContainerName>/files/a.txt`</li>   |  
| Azure Files       |<li>UNC path to shares: `\\<DeviceIPAddres>\<StorageAccountName_AzFile>\<ShareName>\files\a.txt`</li><li>Azure Storage URL: `https://<StorageAccountName>.file.core.windows.net/<ShareName>/files/a.txt`</li>        |      

If using a Windows Server host computer, follow these steps to connect to the Data Box.

1. The first step is to authenticate and start a session. Go to **Connect and copy**. Click **Get credentials** to get the access credentials for the shares associated with your storage account. 

    ![Get share credentials 1](media/data-box-deploy-copy-data/get-share-credentials1.png)

2. In the Access share and copy data dialog box, copy the **Username** and the **Password** corresponding to the share. Click **OK**.
    
    ![Get share credentials 1](media/data-box-deploy-copy-data/get-share-credentials2.png)

3. To access the shares associated with your storage account (*devicemanagertest1* in the following example) from your host computer, open a command window. At the command prompt, type:

    `net use \\<IP address of the device>\<share name>  /u:<user name for the share>`

    Depending upon your data format, the share paths are as follows:
    - Azure Block blob - `\\10.126.76.172\devicemanagertest1_BlockBlob`
    - Azure Page blob - `\\10.126.76.172\devicemanagertest1_PageBlob`
    - Azure Files - `\\10.126.76.172\devicemanagertest1_AzFile`
    
4. Enter the password for the share when prompted. The following sample shows connecting to a share via the preceding command.

    ```
    C:\Users\Databoxuser>net use \\10.126.76.172\devicemanagertest1_BlockBlob /u:devicemanagertest1
    Enter the password for 'devicemanagertest1' to connect to '10.126.76.172':
    The command completed successfully.
    ```

4. Press  Windows + R. In the **Run** window, specify the `\\<device IP address>`. Click **OK** to open File Explorer.
    
    ![Connect to share via File Explorer 2](media/data-box-deploy-copy-data/connect-shares-file-explorer1.png)

    You should now see the shares as folders.
    
    ![Connect to share via File Explorer 2](media/data-box-deploy-copy-data/connect-shares-file-explorer2.png)    

    **Always create a folder for the files that you intend to copy under the share and then copy the files to that folder**. The folder created under block blob and page blob shares represents a container to which data is uploaded as blobs. You cannot copy files directly to *root* folder in the storage account.
    
If using a Linux client, use the following command to mount the SMB share. The "vers" parameter below is the version of SMB that your Linux host supports. Plug in the appropriate version in the command below. For versions of SMB that the Data Box supports see [Supported file systems for Linux clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox/data-box-system-requirements#supported-file-systems-for-linux-clients) 

    `sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=2.1 10.126.76.172:/devicemanagertest1_BlockBlob /home/databoxubuntuhost/databox`
    


## Copy data to Data Box

Once you're connected to the Data Box shares, the next step is to copy data. Before you begin the data copy, review the following considerations:

- Make sure that you copy the data to shares that correspond to the appropriate data format. For instance, copy the block blob data to the share for block blobs. Copy the VHDs to page blob. If the data format doesn't match the appropriate share type, then at a later step, the data upload to Azure will fail.
-  While copying data, make sure that the data size conforms to the size limits described in the [Azure storage and Data Box limits](data-box-limits.md).
- If data, which is being uploaded by Data Box, is concurrently uploaded by other applications outside of Data Box, then this could result in upload job failures and data corruption.
- We recommend that:
    - You don't use both SMB and NFS at the same time.
    - Copy the same data to same end destination on Azure. 
     
  In these cases, the final outcome can't be determined.
- Always create a folder for the files that you intend to copy under the share and then copy the files to that folder. The folder created under block blob and page blob shares represents a container to which the data is uploaded as blobs. You cannot copy files directly to *root* folder in the storage account.

After you've connected to the SMB share, begin data copy. You can use any SMB compatible file copy tool such as Robocopy to copy your data. Multiple copy jobs can be initiated using Robocopy. Use the following command:
    
    robocopy <Source> <Target> * /e /r:3 /w:60 /is /nfl /ndl /np /MT:32 or 64 /fft /Log+:<LogFile> 
  
 The attributes are described in the following table.
    
|Attribute  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|/e     |Copies subdirectories including empty directories.         |
|/r:     |Specifies the number of retries on failed copies.         |
|/w:     |Specifies the wait time between retries, in seconds.         |
|/is     |Includes the same files.         |
|/nfl     |Specifies that file names aren't logged.         |
|/ndl    |Specifies that directory names aren't logged.        |
|/np     |Specifies that the progress of the copying operation (the number of files or directories copied so far) will not be displayed. Displaying the progress significantly lowers the performance.         |
|/MT     | Use multithreading, recommended 32 or 64 threads. This option not used with encrypted files. You may need to separate encrypted and unencrypted files. However, single threaded copy significantly lowers the performance.           |
|/fft     | Use to reduce the time stamp granularity for any file system.        |
|/b     | Copies files in Backup mode.        |
|/z    | Copies files in Restart mode, use this if the environment is unstable. This option reduces throughput due to additional logging.      |
| /zb     | Uses Restart mode. If access is denied, this option uses Backup mode. This option reduces throughput due to checkpointing.         |
|/efsraw     | Copies all encrypted files in EFS raw mode. Use only with encrypted files.         |
|log+:\<LogFile>| Appends the output to the existing log file.|    
 
The following sample shows the output of the robocopy command to copy files to the Data Box.

For more information on Robocopy command, go to [Robocopy and a few examples](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1073.robocopy-and-a-few-examples.aspx).

Open the target folder to view and verify the copied files. If you have any errors during the copy process, download the error files for troubleshooting. For more information, see [View error logs during data copy to Data Box](data-box-logs.md#view-error-log-during-data-copy). For a detailed list of errors during data copy, see [Troubleshoot Data Box issues](data-box-troubleshoot.md).

To ensure data integrity, checksum is computed inline as the data is copied. Once the copy is complete, verify the used space and the free space on your device.

You can copy data from your source server to your Data Box via SMB, NFS, REST, data copy service or to managed disks.

In each case, make sure that the share and folder names, and the data size follow guidelines described in the [Azure Storage and Data Box service limits](data-box-limits.md).

## Copy data via SMB

1. If using a Windows host, use the following command to connect to the SMB shares:

    `\\<IP address of your device>\ShareName`

2. To get the share access credentials, go to the **Connect & copy** page in the local web UI of the Data Box.
3. Use an SMB compatible file copy tool such as Robocopy to copy data to shares. 

For step-by-step instructions, go to [Tutorial: Copy data to Azure Data Box via SMB](data-box-deploy-copy-data.md).

## Copy data via NFS

1. If using an NFS host, use the following command to mount the NFS shares on your Data Box:

    `sudo mount <Data Box device IP>:/<NFS share on Data Box device> <Path to the folder on local Linux computer>`

2. To get the share access credentials, go to the **Connect & copy** page in the local web UI of the Data Box.
3. Use `cp` or `rsync` command to copy your data.

For step-by-step instructions, go to [Tutorial: Copy data to Azure Data Box via NFS](data-box-deploy-copy-data-via-nfs.md).

## Copy data via REST

1. To copy data using Data Box Blob storage via REST APIs, you can connect over *http* or *https*.
2. To copy data to Data Box Blob storage, you can use AzCopy.

For step-by-step instructions, go to [Tutorial: Copy data to Azure Data Box Blob storage via REST APIs](data-box-deploy-copy-data-via-nfs.md).

## Copy data via data copy service

1. To copy data by using the data copy service, you need to create a job. In the local web UI of your Data Box, go to **Manage > Copy data > Create**. 
2. Fill out the parameters and create a job.

For step-by-step instructions, go to [Tutorial: Use the data copy service to copy data into Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-copy-data-via-copy-service.md).

## Copy data to managed disks

1. When ordering the Data Box device, you should have selected managed disks as your storage destination.
2. You can connect to Data Box via SMB or NFS shares.
3. You can then copy data via SMB or NFS tools.

For step-by-step instructions, go to [Tutorial: Use Data Box to import data as managed disks in Azure](data-box-deploy-copy-data-from-vhds.md).
