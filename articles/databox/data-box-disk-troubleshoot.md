# Troubleshoot issues in Azure Data Box Disk

This article applies to Microsoft Azure Data Box Disk and describes the workflows used to troubleshoot any issues you see when you deploy this solution. 

This article includes the following sections:

- Download diagnostic logs
- Query activity logs
- Data Box Disk Unlock tool errors
- Data Box Disk Split Copy tool errors

## Download diagnostic logs

If there are any errors during the data copy process, then the portal displays a path to the folder where the diagnostics logs are located. 

The diagnostics logs can be:
- Error logs
- Verbose logs  

To navigate to the path for copy log, go to the storage account associated with your Data Box order. 

1.	Go to **General > Order details** and make a note of the storage account associated with your order.
 

2.	Go to **All resources** and search for the storage account identified in the previous step. Select and click the storage account.

3.	Go to **Blob service > Browse blobs** and look for the blob corresponding to the storage account. Go to **diagnosticslogcontainer > waies**. 

    ![Copy logs 2](./media/data-box-disk-troubleshoot/data-box-disk-copy-logs2.png)

    You should see both the error logs and the verbose logs for data copy. Select and click each file and then download a local copy.

## Query Activity logs

Use the activity logs to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource. Through activity logs, you can determine:

- What operations were taken on the resources in your subscription.
- Who initiated the operation.
- When the operation occurred.
- The status of the operation.
- The values of other properties that might help you research the operation.

The activity log contains all write operations (such as PUT, POST, DELETE) performed on your resources but not the read operations (such as GET).

Activity logs are retained for 90 days. You can query for any range of dates, as long as the starting date is not more than 90 days in the past. You can also filter by one of the built-in queries in Insights. For instance, click error and then select and click specific failures to understand the root cause.

## Deployment issues for Linux

This section details some of the top issues faced during deployment of Data Box Disk when using a Linux client for data copy.

### Issue: Drive getting mounted as read-only
 
**Cause** 

This could be due to an unclean file system. 

Remounting a drive as read-write does not work with Data Box Disks. This scenario is not supported with drives decrypted by dislocker. You may have successfully remounted the device using the following command:

    `# mount -o remount, rw /mnt/DataBoxDisk/mountVol1`

Though the remounting was successful, the data will not persist.

**Resolution**

Take the following steps on your Linux system:

1. Install the `ntfsprogs` package for the ntfsfix utility.
2. Unmount the mount points provided for the drive by the unlock tool. The number of mount points will vary for drives.

    ```
    unmount /mnt/DataBoxDisk/mountVol1
    ```

3. Run `ntfsfix` on the corresponding path. The highlighted number should be same as Step 2.

    ```
    ntfsfix /mnt/DataBoxDisk/bitlockerVol1/dislocker-file
    ```

4. Run the following command to remove the hibernation metadata that may cause the mount issue.

    ```
    ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /mnt/DataBoxDisk/bitlockerVol1/dislocker-file /mnt/DataBoxDisk/mountVol1
    ```

5. Do a clean unmount.

    ```
    ./DataBoxDiskUnlock_x86_64 /unmount
    ```

6. Do a clean unlock and mount.
7. Test the mount point by writing a file.
8. Unmount and remount to validate the file persistence.
9. Continue with the data copy.
 
### Issue: Error with data not persisting after copy
 
**Cause** 

If you see that your drive does not have data after it was unmounted (though data was copied to it), then it is possible that you remounted a drive as read-write after the drive was mounted as read-only.

**Resolution**
 
If that is the case, see the resolution for [drives getting mounted as read-only](#issue-drive-getting-mounted-as-read-only).

If that was not the case, copy the logs from the folder that has the Data Box Disk Unlock tool and [contact Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md).

## Deployment issues for Windows

This section details some of the top issues faced during deployment of Data Box Disk when using a Windows client for data copy

### Issue: Could not unlock drive from BitLocker
 
**Cause** 

You have used the password in the BitLocker dialog and trying to unlock the disk via the BitLocker unlock drives dialog. This would not work. 

**Resolution**

To unlock the Data Box Disks, you need to use the Data Box Disk Unlock tool and provide the password from the Azure portal. For more information, go to [Tutorial: Unpack, connect, and unlock Azure Data Box Disk](data-box-disk-deploy-set-up.md#connect-to-disks-and-get-the-passkey).
 
### Issue: Could not unlock or verify some volumes. Contact Microsoft Support.
 
**Cause** 

You may see the following error in the error log and are not able to unlock or verify some volumes.

`Exception System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.`
 
This indicates that you are likely missing the appropriate version of Windows PowerShell on your Windows client.

**Resolution**

You can install [Windows PowerShell v 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616) and retry the operation.
 
If you are still not able to unlock the volumes, copy the logs from the folder that has the Data Box Disk Unlock tool and [contact Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md).
