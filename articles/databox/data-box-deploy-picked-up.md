> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prerequisites
> * Prepare to ship
> * Ship Data Box to Microsoft
> * Verify data upload to Azure
> * Erasure of data from Data Box

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

- You've have completed the [Tutorial: Copy data to Azure Data Box and verify](data-box-deploy-copy-data.md). 
- Copy jobs are complete. Prepare to ship can't run if copy jobs are in progress.

## Prepare to ship

[!INCLUDE [data-box-prepare-to-ship](../../includes/data-box-prepare-to-ship.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone target="chromeless"

After the data copy is complete, you prepare and ship the device. When the device reaches Azure datacenter, data is automatically uploaded to Azure.

## Prepare to ship

Before you prepare to ship, make sure that copy jobs are complete.

1. Go to **Prepare to ship** page in the local web UI and start the ship preparation. 
2. Turn off the device from the local web UI. Remove the cables from the device. 

The next steps are determined by where you are returning the device.

## Ship Data Box back

Ensure that the data copy to device is complete and **Prepare to ship** run is successful. Based on the region where you are shipping the device, the procedure is different.

## [In US, Canada, Europe](#tab/in-us-canada-europe)

Take the following steps if returning the device in US, Canada, or Europe.

1. Make sure that the device is powered off and cables are removed. 
2. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with device in the back of the device.
3. Ensure that the shipping label is displayed on the E-ink display and schedule a pickup with your carrier. If the label is damaged or lost or not displayed on the E-ink display, contact Microsoft Support. If the Support suggests, then you can go to **Overview > Download shipping label** in the Azure portal. Download the shipping label and affix on the device. 
4. Schedule a pickup with UPS if returning the device. To schedule a pickup:

    - Call the local UPS (country/region-specific toll free number).
    - In your call, quote the reverse shipment tracking number as shown in the E-ink display or your printed label.
    - If the tracking number is not quoted, UPS will require you to pay an additional charge during pickup.

    Instead of scheduling the pickup, you can also drop off the Data Box at the nearest drop-off location.
4. Once the Data Box is picked up and scanned by your carrier, the order status in the portal updates to **Picked up**. A tracking ID is also displayed.
