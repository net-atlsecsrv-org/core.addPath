This tutorial describes how to return Azure Data Box and the data is erased once the device is received at the Azure data.

In this tutorial, you will learn about topics such as:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Prerequisites
> * Prepare to ship
> * Ship Data Box to Microsoft
> * Erasure of data from Data Box

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

* You've have completed the [Tutorial: Copy data from Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-export-copy-data.md).
* Copy jobs are complete. Prepare to ship can't run if copy jobs are in progress.

## Prepare to ship

[!INCLUDE [data-box-export-prepare-to-ship](../../includes/data-box-export-prepare-to-ship.md)]

The next steps are determined by where you are returning the device.

## Ship Data Box back

Ensure that the data copy from the device is complete and **Prepare to ship** run is successful. Based on the region where you're shipping the device, the procedure is different.

## [US, Canada, Europe](#tab/in-us-canada-europe)

Take the following steps if returning the device in US, Canada, or Europe.

1. Make sure that the device is powered off and cables are removed. 
2. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with device in the back of the device.
3. Ensure that the shipping label is displayed on the E-ink display, and schedule a pickup with your carrier. If the label is damaged or lost or isn't displayed on the E-ink display, contact Microsoft Support. If Support suggests, then you can go to **Overview > Download shipping label** in the Azure portal. Download the shipping label and affix it on the device. 
4. Schedule a pickup with UPS if returning the device. To schedule a pickup:

   - Call the local UPS (country/region-specific toll free number).
   - In your call, quote the reverse shipment tracking number as shown in the E-ink display or your printed label. If you don't quote the tracking number, UPS will require an additional charge during pickup.
   - If any issues come up while you're scheduling a pickup, or you're asked to pay additional fees, contact Azure Data Box Operations. Send email to [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com).

    Instead of scheduling the pickup, you can also drop off the Data Box at the nearest drop-off location.
4. Once the Data Box is picked up and scanned by your carrier, the order status in the portal updates to **Picked up**. A tracking ID is also displayed.
