- Ensure that the shipping label is clearly visible. 

### Q. How is my data protected during transit? 
A.  During the transit, the following features on the Data Box help protect the data.
 - The Data Box disks are encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption. 
 - The device is locked and needs an unlock password to enter and access data.
For more information, go to [Data Box security features](data-box-security.md).  

### Q. I have finished Prepare to Ship and shut down the device. Can I still add more data to Data Box?
A. Yes. You can turn on the device and add more data. You will need to run **Prepare to Ship** again once you have completed data copy.

### Q. I received my device and it is not booting up? How do I ship the device back?
A. If your device is not booting, go to your order in the Azure portal. Download a shipping label and affix that on the device. For more information, go to [Download shipping label](data-box-portal-admin.md#download-shipping-label).

## Verify and upload

### Q. How soon can I access my data in Azure once I’ve shipped the Data Box back? 
A.  Once the order status for **Data Copy** shows as **Complete**, you should be able to access your data right away.

### Q. Where is my data located in Azure after the upload?
A.  When you copy the data to Data Box, depending on whether the data is block blob or page blob or Azure files, the data is uploaded to one of the following paths in your Azure Storage account.
- `https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<containername>` 
- `https://<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net/<sharename>`
 
  Alternatively, you could go to your Azure storage account in Azure portal and navigate from there.

### Q. I just noticed that I did not follow the Azure naming requirements for my containers. Will my data fail to upload to Azure?
A.  If the container names have uppercase letter, then those names are automatically converted to lowercase. If the names are not compliant in other ways (special characters, other languages, and so on), the upload will fail. For more information on best practices for naming shares, containers, files, go to:
- [Naming and referencing shares](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-shares--directories--files--and-metadata)
- [Block blobs and page blob conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs).

### Q. How do I verify the data I copied onto Data Box?
A.  After the data copy is complete, when you run **Prepare to ship**, your data is validated. Data Box generates a list of files and checksums for the data during the validation process. You can download the list of files and verify the list against the files in the source data. For more information, go to [Prepare to ship](data-box-deploy-picked-up.md#prepare-to-ship).

### Q. What happens to my data after I have returned the Data Box?
A.  Once the data copy to Azure is complete, the data from the disks on the Data Box is securely erased as per the NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines. For more information, go to [Erasure of data from Data Box](data-box-deploy-picked-up.md#erasure-of-data-from-data-box).

## Audit report

### How does Azure Data Box service help support customers chain of custody procedure?
A.  Azure Data Box service natively provides reports that you can use for your chain of custody documentation. The audit and copy logs are available in your storage account in Azure and you can [download the order history](data-box-portal-admin.md#download-order-history) in the Azure portal after the order is complete.


### What type of reporting is available to support chain of custody?
A.  Following reporting is available to support chain of custody:

- Transport logistics from UPS.
- Logging of powering on and user share access.
- Manifest file with a 64-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC-64) or checksum for each file ingested successfully into the Data Box.
- Reporting of files that failed to upload to Azure storage account.
- Sanitization of the Data Box device (as per NIST 800 88R1 standards) after data is copied to your Azure storage account.

### Are the carrier tracking logs (from UPS) available? 
A.  Carrier tracking logs are captured in the Data Box order history. This report is available to you after the device has returned to Azure datacenter and the data on device disks is cleaned up. For immediate need, you can also go directly to the carrier’s website with the order tracking number and get the tracking information.

### Can I transport the Data Box to Azure datacenter? 
A.  No. Currently Azure datacenter does not accept delivery of the Data Box from customers or from carriers other than UPS.
