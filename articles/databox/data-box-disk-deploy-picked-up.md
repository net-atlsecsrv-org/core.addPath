1. Once the data validation is complete, unplug the disks. Remove the connecting cables.
2. Wrap all the disks and the connecting cables with a bubble wrap and place them into the shipping box. Charges may apply if the accessories are missing.
    - Reuse the packaging from the initial shipment.  
    - We recommend that you pack disks using a well-secured bubbled wrap.
    - Make sure the fit is snug to reduce any movements within the box.

The next steps are determined by where you are returning the device. The instructions are different for US/Canada, European Union (EU), Australia, or countries/regions in Asia.

### [US or Canada](#tab/in-us-or-canada)

Take the following steps if returning the device in US or Canada.

    - Go to **Overview > Download shipping label** and download a return ship label.
    - Affix the label on the device.

2. Seal the shipping box and ensure that the return shipping label is visible.
3. Schedule a pickup with UPS. To schedule a pickup:

    - Call the local UPS (country/region-specific toll free number).
    - In your call, quote the reverse shipment tracking number as shown in your printed label.
    - If the tracking number is not quoted, UPS will require you to pay an additional charge during pickup.
    - Instead of scheduling the pickup, you can also drop off the Data Box Disk at the nearest drop-off location.
