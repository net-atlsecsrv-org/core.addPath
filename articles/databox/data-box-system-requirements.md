# Azure Data Box system requirements

This article describes the important system requirements for your Microsoft Azure Data Box and for the clients connecting to the Data Box. We recommend you review the information carefully before you deploy your Data Box, and then refer back to it as necessary during the deployment and subsequent operation.

The system requirements include:

* **Software requirements for hosts connecting to Data Box** - describes the supported platforms, browsers for the local web UI, SMB clients, and any additional requirements for hosts that can connect to the Data Box.
* **Networking requirements for the Data Box** - provides information about the networking requirements for the optimum operation of the Data Box.


## Software requirements

The software requirements include the information on the supported operating systems, supported browsers for the local web UI, and SMB clients.

### Supported operating systems for clients

[!INCLUDE [data-box-supported-os-clients](../../includes/data-box-supported-os-clients.md)]


### Supported filesystems for Linux clients

[!INCLUDE [data-box-supported-file-systems-clients](../../includes/data-box-supported-file-systems-clients.md)]


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Connection to Data Box shares is not supported via REST for export orders. 

### Supported storage accounts

[!INCLUDE [data-box-supported-storage-accounts](../../includes/data-box-supported-storage-accounts.md)]


### Supported storage types

[!INCLUDE [data-box-supported-storage-types](../../includes/data-box-supported-storage-types.md)]

### Supported web browsers

[!INCLUDE [data-box-supported-web-browsers](../../includes/data-box-supported-web-browsers.md)]

## Networking requirements

Your datacenter needs to have high-speed network. We strongly recommend that you have at least one 10-GbE connection. If a 10-GbE connection is not available, a 1-GbE data link can be used to copy data but the copy speeds are impacted.

### Port requirements

The following table lists the ports that need to be opened in your firewall to allow for SMB or NFS traffic. In this table, *in* or *inbound* refers to the direction from which incoming client requests access to your device. *Out* or *outbound* refers to the direction in which your Data Box device sends data externally, beyond the deployment: for example, outbound to the Internet.
