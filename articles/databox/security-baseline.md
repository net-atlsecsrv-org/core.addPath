You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.7: Log and alert on suspicious activities from administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Not applicable, Azure Data Box does not have its own administrative account. You access it through the Azure portal. However, you can configure your Azure subscription to use Azure Active Directory (AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for generation of logs and alerts when suspicious or unsafe activity occurs in the environment.

In addition, use Azure AD risk detections to view alerts and reports on risky user behavior.

* [How to deploy Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan)

* [Understand Azure AD risk detections](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risk-events)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (AD) as the central authentication and authorization system where applicable. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

* [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (AD) provides logs to help you discover stale accounts.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (AD) as the central authentication and authorization system where applicable. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

You have access to Azure AD sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

Azure Data Box service logs are not written into Log Analytics workspace.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

## Penetration tests and red team exercises

*For more information, see [Security control: Penetration tests and red team exercises](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-penetration-tests-red-team-exercises).*

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

**Guidance**: Microsoft does penetration testing and vulnerability scanning on Data Box devices. You can do your own penetration testing and vulnerability scan. If you choose to do so, follow the Microsoft Rules of Engagement to ensure your Penetration Tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies. Use Microsoftâ€™s strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications.
