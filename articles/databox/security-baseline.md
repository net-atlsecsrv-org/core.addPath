# Azure security baseline for Azure Data Box

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Data Box. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Data Box. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Data Box have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Data Box completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Data Box security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.1: Use approved time synchronization sources

**Guidance**: Microsoft maintains
the time source used for Azure resources, for example, for timestamps in the logs. Azure Data
Box time could drift if it is not connected to the network that can access the
NTP server at the customer site.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Corresponding
to each step in your Data Box order, you can take multiple actions to control
the access to the order, audit the events, track the order, and interpret the
various logs that are generated.

- [Understand tracking and event logging for your Azure Data Box](data-box-logs.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Corresponding to each step in your Data Box order, you can take multiple actions to control the access to the order, audit the events, track the order, and interpret the various logs that are generated.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Maintain
an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to your Azure
Data Box. You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure
portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The
roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities
in Active Directory.

You
can control who can access your order when the order is first created. Set up
Azure RBAC roles at various scopes to control the access
to the Data Box order. An Azure RBAC role determines the type of access â€“ read-write,
read-only, read-write to a subset of operations.

- [How to configure Azure RBAC for workbooks](../sentinel/quickstart-get-visibility.md)

- [Understand how to set up access control on the order](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox/data-box-logs#set-up-access-control-on-the-order)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

- [How to use Azure Security Center to monitor identity and access (Preview)](../security-center/security-center-identity-access.md)

- [How to use Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.6: Use dedicated machines (Privileged Access Workstations) for all administrative tasks

**Guidance**: Use a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) with Azure AD multifactor authentication enabled to log into and configure your Azure Data Box orders.

- [Privileged Access Workstations](https://4sysops.com/archives/understand-the-microsoft-privileged-access-workstation-paw-security-model/)

- [Planning a cloud-based Azure AD multifactor authentication deployment](../active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.7: Log and alert on suspicious activities from administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Not applicable, Azure Data Box does not have its own administrative account. You access it through the Azure portal. However, you can configure your Azure subscription to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for generation of logs and alerts when suspicious or unsafe activity occurs in the environment.

In addition, use Azure AD risk detections to view alerts and reports on risky user behavior.

- [Understand Azure AD risk detections](../active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.8: Manage Azure resources from only approved locations

**Guidance**: Use Conditional Access Named Locations to allow access to the Azure portal from only specific logical groupings of IP address ranges or countries/regions.

- [How to configure Named Locations in Azure](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system where applicable. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides logs to help you discover stale accounts. In addition, use Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right Users have continued access.

For the Data Box appliance, this is not supported in real time. You can
review the logs at the end of the job.

- [How to use Azure Identity Access Reviews](../active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system where applicable. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

You have access to Azure AD sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

Azure
Data Box service logs are not written into Log Analytics workspace.

Azure
Data Box implements AES 256-bit encryption for Data-at-rest.

Additionally,
Azure Data Box protects the device unlock key (also known as device password)
that is used to lock the device via an encryption key. By default, the device
unlock key for a Data Box order is encrypted with a Microsoft managed key. For
additional control over device unlock key, you can also provide a
customer-managed key. Customer-managed keys must be created and stored in an
Azure Key Vault.
