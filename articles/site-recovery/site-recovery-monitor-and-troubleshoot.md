# Monitor Site Recovery

In this article, learn how to monitor Azure [Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md), using Site Recovery inbuilt monitoring.  You can monitor:

- The health and status of machines replicated by Site Recovery
- Test failover status of machines.
- Issues and errors affecting configuration and replication.
- Infrastructure components such as on-premises servers.


## Before you start

You might want to review [common monitoring questions](monitoring-common-questions.md) before you start.

## Monitor in the dashboard

1. In the vault, click **Overview**. The Recovery Services dashboard consolidates all monitoring information for the vault in a single location. There are pages for both Site Recovery and the Azure Backup service, and you can switch between them.

    ![Site Recovery dashboard](./media/site-recovery-monitor-and-troubleshoot/dashboard.png)

2. From the dashboard, drill down into different areas. 

    ![Screenshot that shows the areas on the dashboard where you can drill down.](./media/site-recovery-monitor-and-troubleshoot/site-recovery-overview-page.png).

3. In **Replicated items**, click **View All** to see all the servers in the vault.
4. Click the status details in each section to drill down.
5. In **Infrastructure view**, sort monitoring information by the type of machines you're replicating.

## Monitor replicated items

In **Replicated items**, monitor the health of all machines in the vault that have replication enabled.

**State** | **Details**
--- | ---
Healthy | Replication is progressing normally. No error or warning symptoms are detected.
Warning | One or more warning symptoms that might impact replication are detected.
Critical | One or more critical replication error symptoms have been detected.<br/><br/> These error symptoms are typically indicators that replication stuck, or not progressing as fast as the data change rate.
Not applicable | Servers that aren't currently expected to be replicating. This might include machines that have been failed over.

## Monitor test failovers

In **Failover test success**, monitor the failover status for machines in the vault.

- We recommend that you run a test failover on replicated machines at least once every six months. It's a way to check that failover is working as expected, without disrupting your production environment. 
- A test failover is considered successful only after the failover and post-failover cleanup have completed successfully.

**State** | **Details**
--- | ---
Test recommended | Machines that haven't had a test failover since protection was enabled.
Performed successfully | Machines with or more successful test failovers.
Not applicable | Machines that aren't currently eligible for a test failover. For example, machines that are failed over, have initial replication/test failover/failover in progress.

## Monitor configuration issues

In **Configuration issues**, monitor any issues that might impact your ability to fail over successfully.

- Configuration issues (except for software update availability), are detected by a periodic validator operation that runs every 12 hours by default. You can force the validator operation to run immediately by clicking the refresh icon next to the **Configuration issues** section heading.
- Click the links to get more details. For issues impacting specific machines, click **needs attention** in the **Target configurations** column. Details include remediation recommendations.

**State** | **Details**
--- | ---
Missing configurations | A necessary setting is missing, such as a recovery network or a resource group.
Missing resources | A specified resource can't be found or isn't available in the subscription. For example, the resource was deleted or migrated. Monitored resources included the target resource group, target VNet/subnet, log/target storage account, target availability set, target IP address.
Subscription quota |  The available subscription resource quota balance is compared against the balance needed to fail over all of the machines in the vault.<br/><br/> If there aren't enough resources, an insufficient quota balance is reported.<br/><br/> Quotas are monitoring for VM core count, VM family core count, network interface card (NIC) count.
Software updates | The availability of new software updates, and information about expiring software versions.


## Monitor errors

In **Error summary**, monitor currently active error symptoms that might impact replication of servers in the vault, and monitor the number of impacted machines.

- Errors impacting on-premises infrastructure components are shown are the beginning of the section. For example, non-receipt of a heartbeat from the Azure Site Recovery Provider on the on-premises configuration server, or Hyper-V host.
- Next, replication error symptoms impacting replicated servers are shown.
- The table entries are sorted by decreasing order of the error severity, and then by decreasing count order of the impacted machines.
- The impacted server count is a useful way to understand whether a single underlying issue might impact multiple machines. For example, a network glitch could potentially impact all machines that replicate to Azure. 
- Multiple replication errors can occur on a single server. In this case, each error symptom counts that server in the list of its impacted servers. After the issue is fixed, replication parameters improve, and the error is cleared from the machine.

## Monitor the infrastructure.

In **Infrastructure view**, monitor the infrastructure components involved in replication, and connectivity health between servers and the Azure services.

- A green line indicates that connection is healthy.
- A red line with the overlaid error icon indicates the existence of one or more error symptoms that impact connectivity.
-  Hover the mouse pointer over the error icon to show the error and the number of impacted entities. Click the icon for a filtered list of impacted entities.

### Tips for monitoring the infrastructure

- Make sure that the on-premises infrastructure components (configuration server, process servers, VMM servers, Hyper-V hosts, VMware machines) are running the latest versions of the Site Recovery Provider and/or agents.
- To use all the features in the infrastructure view, you should be running [Update rollup 22](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4072852) for these components.
- To use the infrastructure view, select the appropriate replication scenario in your environment. You can drill down in the view for more details. The following table shows which scenarios are represented.

    **Scenario** | **State**  | **View available?**
    --- |--- | ---
    **Replication between on-premises sites** | All states | No 
    **Azure VM replication between Azure regions**  | Replication enabled/initial replication in progress | Yes
    **Azure VM replication between Azure regions** | Failed over/fail back | No   
    **VMware replication to Azure** | Replication enabled/initial replication in progress | Yes     
    **VMware replication to Azure** | Failed over/failed back | No      
    **Hyper-V replication to Azure** | Failed over/failed back | No

- To see the infrastructure view for a single replicating machine, in the vault menu, click **Replicated items**, and select a server.  




## Monitor recovery plans

In **Recovery plans**, monitor the number of plans, create new plans, and modify existing ones.  

## Monitor jobs

In **Jobs**, monitor the status of Site Recovery operations.

- Most operations in Azure Site Recovery are executed asynchronously, with a tracking job being created and used to track progress of the operation. 
- The job object has all the information you need to track the state and the progress of the operation. 

Monitor jobs as follows:

1. In the dashboard > **Jobs** section, you can see a summary of jobs that have completed, are in progress, or waiting for input, in the last 24 hours. You can click on any state to get more information about the relevant jobs.
2. Click **View all** to see all jobs in the last 24 hours.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also access job information from the vault menu > **Site Recovery Jobs**. 

2. In the **Site Recovery Jobs** list, a list of jobs is displayed. On the top menu you can get error details for a specific jobs, filter the jobs list based on specific criteria, and export selected job details to Excel.
3. You can drill into a job by clicking it. 

## Monitor virtual machines

In **Replicated items**, get a list of replicated machines. 
    ![Site Recovery replicated items list view](./media/site-recovery-monitor-and-troubleshoot/site-recovery-virtual-machine-list-view.png)

2. You can view and filter information. On the action menu at the top, you can perform actions for a particular machine, including running a test failover, or viewing specific errors.
3. Click **Columns** to show additional columns,  For example to show RPO, target configuration issues, and replication errors.
4. Click **Filter** to view information based on specific parameters such as replication health, or a particular replication policy.
5. Right-click a machine to initiate operations such as test failover for it, or to view specific error details associated with it.
6. Click a machine to drill into more details for it. Details include:
   - **Replication information**: Current status and health of the machine.
   - **RPO** (recovery point objective): Current RPO for the virtual machine and the time at which the RPO was last computed.
   - **Recovery points**: Latest available recovery points for the machine.
   - **Failover readiness**: Indicates whether a test failover was run for the machine, the agent version running on the machine (for machines running the Mobility service), and any configuration issues.
   - **Errors**: List of replication error symptoms currently observed on the machine, and possible causes/actions.
   - **Events**: A chronological list of recent events impacting the machine. Error details shows the currently observable error symptoms, while events is a historical record of issues that have impacted the machine.
   - **Infrastructure view**: Shows state of infrastructure for the scenario when machines are replicating to Azure.
