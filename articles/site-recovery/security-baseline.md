# Azure security baseline for Site Recovery

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Site
Recovery. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Site
Recovery. **Controls** not applicable to Site
Recovery have been excluded. 

To see how Site
Recovery completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Site
Recovery security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Microsoft Azure Site Recovery does not support deployment into an Azure Virtual Network. Configure Site Recovery service with an Azure Private Endpoint to enforce secure communications over your network.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Prioritize which alerts should be investigated first based on Security Center's assigned alert-severity. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Mark subscriptions clearly (for example, production, non-production) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. 

Create a process to review incidents, post occurrence, to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. 

Use the Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel, as needed.
