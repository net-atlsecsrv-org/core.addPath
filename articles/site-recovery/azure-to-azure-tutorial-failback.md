# Fail back an Azure VM between Azure regions

The [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service contributes to your disaster recovery strategy by managing and orchestrating replication, failover, and failback of on-premises machines and Azure virtual machines (VMs).

This tutorial describes how to fail back a single Azure VM. After you've failed over, you must fail back to the primary region when it's available. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> 
> * Fail back the VM in the secondary region.
> * Reprotect the primary VM back to the secondary region.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> 
> This tutorial helps you to fail over a few VMs to a target region and back to the source region with minimum customizations. For more in-depth instructions, review the [how-to guides on Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/).

## Before you start

* Make sure that the status of the VM is **Failover committed**.
* Check that the primary region is available, and that you're able to create and access new resources in it.
* Make sure that reprotection is enabled.

## Fail back to the primary region

After VMs are reprotected, you can fail back to the primary region as needed.

1. In the vault, select **Replicated items**, and then select the VM that was reprotected.

2. In **Replicated items**, select the VM, and then select **Failover**.
3. In **Failover**, select a recovery point to fail over to:
    - **Latest (default)**: Processes all the data in the Site Recovery service and provides the lowest recovery point objective (RPO).
    - **Latest processed**: Reverts the VM to the latest recovery point that has been processed by Site Recovery.
    - **Custom**: Fails over to a particular recovery point. This option is useful for performing a test failover.
4. Select **Shut down machine before beginning failover** if you want Site Recovery to attempt a shutdown of VMs in DR region before triggering the failover. The failover continues even if shutdown fails. 
5. Follow the failover progress on the **Jobs** page.
6. After the failover is complete, validate the VM by logging in to it. You can change the recovery point as needed.
7. After you've verified the failover, select **Commit the failover**. Committing deletes all the available recovery points. The change recovery point option is no longer available.
8. The VM should show as failed over and failed back.
