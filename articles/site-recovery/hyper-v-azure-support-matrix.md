# Support matrix for disaster recovery of on-premises Hyper-V VMs to Azure

This article summarizes the supported components and settings for disaster recovery of on-premises Hyper-V VMs to Azure by using [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
> Site Recovery does not move or store customer data out of the target region, in which disaster recovery has been setup for the source machines. Customers may select a Recovery Services Vault from a different region if they so choose. The Recovery Services Vault contains metadata but no actual customer data.

## Supported scenarios

**Scenario** | **Details**
--- | ---
Hyper-V with Virtual Machine Manager <br> <br>| You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for VMs running on Hyper-V hosts that are managed in the System Center Virtual Machine Manager fabric.<br/><br/> You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.<br/><br/> When Hyper-V hosts are managed by Virtual Machine Manager, you also can perform disaster recovery to a secondary on-premises site. To learn more about this scenario, read [this tutorial](hyper-v-vmm-disaster-recovery.md).
Hyper-V without Virtual Machine Manager | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for VMs running on Hyper-V hosts that aren't managed by Virtual Machine Manager.<br/><br/> You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.

## On-premises servers

**Server** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
Hyper-V (running without Virtual Machine Manager) |  Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2 with latest updates (including server core installation of these operating systems) | If you have already configured Windows Server 2012 R2 with/or SCVMM 2012 R2 with Azure Site Recovery and plan to upgrade the OS, please follow the guidance [documentation.](upgrade-2012R2-to-2016.md)
Hyper-V (running with Virtual Machine Manager) | Virtual Machine Manager 2019, Virtual Machine Manager 2016, Virtual Machine Manager 2012 R2 (including server core installation of these operating systems, except Virtual Machine Manager 2019) | If Virtual Machine Manager is used, Windows Server 2019 hosts should be managed in Virtual Machine Manager 2019. Similarly, Windows Server 2016 hosts should be managed in Virtual Machine Manager 2016.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher is present on the on-premise server.
