# Monitor Site Recovery with Azure Monitor Logs

This article describes how to monitor machines replicated by Azure [Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md), using [Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-logs.md), and [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview.md).

Azure Monitor Logs provide a log data platform that collects activity and diagnostic logs, along with other monitoring data. Within Azure Monitor Logs, you use Log Analytics to write and test log queries, and to interactively analyze log data. You can visualize and query log results, and configure alerts to take actions based on monitored data.

For Site Recovery, you can Azure Monitor Logs to help you do the following:

- **Monitor Site Recovery health and status**. For example, you can monitor replication health, test failover status, Site Recovery events, recovery point objectives (RPOs) for protected machines, and disk/data change rates.
- **Set up alerts for Site Recovery**. For example, you can configure alerts for machine health, test failover status, or Site Recovery job status.

Using Azure Monitor Logs with Site Recovery is supported for **Azure to Azure** replication, and **VMware VM/physical server to Azure** replication.

> [!NOTE]
> To get the churn data logs and upload rate logs for VMware and physical machines, you need to install a Microsoft monitoring agent on the Process Server. This agent sends the logs of the replicating machines to the workspace. This capability is available only for 9.30 mobility agent version onwards.

## Before you start

Here's what you need:

- At least one machine protected in a Recovery Services vault.
- A Log Analytics workspace to store Site Recovery logs. [Learn about](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md) setting up a workspace.
- A basic understanding of how to write, run, and analyze log queries in Log Analytics. [Learn more](../azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal.md).

We recommend that you review [common monitoring questions](monitoring-common-questions.md) before you start.

## Configure Site Recovery to send logs

1. In the vault, click **Diagnostic settings** > **Add diagnostic setting**.

    ![Select diagnostic logging](./media/monitoring-log-analytics/add-diagnostic.png)

2. In **Diagnostic settings**, specify a name, and check the box **Send to Log Analytics**.
3. Select the Azure Monitor Logs subscription, and the Log Analytics workspace.
4. Select **Azure Diagnostics** in the toggle.
5. From the log list, select all the logs with the prefix **AzureSiteRecovery**. Then click **OK**.

    ![Select workspace](./media/monitoring-log-analytics/select-workspace.png)

The Site Recovery logs start to feed into a table (**AzureDiagnostics**) in the selected workspace.

## Configure Microsoft monitoring agent on the Process Server to send churn and upload rate logs

You can capture the data churn rate information and source data upload rate information for your VMware/physical machines at on-premises. To enable this, a Microsoft monitoring agent is required to be installed on the Process Server.

1. Go to the Log Analytics workspace and click on **Advanced Settings**.
2. Click on **Connected Sources** page and further select **Windows Servers**.
3. Download the Windows Agent (64 bit) on the Process Server. 
4. [Obtain the workspace ID and key](../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md#obtain-workspace-id-and-key)
5. [Configure agent to use TLS 1.2](../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md#configure-agent-to-use-tls-12)
6. [Complete the agent installation](../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md#install-the-agent-using-setup-wizard) by providing the obtained workspace ID and key.
7. Once the installation is complete, go to Log Analytics workspace and click on **Advanced Settings**. Go to the **Data** page and further click on **Windows Performance Counters**. 
8. Click on **'+'** to add the following two counters with sample interval of 300 seconds:

        ASRAnalytics(*)\SourceVmChurnRate 
        ASRAnalytics(*)\SourceVmThrpRate 

The churn and upload rate data will start feeding into the workspace.


## Query the logs - examples

You retrieve data from logs using log queries written with the [Kusto query language](../azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-queries.md). This section provides a few examples of common queries you might use for Site Recovery monitoring.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the examples use **replicationProviderName_s** set to **A2A**. This retrieves Azure VMs that are replicated to a secondary Azure region using Site Recovery. In these examples, you can replace **A2A** with **InMageAzureV2**, if you want to retrieve on-premises VMware VMs or physical servers that are replicated to Azure using Site Recovery.

### Query data change rate (churn) and upload rate for a VMware or physical machine

> [!Note]
> Ensure you set up the monitoring agent on the Process Server to fetch these logs. Refer [steps to configure monitoring agent](#configure-microsoft-monitoring-agent-on-the-process-server-to-send-churn-and-upload-rate-logs).

This query plots a trend graph for a specific disk **disk0** of a replicated item **win-9r7sfh9qlru**, that represents the data change rate (Write Bytes per Second), and data upload rate. You can find the disk name on **Disks** blade of the replicated item in the recovery services vault. Instance name to be used in the query is DNS name of the machine followed by _ and disk name as in this example.

```
Perf
| where ObjectName == "ASRAnalytics"
| where InstanceName contains "win-9r7sfh9qlru_disk0"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(4h) 
| project TimeGenerated ,CounterName, Churn_MBps = todouble(CounterValue)/5242880 
| render timechart
```
Process Server pushes this data every 5 minutes to the Log Analytics workspace. These data points represent the average computed for 5 minutes.

## Set up alerts - examples

You can set up Site Recovery alerts based on Azure Monitor data. [Learn more](../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-log.md#managing-log-alerts-from-the-azure-portal) about setting up log alerts. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the examples use **replicationProviderName_s** set to **A2A**. This sets alerts for Azure VMs that are replicated to a secondary Azure region. In these examples, you can replace **A2A** with **InMageAzureV2** if you want to set alerts for on-premises VMware VMs or physical servers replicated to Azure.

```
AzureDiagnostics   
| where Category == "AzureSiteRecoveryJobs"   
| where OperationName == "Reprotect"  
| where ResultType == "Failed"  
| summarize count()  
```

For the alert, set **Threshold value** to 1, and **Period** to 1440 minutes, to check failures in the last day.
