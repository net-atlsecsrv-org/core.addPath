**Linux BRTFS file system** | Supported for Azure VMs.
**Azure VMs in availability zones** | You can enable replication to another region for Azure VMs deployed in availability zones. You can now enable replication for an Azure VM, and set the target for failover to a single VM instance, a VM in an availability set, or a VM in an availability zone. The setting doesn't impact replication. [Read](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/disaster-recovery-of-zone-pinned-azure-virtual-machines-to-another-region/) the announcement.
**Firewall-enabled storage (portal/PowerShell)** | Support added for [firewall-enabled storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security).<br/><br/> You can replicate Azure VMs with unmanaged disks on firewall-enabled storage accounts to another Azure region for disaster recovery.<br/><br/> You can use firewall-enabled storage accounts as target storage accounts for unmanaged disks.<br/><br/> Supported in portal and using PowerShell.

## Updates (December 2018)

### Automatic updates for the Mobility service (Azure VMs)

Site Recovery added an option for automatic updates to the Mobility service extension. The Mobility service extension is installed on each Azure VM replicated by Site Recovery. When you enable replication, you select whether to allow Site Recovery to manage updates to the extension.

Updates don't require a VM restart, and don't affect replication. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-autoupdate.md).

### Pricing calculator for Azure VM disaster recovery

Disaster Recovery of Azure VMs incurs VM licensing costs, and network and storage costs. Azure provides a [pricing calculator](https://aka.ms/a2a-cost-estimator) to help you figure out these costs. Site Recovery now provides an [example pricing estimate](https://aka.ms/a2a-cost-estimator) that prices a sample deployment based on a three-tier app using six VMs with 12 Standard HDD disks and 6 Premium SSD disks.

- The sample presumes a data change of 10 GB a day for standard, and 20 GB for premium.
- For your particular deployment, you can change the variables to estimate costs.
- You can specify the number of VMs, the number and type of managed disks, and the expected total data change rate expected across the VMs.
- Additionally, you can apply a compression factor to estimate bandwidth costs.
