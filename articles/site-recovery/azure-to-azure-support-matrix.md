# Support matrix for Azure VM disaster recovery between Azure regions

This article summarizes support and prerequisites for disaster recovery of Azure VMs from one Azure region to another, using the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service.


## Deployment method support

**Deployment** |  **Support**
--- | ---
**Azure portal** | Supported.
**PowerShell** | Supported. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-powershell.md)
**REST API** | Supported.
**CLI** | Not currently supported


## Resource support

**Resource action** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Move vaults across resource groups** | Not supported
**Move compute/storage/network resources across resource groups** | Not supported.<br/><br/> If you move a VM or associated components such as storage/network after the VM is replicating, you need to disable and then re-enable replication for the VM.
**Replicate Azure VMs from one subscription to another for disaster recovery** | Supported within the same Azure Active Directory tenant.
**Migrate VMs across regions within supported geographical clusters (within and across subscriptions)** | Supported within the same Azure Active Directory tenant.
**Migrate VMs within the same region** | Not supported.

## Region support

You can replicate and recover VMs between any two regions within the same geographic cluster. Geographic clusters are defined keeping data latency and sovereignty in mind.


**Geographic cluster** | **Azure regions**
-- | --
America | Canada East, Canada Central, South Central US, West Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, Central US, North Central US
Europe | UK West, UK South, North Europe, West Europe, South Africa West, South Africa North, Norway East, Norway West, France Central
Asia | South India, Central India, West India, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Korea South
Australia    | Australia East, Australia Southeast, Australia Central, Australia Central 2
Azure Government    | US GOV Virginia, US GOV Iowa, US GOV Arizona, US GOV Texas, US DOD East, US DOD Central
Germany    | Germany Central, Germany Northeast
China | China East, China North, China North2, China East2
Restricted Regions reserved for in-country disaster recovery |Germany North reserved for Germany West Central, Switzerland West reserved for Switzerland North, France South reserved for France Central, UAE Central restricted for UAE North customers

>[!NOTE]
>
> - For **Brazil South**, you can replicate and fail over to these regions: South Central US, West Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, and North Central US.
> - Brazil South can only be used as a source region from which VMs can replicate using Site Recovery. It can't act as a target region. This is because of latency issues due to geographical distances. Note that if you fail over from Brazil South as a source region to a target, failback to Brazil South from the target region is supported.
> - You can work within regions for which you have appropriate access.
> - If the region in which you want to create a vault doesn't show, make sure your subscription has access to create resources in that region.
> - If you can't see a region within a geographic cluster when you enable replication, make sure your subscription has permissions to create VMs in that region.



## Cache storage

This table summarizes support for the cache storage account used by Site Recovery during replication.

**Setting** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
General purpose V2 storage accounts (Hot and Cool tier) | Supported | Usage of GPv2 is not recommended because transaction costs for V2 are substantially higher than V1 storage accounts.
Premium storage | Not supported | Standard storage accounts are used for cache storage, to help optimize costs.
Azure Storage firewalls for virtual networks  | Supported | If you are using firewall enabled cache storage account or target storage account, ensure you ['Allow trusted Microsoft services'](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#exceptions).<br></br>Also, ensure that you allow access to at least one subnet of source Vnet.


## Replicated machine operating systems

Site Recovery supports replication of Azure VMs running the operating systems listed in this section. Please note that if an already replicating machine is subsequently upgraded (or downgraded) to a different major kernel, you need to disable replication and re-enable replication after the upgrade.

## Replicated machines - Linux file system/guest storage

* File systems: ext3, ext4, XFS, BTRFS
* Volume manager: LVM2
* Multipath software: Device Mapper


## Replicated machines - compute settings

**Setting** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
Size | Any Azure VM size with at least 2 CPU cores and 1-GB RAM | Verify [Azure virtual machine sizes](../virtual-machines/sizes.md).
Availability sets | Supported | If you enable replication for an Azure VM with the default options, an availability set is created automatically, based on the source region settings. You can modify these settings.
Availability zones | Supported |
Hybrid Use Benefit (HUB) | Supported | If the source VM has a HUB license enabled, a test failover or failed over VM also uses the HUB license.
Virtual machine scale sets | Not supported |
Azure gallery images - Microsoft published | Supported | Supported if the VM runs on a supported operating system.
Azure Gallery images - Third party published | Supported | Supported if the VM runs on a supported operating system.
Custom images - Third party published | Supported | Supported if the VM runs on a supported operating system.
VMs migrated using Site Recovery | Supported | If a VMware VM or physical machine was migrated to Azure using Site Recovery, you need to uninstall the older version of Mobility service running on the machine, and restart the machine before replicating it to another Azure region.
RBAC policies | Not supported | Role based Access control (RBAC) policies on VMs are not replicated to the failover VM in target region.
Extensions | Not supported | Extensions are not replicated to the failover VM in target region. It needs to be installed manually after failover.
Proximity Placement Groups | Supported | Virtual machines located inside a Proximity Placement Group can be protected using Site Recovery.


## Replicated machines - disk actions

**Action** | **Details**
-- | ---
Resize disk on replicated VM | Supported on the source VM before failover. No need to disable/re-enable replication.<br/><br/> If you change the source VM after failover, the changes aren't captured.<br/><br/> If you change the disk size on the Azure VM after failover, changes aren't captured by Site Recovery, and failback will be to the original VM size.
Add a disk to a replicated VM | Supported

## Replicated machines - storage

This table summarized support for the Azure VM OS disk, data disk, and temporary disk.

- It's important to observe the VM disk limits and targets for [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/disk-scalability-targets.md) and [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/disk-scalability-targets.md) VMs to avoid any performance issues.
- If you deploy with the default settings, Site Recovery automatically creates disks and storage accounts based on the source settings.
- If you customize, ensure you follow the guidelines.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid performance issues, make sure that you follow VM disk scalability and performance targets for [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/disk-scalability-targets.md) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/disk-scalability-targets.md) VMs. If you use default settings, Site Recovery creates the required disks and storage accounts, based on the source configuration. If you customize and select your own settings,follow the disk scalability and performance targets for your source VMs.

## Limits and data change rates

The following table summarizes Site Recovery limits.

- These limits are based on our tests, but obviously don't cover all possible application I/O combinations.
- Actual results can vary based on you app I/O mix.
- There are two limits to consider, per disk data churn and per virtual machine data churn.

**Storage target** | **Average source disk I/O** |**Average source disk data churn** | **Total source disk data churn per day**
---|---|---|---
Standard storage | 8 KB    | 2 MB/s | 168 GB per disk
Premium P10 or P15 disk | 8 KB    | 2 MB/s | 168 GB per disk
Premium P10 or P15 disk | 16 KB | 4 MB/s |    336 GB per disk
Premium P10 or P15 disk | 32 KB or greater | 8 MB/s | 672 GB per disk
Premium P20 or P30 or P40 or P50 disk | 8 KB    | 5 MB/s | 421 GB per disk
Premium P20 or P30 or P40 or P50 disk | 16 KB or greater |20 MB/s | 1684 GB per disk

## Replicated machines - networking
**Setting** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
NIC | Maximum number supported for a specific Azure VM size | NICs are created when the VM is created during failover.<br/><br/> The number of NICs on the failover VM depends on the number of NICs on the source VM when replication was enabled. If you add or remove a NIC after enabling replication, it doesn't impact the number of NICs on the replicated VM after failover. <br/><br/> The order of NICs after failover is not guaranteed to be the same as the original order. <br/><br/> You can rename NICs in the target region based on your organization's naming conventions.
Internet Load Balancer | Supported | Associate the preconfigured load balancer using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
Internal Load balancer | Supported | Associate the preconfigured load balancer using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
Public IP address | Supported | Associate an existing public IP address with the NIC. Or, create a public IP address and associate it with the NIC using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
NSG on NIC | Supported | Associate the NSG with the NIC using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
NSG on subnet | Supported | Associate the NSG with the subnet using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
Reserved (static) IP address | Supported | If the NIC on the source VM has a static IP address, and the target subnet has the same IP address available, it's assigned to the failed over VM.<br/><br/> If the target subnet doesn't have the same IP address available, one of the available IP addresses in the subnet is reserved for the VM.<br/><br/> You can also specify a fixed IP address and subnet in **Replicated items** > **Settings** > **Compute and Network** > **Network interfaces**.
Dynamic IP address | Supported | If the NIC on the source has dynamic IP addressing, the NIC on the failed over VM is also dynamic by default.<br/><br/> You can modify this to a fixed IP address if required.
Multiple IP addresses | Not supported | When you fail over a VM that has a NIC with multiple IP addresses, only the primary IP address of the NIC in the source region is kept. To assign multiple IP addresses, you can add VMs to a [recovery plan](recovery-plan-overview.md) and attach a script to assign additional IP addresses to the plan, or you can make the change manually or with a script after failover.
Traffic Manager     | Supported | You can preconfigure Traffic Manager so that traffic is routed to the endpoint in the source region on a regular basis, and to the endpoint in the target region in case of failover.
Azure DNS | Supported |
Custom DNS    | Supported |
Unauthenticated proxy | Supported | [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md)
Authenticated Proxy | Not supported | If the VM is using an authenticated proxy for outbound connectivity, it cannot be replicated using Azure Site Recovery.
VPN site-to-site connection to on-premises<br/><br/>(with or without ExpressRoute)| Supported | Ensure that the UDRs and NSGs are configured in such a way that the Site Recovery traffic is not routed to on-premises. [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md)
VNET to VNET connection    | Supported | [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md)
Virtual Network Service Endpoints | Supported | If you are restricting the virtual network access to storage accounts, ensure that the trusted Microsoft services are allowed access to the storage account.
Accelerated networking | Supported | Accelerated networking must be enabled on source VM. [Learn more](azure-vm-disaster-recovery-with-accelerated-networking.md).
Palo Alto Network Appliance | Not supported | With third party appliances, there are often restrictions imposed by the provider inside the Virtual Machine. Azure Site Recovery needs agent, extensions and outbound connectivity to be available. But the appliance does not let any outbound activity to be configured inside the Virtual Machine.
IPv6  | Not supported | Mixed configurations that include both IPv4 and IPv6 are also not supported. Please free up the subnet of the IPv6 range before any Site Recovery operation.
Private link access to Site Recovery service | Supported | [Learn more](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints.md)
