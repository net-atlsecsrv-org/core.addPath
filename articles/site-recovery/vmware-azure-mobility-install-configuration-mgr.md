# Automate Mobility Service installation

This article describes how to automate installation and updates for the Mobility service agent in [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).

When you deploy Site Recovery for disaster recovery of on-premises VMware VMs and physical servers to Azure, you install the Mobility service agent on each machine you want to replicate. The Mobility service captures data writes on the machine, and forwards them to the Site Recovery process server for replication. You can deploy the Mobility Service in a couple of ways:

- **Push installation**: Let Site Recovery install  the Mobility service agent when you enable replication for a machine in the Azure portal.
- **Manual installation**: Install the Mobility service manually on each machine. [Learn more](/vmware-physical-mobility-service-overview.md) about push and manual installation.
- **Automated deployment**: Automate installation with software deployment tools such as System Center Configuration Manager, or third-party tools such as Intigua JetPatch.

Automated installation and updating provides a solution if:

- Your organization doesn't allow for push installation on protected servers.
- Your company policy requires passwords to be changed periodically. You have to specify a password for the push installation.
- Your security policy doesn't permit adding firewall exceptions for specific machines.
- You're acting as a hosting service provider and don't want to provide customer machine credentials that are needed for push installation with Site Recovery.
- You need to scale gent installation to lots of servers simultaneously.
- You want to schedule installations and upgrades during planned maintenance windows.



## Prerequisites

For automated installation you need the following:

- A deployed software installation solution such as [Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/configmgr/) or [JetPatch](https://jetpatch.com/microsoft-azure-site-recovery/). 
-  Deployment prerequisites in place in [Azure](tutorial-prepare-azure.md) and [on-premises](vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises.md) for VMware disaster recovery, or for [physical server](physical-azure-disaster-recovery.md) disaster recovery. You should also review [support requirements](vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md) for disaster recovery.

## Prepare for automated deployment

The following table summarizes tools and processes for automating Mobility service deployment.

**Tool** | **Details** | **Instructions**
--- | --- | ---
**Configuration Manager** | 1. Verify that you have the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above in place. <br/><br/>2. Deploy disaster recovery by setting up the source environment, including downloading an OVA file to deploy the Site Recovery configuration server as a VMware VM using an OVF template.<br/><br/> 2. You register the configuration server with the Site Recovery service, set up the target Azure environment, and configure a replication policy.<br/><br/> 3. For automated Mobility service deployment, you create a network share containing the configuration server passphrase and Mobility service installation files.<br/><br/> 4. You create a Configuration Manager package containing the installation or updates, and prepare for Mobility service deployment.<br/><br/> 5. You can then enable replication to Azure for the machines that have the Mobility service installed. | [Automate with Configuration Manager](#automate-with-configuration-manager).
**JetPatch** | 1. Verify that you have the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above in place. <br/><br/> 2. Deploy disaster recovery by setting up the source environment, including downloading and deploying JetPatch Agent Manager for Azure Site Recovery in your Site Recovery environment, using an OVF template.<br/><br/> 2. You register the configuration server with Site Recovery, set up the target Azure environment, and configure a replication policy.<br/><br/> 3. For automated deployment, initialize and complete the JetPatch Agent Manager configuration.<br/><br/> 4. In JetPatch you can create a Site Recovery policy to automate deployment and upgrade of the Mobility service agent. <br/><br/> 5. You can then enable replication to Azure for the machines that have the Mobility service installed. | [Automate with JetPatch Agent Manager](https://jetpatch.com/microsoft-azure-site-recovery-deployment-guide/).<br/><br/> [Troubleshoot agent installation](https://kc.jetpatch.com/hc/articles/360035981812) in JetPatch.

## Automate with Configuration Manager

### Prepare the installation files

1. Make sure you have the prerequisites in place.
2. Create a secure network file share (SMB share) that can be accessed by the machine running the configuration server.
3. In Configuration Manager, [categorize the servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/automatically-categorize-devices-into-collections) on which you want to install or update the Mobility service. One collection should contain all Windows servers, the other all Linux server. 
5. On the network share, create a folder:

    - For installation on Windows machines, create a folder **MobSvcWindows**.
    - For installation on Linux machines, create a folder **MobSvcLinux**.

6. Sign in to the configuration server machine.
7. On the machine, open an admin command prompt.
8. Run this command to generate the passphrase file:

    ```
    cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin
    genpassphrase.exe -v > MobSvc.passphrase
    ```
9. Copy the MobSvc.passphrase file to the Windows folder, and to the Linux folder.
10. Run this command to browse to the folder containing the installation files:

    ```
    cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\pushinstallsvc\repository
    ```

11. Copy these installation files to the network share:

    - To **MobSvcWindows**, copy **Microsoft-ASR_UA_version_Windows_GA_date_Release.exe**
    - To **MobSvcLinux**, copy:
        - Microsoft-ASR_UA*RHEL6-64*release.tar.gz
        - Microsoft-ASR_UA*RHEL7-64*release.tar.gz
        - Microsoft-ASR_UA*SLES11-SP3-64*release.tar.gz
        - Microsoft-ASR_UA*SLES11-SP4-64*release.tar.gz
        - Microsoft-ASR_UA*OL6-64*release.tar.gz
        - Microsoft-ASR_UA*UBUNTU-14.04-64*release.tar.gz
      
12. Copy code to the Windows or Linux folders, as described in the next procedures. We're assuming that:
    - The IP address of the configuration server is 192.168.3.121.
    - The secure network file share is **\\\ContosoSecureFS\MobilityServiceInstallers**.

### Copy code to the Windows folder

Copy the following code:

- Save it as **install.bat** in the **MobSvcWindows** folder.
- Replace the [CSIP] placeholders in this script with the actual values of the IP address of your configuration server.
- The script supports new installations of the Mobility service agent, and updates to agents that are already installed.

REM ==== If not installed no operation required ========
REM ==== Else run uninstall command =====================
REM ==== {275197FC-14FD-4560-A5EB-38217F80CBD1} is ====
REM ==== guid for Mob Svc Installer ====================
whoami >> C:\logfile.log
NET START | FIND "InMage Scout Application Service"
IF  %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 1 (GOTO :INSTALL) ELSE GOTO :UNINSTALL
:NOOPERATION
                echo "No Operation Required." >> c:\logfile.log
                GOTO :ENDSCRIPT
:UNINSTALL
                echo "Uninstall" >> C:\logfile.log
