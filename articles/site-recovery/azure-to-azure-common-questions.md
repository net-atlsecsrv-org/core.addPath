# Common questions: Azure-to-Azure disaster recovery

This article answers common questions about disaster recovery of Azure VMs to another Azure region, using the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service.

## General

### How is Site Recovery priced?

Learn about [costs](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/know-exactly-how-much-it-will-cost-for-enabling-dr-to-your-azure-vm/) for Azure VM disaster recovery.

### How does the free tier work?

Every instance that's protected with Site Recovery is free for the first 31 days of protection. After that period, protection for each instance is at the rates summarized in [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery/). You can estimate costs using the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=site-recovery).

### Do I incur other Azure charges in the first 31 days?

Yes. Even though Azure Site Recovery is free during the first 31 days of a protected instance, you might incur charges for Azure Storage, storage transactions, and data transfers. A recovered VM might also incur Azure compute charges. G

### How do I get started with Azure VM disaster recovery?

1. [Understand](azure-to-azure-architecture.md) the Azure VM disaster recovery architecture.
2. [Review](azure-to-azure-support-matrix.md) support requirements.
3. [Set up](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication.md) disaster recovery for Azure VMs.
4. [Run a disaster recovery drill](azure-to-azure-tutorial-dr-drill.md) with a test failover.
5. [Run a full failover](azure-to-azure-tutorial-failover-failback.md) to a secondary Azure region.
6. [Fail back](azure-to-azure-tutorial-failback.md) from the secondary region to the primary region.

### How do we ensure capacity in the target region?

The Site Recovery team, and the Azure capacity management team, plan for sufficient infrastructure capacity. When you start a failover, the teams also help ensure that VM instances protected by Site Recovery deploy to the target region.

## Replication

### Can I replicate VMs with disk encryption?

Yes. Site Recovery supports disaster recovery of VMs that have Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) enabled. When you enable replication, Azure copies all the required disk encryption keys and secrets from the source region to the target region, in the user context. If you don't have required permissions, your security administrator can use a script to copy the keys and secrets.

- Site Recovery supports ADE for Azure VMs running Windows.
- Site Recovery supports:
    - ADE version 0.1, which has a schema that requires Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
    - ADE version 1.1, which doesn't require Azure AD. For version 1.1, Windows Azure VMs must have managed disks.
    - [Learn more](../virtual-machines/extensions/azure-disk-enc-windows.md#extension-schema). about the extension schemas.

[Learn more](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-ade-vms.md) about enabling replication for encrypted VMs.

### Can I select an automation account from a different resource group?

When you allow Site Recovery to manage updates for the Mobility service extension running on replicated Azure VMs, it deploys a global runbook (used by Azure services), via an Azure automation account. You can use the automation account that Site Recovery creates, or select to use an existing automation account. 

Currently, in the portal, you can only select an automation account in the same resource group as the vault. You can select an automation account from a different resource group using PowerShell. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-autoupdate.md#enable-automatic-updates).

### If I use a customer automation account that's not in the vault resource group, can I delete the default runbook?

Yes, you can delete it if you don't need it. 

### Can I replicate VMs to another subscription?

Yes, you can replicate Azure VMs to any subscription within the same Azure AD tenant. When you enable disaster recovery for VMs, by default the target subscription shown is that of the source VM. You can modify the target subscription, and other settings (such as resource group and virtual network), are populated automatically from the selected subscription.

### Can I replicate VMs in an availability zone to another region?

Yes, you can replicate VMs in availability zones to another Azure region. The target VM can be deployed as a single instance, in an availability set, or in an availability zone if supported in the target region. 

### Can I replicate non-zone VMs to a zone within the same region? 

This isn't supported in the portal. You can use the REST API/PowerShell to do this.

### Can I replicate zoned VMs to a different zone in the same region?

Support for this is limited to a couple of regions. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery.md).

### Can I exclude disks from replication?

Yes, you can exclude disks when you set up replication, using PowerShell. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-exclude-disks.md).

### Can I replicate new disks added to replicated VMs?

For replicated VMs with managed disks, you can add new disks, and enable replication for them. When you add a new disk, the replicated VM shows a warning message that one or more disks on the VM are available for protection. 

- If you enable replication for the added disks, the warning disappears after the initial replication.
- If you don't want to enable replication for the disk, you can dismiss the warning.
- If you fail over a VM with added disks, replication points show the disks available for recovery. For example, if you add a second disk to a VM with one disk, a replication point created before you added shows as "1 of 2 disks."

Site Recovery doesn't support "hot remove" of disks from a replicated VM. If you remove a VM disk, you need to disable and then reenable replication for the VM.

### How often can I replicate to Azure?

Replication is continuous when replicating Azure VMs to another Azure region. [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-architecture.md#replication-process) about how replication works.

### Can I replicate virtual machines within a region? 

You can't use Site Recovery to replicate disks within a region.

### Can I replicate VM instances to any Azure region?

You can replicate and recover VMs between any two regions within the same geographic cluster. Geographic clusters are defined with data latency and sovereignty in mind. [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-support-matrix.md#region-support) about region support.

### Does Site Recovery need internet connectivity?

No, but VMs need access to Site Recovery URLs and IP ranges. [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md#outbound-connectivity-for-urls).

### Can I replicate an application tiered across resource groups?

Yes, you can replicate the app, and keep the disaster recovery configuration in a separate resource group.

For example, if the apps has three tiers (application/database/web) in different resource groups, you need to enable replication three times, to protect all tiers. Site Recovery replicates the three tiers into three different resource groups.

### Can I move storage accounts across resource groups?

No, this is unsupported. If you accidentally move storage accounts to a different resource group and delete the original resource group, then you can create a new resource group with the same name as the old resource group, and then move the storage account to this resource group.

## Replication policy

### What is a replication policy?

A replication policy defines the retention history of recovery points, and the frequency of app-consistent snapshots.  Site Recovery creates a default replication policy as follows:

- Retain recovery points for 24 hours.
- Take app-consistent snapshots every four hours.

[Learn more](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication.md#customize-target-resources) about replication settings.

### What's a crash-consistent recovery point?

A crash-consistent recovery point contains on-disk data, as if you pulled the power cord from the server during the snapshot. It doesn't include anything that was in memory when the snapshot was taken.

Today, most apps can recover well from crash-consistent snapshots. A crash-consistent recovery point is usually enough for non-database operating systems, and apps such as file servers, DHCP servers, and print servers.

Site Recovery automatically creates a crash-consistent recovery point every five minutes.

### What's an application-consistent recovery point?

App-consistent recovery points are created from app-consistent snapshots. They capture the same data as crash-consistent snapshots, and in addition capture data in memory, and all transactions in process.

Because of extra content, app-consistent snapshots are the most involved, and take the longest. We recommend app-consistent recovery points for database operating systems, and apps such as SQL Server. For Windows, app-consistent snapshots use the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

### Do app-consistent recovery points impact performance?

 Because app-consistent recovery points capture all data in memory and process, if they capture frequently, it can affect performance when the workload is already busy. We don't recommend that you capture too often for non-database workloads. Even for database workloads, one hour should be enough.

### What's the minimum frequency for generating app-consistent recovery points?

Site Recovery can create app-consistent recovery points with a minimum frequency of one hour.

### Can I enable app-consistent replication for Linux VMs?

Yes. The Mobility agent for Linux support custom scripts for app-consistency. A custom script with pre and post-options is used by the agent. [Learn more](site-recovery-faq.md#can-i-enable-replication-with-app-consistency-in-linux-servers)

### How are recovery points generated and saved?

To understand how Site Recovery generates recovery points, let's use an example. 

- A replication policy retains recovery points for 24 hours, and takes an app-consistent frequency snapshot every hour.
- Site Recovery creates a crash-consistent recovery point every five minutes. You can't change this frequency.
- Site Recovery prunes recovery points after an hour, saving one point per hour.

So, in the last hour, you can choose from 12 crash-consistent points, and one app-consistent point, as shown in the graphic.

   ![List of generated recovery points](./media/azure-to-azure-common-questions/recovery-points.png)

### How far back can I recover?

The oldest recovery point that you can use is 72 hours.

### What happens if Site Recovery can't generate recovery points for more than 24 hours? 

If you have a replication policy of 24 hours, and Site Recovery can't generate recovery points for more than 24 hours, your old recovery points remain. Site Recovery only replaces the oldest point if it generates new points. Until there are new recovery points, all the old points remain after you reach the retention window.

### Can I change the replication policy after replication is enabled?

Yes. In the vault  > **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Replication policies**, select and edit the policy. Changes apply to existing policies too.

### Are all recovery points a complete VM copy?

The first recovery point that's generated has the complete copy. Successive recovery points have delta changes.

### Do increases in recovery point retention increase storage costs?

Yes. For example, if you increase retention from 24 hours to 72, Site Recovery saves recovery points for an additional 48 hours. The added time incurs storage changes. As an example only, if a single recovery point had delta changes of 10 GB, with a per-GB cost of $0.16 per month, then additional charges would be $1.60 × 48 per month.

## Multi-VM consistency

### What is multi-VM consistency?

Multi-VM consistency ensures that recovery points are consistent across replicated virtual machines.

- When you enable multi-VM consistency, Site Recovery creates a replication group of all the machines with the option enabled. 
- When you fail over the machines in the replication group, they have shared crash-consistent and app-consistent recovery points.

[Learn](azure-to-azure-tutorial-enable-replication.md#enable-replication) how to enable multi-VM consistency.

### Can I fail over a single VM in a replication group?

No. When you enable multi-VM consistency, it infers that an app has a dependency on all VMs in the replication group, and single VM failover isn't allowed.

### How many VM can I replicate together in a group?

You can replicate 16 VMs together in a replication group.

### When should I enable multi-VM consistency?

Multi-VM consistency is CPU intensive, and enabling it can affect workload performance. Enable only if VMs are running the same workload, and you need consistency across multiple machines. For example, if you have two SQL Server instances and two web servers in an application, enable multi-VM consistency for the SQL Server instances only.

### Can I add a replicating VM to a replication group?

When you enable replication for a VM, you can add it to a new replication group, or to an existing group. You can't add a VM that's already replicating to a group. 
 
## Failover

### How do we ensure capacity in the target region?

The Site Recovery team, and Azure capacity management team, plan for sufficient infrastructure capacity. When you start a failover, the teams also help ensure VM instances that are protected by Site Recovery can deploy to the target region.

### Is failover automatic?

Failover isn't automatic. You can start a failover with a single click in the portal, or use  [PowerShell](azure-to-azure-powershell.md) to trigger a failover.

### Can I keep a public IP address after  failover?

You can't keep the public IP address for a production app after a failover.

When you bring up a workload as part of the failover process, you need to assign an Azure public IP address resource to it. The resource must be available in the target region. You can assign the Azure public IP address resource manually, or you can automate it with a recovery plan. [Learn](concepts-public-ip-address-with-site-recovery.md#public-ip-address-assignment-using-recovery-plan) how to set up public IP addresses after failover.

### Can I keep a private IP address after failover?

Yes. By default, when you enable disaster recovery for Azure VMs, Site Recovery creates target resources, based on source resource settings. For Azure VMs configured with static IP addresses, Site Recovery tries to provision the same IP address for the target VM, if it's not in use.
[Learn more about](site-recovery-retain-ip-azure-vm-failover.md) keeping IP addresses after failover.

### Why is a VM assigned a new IP address after failover?

Site Recovery tries to provide the IP address at the time of failover. If another VM uses that address, Site Recovery sets the next available IP address as the target.

[Learn more about](azure-to-azure-network-mapping.md#set-up-ip-addressing-for-target-vms) setting up network mapping and IP addressing for virtual networks.

### What's the *Latest* recovery point?

The *Latest (lowest RPO)* recovery point option does the following:

1. It first processes all the data that has been sent to Site Recovery.
2. After the service processes the data, it creates a recovery point for each VM, before failing over to the VM. This option provides the lowest recovery point objective (RPO).
3. The VM created after failover has all the data replicated to Site Recovery, from when the failover was triggered.

### Do *latest* recovery points impact failover RTO?

Yes. Site Recovery processes all pending data before failing over, so this option has a higher recovery time objective (RTO) than other options.

### What's the *Latest processed* recovery option?

The *Latest processed* option does the following:

1. It fails over all VMs to the latest recovery point processed by Site Recovery . This option provides a low RTO, because no time is spent processing unprocessed data.

### What if there's an unexpected outage in the primary region?

You can start failover. Site Recovery doesn't need connectivity from the primary region to do the failover.

### What is the RTO of a VM failover?

Site Recovery has an RTO SLA of [two hours](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/site-recovery/v1_2/). Most of the time, Site Recovery fails over VMs within minutes. To calculate the RTO, review the failover job, which shows the time it took to bring up a VM. 

## Recovery plans

### What's a recovery plan?

A [recovery plan](site-recovery-create-recovery-plans.md) in Site Recovery orchestrates the failover and recovery of VMs. It helps make recovery consistently accurate, repeatable, and automated. It does the following:

- Defines a group of VMs that fail over together
- Defines the dependencies between VMs, so that the application comes up accurately.
- Automates recovery, with the option of custom manual actions for tasks other than VM failover. 


### How does sequencing work?

In a recovery plan, you can create multiple groups of VM for sequencing. Groups fails over one at one time, so that VMs that are part of the same group fail over together. [Learn more](recovery-plan-overview.md#model-apps).

### How can I find the RTO of a recovery plan?

To check the RTO of a recovery plan, do a test failover for the recovery plan. In **Site Recovery jobs**, check the test failover duration. In the example  screenshot, the **SAPTestRecoveryPlan** test failover job took 8 minutes and 59 seconds.

![List jobs showing the duration of the test failover for RTO](./media/azure-to-azure-common-questions/recovery-plan-rto.png)

### Can I add automation runbooks to recovery plans?

Yes. [Learn more](site-recovery-runbook-automation.md).

## Reprotection and failback

### After failover, are VMs in the secondary region protected automatically? 

No. When you fail over VMs from one region to another, the VMs start up in the target disaster recovery region in an unprotected state. To [reprotect](./azure-to-azure-how-to-reprotect.md) VMs in the secondary region, you enable replication back to the primary region.

### When I reprotect, is all data replicated from the secondary region to primary? 

It depends.If the source region VM exists, then only changes between the source disk and the target disk are synchronized. Site Recovery compares the disks to   what's different, and then it transfers the data. This process usually takes a few hours. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-how-to-reprotect.md#what-happens-during-reprotection).

### How long does it take fail back?

After reprotection, failback takes about the same amount of time it took to fail over from the primary region to a secondary region.

## <a name="capacity"></a>Capacity

### How do we ensure capacity in the target region?

The Site Recovery team and Azure capacity management team plan for sufficient infrastructure capacity. When you start a failover, the teams also help ensure VM instances that are protected by Site Recovery can deploy to the target region.

### Does Site Recovery work with reserved instances?

Yes, you can purchase [reserved Azure VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/) in the disaster recovery region, and Site Recovery failover operations use them. No additional configuration is needed.

## Security

### Is replication data sent to the Site Recovery service?

No, Site Recovery doesn't intercept replicated data, and it doesn't have any information about what's running on your VMs. Only the metadata needed to orchestrate replication and failover is sent to the Site Recovery service.

Site Recovery is ISO 27001:2013, 27018, HIPAA, and DPA certified. The service is undergoing SOC2 and FedRAMP JAB assessments.

### Does Site Recovery encrypt replication?

Yes, both encryption in transit and [encryption at rest in Azure](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md) are supported.
