# Languages supported on the Data Science Virtual Machine 

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) comes with several pre-built languages and development tools for building your AI applications. Here are some of the salient ones. 

## Python (Windows Server 2016 Edition)

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Language versions Supported | 2.7 and 3.6 |
| Supported DSVM Editions      | Windows Server 2016     |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?  | Two global `conda` environments are created. <br /> * `root` environment located at `/anaconda/` is Python 3.6 . <br/> * `python2` environment located at `/anaconda/envs/python2`is Python 2.7       |
| Links to Samples      | Sample Jupyter notebooks for Python are included     |
| Related Tools on the DSVM      | PySpark, R, Julia      |

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Server 2016 created before March 2018 contains Python 3.5 and Python 2.7. Also Python 2.7 is the conda **root** environment and **py35** is the Python 3.5 environment. 

### How to use / run it?    

* Running in command prompt

Open command prompt and do the following depending on the version of Python you want to run. 

```
# To run Python 2.7
activate python2
python --version

# To run Python 3.6
activate 
python --version

```
* Using in an IDE

Use Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) installed in the Visual Studio Community edition. The only environment setup automatically in PTVS by default is Python 3.6. 

> [!NOTE]
> To point the PTVS at Python 2.7, you need to create a  custom environment in PTVS. To set this environment paths in the Visual Studio  Community Edition, navigate to **Tools** -> **Python Tools** -> **Python Environments** and then click **+ Custom**. Then set the location to `c:\anaconda\envs\python2` and then click _Auto Detect_. 

* Using in Jupyter

Open Jupyter and click on the `New` button to create a new notebook. At this point, you can choose the kernel type as _Python [Conda Root]_ for Python 3.6 and _Python [Conda env:python2]_ for Python 2.7 environment. 

* Installing Python packages

The default Python environments on the DSVM are global environment readable by all users. But only administrators can write / install global packages. In order to install package to the global environment, activate to the root or python2 environment using the `activate` command as an Administrator. Then you can use the package manager like `conda` or `pip` to install or update packages. 

## Python (Linux and Windows Server 2012 Edition)

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Language versions Supported | 2.7 and 3.5 |
| Supported DSVM Editions      | Linux, Windows Server 2012    |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?  | Two global `conda` environments are created. <br /> * `root` environment located at `/anaconda/` is Python 2.7 . <br/> * `py35` environment located at `/anaconda/envs/py35`is Python 3.5       |
| Links to Samples      | Sample Jupyter notebooks for Python are included     |
| Related Tools on the DSVM      | PySpark, R, Julia      |
### How to use / run it?
