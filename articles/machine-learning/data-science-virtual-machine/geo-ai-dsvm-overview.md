# What is the Geo Artificial Intelligence Data Science Virtual Machine?

The Geo Artificial Intelligence Data Science Virtual Machine (also known as Geo AI Data Science VM, or Geo-DSVM) delivers geospatial analytics capabilities from the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). Specifically, this VM extends the AI and data science toolkits in the [DSVM](overview.md) by adding the market-leading [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) geographic information system from ERSI.

 Geo AI Data Science VM is a product offering that arose out of the collaboration between ESRI and Microsoft. The result is a powerful environment that provides the ability to:

- Explore data with the most popular AI and data science tools
- Apply statistical analysis to data with geographical or spatial aspects
- Train models for predictive analytics by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms
- Create rich visualizations

Geo AI Data Science VM is supported on the Windows 2016 DSVM. Python and R interfaces to ArcGIS are also preconfigured on the Geo-DSVM, enabling programmatic access to geospatial analytics within your AI applications. Additionally, Jupyter Notebook samples are provided to help you get started building AI applications infused with geospatial intelligence.


## Why Geo AI Data Science VM? 

Integrating geography and location information into your data brings a powerful new dimension to understanding a world increasingly instrumented with IoT devices. There's now a wide range of applications in virtually every segment of civil society, whether commercial, governmental, academic, or not-for-profit. Geospatial analytics provide robust tools for gathering, managing, and analyzing geographic and location-based data. They also offer powerful visualization that can enable unique insights into the significance of such data.

The [Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](overview.md) from Microsoft is a popular experimentation and modeling environment on Azure, which provides a host of AI, Machine Learning, and data science tools. These platforms and tools are all conveniently preconfigured to help you get productive immediately.

Geo AI Data Science VM combines the predictive capabilities of the DSVM with the scalability of the Azure cloud and the geospatial analytics software from [ESRI](https://www.esri.com). This pioneering integration provides data scientists and geospatial analysts with a productive platform from which to obtain new intelligence from their data, and to identify new opportunities.
