### About data science

Data science involves iterating on a sequence of tasks:

1. Find, load, and preprocess data
1. Build and test models
1. Deploy the models for consumption in intelligent applications

Data scientists use several tools for these tasks. It can be time consuming to find the appropriate versions of software and then download and install them. The DSVM saves time by providing a ready-to-use image that can be provisioned on Azure with several popular tools preinstalled and configured.

The DSVM jump-starts your analytics project. You can work on tasks in various languages including R, Python, SQL, and C#. Visual Studio provides an easy-to-use integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and test your code. The Azure SDK is included in the VM so you can build your applications by using various services on Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform.

There are no software charges for this data science VM image. You pay only the Azure usage fees. They depend on the size of the virtual machine you provision. More details on compute fees are in the **Pricing details** section on the [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.dsvm-windows) page.

### Other DSVM versions

* An [Ubuntu](dsvm-ubuntu-intro.md) image. It has many tools similar to the DSVM plus a few additional deep learning frameworks.
* A [Linux CentOS](linux-dsvm-intro.md) image.
* The [Windows Server 2012 edition](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.dsvm-windows) of the Data Science Virtual Machine. A few tools are available only on the Windows Server 2016 edition. Otherwise, this article also applies to the Windows Server 2012 edition.

## How to access the DSVM

After the VM is created and provisioned, you can remote desktop into it by using the admin account credentials that you configured in the preceding **Basics** section. You're ready to start using the tools that are installed and configured on the VM. Many of the tools can be accessed through start menu tiles and desktop icons.

You can also attach a Data Science VM to Azure Notebooks to run Jupyter notebooks on the VM and bypass the limitations of the free service tier. For more information, see [Manage and configure Notebooks projects - Compute tier](/azure/notebooks/configure-manage-azure-notebooks-projects#compute-tier).

## Tools installed on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine

Learn more about the tools that come installed on the DSVM:

### Microsoft Machine Learning Server Developer edition

You can use Microsoft Enterprise Library for scalable R or Python for your analytics because Machine Learning Server Developer edition is installed on the VM. Previously known as Microsoft R Server, Machine Learning Server is a broadly-deployable, enterprise-class analytics platform. It's available for both R and Python. It's also scalable, commercially-supported, and secure.

Machine Learning Server supports various big data statistics, predictive modeling, and machine learning tasks. It supports the full range of analytics: exploration, analysis, visualization, and modeling. By using and extending open-source R and Python, Machine Learning Server is compatible with R and Python scripts and functions. It's also compatible with CRAN, pip, and Conda packages to analyze data at the enterprise scale.

Machine Learning Server addresses the in-memory limitations of open-source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data. This means you can run analytics on much bigger data than what fits in main memory. Visual Studio Community is included on the VM. It has the R tools for Visual Studio and Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) extensions that provide a full IDE for working with R or Python. We also provide other IDEs like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and [PyCharm Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) on the VM.

### Python

For development by using Python, Anaconda Python distributions 2.7 and 3.6 are installed. These distributions have the base Python along with about 300 of the most popular math, engineering, and data analytics packages. You can use PTVS, which is installed within Visual Studio Community 2017. Or you can use one of the IDEs bundled with Anaconda like IDLE or Spyder. Search for and launch one of these packages (Win+S).

> [!NOTE]
> To point the Python Tools for Visual Studio at Anaconda Python 2.7, you need to create custom environments for each version. To set these environment paths in Visual Studio 2017 Community, navigate to **Tools** > **Python Tools** > **Python Environments**. Then select **+ Custom**.

Anaconda Python 3.6 is installed under **C:\Anaconda**. Anaconda Python 2.7 is installed under **c:\Anaconda\envs\python2**. For detailed steps, see [PTVS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python/installing-python-interpreters).

### The Jupyter Notebook

Anaconda distribution also comes with the Jupyter Notebook, an environment to share code and analysis. The Jupyter Notebook server is preconfigured with Python 2.7, Python 3.x, PySpark, Julia, and R kernels. To start the Jupyter server and launch the browser to access the notebook server, use the **Jupyter Notebook** desktop icon.

We package several sample notebooks in Python and R. After you access Jupyter, the notebooks show how to work with the following technologies:

* Machine Learning Server
* SQL Server Machine Learning Services, in-database analytics
* Python
* Microsoft Cognitive ToolKit
* Tensorflow
* Other Azure technologies

You can find the link to the samples on the notebook home page after you authenticate to the Jupyter Notebook by using the password you created in an earlier step.

### Visual Studio Community 2017

The DSVM includes Visual Studio Community. This is a free version of the popular IDE from Microsoft that you can use for evaluation purposes and small teams. See the [licensing terms](https://www.visualstudio.com/support/legal/mt171547).

Open Visual Studio by using the desktop icon or the **Start** menu. Search for programs (Win+S), followed by **Visual Studio**. From there, you can create projects in languages like C#, Python, R, and node.js. Installed plug-ins make it convenient to work with the following Azure services:

* Azure Data Catalog
* Azure HDInsight Hadoop and Spark
* Azure Data Lake

There's also a plug-in called **Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code** that seamlessly integrates to Azure Machine Learning and helps you rapidly build AI applications.

> [!NOTE]
> You might get a message that your evaluation period is expired. Enter your Microsoft account credentials. Or create a new free account to get access to Visual Studio Community.

### SQL Server 2017 Developer edition

The DSVM comes with a developer version of SQL Server 2017 with Machine Learning Services. This SQL Server edition comes in either R or Python and can run in-database analytics. Machine Learning Services provides a platform for developing and deploying intelligent applications. You can use these languages and many packages from the community to create models and generate predictions for your SQL Server data. You can keep analytics close to the data because Machine Learning Services, in-database, integrates both the R and Python languages within SQL Server. This integration eliminates the cost and security risks associated with data movement.

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL Server Developer edition is only for development and test purposes. You need a license to run it in production.

You can access SQL Server by launching Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Your VM name is populated as the **Server Name**. Use Windows authentication when you sign in as the admin on Windows. When you're in SQL Server Management Studio, you can create other users, create databases, import data, and run SQL queries.

To enable in-database analytics by using SQL Machine Learning Services, run the following command as a one-time action in SQL Server Management Studio after you sign in as the server administrator:

```
CREATE LOGIN [%COMPUTERNAME%\SQLRUserGroup] FROM WINDOWS
```

Replace `%COMPUTERNAME%` with your VM name.

### Azure

Several Azure tools are installed on the VM:

* A desktop shortcut goes to Azure SDK documentation.
* Use **AzCopy** to copy data in and out of your Azure Storage account. To see usage, enter **Azcopy** at a command prompt.
* Use **Azure Storage Explorer** to browse the objects you store in your Azure Storage account. It also copies data to and from Azure Storage. To access this tool, enter **Storage Explorer** in the **Search** field. Or find it in the Windows **Start** menu.
* **Adlcopy** copies data to Azure Data Lake. To see usage, enter **adlcopy** in a command prompt.
* **dtui** copies data to and from Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database on the cloud. Enter **dtui** in a command prompt.
* **Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime** copies data between on-premises data sources and the cloud. It's used within tools like Azure Data Factory.
* Use **Microsoft Azure PowerShell** to administer your Azure resources in the PowerShell scripting language. It's also installed on your VM.

### Power BI

The DSVM comes with **Power BI Desktop** installed to help you build dashboards and visualizations. Use this tool to pull data from different sources, to author your dashboards and reports, and to publish them to the cloud. For more information, see the [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) site. You can find Power BI Desktop on the **Start** menu.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a Microsoft Office 365 account to access Power BI.

### Azure Machine Learning service Python SDK

Data scientists and AI developers use the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to build and run machine learning workflows with the [Azure Machine Learning service](../service/overview-what-is-azure-ml.md). You can interact with the service in Jupyter Notebooks or another Python IDE by using open-source frameworks such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

To get started using the Python SDK, see [Use Python to get started with Azure Machine Learning](../service/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python.md).

The Python SDK is preinstalled on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine.
