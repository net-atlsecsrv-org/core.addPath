# Development tools on the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) bundles several popular tools in a highly productive integrated development environment (IDE). Here are some tools that are provided on the DSVM.

## Visual Studio Community Edition

| Category | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | General purpose IDE      |
| Supported DSVM versions      | Windows: Visual Studio 2017, Windows 2019 : Visual Studio 2019      |
| Typical uses      | Software development    |
| How is it configured and installed on the DSVM?      | Data Science Workload (Python and R tools), Azure workload (Hadoop, Data Lake), Node.js, SQL Server tools, [Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-tools-for-ai)    |
| How to use and run it      | Desktop shortcut (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe`).
