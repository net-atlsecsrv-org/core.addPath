# Deep learning and AI frameworks for the Azure Data Science VM
Deep learning frameworks on the DSVM are listed below.

## [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Version(s) supported | |
| Supported DSVM editions      | Linux (Ubuntu)     |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?  | Caffe is installed in `/opt/caffe`.   Samples are in `/opt/caffe/examples`.|
| How to run it      | use X2Go to sign in to your VM, and then start a new terminal and enter the following:<br/>`cd /opt/caffe/examples`<br/>`source activate root`<br/>`jupyter notebook`<br/><br/>A new browser window opens with sample notebooks. Binaries are installed in /opt/caffe/build/install/bin.<br/><br/>Installed version of Caffe requires Python 2.7 and won't work with Python 3.5, which is activated by default. To switch to Python 2.7, run `source activate root` to switch to Anaconda environment.|    

## [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2)
