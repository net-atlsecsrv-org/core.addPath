# Machine learning and data science tools on Azure Data Science Virtual Machines
Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVMs) have a rich set of tools and libraries for machine learning available in popular languages, such as Python, R, and Julia.

Here are some of the machine-learning tools and libraries on DSVMs.

## Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python

See the full reference for the [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml).

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   |   Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service that you can use to develop and deploy machine-learning models. You can track your models as you build, train, scale, and manage them by using the Python SDK. Deploy models as containers and run them in the cloud, on-premises, or on Azure IoT Edge.   |
| Supported editions     | Windows (conda environment: AzureML), Linux (conda environment: py36)    |
| Typical uses      | General machine-learning platform      |
| How is it configured or installed?      |  Installed with GPU support   |
| How to use or run it      | As a Python SDK and in the Azure CLI. Activate to the conda environment `AzureML` on Windows edition *or* to `py36` on Linux edition.      |
| Link to samples      | Sample Jupyter notebooks are included in the `AzureML` directory under notebooks.  |
| Related tools      | Visual Studio Code, Jupyter   |

## H2O

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | An open-source AI platform that supports in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning.  |
| Supported versions      | Linux   |
| Typical uses      | General-purpose distributed, scalable machine learning   |
| How is it configured or installed?      | H2O is installed in `/dsvm/tools/h2o`.      |
| How to use or run it      | Connect to the VM by using X2Go. Start a new terminal, and run `java -jar /dsvm/tools/h2o/current/h2o.jar`. Then start a web browser and connect to `http://localhost:54321`.      |
| Link to samples      | Samples are available on the VM in Jupyter under the `h2o` directory.      |
| Related tools      | Apache Spark, MXNet, XGBoost, Sparkling Water, Deep Water    |

There are several other machine-learning libraries on DSVMs, such as the popular `scikit-learn` package that's part of the Anaconda Python distribution for DSVMs. To check out the list of packages available in Python, R, and Julia, run the respective package managers.

## LightGBM

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | A fast, distributed, high-performance gradient-boosting (GBDT, GBRT, GBM, or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms. It's used for ranking, classification, and many other machine-learning tasks.    |
| Supported versions      | Windows, Linux    |
| Typical uses      | General-purpose gradient-boosting framework      |
| How is it configured or installed?      | On Windows, LightGBM is installed as a Python package. On Linux, the command-line executable is in `/opt/LightGBM/lightgbm`, the R package is installed, and Python packages are installed.     |
| Link to samples      | [LightGBM guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/examples/python-guide)   |
| Related tools      | MXNet, XgBoost  |

## Rattle
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   |   A graphical user interface for data mining by using R.   |
| Supported editions     | Windows, Linux     |
| Typical uses      | General UI data-mining tool for R    |
| How to use or run it      | As a UI tool. On Windows, start a command prompt, run R, and then inside R, run `rattle()`. On Linux, connect with X2Go, start a terminal, run R, and then inside R, run `rattle()`. |
