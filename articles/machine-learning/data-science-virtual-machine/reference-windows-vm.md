# Reference: Windows Data Science Virtual Machine

See below for a list of available tools on your Windows Data Science Virtual Machine. 

## Microsoft Machine Learning Server Developer edition

You can use Microsoft Enterprise Library for your analytics because Machine Learning Server Developer edition is installed on the VM. Previously known as Microsoft R Server, Machine Learning Server is a broadly deployable analytics platform. It's scalable and commercially supported.

Machine Learning Server supports various big data statistics, predictive modeling, and machine learning tasks. It supports the full range of analytics: exploration, analysis, visualization, and modeling. By using and extending open-source R and Python, Machine Learning Server is compatible with R and Python scripts and functions. It's also compatible with CRAN, pip, and Conda packages to analyze data at the enterprise scale.

Machine Learning Server addresses the in-memory limitations of open-source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data. This means you can run analytics on much bigger data than what fits in main memory. 

Visual Studio Community is included on the VM. It has the R tools for Visual Studio and Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) extensions that provide a full IDE for working with R or Python. We also provide other IDEs like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) on the VM.

## Python

For development by using Python, Anaconda Python distributions 2.7 and 3.6 are installed. These distributions have the base Python along with about 300 of the most popular math, engineering, and data analytics packages. You can use PTVS, which is installed in Visual Studio Community 2017. Or you can use one of the IDEs bundled with Anaconda, like IDLE or Spyder. Search for and open one of these packages (Windows logo key+S).

> [!NOTE]
> To point the Python Tools for Visual Studio at Anaconda Python 2.7, you need to create custom environments for each version. To set these environment paths in Visual Studio 2017 Community, go to **Tools** > **Python Tools** > **Python Environments**. Then select **+ Custom**.

Anaconda Python 3.6 is installed under C:\Anaconda. Anaconda Python 2.7 is installed under C:\Anaconda\envs\python2. For detailed steps, see the [PTVS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python/installing-python-interpreters).

## The Jupyter Notebook

Anaconda Distribution also comes with the Jupyter Notebook, an environment to share code and analysis. The Jupyter Notebook server is preconfigured with Python 2.7, Python 3.x, PySpark, Julia, and R kernels. To start the Jupyter server and open the browser to access the notebook server, use the **Jupyter Notebook** desktop icon.

We package several sample notebooks in Python and R. After you access Jupyter, the notebooks show how to work with the following technologies:

* Machine Learning Server
* SQL Server Machine Learning Services, in-database analytics
* Python
* Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit
* TensorFlow
* Other Azure technologies

You can find the link to the samples on the notebook home page after you authenticate to the Jupyter Notebook by using the password that you created earlier.

## Visual Studio Community 2017

The DSVM includes Visual Studio Community. This is a free version of the popular IDE from Microsoft that you can use for evaluation purposes and small teams. See the [Microsoft Software License Terms](https://www.visualstudio.com/support/legal/mt171547).

Open Visual Studio by using the desktop icon or the **Start** menu. Search for programs (Windows logo key+S), followed by **Visual Studio**. From there, you can create projects in languages like C#, Python, R, and Node.js. Installed plug-ins make it convenient to work with the following Azure services:

* Azure Data Catalog
* Azure HDInsight for Hadoop and Spark
* Azure Data Lake

A plug-in called Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code also integrates with Azure Machine Learning and helps you rapidly build AI applications.

> [!NOTE]
> You might get a message that your evaluation period is expired. Enter your Microsoft account credentials. Or create a new free account to get access to Visual Studio Community.

## SQL Server 2017 Developer edition

The DSVM comes with a developer version of SQL Server 2017 with Machine Learning Services. This SQL Server edition comes in either R or Python and can run in-database analytics. 

Machine Learning Services provides a platform for developing and deploying intelligent applications. You can use these languages and many packages from the community to create models and generate predictions for your SQL Server data. You can keep analytics close to the data because Machine Learning Services, in-database, integrates both the R and Python languages within SQL Server. This integration eliminates the cost and security risks associated with data movement.

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL Server Developer edition is only for development and test purposes. You need a license to run it in production.

You can access SQL Server by opening Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Your VM name is populated as **Server Name**. Use Windows authentication when you sign in as the admin on Windows. When you're in SQL Server Management Studio, you can create other users, create databases, import data, and run SQL queries.

To enable in-database analytics by using SQL Server Machine Learning Services, run the following command as a one-time action in SQL Server Management Studio after you sign in as the server administrator:

```
CREATE LOGIN [%COMPUTERNAME%\SQLRUserGroup] FROM WINDOWS
```

Replace `%COMPUTERNAME%` with your VM name.

## Azure

Several Azure tools are installed on the VM:

* A desktop shortcut goes to Azure SDK documentation.
* Use AzCopy to copy data in and out of your Azure storage account. To see usage, enter **Azcopy** at a command prompt.
* Use Azure Storage Explorer to browse through the objects that you store in your Azure storage account. It also copies data to and from Azure Storage. To access this tool, enter **Storage Explorer** in the **Search** field. Or find it on the Windows **Start** menu.
* AdlCopy copies data to Azure Data Lake. To see usage, enter **adlcopy** in a command prompt.
* The dtui tool copies data to and from Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database in the cloud. Enter **dtui** in a command prompt.
* The integration runtime copies data between on-premises data sources and the cloud. It's used within tools like Azure Data Factory.
* Use Azure PowerShell to administer your Azure resources in the PowerShell scripting language. It's also installed on your VM.

## Power BI

The DSVM comes with Power BI Desktop installed to help you build dashboards and visualizations. Use this tool to pull data from different sources, to author your dashboards and reports, and to publish them to the cloud. For more information, see the [Power BI site](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). You can find Power BI Desktop on the **Start** menu.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a Microsoft Office 365 account to access Power BI.

## Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python

Data scientists and AI developers use the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to build and run machine learning workflows with the [Azure Machine Learning service](../service/overview-what-is-azure-ml.md). You can interact with the service in Jupyter Notebooks or another Python IDE by using open-source frameworks such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

The Python SDK is preinstalled on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine. To start using the Python SDK, see [Use Python to get started with Azure Machine Learning](../service/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python.md).

## More Microsoft Development Tools

You can use the [Microsoft Web Platform Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) to find and download other Microsoft development tools. There's also a shortcut to the tool on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine desktop.
