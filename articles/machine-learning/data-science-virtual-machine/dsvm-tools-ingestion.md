# Data Science Virtual Machine data ingestion tools

As one of the first technical steps in a data science or AI project, you must identify the datasets to be used and bring them into your analytics environment. The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) provides tools and libraries to bring data from different sources into analytical data storage locally on the DSVM, or into a data platform either on the cloud or on-premises.

Here are some data movement tools that are available in the DSVM.

## AdlCopy

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | A tool to copy data from Azure Blob storage into Azure Data Lake Store. It can also copy data between two Azure Data Lake Store accounts.      |
| Supported DSVM versions      | Windows      |
| Typical uses      | Importing multiple blobs from Azure Blob storage into Azure Data Lake Store.      |
|  How to use / run it?    |   Open a command prompt and type `adlcopy` to get help.    |
| Links to samples      | [Using AdlCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-copy-data-azure-storage-blob)      |
