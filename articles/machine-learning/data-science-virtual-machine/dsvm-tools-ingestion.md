# Data Science Virtual Machine data ingestion tools

One of the first technical steps in a data science or AI project is to identify the datasets to be used and bring them into your analytics environment. The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) provides tools and libraries to bring in data from different sources into an analytical data storage locally on the DSVM or in a data platform on the cloud or on-premises. 

Here are some data movement tools we have provided on the DSVM. 

## AdlCopy

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | A tool to copy data from Azure storage blobs into Azure Data Lake Store. It can also copy data between two Azure Data Lake Store accounts.      |
| Supported DSVM Versions      | Windows      |
| Typical Uses      | Importing multiple blobs from Azure storage into Azure Data Lake Store.      |
|  How to use / run it?    |   Open a command prompt, then type `adlcopy` to get help.    |
| Links to Samples      | [Using AdlCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-copy-data-azure-storage-blob)      |
