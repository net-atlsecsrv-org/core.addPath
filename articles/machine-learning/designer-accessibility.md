# Use a keyboard to use Azure Machine Learning designer (preview)

Learn how to use a keyboard and screen reader to use Azure Machine Learning designer. For a list of keyboard shortcuts that work everywhere in the Azure portal, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Azure portal](../azure-portal/azure-portal-keyboard-shortcuts.md)

This workflow has been tested with [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/help/22798/windows-10-complete-guide-to-narrator) and [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), but it should work with other standard screen readers.

## Navigate the pipeline graph

The pipeline graph is organized as a nested list. The outer list is a module list, which describes all the modules in the pipeline graph. The inner list is a connection list, which describes all the connections of a specific module.  

1. In the module list, use the arrow key to switch modules.
1. Use tab to open the connection list for the target module.
1. Use arrow key to switch between the connection ports for the module.
1. Use “G” to go to the target module.

## Edit the pipeline graph

### Add a module to the graph

1. Use Ctrl+F6 to switch focus from the canvas to the module tree.
1. Find the desired module in the module tree using standard treeview control.

### Edit a module

To connect a module to another module:

1. Use Ctrl + Shift + H when targeting a module in the module list to open the connection helper.
1. Edit the connection ports for the module.

To adjust module properties:

1. Use Ctrl + Shift + E when targeting a module to open the module properties.
1. Edit the module properties.
