#Customer intent: As a data scientist, I want to use Git, install packages and add kernels to a compute instance in my workspace in Azure Machine Learning studio.

# Access a compute instance terminal in your workspace

Access the terminal of a compute instance in your workspace to:

* Use files from Git and version files. These files are stored in your workspace file system, not restricted to a single compute instance.
* Install packages on the compute instance.
* Create extra kernels on the compute instance.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.
* A Machine Learning workspace. See [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

## Access a terminal

To access the terminal:

1. Open your workspace in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).
1. On the left side, select **Notebooks**.
1. Select the **Open terminal** image.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-terminal/open-terminal-window.png" alt-text="Open terminal window":::

1. When a compute instance is running, the terminal window for that compute instance appears.
1. When no compute instance is running, use the **Compute** section on the right to start or create a compute instance.

In addition to the steps above, you can also access the terminal from:

* RStudio: Select the **Terminal** tab on top left.
* Jupyter Lab:  Select the **Terminal** tile under the **Other** heading in the Launcher tab.
* Jupyter:  Select **New>Terminal** on top right in the Files tab.
* SSH to the machine, if you enabled SSH access when the compute instance was created.

## Copy and paste in the terminal

> * Windows: `Ctrl-Insert` to copy and use `Ctrl-Shift-v` or `Shift-Insert` to paste.
> * Mac OS: `Cmd-c` to copy and `Cmd-v` to paste.
> * FireFox/IE may not support clipboard permissions properly.

## <a name=git></a> Use files from Git and version files

Access all Git operations from the terminal. All Git files and folders will be stored in your workspace file system. This storage allows you to use these files from any compute instance in your workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> Add your files and folders anywhere under the **~/cloudfiles/code/Users** folder so they will be visible in all your Jupyter environments.

Learn more about [cloning Git repositories into your workspace file system](concept-train-model-git-integration.md#clone-git-repositories-into-your-workspace-file-system).

## Install packages

 Install packages from a terminal window. Install Python packages into the **Python 3.6 - AzureML** environment.  Install R packages into the **R** environment.

Or you can install packages directly in Jupyter Notebook or RStudio:

* RStudio Use the **Packages** tab on the bottom right, or the **Console** tab on the top left.  
* Python: Add install code and execute in a Jupyter Notebook cell.

> [!NOTE]
> For package management within a notebook, use **%pip** or **%conda** magic functions to automatically install packages into the **currently-running kernel**, rather than **!pip** or **!conda** which refers to all packages (including packages outside the currently-running kernel)

## Add new kernels

> [!WARNING]
>  While customizing the compute instance, make sure you do not delete the **azureml_py36** conda environment or **Python 3.6 - AzureML** kernel. This is needed for Jupyter/JupyterLab functionality

To add a new Jupyter kernel to the compute instance:

1. Use the terminal window to create a new environment.  For example, the code below creates `newenv`:

    ```shell
    conda create --name newenv
    ```

1. Activate the environment.  For example, after creating `newenv`:

    ```shell
    conda activate newenv
    ```

1. Install pip and ipykernel package to the new environment and create a kernel for that conda env

    ```shell
    conda install pip
    conda install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name newenv --display-name "Python (newenv)"
    ```

Any of the [available Jupyter Kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) can be installed.

## Manage terminal sessions

 Select **View active sessions** in the terminal toolbar to see a list of all active terminal sessions. When there are no active sessions, this tab will be disabled.

Close any unused sessions to preserve your compute instance's resources.
