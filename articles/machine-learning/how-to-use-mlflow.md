# Track model metrics and deploy ML models with MLflow and Azure Machine Learning (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

This article demonstrates how to enable MLflow's tracking URI and logging API, collectively known as [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html#using-the-tracking-api), to connect your MLflow experiments and Azure Machine Learning.  Doing so enables you to,

+ Track and log experiment metrics and artifacts in your [Azure Machine Learning workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture#workspaces). If you already use MLflow Tracking for your experiments, the workspace provides a centralized, secure, and scalable location to store training metrics and models.

+ Deploy your MLflow experiments as an Azure Machine Learning web service. By deploying as a web service, you can apply the Azure Machine Learning monitoring and data drift detection functionalities to your production models. 

[MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org) is an open-source library for managing the life cycle of your machine learning experiments. MLFlow Tracking is a component of MLflow that logs and tracks your training run metrics and model artifacts, no matter your experiment's environment--locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, a virtual machine, or an Azure Databricks cluster. 

>[!NOTE]
> As an open source library, MLflow changes frequently. As such, the functionality made available via the Azure Machine Learning and MLflow integration should be considered as a preview, and not fully supported by Microsoft.

The following diagram illustrates that with MLflow Tracking, you track an experiment's run metrics and store model artifacts in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

![mlflow with azure machine learning diagram](./media/how-to-use-mlflow/mlflow-diagram-track.png)

> [!TIP]
> The information in this document is primarily for data scientists and developers who want to monitor the model training process. If you are an administrator interested in monitoring resource usage and events from Azure Machine Learning, such as quotas, completed training runs, or completed model deployments, see [Monitoring Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md).

## Compare MLflow and Azure Machine Learning clients

 The below table summarizes the different clients that can use Azure Machine Learning, and their respective function capabilities.

 MLflow Tracking offers metric logging and artifact storage functionalities that are only otherwise available via the [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py).

## Prerequisites

* [Install MLflow.](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html)
* [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py) on your local computer  The SDK provides the connectivity for MLflow to access your workspace.
* [Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

## Track local runs

MLflow Tracking with Azure Machine Learning lets you store the logged metrics and artifacts from your local runs into your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Install the `azureml-mlflow` package to use MLflow Tracking with Azure Machine Learning on your experiments locally run in a Jupyter Notebook or code editor.

```shell
pip install azureml-mlflow
```

Import the `mlflow` and [`Workspace`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace(class)?view=azure-ml-py) classes to access MLflow's tracking URI and configure your workspace.

In the following code, the `get_mlflow_tracking_uri()` method assigns a unique tracking URI address to the workspace, `ws`, and `set_tracking_uri()` points the MLflow tracking URI to that address.

```Python
import mlflow
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.from_config()

mlflow.set_tracking_uri(ws.get_mlflow_tracking_uri())
```

>[!NOTE]
>The tracking URI is valid up to an hour or less. If you restart your script after some idle time, use the get_mlflow_tracking_uri API to get a new URI.

Set the MLflow experiment name with `set_experiment()` and start your training run with `start_run()`. Then use `log_metric()` to activate the MLflow logging API and begin logging your training run metrics.

```Python
experiment_name = 'experiment_with_mlflow'
mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name)

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_metric('alpha', 0.03)
```

## Track remote runs

MLflow Tracking with Azure Machine Learning lets you store the logged metrics and artifacts from your remote runs into your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Remote runs let you train your models on more powerful computes, such as GPU enabled virtual machines, or Machine Learning Compute clusters. See [Set up compute targets for model training](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md) to learn about different compute options.

Configure your compute and training run environment with the [`Environment`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment?view=azure-ml-py) class. Include `mlflow` and `azureml-mlflow` pip packages in environment's [`CondaDependencies`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.conda_dependencies.condadependencies?view=azure-ml-py) section. Then construct  [`ScriptRunConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.script_run_config.scriptrunconfig?view=azure-ml-py) with your remote compute as the compute target.

```Python
from azureml.core.environment import Environment
from azureml.core.conda_dependencies import CondaDependencies
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

exp = Experiment(workspace = 'my_workspace',
                 name='my_experiment')

mlflow_env = Environment(name='mlflow-env')

cd = CondaDependencies.create(pip_packages=['mlflow', 'azureml-mlflow'])

mlflow_env.python.conda_dependencies = cd

src = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='./my_script_location', script='my_training_script.py')

src.run_config.target = 'my-remote-compute-compute'
src.run_config.environment = mlflow_env
```

In your training script, import `mlflow` to use the MLflow logging APIs, and start logging your run metrics.

```Python
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_metric('example', 1.23)
```

With this compute and training run configuration, use the `Experiment.submit('train.py')` method to submit a run. This method automatically sets the MLflow tracking URI and directs the logging from MLflow to your Workspace.

```Python
run = exp.submit(src)
```

## Track Azure Databricks runs

MLflow Tracking with Azure Machine Learning lets you store the logged metrics and artifacts from your Azure Databricks runs in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

To run your Mlflow experiments with Azure Databricks, you need to first create an [Azure Databricks workspace and cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-databricks/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal). In your cluster, be sure to install the *azureml-mlflow* library from PyPi, to ensure that your cluster has access to the necessary functions and classes.

From here, import your experiment notebook, attach it to your Azure Databricks cluster and run your experiment. 

### Install libraries

To install libraries on your cluster, navigate to the **Libraries** tab and click **Install New**

 ![mlflow with azure machine learning diagram](./media/how-to-use-mlflow/azure-databricks-cluster-libraries.png)

In the **Package** field, type azureml-mlflow and then click install. Repeat this step as necessary to install other additional packages to your cluster for your experiment.

 ![mlflow with azure machine learning diagram](./media/how-to-use-mlflow/install-libraries.png)

### Set up your notebook and workspace

Once your cluster is set up, import your experiment notebook, open it and attach your cluster to it.

The following code should be in your experiment notebook. This code gets the details of your Azure subscription to instantiate your workspace. This code assumes you have an existing resource group and Azure Machine Learning workspace, otherwise you can [create them](how-to-manage-workspace.md). 

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.azureml
import azureml.mlflow
import azureml.core

from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.mlflow import get_portal_url

subscription_id = 'subscription_id'

# Azure Machine Learning resource group NOT the managed resource group
resource_group = 'resource_group_name' 

#Azure Machine Learning workspace name, NOT Azure Databricks workspace
workspace_name = 'workspace_name'  

# Instantiate Azure Machine Learning workspace
ws = Workspace.get(name=workspace_name,
                   subscription_id=subscription_id,
                   resource_group=resource_group)
```

#### Connect your Azure Databricks and Azure Machine Learning workspaces

On the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com), you can link your Azure Databricks (ADB) workspace to a new or existing Azure Machine Learning workspace. To do so, navigate to your ADB workspace and select the **Link Azure Machine Learning workspace** button on the bottom right. Linking your workspaces enables you to track your experiment data in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. 

### Link MLflow tracking to your workspace

After you instantiate your workspace, set the MLflow tracking URI. By doing so, you link the MLflow tracking to Azure Machine Learning workspace. After linking, all your experiments will land in the managed Azure Machine Learning tracking service.

#### Directly set MLflow Tracking in your notebook

```python
uri = ws.get_mlflow_tracking_uri()
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(uri)
```

In your training script, import mlflow to use the MLflow logging APIs, and start logging your run metrics. The following example, logs the epoch loss metric. 

```python
import mlflow 
mlflow.log_metric('epoch_loss', loss.item()) 
```

#### Automate setting MLflow Tracking

Instead of manually setting the tracking URI in every subsequent experiment notebook session on your clusters, do so automatically using this [Azure Machine Learning Tracking Cluster Init script](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/3ce779063b000e0670bdd1acc6bc3a4ee707ec13/how-to-use-azureml/azure-databricks/linking/README.md).

When configured correctly, you are able to see your MLflow tracking data in the Azure Machine Learning REST API and all clients, and in Azure Databricks via the MLflow user interface or by using the MLflow client.

## View metrics and artifacts in your workspace

The metrics and artifacts from MLflow logging are kept in your workspace. To view them anytime, navigate to your workspace and find the experiment by name in your workspace in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).  Or run the below code. 

```python
run.get_metrics()
ws.get_details()
```

## Deploy MLflow models as a web service

Deploying your MLflow experiments as an Azure Machine Learning web service allows you to leverage the Azure Machine Learning model management and data drift detection capabilities and apply them to your production models.

The following diagram demonstrates that with the MLflow deploy API you can deploy your existing MLflow models as an Azure Machine Learning web service, despite their frameworks--PyTorch, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, ONNX, etc., and manage your production models in your workspace.

![mlflow with azure machine learning diagram](./media/how-to-use-mlflow/mlflow-diagram-deploy.png)

### Log your model

Before you can deploy, be sure that your model is saved so you can reference it and its path location for deployment. In your training script, there should be code similar to the following [mlflow.sklearn.log_model()](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html) method, that saves your model to the specified outputs directory. 

```python
# change sklearn to pytorch, tensorflow, etc. based on your experiment's framework 
import mlflow.sklearn

# Save the model to the outputs directory for capture
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(regression_model, model_save_path)
```
>[!NOTE]
> Include the `conda_env` parameter to pass a dictionary representation of the dependencies and environment this model should be run in.

### Retrieve model from previous run

To retrieve the run, you need the run ID and the path in run history of where the model was saved. 

```python
# gets the list of runs for your experiment as an array
experiment_name = 'experiment-with-mlflow'
exp = ws.experiments[experiment_name]
runs = list(exp.get_runs())

# get the run ID and the path in run history
runid = runs[0].id
model_save_path = 'model'
```

### Deploy the model

Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to deploy the model as a web service.

First, specify the deployment configuration. Azure Container Instance (ACI) is a suitable choice for a quick dev-test deployment, while Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is suitable for scalable production deployments.

#### Deploy to ACI

Set up your deployment configuration with the [deploy_configuration()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.aciwebservice?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-configuration-cpu-cores-none--memory-gb-none--tags-none--properties-none--description-none--location-none--auth-enabled-none--ssl-enabled-none--enable-app-insights-none--ssl-cert-pem-file-none--ssl-key-pem-file-none--ssl-cname-none--dns-name-label-none-) method. You can also add tags and descriptions to help keep track of your web service.

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice, Webservice

# Configure 
aci_config = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores=1, 
                                                memory_gb=1, 
                                                tags={'method' : 'sklearn'}, 
                                                description='Diabetes model',
                                                location='eastus2')
```

Then, register and deploy the model by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK [deploy](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model.model?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-workspace--name--models--inference-config-none--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none--overwrite-false-) method. 

```python
(webservice,model) = mlflow.azureml.deploy( model_uri='runs:/{}/{}'.format(run.id, model_path),
                      workspace=ws,
                      model_name='sklearn-model', 
                      service_name='diabetes-model-1', 
                      deployment_config=aci_config, 
                      tags=None, mlflow_home=None, synchronous=True)

webservice.wait_for_deployment(show_output=True)
```
#### Deploy to AKS

To deploy to AKS, first create an AKS cluster. Create an AKS cluster using the [ComputeTarget.create()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.computetarget?view=azure-ml-py#create-workspace--name--provisioning-configuration-) method. It may take 20-25 minutes to create a new cluster.

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute, ComputeTarget

# Use the default configuration (can also provide parameters to customize)
prov_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration()

aks_name = 'aks-mlflow' 

# Create the cluster
aks_target = ComputeTarget.create(workspace=ws, 
                                  name=aks_name, 
                                  provisioning_configuration=prov_config)

aks_target.wait_for_completion(show_output = True)

print(aks_target.provisioning_state)
print(aks_target.provisioning_errors)
```
Set up your deployment configuration with the [deploy_configuration()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.aciwebservice?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-configuration-cpu-cores-none--memory-gb-none--tags-none--properties-none--description-none--location-none--auth-enabled-none--ssl-enabled-none--enable-app-insights-none--ssl-cert-pem-file-none--ssl-key-pem-file-none--ssl-cname-none--dns-name-label-none-) method. You can also add tags and descriptions to help keep track of your web service.

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice, AksWebservice

# Set the web service configuration (using default here with app insights)
aks_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration(enable_app_insights=True, compute_target_name='aks-mlflow')


Then, deploy the image by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK [deploy()](Then, register and deploy the model by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK [deploy](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model.model?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-workspace--name--models--inference-config-none--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none--overwrite-false-) method. 

```python
# Webservice creation using single command
from azureml.core.webservice import AksWebservice, Webservice
(webservice, model) = mlflow.azureml.deploy( model_uri='runs:/{}/{}'.format(run.id, model_path),
                      workspace=ws,
                      model_name='sklearn-model', 
                      service_name='my-aks', 
                      deployment_config=aks_config, 
                      tags=None, mlflow_home=None, synchronous=True)


webservice.wait_for_deployment()
```

The service deployment can take several minutes.

## Clean up resources

If you don't plan to use the logged metrics and artifacts in your workspace, the ability to delete them individually is currently unavailable. Instead, delete the resource group that contains the storage account and workspace, so you don't incur any charges:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.

   ![Delete in the Azure portal](./media/how-to-use-mlflow/delete-resources.png)

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter the resource group name. Then select **Delete**.
