# Troubleshoot environment image builds
Learn how to troubleshoot issues with Docker environment image builds and package installations.

## Prerequisites

* An **Azure subscription**. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).
* The [Azure Machine Learning SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?preserve-view=true&view=azure-ml-py).
* The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?preserve-view=true&view=azure-cli-latest).
* The [CLI extension for Azure Machine Learning](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md).
* To debug locally, you must have a working Docker installation on your local system.

## Docker Image Build Failures
 
For the majority of image build failures, the root cause can be found in the image build log.
You can find the image build log from the Azure Machine Learning portal (20\_image\_build\_log.txt) or from your ACR tasks runs logs
 
In most cases, it is easier to reproduce errors locally. Check the kind of error and try one of the following `setuptools`:

- Install conda dependency locally `conda install suspicious-dependency==X.Y.Z`
- Install pip dependency locally `pip install suspicious-dependency==X.Y.Z`
- Try to materialize the entire environment `conda create -f conda-specification.yml`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that platform and interpreter on your local compute match the ones on the remote. 

### Timeout 
 
Timeout issues can happen for various network issues:
- Low internet bandwidth
- Server issues
- Large dependency that can't be downloaded with the given conda or pip timeout settings
 
Messages similar to the below will indicate the issue:
 
```
('Connection broken: OSError("(104, \'ECONNRESET\')")', OSError("(104, 'ECONNRESET')"))
```
```
ReadTimeoutError("HTTPSConnectionPool(host='****', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=15)",)
```

Possible solutions:
 
- Try a different source for the dependency if available such as mirrors, blob storage, or other python feeds.
- Update conda or pip. If a custom docker file is used, update the timeout settings.
- Some pip versions have known issues. Consider adding a specific version of pip into environment dependencies .

### Package Not Found

This is the most common case for image build failures.

- Conda package could not be found
        ```
        ResolvePackageNotFound: 
          - not-existing-conda-package
        ```

- Specified pip package or version could not be found
        ```
        ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement invalid-pip-package (from versions: none)
        ERROR: No matching distribution found for invalid-pip-package
        ```

- Bad nested pip dependency
        ```
        ERROR: No matching distribution found for bad-backage==0.0 (from good-package==1.0)
        ```

Check the package exists on the specified sources. Use [pip search](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_search/) to verify pip dependencies.

`pip search azureml-core`

For conda dependencies, use [conda search](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/search.html).

`conda search conda-forge::numpy`

For more options:
- `pip search -h`
- `conda search -h`

#### Installer Notes

Make sure that the required distribution exists for the specified platform and Python interpreter version.

For pip dependencies, navigate to `https://pypi.org/project/[PROJECT NAME]/[VERSION]/#files` to see if required version is available. For example, https://pypi.org/project/azureml-core/1.11.0/#files

For conda dependencies, check package on the channel repository.
For channels maintained by Anaconda, Inc., check [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/).

### Pip Package Update

During install or update of a pip package the resolver may need to update an already installed package to satisfy the new requirements.
Uninstall can fail for various reasons related to pip version or the way the dependency was installed.
The most common scenario is that a dependency installed by conda could not be uninstalled by pip.
For this scenario, consider uninstalling the dependency using `conda remove mypackage`.

```
  Attempting uninstall: mypackage
    Found existing installation: mypackage X.Y.Z
ERROR: Cannot uninstall 'mypackage'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.
``` 
### Installer issues

Certain installer versions have issues in the package resolvers that can lead to a build failure.

If a custom base image or dockerfile is used, we recommend using conda version 4.5.4 or higher.

Pip package is required to install pip dependencies and if a version is not specified in the environment the latest version will be used.
We recommend using a known version of pip to avoid transient issues or breaking changes that can be caused by the latest version of the tool.

Consider pinning the pip version in your environment if you see any of the messages below:

`Warning: you have pip-installed dependencies in your environment file, but you do not list pip itself as one of your conda dependencies. Conda may not use the correct pip to install your packages, and they may end up in the wrong place. Please add an explicit pip dependency. I'm adding one for you, but still nagging you.`

`Pip subprocess error:
ERROR: THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE. If you have updated the package versions, update the hashes as well. Otherwise, examine the package contents carefully; someone may have tampered with them.`

In addition, pip installation can be stuck in an infinite loop if there are unresolvable conflicts in the dependencies. 
If working locally, downgrade the pip version to < 20.3. 
In a conda environment created from a YAML file, this issue will only be seen if conda-forge is highest priority channel. To mitigate the issue, explicitly specify pip < 20.3 (!=20.3 or =20.2.4 pin to other version) as a conda dependency in the conda specification file.

## Service Side Failures

### Unable to pull image from MCR/Address could not be resolved for Container Registry.
Possible issues:
- Path name to container registry may not be resolving correctly. Check that image names use double slashes and the direction of slashes on Linux vs Windows hosts is correct.
- If the ACR behind a Vnet is using a private endpoint in [an unsupported region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-link-overview#availability), configure the ACR behind a VNet using the service endpoint (Public access) from the portal and retry.
- After putting the ACR behind a VNet, ensure that the [ARM template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-enable-virtual-network#azure-container-registry) is run. This enables the workspace to communicate with the ACR instance.

### 401 error from workspace ACR
Resynchronize storage keys using [ws.sync_keys()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace?view=azure-ml-py#sync-keys--)

### Environment keeps throwing "Waiting for other Conda operations to finishâ€¦" Error
When an image build is ongoing, conda is locked by the SDK client. If the process crashed or was canceled incorrectly by the user - conda stays in the locked state. To resolve this, manually delete the lock file. 

### Custom docker image not in registry
Check if the [correct tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-environments#create-an-environment) is used and that `user_managed_dependencies = True`. `Environment.python.user_managed_dependencies = True` disables Conda and uses the user's installed packages.

### Common VNet issues

1. Check that the storage account, compute cluster, and Azure Container Registry are all in the same subnet of the virtual network.
2. When ACR is behind a VNet, it can't directly be used to build images. The compute cluster needs to be used to build images.
3. Storage may need to be placed behind a VNet when:
    - Using inferencing or private wheel
    - Seeing 403 (not authorized) service errors
    - Can't get image details from ACR/MCR

### Image build fails when trying to access network protected storage
- ACR tasks do not work behind the VNet. If the user has their ACR behind the VNet, they need to use the compute cluster to build an image.
- Storage should be behind VNet in order to be able to pull dependencies from it. 

### Cannot run experiments when storage has network security enabled
When using default Docker images and enabling user-managed dependencies, you must use the MicrosoftContainerRegistry and AzureFrontDoor.FirstParty [service tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-enable-virtual-network) to allowlist MCR and its dependencies.

 See [enabling VNET](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-enable-virtual-network#azure-container-registry) for more.

### Creating an ICM

When creating/assigning an ICM to Metastore, please include the CSS support ticket so that we can better understand the issue.
