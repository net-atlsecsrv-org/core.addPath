# Responsible Machine Learning (ML)

In this article, you'll learn what Responsible ML is and ways you can put it into practice with Azure Machine Learning.

Throughout the development and use of AI systems, trust must be at the core. Trust in the platform, process, and models. At Microsoft, Responsible ML encompasses the following values and principles:

- Understand machine learning models
  - Interpret and explain model behavior
  - Assess and mitigate model unfairness
- Protect people and their data
  - Prevent data exposure with differential privacy  
- Control the end-to-end machine learning process
  - Document the machine learning lifecycle with datasheets

As artificial intelligence and autonomous systems integrate more into the fabric of society, it's important to proactively make an effort to anticipate and mitigate the unintended consequences of these technologies.

## Interpret and explain model behavior

Hard to explain or black-box systems can be problematic because it makes it hard for stakeholders like system developers, regulators, users, and business decision makers to understand why systems make certain decisions. Some AI systems are more explainable than others and there's sometimes a tradeoff between a system with higher accuracy and one that is more explainable.

To build interpretable AI systems, use [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret), an open-source package built by Microsoft. [InterpretML can be used inside of Azure Machine Learning](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability.md) to [interpret and explain your machine learning models](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability-aml.md), including [automated machine learning models](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability-automl.md).

## Assess and mitigate model unfairness

As AI systems become more involved in the everyday decision-making of society, it's of extreme importance that these systems work well in providing fair outcomes for everyone.

Unfairness in AI systems can result in the following unintended consequences:

- Withholding opportunities, resources or information from individuals.
- Reinforcing biases and stereotypes.

Many aspects of fairness cannot be captured or represented by metrics. There are tools and practices that can improve fairness in the design and development of AI systems.

Two key steps in reducing unfairness in AI systems are assessment and mitigation. We recommend [FairLearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn), an open-source package that can assess and mitigate the potential unfairness of AI systems. To learn more about fairness and the FairLearn package, see the [Fairness in ML article](./concept-fairness-ml.md).

## Prevent data exposure with differential privacy

When data is used for analysis, it's important that the data remains private and confidential throughout its use. Differential privacy is a set of systems and practices that help keep the data of individuals safe and private.

In traditional scenarios, raw data is stored in files and databases. When users analyze data, they typically use the raw data. This is a concern because it might infringe on an individual's privacy. Differential privacy tries to deal with this problem by adding "noise" or randomness to the data so that users can't identify any individual data points.

Implementing differentially private systems is difficult. [WhiteNoise](https://github.com/opendifferentialprivacy/whitenoise-core) is an open-source project that contains different components for building global differentially private systems. To learn more about differential privacy and the WhiteNoise project, see the [preserve data privacy by using differential privacy and WhiteNoise](./concept-differential-privacy.md) article.

## Document the machine learning lifecycle with datasheets

Documenting the right information in the machine learning process is key to making responsible decisions at each stage. Datasheets are a way to document machine learning assets that are used and created as part of the machine learning lifecycle.

Models tend to be thought of as "black boxes" and often there is little information about them. Because machine learning systems are becoming more pervasive and are used for decision making, using datasheets is a step towards developing more responsible machine learning systems.

Some model information you might want to document as part of a datasheet:

- Intended use
- Model architecture
- Training data used
- Evaluation data used
- Training model performance metrics
- Fairness information.

See the following sample to learn how to use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to implement [datasheets for models](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOps/blob/master/pytorch_with_datasheet/model_with_datasheet.ipynb).
