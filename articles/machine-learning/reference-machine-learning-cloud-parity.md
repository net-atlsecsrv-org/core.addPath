# Azure Machine Learning sovereign cloud parity

Learn what Azure Machine Learning features are available in sovereign cloud regions. 

In the list of global Azure regions, there are several 'sovereign' regions that serve specific markets. For example, the Azure Government and the Azure China 21Vianet regions. Currently Azure Machine Learning is deployed into the following sovereign cloud regions:

* Azure Government regions **US-Arizona** and **US-Virginia**.
* Azure China 21Vianet region **China-East-2**.

> [!TIP]
> To differentiate between sovereign and non-sovereign regions, this article will use the term __public cloud__ to refer to non-sovereign regions.

We aim to provide maximum parity between our public cloud and sovereign regions. All Azure Machine Learning features will be available in these regions within **30 days of GA** (general availability) in our public cloud. We also enable a select number of preview features in these regions. Below display the current parity differences between our sovereign and public clouds.

### Additional Azure Government limitations

* For Azure Machine Learning compute instances, the ability to refresh a token lasting more than 24 hours is not available in Azure Government.
* Model Profiling does not support 4 CPUs in the US-Arizona region.   
* Sample notebooks may not work in Azure Government if it needs access to public data.
* IP addresses: The CLI command used in the [VNet and forced tunneling](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md#forced-tunneling) instructions does not return IP ranges. Use the [Azure IP ranges and service tags for Azure Government](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063) instead.
* For scheduled pipelines, we also provide a blob-based trigger mechanism. This mechanism is not supported for CMK workspaces. For enabling a blob-based trigger for CMK workspaces, you have to do additional setup. For more information, see [Trigger a run of a machine learning pipeline from a Logic App](how-to-trigger-published-pipeline.md).
* Firewalls: When using an Azure Government region, add the following additional hosts to your firewall setting:

    * For Arizona use: `usgovarizona.api.ml.azure.us`
    * For Virginia use: `usgovvirginia.api.ml.azure.us`
    * For both: `graph.windows.net`

### Additional Azure China limitations

* Azure China has limited VM SKU, especially for GPU SKU. It only has NCv3 family (V100).
* REST API Endpoints are different from global Azure. Use the following table to find the REST API endpoint for Azure China regions:

    | REST endpoint                 | Global Azure                                 | China-Government                           |
    |------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | Management plane | `https://management.azure.com/`              | `https://management.chinacloudapi.cn/`       |
    | Data plane       | `https://{location}.experiments.azureml.net` | `https://{location}.experiments.ml.azure.cn` |
    | Azure Active Directory              | `https://login.microsoftonline.com`          | `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn`             |

* Sample notebook may not work, if it needs access to public data.
* IP address ranges: The CLI command used in the [VNet forced tunneling](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md#forced-tunneling) instructions does not return IP ranges. Use the [Azure IP ranges and service tags for Azure China](https://www.microsoft.com//download/details.aspx?id=57062) instead.
* Azure Machine Learning compute instances preview is not supported in a workspace where Private Link is enabled for now, but CI will be supported in the next deployment for the service expansion to all AML regions.
