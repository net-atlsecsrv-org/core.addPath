# Use workspace behind Azure Firewall for Azure Machine Learning

In this article, learn how to configure Azure Firewall for use with an Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Azure Firewall can be used to control access to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and the public internet. If not configured correctly, the firewall can cause problems using your workspace. There are a variety of host names that are used both by the Azure Machine Learning workspace, which are described in this article.

## Network rules

On your firewall, create a network rule allowing traffic to and from the addresses in this article.

> [!TIP]
> When adding the network rule, set the __Protocol__ to any, and the ports to `*`.
>
> For more information on configuring Azure Firewall, see [Deploy and configure Azure Firewall](../firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal.md#configure-a-network-rule).

## Microsoft hosts

The hosts in this section are owned by Microsoft, and provide services required for the proper functioning of your workspace.

| **Host name** | **Purpose** |
| ---- | ---- |
| **\*.batchai.core.windows.net** | Training clusters |
| **ml.azure.com** | Azure Machine Learning studio |
| **default.exp-tas.com** | Used by the Azure Machine Learning studio |
| **\*.azureml.ms** | Used by Azure Machine Learning APIs |
| **\*.experiments.azureml.net** | Used by experiments running in Azure Machine Learning |
| **\*.modelmanagement.azureml.net** | Used to register and deploy models|
| **mlworkspace.azure.ai** | Used by the Azure portal when viewing a workspace |
| **\*.aether.ms** | Used when running Azure Machine Learning pipelines |
| **\*.instances.azureml.net** | Azure Machine Learning compute instances |
| **\*.instances.azureml.ms** | Azure Machine Learning compute instances when workspace has Private Link enabled |
| **windows.net** | Azure Blob Storage |
| **vault.azure.net** | Azure Key Vault |
| **azurecr.io** | Azure Container Registry |
| **mcr.microsoft.com** | Microsoft Container Registry for base docker images |

## Python hosts

The hosts in this section are used to install Python packages. They are required during development, training, and deployment. 

| **Host name** | **Purpose** |
| ---- | ---- |
| **anaconda.com** | Used when installing conda packages |
| **pypi.org** | Used when installing pip packages |


## R hosts

The hosts in this section are used to install R packages. They are required during development, training, and deployment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Internally, the R SDK for Azure Machine Learning uses Python packages. So you must also allow Python hosts through the firewall.

| **Host name** | **Purpose** |
| ---- | ---- |
| **cloud.r-project.org** | Used when installing CRAN packages. |
