# Customer intent: As an experienced Python developer, I need to make my data in Azure storage available to my remote compute to train my machine learning models.

# Connect to Azure storage services
[!INCLUDE [aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

In this article, learn how to connect to Azure storage services via Azure Machine Learning datastores. Datastores store connection information, like your subscription ID and token authorization in your [Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) associated with the workspace, so you can securely access your storage without having to hard code them in your scripts.

You can create datastores from [these Azure storage solutions](#matrix). For unsupported storage solutions, and to save data egress cost during machine learning experiments, we recommend that you [move your data](#move) to supported Azure storage solutions. 

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).

- An Azure storage account with an [Azure blob container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) or [Azure file share](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction).

- The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py), or access to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/).

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace.
  
  Either [create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md) or use an existing one via the Python SDK. Import the `Workspace` and `Datastore` class, and load your subscription information from the file `config.json` using the function `from_config()`. This looks for the JSON file in the current directory by default, but you can also specify a path parameter to point to the file using `from_config(path="your/file/path")`.

   ```Python
   import azureml.core
   from azureml.core import Workspace, Datastore
        
   ws = Workspace.from_config()
   ```

### Storage guidance

We recommend creating a datastore for an [Azure Blob container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction). Both standard and premium storage are available for blobs. Although premium storage is more expensive, its faster throughput speeds might improve the speed of your training runs, particularly if you train against a large dataset. For information about the cost of storage accounts, see the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=machine-learning-service).

[Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json) is built on top of Azure Blob storage and designed for enterprise big data analytics. A fundamental part of Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the addition of a [hierarchical namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace) to Blob storage. The hierarchical namespace organizes objects/files into a hierarchy of directories for efficient data access.

When you create a workspace, an Azure blob container and an Azure file share are automatically registered to the workspace. They're named `workspaceblobstore` and `workspacefilestore`, respectively. `workspaceblobstore` is used to store workspace artifacts and your machine learning experiment logs. `workspacefilestore` is used to store notebooks and R scripts authorized via [compute instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance#accessing-files). The `workspaceblobstore` container is set as the default datastore.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Machine Learning designer (preview) will create a datastore named **azureml_globaldatasets** automatically when you open a sample in the designer homepage. This datastore only contains sample datasets. Please **do not** use this datastore for any confidential data access!
> ![Auto-created datastore for designer sample datasets](media/how-to-access-data/datastore-designer-sample.png)

<a name="access"></a>

## Create and register datastores

When you register an Azure storage solution as a datastore, you automatically create and register that datastore to a specific workspace. You can create and register datastores to a workspace by using the Python SDK or Azure Machine Learning studio.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> As part of the initial datastore create and register process, Azure Machine Learning validates that the underlying storage service exists and that the user provided principal (username, service principal or SAS token) has access to that storage. For Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 1 and 2 datastores, however,  this validation  happens later, when data access methods like [`from_files()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.dataset_factory.filedatasetfactory?view=azure-ml-py) or [`from_delimited_files()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.dataset_factory.tabulardatasetfactory?view=azure-ml-py#from-parquet-files-path--validate-true--include-path-false--set-column-types-none--partition-format-none-) are called. 
<br><br>
After datastore creation, this validation is only performed for methods that require access to the underlying storage container, **not** each time datastore objects are retrieved. For example, validation happens if you want to download files from your datastore; but if you just want to change your default datastore, then validation does not happen.

### Python SDK

All the register methods are on the [`Datastore`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.datastore(class)?view=azure-ml-py) class and have the form `register_azure_*`.

You can find the information that you need to populate the `register()` method on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
Select **Storage Accounts** on the left pane, and choose the storage account that you want to register. The **Overview** page provides information such as the account name, container, and file share name. 

* For authentication items, like account key or SAS token, go to **Account Keys** on the **Settings** pane. 

* For service principal items like, tenant ID and client ID, go to your **App registrations** and select which app you want to use. Its corresponding **Overview** page will contain these items.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your storage account is in a virtual network, only creation of Blob, File share, ADLS Gen 1 and ADLS Gen 2 datastores **via the SDK** is supported. To grant your workspace access to your storage account, set the parameter `grant_workspace_access` to `True`.

The following examples show how to register an Azure blob container, an Azure file share, and Azure Data Lake Storage Generation 2 as a datastore. For other storage services, please see the [reference documentation for the applicable `register_azure_*` methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.datastore.datastore?view=azure-ml-py#methods).

#### Blob container

To register an Azure blob container as a datastore, use [`register_azure_blob-container()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.datastore(class)?view=azure-ml-py#register-azure-blob-container-workspace--datastore-name--container-name--account-name--sas-token-none--account-key-none--protocol-none--endpoint-none--overwrite-false--create-if-not-exists-false--skip-validation-false--blob-cache-timeout-none--grant-workspace-access-false--subscription-id-none--resource-group-none-).

The following code creates and registers the `blob_datastore_name` datastore to the `ws` workspace. This datastore accesses the `my-container-name` blob container on the `my-account-name` storage account, by using the provided account key.

```Python
blob_datastore_name='azblobsdk' # Name of the datastore to workspace
container_name=os.getenv("BLOB_CONTAINER", "<my-container-name>") # Name of Azure blob container
account_name=os.getenv("BLOB_ACCOUNTNAME", "<my-account-name>") # Storage account name
account_key=os.getenv("BLOB_ACCOUNT_KEY", "<my-account-key>") # Storage account key

blob_datastore = Datastore.register_azure_blob_container(workspace=ws, 
                                                         datastore_name=blob_datastore_name, 
                                                         container_name=container_name, 
                                                         account_name=account_name,
                                                         account_key=account_key)
```

#### File share

To register an Azure file share as a datastore, use [`register_azure_file_share()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.datastore(class)?view=azure-ml-py#register-azure-file-share-workspace--datastore-name--file-share-name--account-name--sas-token-none--account-key-none--protocol-none--endpoint-none--overwrite-false--create-if-not-exists-false--skip-validation-false-). 

The following code creates and registers the `file_datastore_name` datastore to the `ws` workspace. This datastore accesses the `my-fileshare-name` file share on the `my-account-name` storage account, by using the provided account key.

```Python
file_datastore_name='azfilesharesdk' # Name of the datastore to workspace
file_share_name=os.getenv("FILE_SHARE_CONTAINER", "<my-fileshare-name>") # Name of Azure file share container
account_name=os.getenv("FILE_SHARE_ACCOUNTNAME", "<my-account-name>") # Storage account name
account_key=os.getenv("FILE_SHARE_ACCOUNT_KEY", "<my-account-key>") # Storage account key

file_datastore = Datastore.register_azure_file_share(workspace=ws,
                                                     datastore_name=file_datastore_name, 
                                                     file_share_name=file_share_name, 
                                                     account_name=account_name,
                                                     account_key=account_key)
```

#### Azure Data Lake Storage Generation 2

For an Azure Data Lake Storage Generation 2 (ADLS Gen 2) datastore, use [register_azure_data_lake_gen2()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.datastore.datastore?view=azure-ml-py#register-azure-data-lake-gen2-workspace--datastore-name--filesystem--account-name--tenant-id--client-id--client-secret--resource-url-none--authority-url-none--protocol-none--endpoint-none--overwrite-false-) to register a credential datastore connected to an Azure DataLake Gen 2 storage with [service principal permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). In order to utilize your service principal you need to [register your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) and grant the service principal with the right data access. Learn more about [access control set up for ADLS Gen 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control). 

The following code creates and registers the `adlsgen2_datastore_name` datastore to the `ws` workspace. This datastore accesses the file system `test` on the `account_name` storage account, by using the provided service principal credentials.

```python 
adlsgen2_datastore_name = 'adlsgen2datastore'

subscription_id=os.getenv("ADL_SUBSCRIPTION", "<my_subscription_id>") # subscription id of ADLS account
resource_group=os.getenv("ADL_RESOURCE_GROUP", "<my_resource_group>") # resource group of ADLS account

account_name=os.getenv("ADLSGEN2_ACCOUNTNAME", "<my_account_name>") # ADLS Gen2 account name
tenant_id=os.getenv("ADLSGEN2_TENANT", "<my_tenant_id>") # tenant id of service principal
client_id=os.getenv("ADLSGEN2_CLIENTID", "<my_client_id>") # client id of service principal
client_secret=os.getenv("ADLSGEN2_CLIENT_SECRET", "<my_client_secret>") # the secret of service principal

adlsgen2_datastore = Datastore.register_azure_data_lake_gen2(workspace=ws,
                                                             datastore_name=adlsgen2_datastore_name,
                                                             account_name=account_name, # ADLS Gen2 account name
                                                             filesystem='test', # ADLS Gen2 filesystem
                                                             tenant_id=tenant_id, # tenant id of service principal
                                                             client_id=client_id, # client id of service principal
                                                             client_secret=client_secret) # the secret of service principal
```

### Azure Machine Learning studio 

Create a new datastore in a few steps in Azure Machine Learning studio:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your storage account is in a virtual network, only creation of datastores [via the SDK](#python-sdk) is supported. 

1. Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/).
1. Select **Datastores** on the left pane under **Manage**.
1. Select **+ New datastore**.
1. Complete the form for a new datastore. The form intelligently updates itself based on your selections for Azure storage type and authentication type.
  
You can find the information that you need to populate the form on the  [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Storage Accounts** on the left pane, and choose the storage account that you want to register. The **Overview** page provides information such as the account name, container, and file share name. 

* For authentication items, like account key or SAS token, go to **Account Keys** on the **Settings** pane. 

* For service principal items like, tenant ID and client ID, go to your **App registrations** and select which app you want to use. Its corresponding **Overview** page will contain these items. 

The following example demonstrates what the form looks like when you create an Azure blob datastore: 
    
![Form for a new datastore](media/how-to-access-data/new-datastore-form.png)


<a name="get"></a>

## Get datastores from your workspace

To get a specific datastore registered in the current workspace, use the [`get()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.datastore(class)?view=azure-ml-py#get-workspace--datastore-name-) static method on the `Datastore` class:

```Python
# Get a named datastore from the current workspace
datastore = Datastore.get(ws, datastore_name='your datastore name')
```
To get the list of datastores registered with a given workspace, you can use the [`datastores`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace%28class%29?view=azure-ml-py#datastores) property on a workspace object:

```Python
# List all datastores registered in the current workspace
datastores = ws.datastores
for name, datastore in datastores.items():
    print(name, datastore.datastore_type)
```

To get the workspace's default datastore, use this line:

```Python
datastore = ws.get_default_datastore()
```

<a name="up-and-down"></a>
## Upload and download data

The [`upload()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.azure_storage_datastore.azureblobdatastore?view=azure-ml-py#upload-src-dir--target-path-none--overwrite-false--show-progress-true-) and [`download()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.azure_storage_datastore.azureblobdatastore?view=azure-ml-py#download-target-path--prefix-none--overwrite-false--show-progress-true-) methods described in the following examples are specific to, and operate identically for, the [AzureBlobDatastore](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.azure_storage_datastore.azureblobdatastore?view=azure-ml-py) and [AzureFileDatastore](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.azure_storage_datastore.azurefiledatastore?view=azure-ml-py) classes.

### Upload

Upload either a directory or individual files to the datastore by using the Python SDK:

```Python
datastore.upload(src_dir='your source directory',
                 target_path='your target path',
                 overwrite=True,
                 show_progress=True)
```

The `target_path` parameter specifies the location in the file share (or blob container) to upload. It defaults to `None`, so the data is uploaded to root. If `overwrite=True`, any existing data at `target_path` is overwritten.

You can also upload a list of individual files to the datastore via the `upload_files()` method.

### Download

Download data from a datastore to your local file system:

```Python
datastore.download(target_path='your target path',
                   prefix='your prefix',
                   show_progress=True)
```

The `target_path` parameter is the location of the local directory to download the data to. To specify a path to the folder in the file share (or blob container) to download, provide that path to `prefix`. If `prefix` is `None`, all the contents of your file share (or blob container) will be downloaded.

<a name="train"></a>

## Access your data during training

To interact with data in your datastores or to package your data into a consumable object for machine learning tasks, like training, [create an Azure Machine Learning dataset](how-to-create-register-datasets.md). Datasets provide functions that load tabular data into a pandas or Spark DataFrame. Datasets also provide the ability to download or mount files of any format from Azure Blob storage, Azure Files, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. [Learn more about how to train with datasets](how-to-train-with-datasets.md).

### Accessing source code during training

Azure Blob storage has higher throughput speeds than an Azure file share and will scale to large numbers of jobs started in parallel. For this reason, we recommend configuring your runs to use Blob storage for transferring source code files.

The following code example specifies in the run configuration which blob datastore to use for source code transfers.

```python 
# workspaceblobstore is the default blob storage
run_config.source_directory_data_store = "workspaceblobstore" 
```

## Access data during scoring

Azure Machine Learning provides several ways to use your models for scoring. Some of these methods don't provide access to datastores. Use the following table to understand which methods allow you to access datastores during scoring:

| Method | Datastore access | Description |
| ----- | :-----: | ----- |
| [Batch prediction](how-to-use-parallel-run-step.md) | ✔ | Make predictions on large quantities of data asynchronously. |
| [Web service](how-to-deploy-and-where.md) | &nbsp; | Deploy models as a web service. |
| [Azure IoT Edge module](how-to-deploy-and-where.md) | &nbsp; | Deploy models to IoT Edge devices. |

For situations where the SDK doesn't provide access to datastores, you might be able to create custom code by using the relevant Azure SDK to access the data. For example, the [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python) is a client library that you can use to access data stored in blobs or files.

## Move data to supported Azure storage solutions

Azure Machine Learning supports accessing data from Azure Blob storage, Azure Files, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. If you're using unsupported storage, we recommend that you move your data to supported Azure storage solutions by using [Azure Data Factory and these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-copy-data-tool). Moving data to supported storage can help you save data egress costs during machine learning experiments. 

Azure Data Factory provides efficient and resilient data transfer with more than 80 prebuilt connectors at no additional cost. These connectors include Azure data services, on-premises data sources, Amazon S3 and Redshift, and Google BigQuery.
