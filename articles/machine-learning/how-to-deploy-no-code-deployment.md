# (Preview) No-code model deployment

No-code model deployment is currently in preview and supports the following machine learning frameworks:

## TensorFlow SavedModel format
TensorFlow models need to be registered in **SavedModel format** to work with no-code model deployment.

See [this link](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) for information on how to create a SavedModel.

We support any TensorFlow version that is listed under "Tags" at the [TensorFlow Serving DockerHub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/serving/tags).

```python
from azureml.core import Model

model = Model.register(workspace=ws,
                       model_name='flowers',                        # Name of the registered model in your workspace.
                       model_path='./flowers_model',                # Local Tensorflow SavedModel folder to upload and register as a model.
                       model_framework=Model.Framework.TENSORFLOW,  # Framework used to create the model.
                       model_framework_version='1.14.0',            # Version of Tensorflow used to create the model.
                       description='Flowers model')

service_name = 'tensorflow-flower-service'
service = Model.deploy(ws, service_name, [model])
```

## ONNX models

ONNX model registration and deployment is supported for any ONNX inference graph. Preprocess and postprocess steps are not currently supported.

Here is an example of how to register and deploy an MNIST ONNX model:

```python
from azureml.core import Model

model = Model.register(workspace=ws,
                       model_name='mnist-sample',                  # Name of the registered model in your workspace.
                       model_path='mnist-model.onnx',              # Local ONNX model to upload and register as a model.
                       model_framework=Model.Framework.ONNX ,      # Framework used to create the model.
                       model_framework_version='1.3',              # Version of ONNX used to create the model.
                       description='Onnx MNIST model')

service_name = 'onnx-mnist-service'
service = Model.deploy(ws, service_name, [model])
```

To score a model, see [Consume an Azure Machine Learning model deployed as a web service](./how-to-consume-web-service.md). Many ONNX projects use protobuf files to compactly store training and validation data, which can make it difficult to know what the data format expected by the service. As a model developer, you should document for your developers:

* Input format (JSON or binary)
* Input data shape and type (for example, an array of floats of shape [100,100,3])
* Domain information (for instance, for an image, the color space, component order, and whether the values are normalized)

If you're using Pytorch, [Exporting models from PyTorch to ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/PytorchOnnxExport.ipynb) has the details on conversion and limitations. 

## Scikit-learn models

No code model deployment is supported for all built-in scikit-learn model types.

Here is an example of how to register and deploy a sklearn model with no extra code:

```python
from azureml.core import Model
from azureml.core.resource_configuration import ResourceConfiguration

model = Model.register(workspace=ws,
                       model_name='my-sklearn-model',                # Name of the registered model in your workspace.
                       model_path='./sklearn_regression_model.pkl',  # Local file to upload and register as a model.
                       model_framework=Model.Framework.SCIKITLEARN,  # Framework used to create the model.
                       model_framework_version='0.19.1',             # Version of scikit-learn used to create the model.
                       resource_configuration=ResourceConfiguration(cpu=1, memory_in_gb=0.5),
                       description='Ridge regression model to predict diabetes progression.',
                       tags={'area': 'diabetes', 'type': 'regression'})
                       
service_name = 'my-sklearn-service'
service = Model.deploy(ws, service_name, [model])
```

> [!NOTE]
> Models that support predict_proba will use that method by default. To override this to use predict you can modify the POST body as below:

```python
import json


input_payload = json.dumps({
    'data': [
        [ 0.03807591,  0.05068012,  0.06169621, 0.02187235, -0.0442235,
         -0.03482076, -0.04340085, -0.00259226, 0.01990842, -0.01764613]
    ],
    'method': 'predict'  # If you have a classification model, the default behavior is to run 'predict_proba'.
})

output = service.run(input_payload)

print(output)
```

> [!NOTE]
> These dependencies are included in the prebuilt scikit-learn inference container:

```yaml
    - dill
    - azureml-defaults
    - inference-schema[numpy-support]
    - scikit-learn
    - numpy
    - joblib
    - pandas
    - scipy
    - sklearn_pandas
```
