# Tutorial: Train your first ML model

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

This tutorial is **part two of a two-part tutorial series**. In the previous tutorial, you [created a workspace and chose a development environment](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md). In this tutorial, you learn the foundational design patterns in Azure Machine Learning, and train a simple scikit-learn model based on the diabetes data set. After completing this tutorial, you will have the practical knowledge of the SDK to scale up to developing more-complex experiments and workflows.

In this tutorial, you learn the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Connect your workspace and create an experiment
> * Load data and train scikit-learn models
> * View training results in the studio
> * Retrieve the best model

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is to run part one of this tutorial, [Setup environment and workspace](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md).

In this part of the tutorial, you run the code in the sample Jupyter notebook *tutorials/create-first-ml-experiment/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train.ipynb* opened at the end of part one. This article walks through the same code that is in the notebook.

## Open the notebook

1. Sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/).

1. Open the **tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train.ipynb** in your folder as shown in [part one](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md#open).

Do **not** create a *new* notebook in the Jupyter interface! The notebook *tutorials/create-first-ml-experiment/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train.ipynb* is inclusive of **all code and data needed** 
for this tutorial.

## Connect workspace and create experiment

<!-- nbstart https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/master/tutorials/create-first-ml-experiment/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train.ipynb -->

> [!TIP]
> Contents of _tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train.ipynb_. 
> Switch to the Jupyter notebook now if you want to read along as you run the code. 
> To run a single code cell in a notebook, click the code cell and hit **Shift+Enter**. Or, run the entire notebook by choosing **Run all** from the top toolbar.


Import the `Workspace` class, and load your subscription information from the file `config.json` using the function `from_config().` This looks for the JSON file in the current directory by default, but you can also specify a path parameter to point to the file using `from_config(path="your/file/path")`. If you are running this notebook in a cloud notebook server in your workspace, the file is automatically in the root directory.

If the following code asks for additional authentication, simply paste the link in a browser and enter the authentication token. In addition, if you have more than one tenant linked to your user, you will need to add the following lines:

```python
from azureml.core.authentication import InteractiveLoginAuthentication
interactive_auth = InteractiveLoginAuthentication(tenant_id="your-tenant-id")
```

For more information on authentication, see [Authentication in Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/aml-notebook-auth)


```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

Now create an experiment in your workspace. An experiment is another foundational cloud resource that represents a collection of trials (individual model runs). In this tutorial you use the experiment to create runs and track your model training in the Azure Machine Learning studio. Parameters include your workspace reference, and a string name for the experiment.


```python
from azureml.core import Experiment
experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name="diabetes-experiment")
```

## Load data and prepare for training

For this tutorial, you use the diabetes data set, which uses features like age, gender, and BMI to predict diabetes disease progression. Load the data from the [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/open-datasets/) class, and split it into training and test sets using `train_test_split()`. This function segregates the data so the model has unseen data to use for testing following training.


```python
from azureml.opendatasets import Diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x_df = Diabetes.get_tabular_dataset().to_pandas_dataframe().dropna()
y_df = x_df.pop("Y")

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_df, y_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=66)
```

## Train a model

Training a simple scikit-learn model can easily be done locally for small-scale training, but when training many iterations with dozens of different feature permutations and hyperparameter settings, it is easy to lose track of what models you've trained and how you trained them. The following design pattern shows how to leverage the SDK to easily keep track of your training in the cloud.

Build a script that trains ridge models in a loop through different hyperparameter alpha values.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.externals import joblib
import math

alphas = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]

for alpha in alphas:
    run = experiment.start_logging()
    run.log("alpha_value", alpha)
    
    model = Ridge(alpha=alpha)
    model.fit(X=X_train, y=y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X=X_test)
    rmse = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred))
    run.log("rmse", rmse)
    
    model_name = "model_alpha_" + str(alpha) + ".pkl"
    filename = "outputs/" + model_name
    
    joblib.dump(value=model, filename=filename)
    run.upload_file(name=model_name, path_or_stream=filename)
    run.complete()
```

The above code accomplishes the following:

1. For each alpha hyperparameter value in the `alphas` array, a new run is created within the experiment. The alpha value is logged to differentiate between each run.
1. In each run, a Ridge model is instantiated, trained, and used to run predictions. The root-mean-squared-error is calculated for the actual versus predicted values, and then logged to the run. At this point the run has metadata attached for both the alpha value and the rmse accuracy.
1. Next, the model for each run is serialized and uploaded to the run. This allows you to download the model file from the run in the studio.
1. At the end of each iteration the run is completed by calling `run.complete()`.

After the training has completed, call the `experiment` variable to fetch a link to the experiment in the studio.

```python
experiment
```

<table style="width:100%"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Workspace</th><th>Report Page</th><th>Docs Page</th></tr><tr><td>diabetes-experiment</td><td>your-workspace-name</td><td>Link to Azure Machine Learning studio</td><td>Link to Documentation</td></tr></table>

## View training results in studio

Following the **Link to Azure Machine Learning studio** takes you to the main experiment page. Here you see all the individual runs in the experiment. Any custom-logged values (`alpha_value` and `rmse`, in this case) become fields for each run, and also become available for the charts. To plot a new chart with a logged metric, click on 'Add chart' and select the metric you would like to plot.

When training models at scale over hundreds and thousands of separate runs, this page makes it easy to see every model you trained, specifically how they were trained, and how your unique metrics have changed over time.

Select a run number link in the `RUN NUMBER` column to see the page for an individual run. The default tab **Details** shows you more-detailed information on each run. Navigate to the **Outputs + logs** tab, and you see the `.pkl` file for the model that was uploaded to the run during each training iteration. Here you can download the model file, rather than having to retrain it manually.

## Get the best model

In addition to being able to download model files from the experiment in the studio, you can also download them programmatically. The following code iterates through each run in the experiment, and accesses both the logged run metrics and the run details (which contains the run_id). This keeps track of the best run, in this case the run with the lowest root-mean-squared-error.

```python
minimum_rmse_runid = None
minimum_rmse = None

for run in experiment.get_runs():
    run_metrics = run.get_metrics()
    run_details = run.get_details()
    # each logged metric becomes a key in this returned dict
    run_rmse = run_metrics["rmse"]
    run_id = run_details["runId"]
    
    if minimum_rmse is None:
        minimum_rmse = run_rmse
        minimum_rmse_runid = run_id
    else:
        if run_rmse < minimum_rmse:
            minimum_rmse = run_rmse
            minimum_rmse_runid = run_id

print("Best run_id: " + minimum_rmse_runid)
print("Best run_id rmse: " + str(minimum_rmse))    
```
```output
Best run_id: 864f5ce7-6729-405d-b457-83250da99c80
Best run_id rmse: 57.234760283951765
```

Use the best run ID to fetch the individual run using the `Run` constructor along with the experiment object. Then call `get_file_names()` to see all the files available for download from this run. In this case, you only uploaded one file for each run during training.


```python
from azureml.core import Run
best_run = Run(experiment=experiment, run_id=minimum_rmse_runid)
print(best_run.get_file_names())
```

```output
['model_alpha_0.1.pkl']
```

Call `download()` on the run object, specifying the model file name to download. By default this function downloads to the current directory.


```python
best_run.download_file(name="model_alpha_0.1.pkl")
```
<!-- nbend -->

## Clean up resources
