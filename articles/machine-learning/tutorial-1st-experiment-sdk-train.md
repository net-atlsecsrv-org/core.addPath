# Tutorial: Train your first machine learning model (part 2 of 3)

This tutorial shows you how to train a machine learning model in Azure Machine Learning.

This tutorial is *part 2 of a three-part tutorial series* in which you learn the fundamentals of Azure Machine Learning and complete jobs-based machine learning tasks in Azure. This tutorial builds on the work that you completed in [Part 1: Run "Hello world!"](tutorial-1st-experiment-hello-world.md) of the series.

In this tutorial, you take the next step by submitting a script that trains a machine learning model. This example will help you understand how Azure Machine Learning eases consistent behavior between local debugging and remote runs.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a training script.
> * Use Conda to define an Azure Machine Learning environment.
> * Create a control script.
> * Understand Azure Machine Learning classes (`Environment`, `Run`, `Metrics`).
> * Submit and run your training script.
> * View your code output in the cloud.
> * Log metrics to Azure Machine Learning.
> * View your metrics in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [part 1](tutorial-1st-experiment-hello-world.md) of the series.

## Create training scripts

First you define the neural network architecture in a *model.py* file. All your training code will go into the `src` subdirectory, including *model.py*.

The training code is taken from [this introductory example](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) from PyTorch. Note that the Azure Machine Learning concepts apply to any machine learning code, not just PyTorch.

1. Create a *model.py* file in the **src** subfolder. Copy this code into the file:

    :::code language="python" source="~/MachineLearningNotebooks/tutorials/get-started-day1/IDE-users/src/model.py":::

1. On the toolbar, select **Save** to save the file.  Close the tab if you wish.

1. Next, define the training script, also in the **src** subfolder. This script downloads the CIFAR10 dataset by using PyTorch `torchvision.dataset` APIs, sets up the network defined in *model.py*, and trains it for two epochs by using standard SGD and cross-entropy loss.

    Create a *train.py* script in the **src** subfolder:

     ```python
    import torch
    import torch.optim as optim
    import torchvision
    import torchvision.transforms as transforms
    
    from model import Net
    
    # download CIFAR 10 data
    trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(
        root="../data",
        train=True,
        download=True,
        transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),
    )
    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        trainset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True, num_workers=2
    )
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    
        # define convolutional network
        net = Net()
    
        # set up pytorch loss /  optimizer
        criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
    
        # train the network
        for epoch in range(2):
    
            running_loss = 0.0
            for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
                # unpack the data
                inputs, labels = data
    
                # zero the parameter gradients
                optimizer.zero_grad()
    
                # forward + backward + optimize
                outputs = net(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
    
                # print statistics
                running_loss += loss.item()
                if i % 2000 == 1999:
                    loss = running_loss / 2000
                    print(f"epoch={epoch + 1}, batch={i + 1:5}: loss {loss:.2f}")
                    running_loss = 0.0
    
        print("Finished Training")
    ```

1. You now have the following folder structure:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train/directory-structure.png" alt-text="Directory structure shows train.py in src subdirectory":::
    

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [I created the training scripts](?success=create-scripts#test-local) [I ran into an issue](https://www.research.net/r/7CTJQQN?issue=create-scripts)


## <a name="test-local"></a> Test locally

Select **Save and run script in terminal** to run the *train.py* script directly on the compute instance.

After the script completes, select **Refresh** above the file folders. You'll see the new data folder called **get-started/data** Expand this folder to view the downloaded data.

## <a name="create-local"></a> Create the control script

The difference between the following control script and the one that you used to submit "Hello world!" is that you add a couple of extra lines to set the environment.

Create a new Python file in the **get-started** folder called `run-pytorch.py`:

```python
# run-pytorch.py
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core import Experiment
from azureml.core import Environment
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='day1-experiment-train')
    config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='./src',
                             script='train.py',
                             compute_target='cpu-cluster')

    # use curated pytorch environment 
    env = ws.environments['AzureML-PyTorch-1.6-CPU']
    config.run_config.environment = env

    run = experiment.submit(config)

    aml_url = run.get_portal_url()
    print(aml_url)
```

### Understand the code changes

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `env = ...`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Azure Machine Learning provides the concept of an [environment](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment) to represent a reproducible, versioned Python environment for running experiments. Here you use one of the [curated environments](how-to-use-environments.md#use-a-curated-environment).  It's also easy to create an environment from a local Conda or pip environment.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `config.run_config.environment = env`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Adds the environment to [ScriptRunConfig](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.scriptrunconfig).

## <a name="submit"></a> Submit the run to Azure Machine Learning

Select **Save and run script in terminal** to run the *run-pytorch.py* script.

>[!NOTE] 
> The first time you run this script, Azure Machine Learning will build a new Docker image from your PyTorch environment. The whole run might take 3 to 4 minutes to complete. 
>
> You can see the Docker build logs in the Azure Machine Learning studio. Follow the link to the studio, select the **Outputs + logs** tab, and then select `20_image_build_log.txt`.
>
> This image will be reused in future runs to make them run much quicker.

After your image is built, select `70_driver_log.txt` to see the output of your training script.

## <a name="log"></a> Log training metrics

Now that you have a model training in Azure Machine Learning, start tracking some performance metrics.

The current training script prints metrics to the terminal. Azure Machine Learning provides a mechanism for logging metrics with more functionality. By adding a few lines of code, you gain the ability to visualize metrics in the studio and to compare metrics between multiple runs.

### Modify *train.py* to include logging

1. Modify your *train.py* script to include two more lines of code:

  :::code language="python" source="~/MachineLearningNotebooks/tutorials/get-started-day1/code/pytorch-cifar10-train-with-logging/train.py":::

2. **Save** this file, then close the tab if you wish.

#### Understand the additional two lines of code

In *train.py*, you access the run object from _within_ the training script itself by using the `Run.get_context()` method and use it to log metrics:

```python
# in train.py
run = Run.get_context()

...

run.log('loss', loss)
```

Metrics in Azure Machine Learning are:

- Organized by experiment and run, so it's easy to keep track of and
compare metrics.
- Equipped with a UI so you can visualize training performance in the studio.
- Designed to scale, so you keep these benefits even as you run hundreds of experiments.

### <a name="submit-again"></a> Submit the run to Azure Machine Learning

Select the tab for the *run-pytorch.py* script, then select **Save and run script in terminal** to re-run the *run-pytorch.py* script. 

This time when you visit the studio, go to the **Metrics** tab where you can now see live updates on the model training loss! It may take a 1 to 2  minutes before the training begins.

## Next steps

In this session, you upgraded from a basic "Hello world!" script to a more realistic training script that required a specific Python environment to run. You saw how to take a local Conda environment to the cloud with Azure Machine Learning environments. Finally, you
saw how in a few lines of code you can log metrics to Azure Machine Learning.

There are other ways to create Azure Machine Learning environments, including [from a pip requirements.txt](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment#from-pip-requirements-name--file-path-) file or [from an existing local Conda environment](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.environment.environment#from-existing-conda-environment-name--conda-environment-name-).

In the next session, you'll see how to work with data in Azure Machine Learning by uploading the CIFAR10 dataset to Azure.
