# Enterprise security for Azure Machine Learning

In this article, you'll learn about security features available for Azure Machine Learning.

When you use a cloud service, a best practice is to restrict access to only the users who need it. Start by understanding the authentication and authorization model used by the service. You might also want to restrict network access or securely join resources in your on-premises network with the cloud. Data encryption is also vital, both at rest and while data moves between services. Finally, you need to be able to monitor the service and produce an audit log of all activity.

## Authentication

Multi-factor authentication is supported if Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is configured to use it. Here's the authentication process:

1. The client signs in to Azure AD and gets an Azure Resource Manager token.  Users and service principals are fully supported.
1. The client presents the token to Azure Resource Manager and to all Azure Machine Learning.
1. The Machine Learning service provides a Machine Learning service token to the user compute target (for example, Machine Learning Compute). This token is used by the user compute target to call back into the Machine Learning service after the run is complete. Scope is limited to the workspace.

[![Authentication in Azure Machine Learning](media/concept-enterprise-security/authentication.png)](media/concept-enterprise-security/authentication-expanded.png#lightbox)

See the [Set up authentication](how-to-setup-authentication.md) how-to for detailed examples and instructions on setting up authentication, including service principal authentication for automated workflows.

### Authentication for web service deployment

Azure Machine Learning supports two forms of authentication for web services: key and token. Each web service can enable only one form of authentication at a time.

|Authentication method|Description|Azure Container Instances|AKS|
|---|---|---|---|
|Key|Keys are static and do not need to be refreshed. Keys can be regenerated manually.|Disabled by default| Enabled by default|
|Token|Tokens expire after a specified time period and need to be refreshed.| Not available| Disabled by default |

See the [web-service authentication section](how-to-setup-authentication.md#web-service-authentication) for code examples on authenticating to web-services in Azure Machine Learning.

## Authorization

You can create multiple workspaces, and each workspace can be shared by multiple people. When you share a workspace, you can control access to it by assigning these roles to users:

* Owner
* Contributor
* Reader

The following table lists some of the major Azure Machine Learning operations and the roles that can perform them:

| Azure Machine Learning operation | Owner | Contributor | Reader |
| ---- |:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Create workspace | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Share workspace | ✓ | |  |
| Upgrade workspace to Enterprise edition | ✓ | |
| Create compute target | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Attach compute target | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Attach data stores | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Run experiment | ✓ | ✓ | |
| View runs/metrics | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Register model | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Create image | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Deploy web service | ✓ | ✓ | |
| View models/images | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Call web service | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

If the built-in roles don't meet your needs, you can create custom roles. Custom roles are supported only for operations on the workspace and Machine Learning Compute. Custom roles can have read, write, or delete permissions on the workspace and on the compute resource in that workspace. You can make the role available at a specific workspace level, a specific resource-group level, or a specific subscription level. For more information, see [Manage users and roles in an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md).

### Securing compute targets and data

Owners and contributors can use all compute targets and data stores that are attached to the workspace.  

Each workspace also has an associated system-assigned managed identity that has the same name as the workspace. The managed identity has the following permissions on attached resources used in the workspace.

For more information on managed identities, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

| Resource | Permissions |
| ----- | ----- |
| Workspace | Contributor |
| Storage account | Storage Blob Data Contributor |
| Key vault | Access to all keys, secrets, certificates |
| Azure Container Registry | Contributor |
| Resource group that contains the workspace | Contributor |
| Resource group that contains the key vault (if different from the one that contains the workspace) | Contributor |

We don't recommend that admins revoke the access of the managed identity to the resources mentioned in the preceding table. You can restore access by using the resync keys operation.

Azure Machine Learning creates an additional application (the name starts with `aml-` or `Microsoft-AzureML-Support-App-`) with contributor-level access in your subscription for every workspace region. For example, if you have one workspace in East US and another workspace in North Europe in the same subscription, you'll see two of these applications. These applications enable Azure Machine Learning to help you manage compute resources.

## Network security

Azure Machine Learning relies on other Azure services for compute resources. Compute resources (compute targets) are used to train and deploy models. You can create these compute targets in a virtual network. For example, you can use Azure Data Science Virtual Machine to train a model and then deploy the model to AKS.  

For more information, see [How to run experiments and inference in a virtual network](how-to-enable-virtual-network.md).

## Data encryption

### Encryption at rest

#### Azure Blob storage

Azure Machine Learning stores snapshots, output, and logs in the Azure Blob storage account that's tied to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and your subscription. All the data stored in Azure Blob storage is encrypted at rest with Microsoft-managed keys.

For information on how to use your own keys for data stored in Azure Blob storage, see [Azure Storage encryption with customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys).

Training data is typically also stored in Azure Blob storage so that it's accessible to training compute targets. This storage isn't managed by Azure Machine Learning but mounted to compute targets as a remote file system.

For information on regenerating the access keys for the Azure storage accounts used with your workspace, see [Regenerate storage access keys](how-to-change-storage-access-key.md).

#### Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Machine Learning stores metrics and metadata in the Azure Cosmos DB instance associated with a Microsoft subscription managed by Azure Machine Learning. All the data stored in Azure Cosmos DB is encrypted at rest with Microsoft-managed keys.

#### Azure Container Registry

All container images in your registry (Azure Container Registry) are encrypted at rest. Azure automatically encrypts an image before storing it and decrypts it on the fly when Azure Machine Learning pulls the image.

#### Machine Learning Compute

The OS disk for each compute node stored in Azure Storage is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys in Azure Machine Learning storage accounts. This compute target is ephemeral, and clusters are typically scaled down when no runs are queued. The underlying virtual machine is de-provisioned, and the OS disk is deleted. Azure Disk Encryption isn't supported for the OS disk.

Each virtual machine also has a local temporary disk for OS operations. If you want, you can use the disk to stage training data. The disk isn't encrypted.
For more information on how encryption at rest works in Azure, see [Azure data encryption at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest).

### Encryption in transit

You can use SSL to secure internal communication between Azure Machine Learning microservices and to secure external calls to the scoring endpoint. All Azure Storage access also occurs over a secure channel.

For more information, see [Use SSL to secure a web service through Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-secure-web-service).

### Using Azure Key Vault

Azure Machine Learning uses the Azure Key Vault instance associated with the workspace to store credentials of various kinds:

* The associated storage account connection string
* Passwords to Azure Container Repository instances
* Connection strings to data stores

SSH passwords and keys to compute targets like Azure HDInsight and VMs are stored in a separate key vault that's associated with the Microsoft subscription. Azure Machine Learning doesn't store any passwords or keys provided by users. Instead, it generates, authorizes, and stores its own SSH keys to connect to VMs and HDInsight to run the experiments.

Each workspace has an associated system-assigned managed identity that has the same name as the workspace. This managed identity has access to all keys, secrets, and certificates in the key vault.

## Monitoring

### Metrics

You can use Azure Monitor metrics to view and monitor metrics for your Azure Machine Learning workspace. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your workspace and then select **Metrics**:

[![Screenshot showing example metrics for a workspace](media/concept-enterprise-security/workspace-metrics.png)](media/concept-enterprise-security/workspace-metrics-expanded.png#lightbox)

The metrics include information on runs, deployments, and registrations.

For more information, see [Metrics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-metrics).

### Activity log

You can view the activity log of a workspace to see various operations that are performed on the workspace. The log includes basic information like the operation name, event initiator, and timestamp.

This screenshot shows the activity log of a workspace:

[![Screenshot showing the activity log of a workspace](media/concept-enterprise-security/workspace-activity-log.png)](media/concept-enterprise-security/workspace-activity-log-expanded.png#lightbox)

Scoring request details are stored in Application Insights. Application Insights is created in your subscription when you create a workspace. Logged information includes fields like HTTPMethod, UserAgent, ComputeType, RequestUrl, StatusCode, RequestId, and Duration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some actions in the Azure Machine Learning workspace don't log information to the activity log. For example, the start of a training run and the registration of a model aren't logged.
>
> Some of these actions appear in the **Activities** area of your workspace, but these notifications don't indicate who initiated the activity.

## Data flow diagrams

### Create workspace

The following diagram shows the create workspace workflow.

* The user signs in to Azure AD from one of the supported Azure Machine Learning clients (Azure CLI, Python SDK, Azure portal) and requests the appropriate Azure Resource Manager token.
* The user calls Azure Resource Manager to create the workspace. 
* Azure Resource Manager contacts the Azure Machine Learning resource provider to provision the workspace.

Additional resources are created in the user's subscription during workspace creation:

* Key Vault (to store secrets)
* An Azure storage account (including blob and file share)
* Azure Container Registry (to store Docker images for inference/scoring and experimentation)
* Application Insights (to store telemetry)

The user can also provision other compute targets that are attached to a workspace (like Azure Kubernetes Service or VMs) as needed.

### Save source code (training scripts)

The following diagram shows the code snapshot workflow.

Associated with an Azure Machine Learning workspace are directories (experiments) that contain the source code (training scripts). These scripts are stored on your local machine and in the cloud (in the Azure Blob storage for your subscription). The code snapshots are used for execution or inspection for historical auditing.

[![Code snapshot workflow](media/concept-enterprise-security/code-snapshot.png)](media/concept-enterprise-security/code-snapshot-expanded.png#lightbox)

### Training

The following diagram shows the training workflow.

* Azure Machine Learning is called with the snapshot ID for the code snapshot saved in the previous section.
* Azure Machine Learning creates a run ID (optional) and a Machine Learning service token, which is later used by compute targets like Machine Learning Compute/VMs to communicate with the Machine Learning service.
* You can choose either a managed compute target (like Machine Learning Compute) or an unmanaged compute target (like VMs) to run your training jobs. Here are the data flows for both scenarios:
   * VMs/HDInsight, accessed by SSH credentials in a key vault in the Microsoft subscription. Azure Machine Learning runs management code on the compute target that:

   1. Prepares the environment. (Docker is an option for VMs and local computers. See the following steps for Machine Learning Compute to understand how running experiments on Docker containers works.)
   1. Downloads the code.
   1. Sets up environment variables and configurations.
   1. Runs user scripts (the code snapshot mentioned in the previous section).

   * Machine Learning Compute, accessed through a workspace-managed identity.
Because Machine Learning Compute is a managed compute target (that is, it's managed by Microsoft) it runs under your Microsoft subscription.

   1. Remote Docker construction is kicked off, if needed.
   1. Management code is written to the user's Azure Files share.
   1. The container is started with an initial command. That is, management code as described in the previous step.

#### Querying runs and metrics

In the flow diagram below, this step occurs when the training compute target writes the run metrics back to Azure Machine Learning from storage in the Cosmos DB database. Clients can call Azure Machine Learning. Machine Learning will in turn pull metrics from the Cosmos DB database and return them back to the client.

[![Training workflow](media/concept-enterprise-security/training-and-metrics.png)](media/concept-enterprise-security/training-and-metrics-expanded.png#lightbox)

### Creating web services

The following diagram shows the inference workflow. Inference, or model scoring, is the phase in which the deployed model is used for prediction, most commonly on production data.

Here are the details:

* The user registers a model by using a client like the Azure Machine Learning SDK.
* The user creates an image by using a model, a score file, and other model dependencies.
* The Docker image is created and stored in Azure Container Registry.
* The web service is deployed to the compute target (Container Instances/AKS) using the image created in the previous step.
* Scoring request details are stored in Application Insights, which is in the user’s subscription.
* Telemetry is also pushed to the Microsoft/Azure subscription.
