# Execute R Script

This article describes how to use the **Execute R Script** module to run R code in your Azure Machine Learning designer (preview) pipeline.

With R, you can perform tasks that aren't currently supported by existing modules such as: 
- Create custom data transformations
- Use your own metrics to evaluate predictions
- Build models using algorithms that aren't implemented as standalone modules in the designer

## R version support

Azure Machine Learning designer uses the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) distribution of R. The currently used version is CRAN 3.5.1.

## Supported R packages

The R environment is pre-installed with over 100 packages. For a complete list, see the section [Pre-installed R packages](#pre-installed-r-packages).

You can also add the following code to any **Execute R Script** module and to see the installed packages.

```R
azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
  print("R script run.")
  dataframe1 <- data.frame(installed.packages())
  return(list(dataset1=dataframe1, dataset2=dataframe2))
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> If your pipeline contains multiple Execute R Script modules and need same packages which are not in the pre-installed list, please install the packages in each module respectively. 

## Installing R packages
To install additional R packages, use the `install.packages()` method. Packages are installed for each **Execute R Script** module, and aren't shared across other **Execute R Script** modules.

> [!NOTE]
> Please specify the CRAN repository when installing packages such as `install.packages("zoo",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")`

This sample shows how to install Zoo:
```R
# R version: 3.5.1
# The script MUST contain a function named azureml_main
# which is the entry point for this module.

# Please note that functions dependant on X11 library
# such as "View" are not supported because X11 library
# is not pre-installed.

# The entry point function MUST have two input arguments.
# If the input port is not connected, the corresponding
# dataframe argument will be null.
#   Param<dataframe1>: a R DataFrame
#   Param<dataframe2>: a R DataFrame
azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
  print("R script run.")
  
  if(!require(zoo)) install.packages("zoo",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  library(zoo)
  # Return datasets as a Named List
  return(list(dataset1=dataframe1, dataset2=dataframe2))
}
```
 > [!NOTE]
  > Please check if the package already exists before install it to avoid repeat installing. Like `  if(!require(zoo)) install.packages("zoo",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")`  in above sample code. Repeat installing may cause web service request timeout.     

## Upload files
The **Execute R Script** supports uploading files using Azure Machine Learning R SDK.

The following example shows how to upload an image file in the **Execute R Script**:
```R

# R version: 3.5.1
# The script MUST contain a function named azureml_main
# which is the entry point for this module.

# Please note that functions dependant on X11 library
# such as "View" are not supported because X11 library
# is not pre-installed.

# The entry point function MUST have two input arguments.
# If the input port is not connected, the corresponding
# dataframe argument will be null.
#   Param<dataframe1>: a R DataFrame
#   Param<dataframe2>: a R DataFrame
azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
  print("R script run.")

  # Generate a jpeg graph
  img_file_name <- "rect.jpg"
  jpeg(file=img_file_name)
  example(rect)
  dev.off()

  upload_files_to_run(names = list(file.path("graphic", img_file_name)), paths=list(img_file_name))


  # Return datasets as a Named List
  return(list(dataset1=dataframe1, dataset2=dataframe2))
}
```

After the pipeline run is finished, you can preview the image in the right panel of the module

## How to configure Execute R Script

The **Execute R Script** module contains sample code that you can use as a starting point. To configure the **Execute R Script** module, provide a set of inputs and code to execute.

![R-module](media/module/execute-r-script.png)

Datasets stored in the designer are automatically converted to an R data frame when loaded with this module.

1.  Add the **Execute R Script** module to your pipeline.

  

1. Connect any inputs needed by the script. Inputs are optional and can include data and additional R code.

    * **Dataset1**: Reference the first input as `dataframe1`. The input dataset must be formatted as a CSV, TSV, ARFF, or you can connect an Azure Machine Learning dataset.

    * **Dataset2**: Reference the second input as `dataframe2`. This dataset also must be formatted as a CSV, TSV, ARFF file, or as an Azure Machine Learning dataset.

    * **Script Bundle**: The third input accepts ZIP files. The zipped file can contain multiple files and multiple file types.

1. In the **R script** text box, type or paste valid R script.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Please be very careful when writing your script and makes sure there is no syntax error, such as using un-declared variables or un-imported modules or functions. Also pay extra attention to the pre-installed package list in the end of this document. To use packages that are not listed, please install them in your script such as `install.packages("zoo",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")`
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Functions dependant on X11 library such as "View" are not supported because X11 library is not pre-installed.
    
    To help you get started, the **R Script** text box is pre-populated with sample code, which you can edit or replace.
    
    ```R
    # R version: 3.5.1
    # The script MUST contain a function named azureml_main
    # which is the entry point for this module.

    # Please note that functions dependant on X11 library
    # such as "View" are not supported because X11 library
    # is not pre-installed.
    
    # The entry point function MUST have two input arguments.
    # If the input port is not connected, the corresponding
    # dataframe argument will be null.
    #   Param<dataframe1>: a R DataFrame
    #   Param<dataframe2>: a R DataFrame
    azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
    print("R script run.")

    # If a zip file is connected to the third input port, it is
    # unzipped under "./Script Bundle". This directory is added
    # to sys.path.

    # Return datasets as a Named List
    return(list(dataset1=dataframe1, dataset2=dataframe2))
    }
    ```

 * The script must contain a function named `azureml_main`, which is the entry point for this module.

 * The entry point function must have two input arguments: `Param<dataframe1>` and `Param<dataframe2>`, even when these two arguments are not used in the function.

   > [!NOTE]
    > The data passed to the **Execute R Script** module is referenced as `dataframe1` and `dataframe2`, which is different from Azure Machine Learning designer (the designer reference as `dataset1`, `dataset2`). Please check to make sure input data is referneced correctly in your script.  
 
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Existing R code may need minor changes to run in a designer pipeline. For example, input data that you provide in CSV format should be explicitly converted to a dataset before you can use it in your code. Data and column types used in the R language also differ in some ways from the data and column types used in the designer.

1.  **Random Seed**: Type a value to use inside the R environment as the random seed value. This parameter is equivalent to calling `set.seed(value)` in R code.  

1. Submit the pipeline.  

## Results

The **Execute R Script** modules can return multiple outputs, but they must be provided as R data frames. Data frames are automatically converted to datasets in the designer for compatibility with other modules.

Standard messages and errors from R are returned to the module's log.

If you need to print results in the R script, You can find the printed results in the **70_driver_log** under **Outputs+logs** tab in the right panel of the module.

## Sample scripts

There are many ways that you can extend your pipeline by using custom R script.  This section provides sample code for common tasks.


### Add R script as an input

The **Execute R Script** module supports arbitrary R script files as inputs. To do so, they must be uploaded to your workspace as part of the ZIP file.

1. To upload a ZIP file containing R code to your workspace, go to the **Datasets** asset page, click **Create dataset**, and then select **From local file** and the **File** dataset type option.  

1. Verify that the zipped file is available in the **My Datasets** list under **Datasets** category in the left module tree.

1.  Connect the dataset to the **Script Bundle** input port.

1. All files that are contained in the ZIP file are available during pipeline run time. 

    If the script bundle file contained a directory structure, the structure is preserved. However, you must alter your code to prepend the directory **./Script Bundle** to the path.

### Process data

The following sample shows how to scale and normalize input data:

```R
# R version: 3.5.1
# The script MUST contain a function named azureml_main
# which is the entry point for this module.

# Please note that functions dependant on X11 library
# such as "View" are not supported because X11 library
# is not pre-installed.

# The entry point function MUST have two input arguments.
# If the input port is not connected, the corresponding
# dataframe argument will be null.
#   Param<dataframe1>: a R DataFrame
#   Param<dataframe2>: a R DataFrame
azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
  print("R script run.")
  # If a zip file is connected to the third input port, it is
  # unzipped under "./Script Bundle". This directory is added
  # to sys.path.
  series <- dataframe1$width
  # find the maximum and minimum values of width column in dataframe1
  max_v <- max(series)
  min_v <- min(series)
  # calculate the scale and bias
  scale <- max_v - min_v
  bias <- min_v / dis
  # apply min-max normalizing
  dataframe1$width <- dataframe1$width / scale - bias
  dataframe2$width <- dataframe2$width / scale - bias
  # Return datasets as a Named List
  return(list(dataset1=dataframe1, dataset2=dataframe2))
}
 ```

### Read a ZIP file as input

This sample shows how to use a dataset in a ZIP file as an input to the **Execute R Script** module.

1. Create the data file in CSV format, and name it "mydatafile.csv".
1. Create a ZIP file and add the CSV file to the archive.
1. Upload the zipped file to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. 
1. Connect the resulting dataset to the **ScriptBundle** input of your **Execute R Script** module.
1. Using the following code to read the CSV data from the zipped file.

```R
azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
  print("R script run.")
  mydataset<-read.csv("./Script Bundle/mydatafile.csv",encoding="UTF-8");  
  # Return datasets as a Named List
  return(list(dataset1=mydataset, dataset2=dataframe2))
}
```

### Replicate rows

This sample shows how to replicate positive records in a dataset to balance the sample:

```R
azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
  data.set <- dataframe1[dataframe1[,1]==-1,]  
  # positions of the positive samples
  pos <- dataframe1[dataframe1[,1]==1,]
  # replicate the positive samples to balance the sample  
  for (i in 1:20) data.set <- rbind(data.set,pos)  
  row.names(data.set) <- NULL
  # Return datasets as a Named List
  return(list(dataset1=data.set, dataset2=dataframe2))
}
```

### Pass R objects between Execute R Script modules

You can pass R objects between instances of the **Execute R Script** module by using the internal serialization mechanism. This example assumes that you want to move the R object named `A` between two **Execute R Script** modules.

1. Add the first **Execute R Script** module to your pipeline, and type the following code in the **R Script** text box to create a serialized object `A` as a column in the module's output Data Table:  
  
    ```R
    azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
      print("R script run.")
      # some codes generated A
      
      serialized <- as.integer(serialize(A,NULL))  
      data.set <- data.frame(serialized,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

      return(list(dataset1=data.set, dataset2=dataframe2))
    }
    ```

    The explicit conversion to integer type is done because the serialization function outputs data in the R `Raw` format, which isn't supported by the designer.

1. Add a second instance of the **Execute R Script** module, and connect it to the output port of the previous module.

1. Type the following code in the **R Script** text box to extract object `A` from the input Data Table. 

    ```R
    azureml_main <- function(dataframe1, dataframe2){
      print("R script run.")
      A <- unserialize(as.raw(dataframe1$serialized))  
      # Return datasets as a Named List
      return(list(dataset1=dataframe1, dataset2=dataframe2))
    }
    ```
