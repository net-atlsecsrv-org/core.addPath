# Multiclass Boosted Decision Tree

This article describes a module of the visual interface (preview) for Azure Machine Learning service.

Use this module to create a machine learning model that is based on the boosted decision trees algorithm.

A boosted decision tree is an ensemble learning method in which the second tree corrects for the errors of the first tree, the third tree corrects for the errors of the first and second trees, and so forth. Predictions are based on the ensemble of trees together.

## How to configure 

This module creates an untrained classification model. Because classification is a supervised learning method, you need a *labeled dataset* that includes a label column with a value for all rows.

You can train this type of model by using the [Train Model](././train-model.md). 

1.  Add the **Multiclass Boosted Decision Tree** module to your experiment.

1.  Specify how you want the model to be trained by setting the **Create trainer mode** option.

    + **Single Parameter**: If you know how you want to configure the model, you can provide a specific set of values as arguments.


    *  **Maximum number of leaves per tree** limits the maximum number of terminal nodes (leaves) that can be created in any tree.
    
        By increasing this value, you potentially increase the size of the tree and achieve higher precision, at the risk of overfitting and longer training time.
  
    * **Minimum number of samples per leaf node** indicates the number of cases required to create any terminal node (leaf) in a tree.  

         By increasing this value, you increase the threshold for creating new rules. For example, with the default value of 1, even a single case can cause a new rule to be created. If you increase the value to 5, the training data would have to contain at least five cases that meet the same conditions.

    * **Learning rate** defines the step size while learning. Enter a number between 0 and 1.

         The learning rate determines how fast or slow the learner converges on an optimal solution. If the step size is too large, you might overshoot the optimal solution. If the step size is too small, training takes longer to converge on the best solution.

    * **Number of trees constructed** indicates the total number of decision trees to create in the ensemble. By creating more decision trees, you can potentially get better coverage, but training time will increase.

    *  **Random number seed** optionally sets a non-negative integer to use as the random seed value. Specifying a seed ensures reproducibility across runs that have the same data and parameters.  

         The random seed is set by default to 42. Successive runs using different random seeds can have different results.

> [!Note]
> If you set **Create trainer mode** to **Single Parameter**, connect a tagged dataset and the [Train Model](./train-model.md) module.
