# Split Image Directory

This topic describes how to use the Split Image Directory module in Azure Machine Learning designer, to divide the images of an image directory into two distinct sets.

This module is particularly useful when you need to separate image data into training and testing sets. 

## How to configure Split Image Directory

1. Add the **Split Image Directory** module to your pipeline. You can find this module under 'Computer Vision/Image Data Transformation' category.

2. Connect it to module of which the output is image directory.

3. Input **Fraction of images in the first output** to specify the percentage of data to put in the left split, by default 0.9. If the fraction result is not integer, the module uses the smaller near integer.


## Technical notes

### Expected inputs

| Name                  | Type           | Description              |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Input image directory | ImageDirectory | Image directory to split |

### Module parameters

| Name                                   | Type  | Range | Optional | Description                            | Default |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Fraction of images in the first output | Float | 0-1   | Required | Fraction of images in the first output | 0.9     |

### Outputs

| Name                    | Type           | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Output image directory1 | ImageDirectory | Image directory that contains selected images |
| Output image directory2 | ImageDirectory | Image directory that contains all other images |
