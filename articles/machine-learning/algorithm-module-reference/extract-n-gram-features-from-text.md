# Extract N-Gram Features from Text module reference

This article describes a module in Azure Machine Learning designer (preview). Use the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module to *featurize* unstructured text data. 

## Configuration of the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module

The module supports the following scenarios for using an n-gram dictionary:

* [Create a new n-gram dictionary](#create-a-new-n-gram-dictionary) from a column of free text.

* [Use an existing set of text features](#use-an-existing-n-gram-dictionary) to featurize a free text column.

* [Score or publish a model](#score-or-publish-a-model-that-uses-n-grams) that uses n-grams.

### Create a new n-gram dictionary

1.  Add the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module to your pipeline, and connect the dataset that has the text you want to process.

1.  Use **Text column** to choose a column of string type that contains the text you want to extract. Because results are verbose, you can process only a single column at a time.

1. Set **Vocabulary mode** to **Create** to indicate that you're creating a new list of n-gram features. 

1. Set **N-Grams size** to indicate the *maximum* size of the n-grams to extract and store. 

    For example, if you enter 3, unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams will be created.

1. **Weighting function** specifies how to build the document feature vector and how to extract vocabulary from documents.

    * **Binary Weight**: Assigns a binary presence value to the extracted n-grams. The value for each n-gram is 1 when it exists in the document, and 0 otherwise.

    * **TF Weight**: Assigns a term frequency (TF) score to the extracted n-grams. The value for each n-gram is its occurrence frequency in the document.

    * **IDF Weight**: Assigns an inverse document frequency (IDF) score to the extracted n-grams. The value for each n-gram is the log of corpus size divided by its occurrence frequency in the whole corpus.
    
      `IDF = log of corpus_size / document_frequency`
 
    *  **TF-IDF Weight**: Assigns a term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) score to the extracted n-grams. The value for each n-gram is its TF score multiplied by its IDF score.

1. Set **Minimum word length** to the minimum number of letters that can be used in any *single word* in an n-gram.

1. Use **Maximum word length** to set the maximum number of letters that can be used in any *single word* in an n-gram.

    By default, up to 25 characters per word or token are allowed.

1. Use **Minimum n-gram document absolute frequency** to set the minimum occurrences required for any n-gram to be included in the n-gram dictionary. 

    For example, if you use the default value of 5, any n-gram must appear at least five times in the corpus to be included in the n-gram dictionary. 

1.  Set **Maximum n-gram document ratio** to the maximum ratio of the number of rows that contain a particular n-gram, over the number of rows in the overall corpus.

    For example, a ratio of 1 would indicate that, even if a specific n-gram is present in every row, the n-gram can be added to the n-gram dictionary. More typically, a word that occurs in every row would be considered a noise word and would be removed. To filter out domain-dependent noise words, try reducing this ratio.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The rate of occurrence of particular words is not uniform. It varies from document to document. For example, if you're analyzing customer comments about a specific product, the product name might be very high frequency and close to a noise word, but be a significant term in other contexts.

1. Select the option **Normalize n-gram feature vectors** to normalize the feature vectors. If this option is enabled, each n-gram feature vector is divided by its L2 norm.

1. Submit the pipeline.

### Use an existing n-gram dictionary

1.  Add the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module to your pipeline, and connect the dataset that has the text you want to process to the **Dataset** port.

1.  Use **Text column** to select the text column that contains the text you want to featurize. By default, the module selects all columns of type **string**. For best results, process a single column at a time.

1. Add the saved dataset that contains a previously generated n-gram dictionary, and connect it to the **Input vocabulary** port. You can also connect the **Result vocabulary** output of an upstream instance of the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module.

1. For **Vocabulary mode**, select the **ReadOnly** update option from the drop-down list.

   The **ReadOnly** option represents the input corpus for the input vocabulary. Rather than computing term frequencies from the new text dataset (on the left input), the n-gram weights from the input vocabulary are applied as is.

   > [!TIP]
   > Use this option when you're scoring a text classifier.

1.  For all other options, see the property descriptions in the [previous section](#create-a-new-n-gram-dictionary).

1.  Submit the pipeline.

### Score or publish a model that uses n-grams

1.  Copy the **Extract N-Gram Features from Text** module from the training dataflow to the scoring dataflow.

1.  Connect the **Result Vocabulary** output from the training dataflow to **Input Vocabulary** on the scoring dataflow.

1.  In the scoring workflow, modify the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module and set the **Vocabulary mode** parameter to **ReadOnly**. Leave all else the same.

1.  To publish the pipeline, save **Result Vocabulary** as a dataset.

1.  Connect the saved dataset to the Extract N-Gram Features from Text module in your scoring graph.

## Results

The Extract N-Gram Features from Text module creates two types of output: 

* **Result dataset**: This output is a summary of the analyzed text combined with the n-grams that were extracted. Columns that you didn't select in the **Text column** option are passed through to the output. For each column of text that you analyze, the module generates these columns:

  * **Matrix of n-gram occurrences**: The module generates a column for each n-gram found in the total corpus and adds a score in each column to indicate the weight of the n-gram for that row. 

* **Result vocabulary**: The vocabulary contains the actual n-gram dictionary, together with the term frequency scores that are generated as part of the analysis. You can save the dataset for reuse with a different set of inputs, or for a later update. You can also reuse the vocabulary for modeling and scoring.

### Result vocabulary

The vocabulary contains the n-gram dictionary with the term frequency scores that are generated as part of the analysis. The DF and IDF scores are generated regardless of other options.

+ **ID**: An identifier generated for each unique n-gram.
+ **NGram**: The n-gram. Spaces or other word separators are replaced by the underscore character.
+ **DF**: The term frequency score for the n-gram in the original corpus.
+ **IDF**: The inverse document frequency score for the n-gram in the original corpus.

You can manually update this dataset, but you might introduce errors. For example:

* An error is raised if the module finds duplicate rows with the same key in the input vocabulary. Be sure that no two rows in the vocabulary have the same word.
* The input schema of the vocabulary datasets must match exactly, including column names and column types. 
* The **ID** column and **DF** column must be of the integer type. 
* The **IDF** column must be of the float type.

> [!Note]
> Don't connect the data output to the Train Model module directly. You should remove free text columns before they're fed into the Train Model. Otherwise, the free text columns will be treated as categorical features.
