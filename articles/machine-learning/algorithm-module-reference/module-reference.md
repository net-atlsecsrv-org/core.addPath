# Algorithm & module reference for Azure Machine Learning designer (preview)

This reference content provides the technical background on each of the machine learning algorithms and modules available in Azure Machine Learning designer (preview).

Each module represents a set of code that can run independently and perform a machine learning task, given the required inputs. A module might contain a particular algorithm, or perform a task that is important in machine learning, such as missing value replacement, or statistical analysis.

For help with choosing algorithms, see 
* [How to select algorithms](../how-to-select-algorithms.md)
* [Azure Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet](../algorithm-cheat-sheet.md)

> [!TIP]
> In any pipeline in the designer, you can get information about a specific module. Select the module, then select the **more help** link in the **Quick Help** pane.
