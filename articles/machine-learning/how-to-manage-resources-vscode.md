# Manage Azure Machine Learning resources with the VS Code Extension (preview)

Learn how to manage Azure Machine Learning resources with the VS Code extension.

![Azure Machine Learning VS Code Extension](media/how-to-manage-resources-vscode/azure-machine-learning-vscode-extension.png)

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription. If you don't have one, sign up to try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).
- Visual Studio Code. If you don't have it, [install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).
- VS Code Azure Machine Learning Extension. Follow the [Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension installation guide](tutorial-setup-vscode-extension.md#install-the-extension) to install the extension.

All of the processes below assume that you are in the Azure Machine Learning view in Visual Studio Code. To launch the extension, select the **Azure** icon in the VS Code activity bar.

## Workspaces

For more information, see [workspaces](concept-workspace.md).

### Create a workspace

1. In the Azure Machine Learning view, right-click your subscription node and select **Create workspace**.
1. In the prompt:
    1. Provide a name for your workspace
    1. Choose your Azure subscription
    1. Choose or create a new resource group to provision the workspace in
    1. Select the location where to provision the workspace.

Alternative methods to create a workspace include:

- Open the command palette **View > Command Palette** and enter into the text prompt **Azure ML: Create Workspace**.
- Click the `+` icon at the top of the Azure Machine Learning view.
- Create a new workspace when prompted to select a workspace during the provisioning of other resources.

### Remove a workspace

1. Expand the subscription node that contains your workspace.
1. Right-click the workspace you want to remove.
1. Select whether you want to remove:
    - *Only the workspace*: This option deletes **only** the workspace Azure resource. The resource group, storage accounts, and any other resources the workspace was attached to are still in Azure.
    - *With associated resources*: This option deletes the workspace **and** all resources associated with it.

## Datastores

The VS Code extension currently supports datastores of the following types:

- Azure File Share
- Azure Blob Storage

When you create a workspace, a datastore is created for each of these types.

For more information, see [datastores](concept-data.md#datastores).

### Create a datastore

1. Expand the subscription node that contains your workspace.
1. Expand the workspace node you want to create the datastore under.
1. Right-click the **Datastores** node and select **Register datastore**.
1. In the prompt:
    1. Provide a name for your datastore.
    1. Choose the datastore type.
    1. Select your storage resource. You can either choose a storage resource that's associated with your workspace or select from any valid storage resource in your Azure subscriptions.
    1. Choose the container where your data is inside the previously selected storage resource.
1. A configuration file appears in VS Code. If you're satisfied with your configuration file, select **Save and continue** or open the VS Code command palette (**View > Command Palette**) and type **Azure ML: Save and Continue**.

### Manage a datastore

1. Expand the subscription node that contains your workspace.
1. Expand your workspace node.
1. Expand the **Datastores** node inside your workspace.
1. Select the datastore you want to:
    - *Set as default*. Whenever you run experiments, this is the datastore that will be used.
    - *Inspect read-only settings*.
    - *Modify*. Change the authentication type and credentials. Supported authentication types include account key and SAS token.

## Datasets

The extension currently supports the following dataset types:

- *Tabular*: Allows you to materialize data into a DataFrame (Pandas or PySpark).
