# Quickstart: Use your own notebook server to get started with Azure Machine Learning

Use your own Python environment and Jupyter Notebook Server to get started with Azure Machine Learning service.  For a quickstart with no SDK installation, see [Quickstart: Use a cloud-based notebook server to get started with Azure Machine Learning](quickstart-run-cloud-notebook.md).

This quickstart shows how you can use the [Azure Machine Learning service workspace](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md) to keep track of your machine learning experiments. You will run Python code that log values into the workspace.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.

## Prerequisites

* A Python 3.6 notebook server with the Azure Machine Learning SDK installed
* An Azure Machine Learning service workspace
* A workspace configuration file (**.azureml/config.json**).

Get all these prerequisites from [Create an Azure Machine Learning service workspace](setup-create-workspace.md#sdk).



## Use the workspace

Create a script or start a notebook in the same directory as your workspace configuration file (**.azureml/config.json**).

### Attach to workspace

This code reads information from the configuration file to attach to your workspace.

```
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

### Log values

Run this code that uses the basic APIs of the SDK to track experiment runs.

1. Create an experiment in the workspace.
1. Log a single value into the experiment.
1. Log a list of values into the experiment.

## View logged results

When the run finishes, you can view the experiment run in the Azure portal. To print a URL that navigates to the results for the last run, use the following code:

```python
print(run.get_portal_url())
```

This code returns a link you can use to view the logged values in the Azure portal in your browser.

## Clean up resources 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can use the resources you've created here as prerequisites to other Machine Learning tutorials and how-to articles.

If you don't plan to use the resources that you created in this article, delete them to avoid incurring any charges.

[!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python/quickstart.py?name=delete)]

## Next steps

In this article, you created the resources you need to experiment with and deploy models. You ran code in a notebook, and you explored the run history for the code in your workspace in the cloud.
