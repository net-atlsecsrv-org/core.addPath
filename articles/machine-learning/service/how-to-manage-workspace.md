# Create and manage Azure Machine Learning service workspaces

In this article, you'll create, view, and delete [**Azure Machine Learning service workspaces**](concept-workspace.md) in the Azure portal for [Azure Machine Learning service](overview-what-is-azure-ml.md).  You can also create and delete workspaces [using the CLI](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md), [with Python code](https://aka.ms/aml-sdk) or [via the VS Code extension](how-to-vscode-tools.md#get-started-with-azure-machine-learning).

## Create a workspace

To create a workspace, you need an Azure subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.
