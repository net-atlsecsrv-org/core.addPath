# Visualize experiment runs and metrics with TensorBoard and Azure Machine Learning
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

In this article, you learn how to view your experiment runs and metrics in TensorBoard using [the `tensorboard` package](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/?view=azure-ml-py) in the main Azure Machine Learning SDK. Once you've inspected your experiment runs, you can better tune and retrain your machine learning models.

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r1/overview) is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding your experiment structure and performance.

How you launch TensorBoard with Azure Machine Learning experiments depends on the type of experiment:
+ If your experiment natively outputs log files that are consumable by TensorBoard, such as PyTorch, Chainer and TensorFlow experiments, then you can [launch TensorBoard directly](#direct) from experiment's run history. 

+ For experiments that don't natively output TensorBoard consumable files, such as like Scikit-learn or Azure Machine Learning experiments, use [the `export_to_tensorboard()` method](#export) to export the run histories as TensorBoard logs and launch TensorBoard from there. 

> [!TIP]
> The information in this document is primarily for data scientists and developers who want to monitor the model training process. If you are an administrator interested in monitoring resource usage and events from Azure Machine learning, such as quotas, completed training runs, or completed model deployments, see [Monitoring Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md).

## Prerequisites

* To launch TensorBoard and view your experiment run histories, your experiments need to have previously enabled logging to    track its metrics and performance.  

* The code in this document can be run in either of the following environments: 

    * Azure Machine Learning Notebook VM - no downloads or installation necessary

        * Complete the [Tutorial: Setup environment and workspace](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md) to create a dedicated notebook server pre-loaded with the SDK and the sample repository.

        * In the samples folder on the notebook server, find  two completed and expanded notebooks by navigating to these directories:
            * **how-to-use-azureml > training-with-deep-learning > export-run-history-to-tensorboard > export-run-history-to-tensorboard.ipynb**

            * **how-to-use-azureml > track-and-monitor-experiments > tensorboard.ipynb**

    * Your own Juptyer notebook server
       * [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py) with the `tensorboard` extra
        * [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).  
        * [Create a workspace configuration file](how-to-configure-environment.md#workspace).

## Option 1: Directly view run history in TensorBoard

This option works for experiments that natively outputs log files consumable by TensorBoard, such as PyTorch, Chainer, and TensorFlow experiments. If that is not the case of your experiment, use [the `export_to_tensorboard()` method](#export) instead.

The following example code uses the [MNIST demo experiment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/r1.8/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py) from TensorFlow's repository in a remote compute target, Azure Machine Learning Compute. Next, we train our model with the SDK's custom [TensorFlow estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.dnn.tensorflow?view=azure-ml-py), and then
start TensorBoard against this TensorFlow experiment, that is, an experiment that natively outputs TensorBoard event files.

### Set experiment name and create project folder

Here we name the experiment and create its folder. 
 
```python
from os import path, makedirs
experiment_name = 'tensorboard-demo'

# experiment folder
exp_dir = './sample_projects/' + experiment_name

if not path.exists(exp_dir):
    makedirs(exp_dir)

```

### Download TensorFlow demo experiment code

TensorFlow's repository has an MNIST demo with extensive TensorBoard instrumentation. We do not, nor need to, alter any of this demo's code for it to work with Azure Machine Learning. In the following code, we download the MNIST code and save it in our newly created experiment folder.

```python
import requests
import os

tf_code = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/r1.8/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py")
with open(os.path.join(exp_dir, "mnist_with_summaries.py"), "w") as file:
    file.write(tf_code.text)
```
Throughout the MNIST code file, mnist_with_summaries.py, notice that there are lines that call `tf.summary.scalar()`,  `tf.summary.histogram()`, `tf.summary.FileWriter()` etc. These methods group, log, and tag key metrics of your experiments into run history. The `tf.summary.FileWriter()` is especially important as it serializes the data from your logged experiment metrics, which allows for TensorBoard to generate visualizations off of them.

 ### Configure experiment

In the following, we configure our experiment and set up directories for logs and data. These logs will be uploaded to the Artifact Service, which TensorBoard accesses later.

>[!Note]
> For this TensorFlow example, you will need to install TensorFlow on your local machine. Further, the TensorBoard module (that is, the one included with TensorFlow) must be accessible to this notebook's kernel, as the local machine is what runs TensorBoard.

```Python
import azureml.core
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core import Experiment

ws = Workspace.from_config()

# create directories for experiment logs and dataset
logs_dir = os.path.join(os.curdir, "logs")
data_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.curdir, "mnist_data"))

if not path.exists(data_dir):
    makedirs(data_dir)

os.environ["TEST_TMPDIR"] = data_dir

# Writing logs to ./logs results in their being uploaded to Artifact Service,
# and thus, made accessible to our TensorBoard instance.
arguments_list = ["--log_dir", logs_dir]

# Create an experiment
exp = Experiment(ws, experiment_name)
```

### Create a cluster for your experiment
We create an AmlCompute cluster for this experiment, however your experiments can be created in any environment and you are still able to launch TensorBoard against the experiment run history. 

```Python
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute

cluster_name = "cpucluster"

cts = ws.compute_targets
found = False
if cluster_name in cts and cts[cluster_name].type == 'AmlCompute':
   found = True
   print('Found existing compute target.')
   compute_target = cts[cluster_name]
if not found:
    print('Creating a new compute target...')
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size='STANDARD_D2_V2', 
                                                           max_nodes=4)

    # create the cluster
    compute_target = ComputeTarget.create(ws, cluster_name, compute_config)

compute_target.wait_for_completion(show_output=True, min_node_count=None)

# use get_status() to get a detailed status for the current cluster. 
# print(compute_target.get_status().serialize())
```

### Submit run with TensorFlow estimator

The TensorFlow estimator provides a simple way of launching a TensorFlow training job on a compute target. It's implemented through the generic [`estimator`](https://docs.microsoft.com//python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.estimator.estimator?view=azure-ml-py) class, which can be used to support any framework. For more information about training models using the generic estimator, see [train models with Azure Machine Learning using estimator](how-to-train-ml-models.md)

```Python
from azureml.train.dnn import TensorFlow
script_params = {"--log_dir": "./logs"}

tf_estimator = TensorFlow(source_directory=exp_dir,
                          compute_target=compute_target,
                          entry_script='mnist_with_summaries.py',
                          script_params=script_params)

run = exp.submit(tf_estimator)
```

### Launch TensorBoard

You can launch TensorBoard during your run or after it completes. In the following, we create a TensorBoard object instance, `tb`, that takes the experiment run history loaded in the `run`, and then launches TensorBoard with the `start()` method. 
  
The [TensorBoard constructor](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/azureml.tensorboard.tensorboard?view=azure-ml-py) takes an array of runs, so be sure and pass it in as a single-element array.

```python
from azureml.tensorboard import Tensorboard

tb = Tensorboard([run])

# If successful, start() returns a string with the URI of the instance.
tb.start()

# After your job completes, be sure to stop() the streaming otherwise it will continue to run. 
tb.stop()
```

<a name="export"></a>

## Option 2: Export history as log to view in TensorBoard

The following code sets up a sample experiment, begins the logging process using the Azure Machine Learning run history APIs, and exports the experiment run history into logs consumable by TensorBoard for visualization. 

### Set up experiment

The following code sets up a new experiment and names the run directory `root_run`. 

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment
import azuremml.core

# set experiment name and run name
ws = Workspace.from_config()
experiment_name = 'export-to-tensorboard'
exp = Experiment(ws, experiment_name)
root_run = exp.start_logging()
```

Here we load the diabetes dataset-- a built-in small dataset that comes with scikit-learn, and split it into test and training sets.

```Python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
columns = ['age', 'gender', 'bmi', 'bp', 's1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 's6']
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
data = {
    "train":{"x":x_train, "y":y_train},        
    "test":{"x":x_test, "y":y_test}
}
```

### Run experiment and log metrics

For this code, we train a linear regression model and log key metrics, the alpha coefficient, `alpha`, and mean squared error, `mse`, in run history.

```Python
from tqdm import tqdm
alphas = [.1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6 , .7]
# try a bunch of alpha values in a Linear Regression (aka Ridge regression) mode
for alpha in tqdm(alphas):
  # create child runs and fit lines for the resulting models
  with root_run.child_run("alpha" + str(alpha)) as run
 
   reg = Ridge(alpha=alpha)
   reg.fit(data["train"]["x"], data["train"]["y"])    
 
   preds = reg.predict(data["test"]["x"])
   mse = mean_squared_error(preds, data["test"]["y"])
   # End train and eval

# log alpha, mean_squared_error and feature names in run history
   root_run.log("alpha", alpha)
   root_run.log("mse", mse)
```

### Export runs to TensorBoard

With the SDK's [export_to_tensorboard()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/azureml.tensorboard.export?view=azure-ml-py) method, we can export the run history of our Azure machine learning experiment into TensorBoard logs, so we can view them via TensorBoard.  

In the following code, we create the folder `logdir` in our current working directory. This folder is where we will export our experiment run history and logs from `root_run` and then mark that run as completed. 

```Python
from azureml.tensorboard.export import export_to_tensorboard
import os

logdir = 'exportedTBlogs'
log_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), logdir)
try:
    os.stat(log_path)
except os.error:
    os.mkdir(log_path)
print(logdir)

# export run history for the project
export_to_tensorboard(root_run, logdir)

root_run.complete()
```

>[!Note]
 You can also export a particular run to TensorBoard by specifying the name of the run  `export_to_tensorboard(run_name, logdir)`

### Start and stop TensorBoard
Once our run history for this experiment is exported, we can launch TensorBoard with the [start()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/azureml.tensorboard.tensorboard?view=azure-ml-py#start-start-browser-false-) method. 

```Python
from azureml.tensorboard import Tensorboard

# The TensorBoard constructor takes an array of runs, so be sure and pass it in as a single-element array here
tb = Tensorboard([], local_root=logdir, port=6006)

# If successful, start() returns a string with the URI of the instance.
tb.start()
```

When you're done, make sure to call the [stop()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/azureml.tensorboard.tensorboard?view=azure-ml-py#stop--) method of the TensorBoard object. Otherwise, TensorBoard will continue to run until you shut down the notebook kernel. 

```python
tb.stop()
```
