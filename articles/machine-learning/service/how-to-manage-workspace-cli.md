# Create a workspace for Azure Machine Learning with Azure CLI
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace using the Azure CLI. The Azure CLI provides commands for managing Azure resources. The machine learning extension to the CLI provides commands for working with Azure Machine Learning resources.

## Prerequisites

* An **Azure subscription**. If you do not have one, try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).

* To use the CLI commands in this document from your **local environment**, you need the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

    If you use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com//features/cloud-shell/), the CLI is accessed through the browser and lives in the cloud.

## Connect the CLI to your Azure subscription

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can skip this section. The cloud shell automatically authenticates you using the account you log into your Azure subscription.

There are several ways that you can authenticate to your Azure subscription from the CLI. The most basic is to interactively authenticate using a browser. To authenticate interactively, open a command line or terminal and use the following command:

```azurecli
az login
```

If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load a sign-in page. Otherwise, you need to open a browser and follow the instructions on the command line. The instructions involve browsing to [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and entering an authorization code.

For other methods of authenticating, see [Sign in with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Install the machine learning extension

To install the machine learning extension, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add -n azure-cli-ml
```

## Create a workspace

The Azure Machine Learning workspace relies on the following Azure services or entities:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not specify an existing Azure service, one will be created automatically during workspace creation. You must always specify a resource group.

| Service | Parameter to specify an existing instance |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Azure resource group** | `-g <resource-group-name>`
| **Azure Storage Account** | `--storage-account <service-id>` |
| **Azure Application Insights** | `--application-insights <service-id>` |
| **Azure Key Vault** | `--keyvault <service-id>` |
| **Azure Container Registry** | `--container-registry <service-id>` |

### Create a resource group

The Azure Machine Learning workspace must be created inside a resource group. You can use an existing resource group or create a new one. To __create a new resource group__, use the following command. Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name to use for this resource group. Replace `<location>` with the Azure region to use for this resource group:

> [!TIP]
> You should select a region where Azure Machine Learning is available. For information, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=machine-learning-service).

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name <resource-group-name> --location <location>
```

The response from this command is similar to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<subscription-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>",
  "location": "<location>",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "<resource-group-name>",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": null
}
```

For more information on working with resource groups, see [az group](https://docs.microsoft.com//cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest).

### Automatically create required resources

To create a new workspace where the __services are automatically created__, use the following command:

> [!TIP]
> The commands in this section create a basic edition workspace. To create an enterprise workspace, use the `--sku enterprise` switch with the `az ml workspace create` command. For more information on Azure Machine Learning editions, see [What is Azure Machine Learning](overview-what-is-azure-ml.md#sku).

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace create -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name>
```

The output of this command is similar to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "applicationInsights": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.insights/components/<application-insight-name>",
  "containerRegistry": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.containerregistry/registries/<acr-name>",
  "creationTime": "2019-08-30T20:24:19.6984254+00:00",
  "description": "",
  "friendlyName": "<workspace-name>",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace-name>",
  "identityPrincipalId": "<GUID>",
  "identityTenantId": "<GUID>",
  "identityType": "SystemAssigned",
  "keyVault": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/<key-vault-name>",
  "location": "<location>",
  "name": "<workspace-name>",
  "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>",
  "storageAccount": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts/<storage-account-name>",
  "type": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces",
  "workspaceid": "<GUID>"
}
```

### Use existing resources

To create a workspace that uses existing resources, you must provide the ID for the resources. Use the following commands to get the ID for the services:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You don't have to specify all existing resources. You can specify one or more. For example, you can specify an existing storage account and the workspace will create the other resources.

+ **Azure Storage Account**: `az storage account show --name <storage-account-name> --query "id"`

    The response from this command is similar to the following text, and is the ID for your storage account:

    `"/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>"`

+ **Azure Application Insights**:

    1. Install the application insights extension:

        ```bash
        az extension add -n application-insights
        ```

    2. Get the ID of your application insight service:

        ```bash
        az monitor app-insights component show --app <application-insight-name> -g <resource-group-name> --query "id"
        ```

        The response from this command is similar to the following text, and is the ID for your application insights service:

        `"/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.insights/components/<application-insight-name>"`

+ **Azure Key Vault**: `az keyvault show --name <key-vault-name> --query "ID"

    The response from this command is similar to the following text, and is the ID for your key vault:

    `"/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<key-vault-name>"`

+ **Azure Container Registry**: `az acr show --name <acr-name> -g <resource-group-name> --query "id"`

    The response from this command is similar to the following text, and is the ID for the container registry:

    `"/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<acr-name>"`

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The container registry must have the the [admin account](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account) enabled before it can be used with an Azure Machine Learning workspace.

Once you have the IDs for the resource(s) that you want to use with the workspace, use the base `az workspace create -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name>` command and add the parameter(s) and ID(s) for the existing resources. For example, the following command creates a workspace that uses an existing container registry:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace create -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name> --container-registry "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<acr-name>"
```

The output of this command is similar to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "applicationInsights": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.insights/components/<application-insight-name>",
  "containerRegistry": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.containerregistry/registries/<acr-name>",
  "creationTime": "2019-08-30T20:24:19.6984254+00:00",
  "description": "",
  "friendlyName": "<workspace-name>",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace-name>",
  "identityPrincipalId": "<GUID>",
  "identityTenantId": "<GUID>",
  "identityType": "SystemAssigned",
  "keyVault": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/<key-vault-name>",
  "location": "<location>",
  "name": "<workspace-name>",
  "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>",
  "storageAccount": "/subscriptions/<service-GUID>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts/<storage-account-name>",
  "type": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces",
  "workspaceid": "<GUID>"
}
```

## List workspaces

To list all the workspaces for your Azure subscription, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace list
```

The output of this command is similar to the following JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "resourceGroup": "myresourcegroup",
    "subscriptionId": "<subscription-id>",
    "workspaceName": "myml"
  },
  {
    "resourceGroup": "anotherresourcegroup",
    "subscriptionId": "<subscription-id>",
    "workspaceName": "anotherml"
  }
]
```

For more information, see the [az ml workspace list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-workspace-list) documentation.

## Get workspace information

To get information about a workspace, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace show -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name>
```

The output of this command is similar to the following JSON:

}
```

For more information, see the [az ml workspace update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-workspace-update) documentation.

## Share a workspace with another user

To share a workspace with another user on your subscription, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace share -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name> --user <user> --role <role>
```

For more information on roles-based access control (RBAC) with Azure Machine Learning, see [Manage users and roles](how-to-assign-roles.md).

For more information, see the [az ml workspace share](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-workspace-share) documentation.

## Sync keys for dependent resources

If you change access keys for one of the resources used by your workspace, use the following command to sync the new keys with the workspace:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace sync-keys -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name>
```

For more information on changing keys, see [Regenerate storage access keys](how-to-change-storage-access-key.md).

For more information, see the [az ml workspace sync-keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-workspace-sync-keys) documentation.

## Delete a workspace

To delete a workspace after it is no longer needed, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml workspace delete -w <workspace-name> -g <resource-group-name>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a workspace does not delete the application insight, storage account, key vault, or container registry used by the workspace.

You can also delete the resource group, which deletes the workspace and all other Azure resources in the resource group. To delete the resource group, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete -g <resource-group-name>
```

For more information, see the [az ml workspace delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-workspace-delete) documentation.
