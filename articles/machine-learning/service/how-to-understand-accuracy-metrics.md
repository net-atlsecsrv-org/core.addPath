# Evaluate training accuracy in automated ML with metrics

There are multiple ways to view training accuracy metrics for each run iteration.

* Use [a Jupyter widget](how-to-track-experiments.md#view-run-details)
* Use [the `get_metrics()` function](how-to-track-experiments.md#query-run-metrics) on any `Run` object
* View [the experiment metrics in the Azure portal](how-to-track-experiments.md#view-the-experiment-in-the-azure-portal)

## Classification metrics

The following metrics are saved in each run iteration for a classification task.

## Regression and forecasting metrics

The following metrics are saved in each run iteration for a regression or forecasting task.

|Metric|Description|Calculation|Extra Parameters
--|--|--|--|
explained_variance|Explained variance is  the proportion to which a mathematical model accounts for the variation of a given data set. It is the percent decrease in variance of the original data to the variance of the errors. When the mean of the errors is 0, it is equal to explained variance.|[Calculation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score.html)|None|
r2_score|R2 is the coefficient of determination or the percent reduction in squared errors compared to a baseline model that outputs the mean. When the mean of the errors is 0, it is equal to explained variance.|[Calculation](https://scikit-learn.org/0.16/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html)|None|
spearman_correlation|Spearman correlation is a nonparametric measure of the monotonicity of the relationship between two datasets. Unlike the Pearson correlation, the Spearman correlation does not assume that both datasets are normally distributed. Like other correlation coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact monotonic relationship. Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.|[Calculation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html)|None|

median_absolute_error|Median absolute error is the median of all absolute differences between the target and the prediction. This loss is robust to outliers.|[Calculation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.median_absolute_error.html)|None|
normalized_median_absolute_error|Normalized median absolute error is median absolute error divided by the range of the data|[Calculation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.median_absolute_error.html)|Divide by range of the data|
