See [the list of known issues](resource-known-issues.md) to learn about known bugs and workarounds.

## 2019-06-10

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.43

+ **New features**
  + Azure Machine Learning now provides first-class support for popular machine learning and data analysis framework Scikit-learn. Using [`SKLearn` estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.sklearn.sklearn?view=azure-ml-py), users can easily train and deploy Scikit-learn models.
    + Learn how to [run hyperparameter tuning with Scikit-learn using HyperDrive](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/training/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-sklearn/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-sklearn.ipynb).
  + Added support for creating ModuleStep in pipelines along with Module and ModuleVersion classes to manage reusable compute units.
  + ACI webservices now support persistent scoring_uri through updates. The scoring_uri will change from IP to FQDN. The Dns Name Label for FQDN can be configured by setting the dns_name_label on deploy_configuration. 
  + Automated machine learning new features:
    + STL featurizer for forecasting
    + KMeans clustering is enabled for feature sweeping
  + AmlCompute Quota approvals just became faster! We have now automated the process to approve your quota requests within a threshold. For more information on how quotas work, learn [how to manage quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-manage-quotas).
 

+ **Preview features**
    + Integration with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org) 1.0.0 tracking through azureml-mlflow package ([example notebooks](https://aka.ms/azureml-mlflow-examples)).
    + Submit Jupyter notebook as a run. [API Reference Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-contrib-notebook/azureml.contrib.notebook?view=azure-ml-py)
    + Public Preview of [Data Drift Detector](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-contrib-datadrift/azureml.contrib.datadrift?view=azure-ml-py) through azureml-contrib-datadrift package ([example notebooks](https://aka.ms/azureml-datadrift-example)). Data Drift is one of the top reasons where model accuracy degrades over time. It happens when data served to model in production is different from the data that the model was trained on. AML Data Drift detector helps customer to monitor data drift and sends alert whenever drift is detected. 

+ **Breaking changes**

+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + RunConfiguration load and save supports specifying a full file path with full back-compat for previous behavior.
  + Added caching in ServicePrincipalAuthentication, turned off by default.
  + Enable logging of multiple plots under the same metric name.
  + Model class now properly importable from azureml.core (`from azureml.core import Model`).
  + In pipeline steps, `hash_path` parameter is now deprecated. New behavior is to hash complete source_directory, except files listed in .amlignore or .gitignore.
  + In pipeline packages, various `get_all` and `get_all_*` methods have been deprecated in favor of `list` and `list_*`, respectively.
  + azureml.core.get_run no longer requires classes to be imported before returning the original run type.
  + Fixed an issue where some calls to WebService Update did not trigger an update.
  + Scoring timeout on AKS webservices should be between 5ms and 300000ms. Max allowed scoring_timeout_ms for scoring requests has been bumped from 1 min to 5 min.
  + LocalWebservice objects now have `scoring_uri` and `swagger_uri` properties.
  + Moved outputs directory creation and outputs directory upload out of the user process. Enabled run history SDK to run in every user process. This should resolve some synchronization issues experienced by distributed training runs.
  + The name of the azureml log written from the user process name will now include process name (for distributed training only) and PID.

### Azure Machine Learning Data Prep SDK v1.1.5

+ **Bug fixes and improvements**
  + For interpreted datetime values that have a 2-digit year format, the range of valid years has been updated to match Windows May Release. The range has been changed from 1930-2029 to 1950-2049.
  + When reading in a file and setting `handleQuotedLineBreaks=True`, `\r` will be treated as a new line.
  + Fixed a bug that caused `read_pandas_dataframe` to fail in some cases.
  + Improved performance of `get_profile`.
  + Improved error messages.

## 2019-05-28

### Azure Machine Learning Data Prep SDK v1.1.4

## 2019-04-26

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.33 released.

+ Azure ML Hardware Accelerated Models on [FPGAs](concept-accelerate-with-fpgas.md) is generally available.
  + You can now [use the azureml-accel-models package](how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md) to:
    + Train the weights of a supported deep neural network (ResNet 50, ResNet 152, DenseNet-121, VGG-16, and SSD-VGG)
    + Use transfer learning with the supported DNN
    + Register the model with Model Management Service and containerize the model
    + Deploy the model to an Azure VM with an FPGA in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
  + Deploy the container to an [Azure Data Box Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-overview) server device
  + Score your data with the gRPC endpoint with this [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aml-hardware-accelerated-models)

### Automated Machine Learning

+ Feature sweeping to enable dynamically adding featurizers for performance optimization. New featurizers: work embeddings, weight of evidence, target encodings, text target encoding, cluster distance
+ Smart CV to handle train/valid splits inside automated ML
+ Few memory optimization changes and runtime performance improvement
+ Performance improvement in model explanation
+ ONNX model conversion for local run
+ Added Subsampling support
+ Intelligent Stopping when no exit criteria defined
+ Stacked ensembles

+ Time Series Forecasting
  + New predict forecast function   
  + You can now use rolling-origin cross validation on time series data
  + New functionality added to configure time series lags 
  + New functionality added to support rolling window aggregate features
  + New Holiday detection and featurizer when country code is defined in experiment settings

+ Azure Databricks
  + Enabled time series forecasting and model explainabilty/interpretability capability
  + You can now cancel and resume (continue) automated ML experiments
  + Added support for multicore processing

### MLOps
+ **Local deployment & debugging for scoring containers**<br/> You can now deploy an ML model locally and iterate quickly on your scoring file and  dependencies to ensure they behave as expected.

+ **Introduced InferenceConfig & Model.deploy()**<br/> Model deployment now supports specifying a source folder with an entry script, the same as a RunConfig.  Additionally, model deployment has been simplified to a single command.

+ **Git reference tracking**<br/> Customers have been requesting basic Git integration capabilities for some time as it helps maintain an end-to-end audit trail. We have implemented tracking across major entities in Azure ML for Git-related metadata (repo, commit, clean state). This information will be collected automatically by the SDK and CLI.

+ **Model profiling & validation service**<br/> Customers frequently complain of the difficulty to properly size the compute associated with their inference service. With our model profiling service, the customer can provide sample inputs and we will profile across 16 different CPU / memory configurations to determine optimal sizing for deployment.

+ **Bring your own base image for inference**<br/> Another common complaint was the difficulty in moving from experimentation to inference RE sharing dependencies. With our new base image sharing capability, you can now reuse your experimentation base images, dependencies and all, for inference. This should speed up deployments and reduce the gap from the inner to the outer loop.

+ **Improved Swagger schema generation experience**<br/> Our previous swagger generation method was error prone and impossible to automate. We have a new in-line way of generating swagger schemas from any Python function via decorators. We have open-sourced this code and our schema generation protocol is not coupled to the Azure ML platform.

+ **Azure ML CLI is generally available (GA)**<br/> Models can now be deployed with a single CLI command. We got common customer feedback that no one deploys an ML model from a Jupyter notebook. The [**CLI reference documentation**](https://aka.ms/azmlcli) has been updated.


## 2019-04-22

Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.30 released.

The [`PipelineEndpoint`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-core/azureml.pipeline.core.pipeline_endpoint.pipelineendpoint?view=azure-ml-py) was introduce to add a new version of a published pipeline while maintaining same endpoint.

## 2018-12-04: General Availability

Azure Machine Learning service is now generally available.

### Azure Machine Learning Compute
With this release, we are announcing a new managed compute experience through the [Azure Machine Learning Compute](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md#amlcompute). This compute target replaces Azure Batch AI compute for Azure Machine Learning. 

This compute target:
+ Is used for model training and batch inference/scoring
+ Is single- to multi-node compute
+ Does the cluster management and job scheduling for the user
+ Autoscales by default
+ Support for both CPU and GPU resources 
+ Enables use of low-priority VMs for reduced cost

Azure Machine Learning Compute can be created in Python, using Azure portal, or the CLI. It must be created in the region of your workspace, and cannot be attached to any other workspace. This compute target uses a Docker container for your run, and packages your dependencies to replicate the same environment across all your nodes.

> [!Warning]
> We recommend creating a new workspace to use Azure Machine Learning Compute. There is a remote chance that users trying to create Azure Machine Learning Compute from an existing workspace might see an error. Existing compute in your workspace should continue to work unaffected.

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v1.0.2
+ **Breaking changes**
  + With this release, we are removing support for creating a VM from Azure Machine Learning. You can still attach an existing cloud VM or a remote on-premises server. 
  + We are also removing support for BatchAI, all of which should be supported through Azure Machine Learning Compute now.

+ **New**
  + For machine learning pipelines:
    + [EstimatorStep](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.estimator_step.estimatorstep?view=azure-ml-py)
    + [HyperDriveStep](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.hyper_drive_step.hyperdrivestep?view=azure-ml-py)
    + [MpiStep](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.mpi_step.mpistep?view=azure-ml-py)


+ **Updated**
  + For machine learning pipelines:
    + [DatabricksStep](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.databricks_step.databricksstep?view=azure-ml-py) now accepts runconfig
    + [DataTransferStep](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.data_transfer_step.datatransferstep?view=azure-ml-py) now copies to and from a SQL datasource
    + Schedule functionality in SDK to create and update schedules for running published pipelines

<!--+ **Bugs fixed**-->

### Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v0.1.80

+ **Breaking changes** 
  * *azureml.train.widgets* namespace has moved to *azureml.widgets*.
  * *azureml.core.compute.AmlCompute* deprecates the following classes - *azureml.core.compute.BatchAICompute* and *azureml.core.compute.DSVMCompute*. The latter class will be removed in subsequent releases. The AmlCompute class has an easier definition now, and simply needs a vm_size and the max_nodes, and will automatically scale your cluster from 0 to the max_nodes when a job is submitted. Our [sample notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/training) have been updated with this information and should give you usage examples. We hope you like this simplification and lots of more exciting features to come in a later release!
