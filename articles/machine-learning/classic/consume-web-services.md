# How to consume a Machine Learning Studio (classic) web service

**APPLIES TO:**  ![yes](../../../includes/media/aml-applies-to-skus/yes.png)Machine Learning Studio (classic)   ![no](../../../includes/media/aml-applies-to-skus/no.png)[Azure Machine Learning](../overview-what-is-machine-learning-studio.md#ml-studio-classic-vs-azure-machine-learning-studio)


Once you deploy an Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) predictive model as a Web service, you can use a REST API to send it data and get predictions. You can send the data in real-time or in batch mode.

You can find more information about how to create and deploy a Machine Learning Web service using Machine Learning Studio (classic) here:

* For a tutorial on how to create an experiment in Machine Learning Studio (classic), see [Create your first experiment](create-experiment.md).
* For details on how to deploy a Web service, see [Deploy a Machine Learning Web service](deploy-a-machine-learning-web-service.md).
* For more information about Machine Learning in general, visit the [Machine Learning Documentation Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/machine-learning/).



## Overview
With the Azure Machine Learning Web service, an external application communicates with a Machine Learning workflow scoring model in real time. A Machine Learning Web service call returns prediction results to an external application. To make a Machine Learning Web service call, you pass an API key that is created when you deploy a prediction. The Machine Learning Web service is based on REST, a popular architecture choice for web programming projects.

Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) has two types of services:

* Request-Response Service (RRS) – A low latency, highly scalable service that provides an interface to the stateless models created and deployed from the Machine Learning Studio (classic).
* Batch Execution Service (BES) – An asynchronous service that scores a batch for data records.

For more information about Machine Learning Web services, see [Deploy a Machine Learning Web service](deploy-a-machine-learning-web-service.md).

## Get an authorization key
When you deploy your experiment, API keys are generated for the Web service. You can retrieve the keys from several locations.

### From the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Web Services portal
Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Web Services](https://services.azureml.net) portal.

To retrieve the API key for a New Machine Learning Web service:

1. In the Azure Machine Learning Web Services portal, click **Web Services** the top menu.
2. Click the Web service for which you want to retrieve the key.
3. On the top menu, click **Consume**.
4. Copy and save the **Primary Key**.

To retrieve the API key for a Classic Machine Learning Web service:

1. In the Azure Machine Learning Web Services portal, click **Classic Web Services** the top menu.
2. Click the Web service with which you are working.
3. Click the endpoint for which you want to retrieve the key.

2. Click a Web service. The **API key** is on the **DASHBOARD** tab.

## <a id="connect"></a>Connect to a Machine Learning Web service
You can connect to a Machine Learning Web service using any programming language that supports HTTP request and response. You can view examples in C#, Python, and R from a Machine Learning Web service help page.

**Machine Learning API help**
Machine Learning API help is created when you deploy a Web service. See [Tutorial 3: Deploy credit risk model](tutorial-part3-credit-risk-deploy.md).
The Machine Learning API help contains details about a prediction Web service.

1. Click the Web service with which you are working.
2. Click the endpoint for which you want to view the API Help Page.
3. On the top menu, click **Consume**.
4. Click **API help page** under either the Request-Response or Batch Execution endpoints.

**To view Machine Learning API help for a New Web service**

In the [Azure Machine Learning Web Services Portal](https://services.azureml.net/):

1. Click **WEB SERVICES** on the top menu.
2. Click the Web service for which you want to retrieve the key.

Click **Use Web Service** to get the URIs for the Request-Response and Batch Execution Services and Sample code in C#, R, and Python.

Click **Swagger API** to get Swagger based documentation for the APIs called from the supplied URIs.

### C# Sample
To connect to a Machine Learning Web service, use an **HttpClient** passing ScoreData. ScoreData contains a FeatureVector, an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represents the ScoreData. You authenticate to the Machine Learning service with an API key.

To connect to a Machine Learning Web service, the **Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client** NuGet package must be installed.

**Install Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client NuGet in Visual Studio**

1. Publish the Download dataset from UCI: Adult 2 class dataset Web Service.
2. Click **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
3. Choose **Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client**.

**To run the code sample**

1. Publish "Sample 1: Download dataset from UCI: Adult 2 class dataset" experiment, part of the Machine Learning sample collection.
2. Assign apiKey with the key from a Web service. See **Get an authorization key** above.
3. Assign serviceUri with the Request URI.

**Here is what a complete request will look like.**

        {
            using (var client = new HttpClient())
            {
                var scoreRequest = new
                {
                    Inputs = new Dictionary<string, List<Dictionary<string, string>>> () {
                        {
                            "input1",
                            // Replace columns labels with those used in your dataset
                            new List<Dictionary<string, string>>(){new Dictionary<string, string>(){
                                    {
                                        "column1", "value1"
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "column2", "value2"
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "column3", "value3"
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        },
                    },
                    GlobalParameters = new Dictionary<string, string>() {}
                };

                // Replace these values with your API key and URI found on https://services.azureml.net/
                const string apiKey = "<your-api-key>"; 
                const string apiUri = "<your-api-uri>";
                
                client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue( "Bearer", apiKey);
                client.BaseAddress = new Uri(apiUri);

                // WARNING: The 'await' statement below can result in a deadlock
                // if you are calling this code from the UI thread of an ASP.NET application.
                // One way to address this would be to call ConfigureAwait(false)
                // so that the execution does not attempt to resume on the original context.
                // For instance, replace code such as:
                //      result = await DoSomeTask()
                // with the following:
                //      result = await DoSomeTask().ConfigureAwait(false)

                HttpResponseMessage response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync("", scoreRequest);

                if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
                {
                    string result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                    Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", result);
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("The request failed with status code: {0}", response.StatusCode));

                    // Print the headers - they include the request ID and the timestamp,
                    // which are useful for debugging the failure
                    Console.WriteLine(response.Headers.ToString());

                    string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                    Console.WriteLine(responseContent);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Python Sample
To connect to a Machine Learning Web service, use the **urllib2** library for Python 2.X and **urllib.request** library for Python 3.X. You will pass ScoreData, which contains a FeatureVector, an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represents the ScoreData. You authenticate to the Machine Learning service with an API key.

**To run the code sample**

1. Deploy "Sample 1: Download dataset from UCI: Adult 2 class dataset" experiment, part of the Machine Learning sample collection.
2. Assign apiKey with the key from a Web service. See the **Get an authorization key** section near the beginning of this article.
3. Assign serviceUri with the Request URI.

**Here is what a complete request will look like.**
```python
import urllib2 # urllib.request and urllib.error for Python 3.X
import json

data = {
    "Inputs": {
        "input1":
        [
            {
                'column1': "value1",   
                'column2': "value2",   
                'column3': "value3"
            }
        ],
    },
    "GlobalParameters":  {}
}

body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))

# Replace this with the URI and API Key for your web service
url = '<your-api-uri>'
api_key = '<your-api-key>'
headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json', 'Authorization':('Bearer '+ api_key)}

# "urllib.request.Request(url, body, headers)" for Python 3.X
req = urllib2.Request(url, body, headers)

try:
    # "urllib.request.urlopen(req)" for Python 3.X
    response = urllib2.urlopen(req)

    result = response.read()
    print(result)
# "urllib.error.HTTPError as error" for Python 3.X
except urllib2.HTTPError, error: 
    print("The request failed with status code: " + str(error.code))

    # Print the headers - they include the request ID and the timestamp, which are useful for debugging the failure
    print(error.info())
    print(json.loads(error.read())) 
```

### R Sample

To connect to a Machine Learning Web Service, use the **RCurl** and **rjson** libraries to make the request and process the returned JSON response. You will pass ScoreData, which contains a FeatureVector, an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represents the ScoreData. You authenticate to the Machine Learning service with an API key.

**Here is what a complete request will look like.**
```r
library("curl")
library("httr")
library("rjson")

requestFailed = function(response) {
    return (response$status_code >= 400)
}

printHttpResult = function(response, result) {
    if (requestFailed(response)) {
        print(paste("The request failed with status code:", response$status_code, sep=" "))
    
        # Print the headers - they include the request ID and the timestamp, which are useful for debugging the failure
        print(response$headers)
    }
    
    print("Result:") 
    print(fromJSON(result))  
}

req = list(
        Inputs = list( 
            "input1" = list(
                "ColumnNames" = list("Col1", "Col2", "Col3"),
                "Values" = list( list( "0", "value", "0" ),  list( "0", "value", "0" )  )
            )                ),
        GlobalParameters = setNames(fromJSON('{}'), character(0))
)

body = enc2utf8(toJSON(req))
api_key = "abc123" # Replace this with the API key for the web service
authz_hdr = paste('Bearer', api_key, sep=' ')

response = POST(url= "<your-api-uri>",
        add_headers("Content-Type" = "application/json", "Authorization" = authz_hdr),
        body = body)

result = content(response, type="text", encoding="UTF-8")

printHttpResult(response, result)
```

### JavaScript Sample

To connect to a Machine Learning Web Service, use the **request** npm package in your project. You will also use the `JSON` object to format your input and parse the result. Install using `npm install request --save`, or add `"request": "*"` to your package.json under `dependencies` and run `npm install`.

**Here is what a complete request will look like.**
```js
let req = require("request");

const uri = "<your-api-uri>";
const apiKey = "<your-api-key>";

let data = {
    "Inputs": {
        "input1":
        [
            {
                'column1': "value1",
                'column2': "value2",
                'column3': "value3"
            }
        ],
    },
    "GlobalParameters": {}
}

const options = {
    uri: uri,
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer " + apiKey,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
}

req(options, (err, res, body) => {
    if (!err && res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(body);
    } else {
        console.log("The request failed with status code: " + res.statusCode);
    }
});
```
