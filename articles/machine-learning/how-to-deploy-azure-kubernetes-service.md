# Deploy a model to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

Learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to deploy a model as a web service on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Azure Kubernetes Service is good for high-scale production deployments. Use Azure Kubernetes service if you need one or more of the following capabilities:

- __Fast response time__.
- __Autoscaling__ of the deployed service.
- __Hardware acceleration__ options such as GPU and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cluster scaling is not provided through the Azure Machine Learning SDK. For more information on scaling the nodes in an AKS cluster, see [Scale the node count in an AKS cluster](../aks/scale-cluster.md).

When deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service, you deploy to an AKS cluster that is __connected to your workspace__. There are two ways to connect an AKS cluster to your workspace:

* Create the AKS cluster using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, the Machine Learning CLI, or [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com). This process automatically connects the cluster to the workspace.
* Attach an existing AKS cluster to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. A cluster can be attached using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, Machine Learning CLI, or Azure Machine Learning studio.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The creation or attachment process is a one time task. Once an AKS cluster is connected to the workspace, you can use it for deployments. You can detach or delete the AKS cluster if you no longer need it. Once detached or deleted, you will no longer be able to deploy to the cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is highly advised to debug locally before deploying to the web service, for more information see [Debug Locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-troubleshoot-deployment#debug-locally)
>
> You can also refer to Azure Machine Learning - [Deploy to Local Notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/deployment/deploy-to-local)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more information, see [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

- A machine learning model registered in your workspace. If you don't have a registered model, see [How and where to deploy models](how-to-deploy-and-where.md).

- The [Azure CLI extension for Machine Learning service](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md), [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py), or the [Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension](tutorial-setup-vscode-extension.md).

- The __Python__ code snippets in this article assume that the following variables are set:

    * `ws` - Set to your workspace.
    * `model` - Set to your registered model.
    * `inference_config` - Set to the inference configuration for the model.

    For more information on setting these variables, see [How and where to deploy models](how-to-deploy-and-where.md).

- The __CLI__ snippets in this article assume that you've created an `inferenceconfig.json` document. For more information on creating this document, see [How and where to deploy models](how-to-deploy-and-where.md).

## Create a new AKS cluster

**Time estimate**: Approximately 20 minutes.

Creating or attaching an AKS cluster is a one time process for your workspace. You can reuse this cluster for multiple deployments. If you delete the cluster or the resource group that contains it, you must create a new cluster the next time you need to deploy. You can have multiple AKS clusters attached to your workspace.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to secure your AKS cluster using an Azure Virtual Network, you must create the virtual network first. For more information, see [Secure experimentation and inference with Azure Virtual Network](how-to-enable-virtual-network.md#aksvnet).

If you want to create an AKS cluster for __development__, __validation__, and __testing__ instead of production, you can specify the __cluster purpose__ to __dev test__.

> [!WARNING]
> If you set `cluster_purpose = AksCompute.ClusterPurpose.DEV_TEST`, the cluster that is created is not suitable for production level traffic and may increase inference times. Dev/test clusters also do not guarantee fault tolerance. We recommend at least 2 virtual CPUs for dev/test clusters.

The following examples demonstrate how to create a new AKS cluster using the SDK and CLI:

**Using the SDK**

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute, ComputeTarget

# Use the default configuration (you can also provide parameters to customize this).
# For example, to create a dev/test cluster, use:
# prov_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration(cluster_purpose = AksCompute.ClusterPurpose.DEV_TEST)
prov_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration()

aks_name = 'myaks'
# Create the cluster
aks_target = ComputeTarget.create(workspace = ws,
                                    name = aks_name,
                                    provisioning_configuration = prov_config)

# Wait for the create process to complete
aks_target.wait_for_completion(show_output = True)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [`provisioning_configuration()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.akscompute?view=azure-ml-py), if you pick custom values for `agent_count` and `vm_size`, and `cluster_purpose` is not `DEV_TEST`, then you need to make sure `agent_count` multiplied by `vm_size` is greater than or equal to 12 virtual CPUs. For example, if you use a `vm_size` of "Standard_D3_v2", which has 4 virtual CPUs, then you should pick an `agent_count` of 3 or greater.
>
> The Azure Machine Learning SDK does not provide support scaling an AKS cluster. To scale the nodes in the cluster, use the UI for your AKS cluster in the Azure Machine Learning studio. You can only change the node count, not the VM size of the cluster.

For more information on the classes, methods, and parameters used in this example, see the following reference documents:

* [AksCompute.ClusterPurpose](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.aks.akscompute.clusterpurpose?view=azure-ml-py)
* [AksCompute.provisioning_configuration](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.akscompute?view=azure-ml-py#attach-configuration-resource-group-none--cluster-name-none--resource-id-none--cluster-purpose-none-)
* [ComputeTarget.create](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.computetarget?view=azure-ml-py#create-workspace--name--provisioning-configuration-)
* [ComputeTarget.wait_for_completion](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.computetarget?view=azure-ml-py#wait-for-completion-show-output-false-)

**Using the CLI**

```azurecli
az ml computetarget create aks -n myaks
```

For more information, see the [az ml computetarget create aks](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/computetarget/create?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-computetarget-create-aks) reference.

## Attach an existing AKS cluster

**Time estimate:** Approximately 5 minutes.

If you already have AKS cluster in your Azure subscription, and it is version 1.17 or lower, you can use it to deploy your image.

> [!TIP]
> The existing AKS cluster can be in a Azure region other than your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
>
> If you want to secure your AKS cluster using an Azure Virtual Network, you must create the virtual network first. For more information, see [Secure experimentation and inference with Azure Virtual Network](how-to-enable-virtual-network.md#aksvnet).

When attaching an AKS cluster to a workspace, you can define how you will use the cluster by setting the `cluster_purpose` parameter.

If you do not set the `cluster_purpose` parameter, or set `cluster_purpose = AksCompute.ClusterPurpose.FAST_PROD`, then the cluster must have at least 12 virtual CPUs available.

If you set `cluster_purpose = AksCompute.ClusterPurpose.DEV_TEST`, then the cluster does not need to have 12 virtual CPUs. We recommend at least 2 virtual CPUs for dev/test. However a cluster that is configured for dev/test is not suitable for production level traffic and may increase inference times. Dev/test clusters also do not guarantee fault tolerance.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not create multiple, simultaneous attachments to the same AKS cluster from your workspace. For example, attaching one AKS cluster to a workspace using two different names. Each new attachment will break the previous existing attachment(s).
>
> If you want to re-attach an AKS cluster, for example to change TLS or other cluster configuration setting, you must first remove the existing attachment by using [AksCompute.detach()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.akscompute?view=azure-ml-py#detach--).

For more information on creating an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI or portal, see the following articles:

* [Create an AKS cluster (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aks?toc=%2Fazure%2Faks%2FTOC.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fbread%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create)
* [Create an AKS cluster (portal)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal?view=azure-cli-latest)
* [Create an AKS cluster (ARM Template on Azure Quickstart templates)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-aks-azml-targetcompute)

The following examples demonstrate how to attach an existing AKS cluster to your workspace:

**Using the SDK**

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute, ComputeTarget
# Set the resource group that contains the AKS cluster and the cluster name
resource_group = 'myresourcegroup'
cluster_name = 'myexistingcluster'

# Attach the cluster to your workgroup. If the cluster has less than 12 virtual CPUs, use the following instead:
# attach_config = AksCompute.attach_configuration(resource_group = resource_group,
#                                         cluster_name = cluster_name,
#                                         cluster_purpose = AksCompute.ClusterPurpose.DEV_TEST)
attach_config = AksCompute.attach_configuration(resource_group = resource_group,
                                         cluster_name = cluster_name)
aks_target = ComputeTarget.attach(ws, 'myaks', attach_config)
```

For more information on the classes, methods, and parameters used in this example, see the following reference documents:

* [AksCompute.attach_configuration()](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.akscompute?view=azure-ml-py#attach-configuration-resource-group-none--cluster-name-none--resource-id-none--cluster-purpose-none-)
* [AksCompute.ClusterPurpose](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.aks.akscompute.clusterpurpose?view=azure-ml-py)
* [AksCompute.attach](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.computetarget?view=azure-ml-py#attach-workspace--name--attach-configuration-)

**Using the CLI**

To attach an existing cluster using the CLI, you need to get the resource ID of the existing cluster. To get this value, use the following command. Replace `myexistingcluster` with the name of your AKS cluster. Replace `myresourcegroup` with the resource group that contains the cluster:

```azurecli
az aks show -n myexistingcluster -g myresourcegroup --query id
```

This command returns a value similar to the following text:

```text
/subscriptions/{GUID}/resourcegroups/{myresourcegroup}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/{myexistingcluster}
```

To attach the existing cluster to your workspace, use the following command. Replace `aksresourceid` with the value returned by the previous command. Replace `myresourcegroup` with the resource group that contains your workspace. Replace `myworkspace` with your workspace name.

```azurecli
az ml computetarget attach aks -n myaks -i aksresourceid -g myresourcegroup -w myworkspace
```

For more information, see the [az ml computetarget attach aks](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/computetarget/attach?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-computetarget-attach-aks) reference.

## Deploy to AKS

To deploy a model to Azure Kubernetes Service, create a __deployment configuration__ that describes the compute resources needed. For example, number of cores and memory. You also need an __inference configuration__, which describes the environment needed to host the model and web service. For more information on creating the inference configuration, see [How and where to deploy models](how-to-deploy-and-where.md).

### Using the SDK

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import AksWebservice, Webservice
from azureml.core.model import Model

aks_target = AksCompute(ws,"myaks")
# If deploying to a cluster configured for dev/test, ensure that it was created with enough
# cores and memory to handle this deployment configuration. Note that memory is also used by
# things such as dependencies and AML components.
deployment_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores = 1, memory_gb = 1)
service = Model.deploy(ws, "myservice", [model], inference_config, deployment_config, aks_target)
service.wait_for_deployment(show_output = True)
print(service.state)
print(service.get_logs())
```

For more information on the classes, methods, and parameters used in this example, see the following reference documents:

* [AksCompute](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.aks.akscompute?view=azure-ml-py)
* [AksWebservice.deploy_configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.aks.aksservicedeploymentconfiguration?view=azure-ml-py)
* [Model.deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model.model?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-workspace--name--models--inference-config-none--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none--overwrite-false-)
* [Webservice.wait_for_deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice%28class%29?view=azure-ml-py#wait-for-deployment-show-output-false-)

### Using the CLI

To deploy using the CLI, use the following command. Replace `myaks` with the name of the AKS compute target. Replace `mymodel:1` with the name and version of the registered model. Replace `myservice` with the name to give this service:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml model deploy -ct myaks -m mymodel:1 -n myservice -ic inferenceconfig.json -dc deploymentconfig.json
```

[!INCLUDE [deploymentconfig](../../includes/machine-learning-service-aks-deploy-config.md)]

For more information, see the [az ml model deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/model?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-model-deploy) reference.

### Using VS Code

For information on using VS Code, see [deploy to AKS via the VS Code extension](tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode.md#deploy-the-model).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploying through VS Code requires the AKS cluster to be created or attached to your workspace in advance.

## Deploy models to AKS using controlled rollout (preview)

Analyze and promote model versions in a controlled fashion using endpoints. You can deploy up to six versions behind a single endpoint. Endpoints provide the following capabilities:

* Configure the __percentage of scoring traffic sent to each endpoint__. For example, route 20% of the traffic to endpoint 'test' and 80% to 'production'.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not account for 100% of the traffic, any remaining percentage is routed to the __default__ endpoint version. For example, if you configure endpoint version 'test' to get 10% of the traffic, and 'prod' for 30%, the remaining 60% is sent to the default endpoint version.
    >
    > The first endpoint version created is automatically configured as the default. You can change this by setting `is_default=True` when creating or updating an endpoint version.
     
* Tag an endpoint version as either __control__ or __treatment__. For example, the current production endpoint version might be the control, while potential new models are deployed as treatment versions. After evaluating performance of the treatment versions, if one outperforms the current control, it might be promoted to the new production/control.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only have __one__ control. You can have multiple treatments.

You can enable app insights to view operational metrics of endpoints and deployed versions.

### Create an endpoint
Once you are ready to deploy your models, create a scoring endpoint and deploy your first version. The following example shows how to deploy and create the endpoint using the SDK. The first deployment will be defined as the default version, which means that unspecified traffic percentile across all versions will go to the default version.  

> [!TIP]
> In the following example, the configuration sets the initial endpoint version to handle 20% of the traffic. Since this is the first endpoint, it's also the default version. And since we don't have any other versions for the other 80% of traffic, it is routed to the default as well. Until other versions that take a percentage of traffic are deployed, this one effectively receives 100% of the traffic.

```python
import azureml.core,
from azureml.core.webservice import AksEndpoint
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget
# select a created compute
compute = ComputeTarget(ws, 'myaks')
namespace_name= endpointnamespace
# define the endpoint and version name
endpoint_name = "mynewendpoint"
version_name= "versiona"
# create the deployment config and define the scoring traffic percentile for the first deployment
endpoint_deployment_config = AksEndpoint.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores = 0.1, memory_gb = 0.2,
                                                              enable_app_insights = True,
                                                              tags = {'sckitlearn':'demo'},
                                                              description = "testing versions",
                                                              version_name = version_name,
                                                              traffic_percentile = 20)
 # deploy the model and endpoint
 endpoint = Model.deploy(ws, endpoint_name, [model], inference_config, endpoint_deployment_config, compute)
 # Wait for he process to complete
 endpoint.wait_for_deployment(True)
 ```

### Update and add versions to an endpoint

Add another version to your endpoint and configure the scoring traffic percentile going to the version. There are two types of versions, a control and a treatment version. There can be multiple treatment versions to help compare against a single control version.

> [!TIP]
> The second version, created by the following code snippet, accepts 10% of traffic. The first version is configured for 20%, so only 30% of the traffic is configured for specific versions. The remaining 70% is sent to the first endpoint version, because it is also the default version.

 ```python
from azureml.core.webservice import AksEndpoint

# add another model deployment to the same endpoint as above
version_name_add = "versionb"
endpoint.create_version(version_name = version_name_add,
                        inference_config=inference_config,
                        models=[model],
                        tags = {'modelVersion':'b'},
                        description = "my second version",
                        traffic_percentile = 10)
endpoint.wait_for_deployment(True)
```

Update existing versions or delete them in an endpoint. You can change the version's default type, control type, and the traffic percentile. In the following example, the second version increases its traffic to 40% and is now the default.

> [!TIP]
> After the following code snippet, the second version is now default. It is now configured for 40%, while the original version is still configured for 20%. This means that 40% of traffic is not accounted for by version configurations. The leftover traffic will be routed to the second version, because it is now default. It effectively receives 80% of the traffic.

 ```python
from azureml.core.webservice import AksEndpoint

# update the version's scoring traffic percentage and if it is a default or control type
endpoint.update_version(version_name=endpoint.versions["versionb"].name,
                        description="my second version update",
                        traffic_percentile=40,
                        is_default=True,
                        is_control_version_type=True)
# Wait for the process to complete before deleting
endpoint.wait_for_deployment(true)
# delete a version in an endpoint
endpoint.delete_version(version_name="versionb")

```


## Web service authentication

When deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service, __key-based__ authentication is enabled by default. You can also enable __token-based__ authentication. Token-based authentication requires clients to use an Azure Active Directory account to request an authentication token, which is used to make requests to the deployed service.

To __disable__ authentication, set the `auth_enabled=False` parameter when creating the deployment configuration. The following example disables authentication using the SDK:

```python
deployment_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores=1, memory_gb=1, auth_enabled=False)
```

For information on authenticating from a client application, see the [Consume an Azure Machine Learning model deployed as a web service](how-to-consume-web-service.md).

### Authentication with keys

If key authentication is enabled, you can use the `get_keys` method to retrieve a primary and secondary authentication key:

```python
primary, secondary = service.get_keys()
print(primary)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need to regenerate a key, use [`service.regen_key`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice(class)?view=azure-ml-py)

### Authentication with tokens

To enable token authentication, set the `token_auth_enabled=True` parameter when you are creating or updating a deployment. The following example enables token authentication using the SDK:

```python
deployment_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores=1, memory_gb=1, token_auth_enabled=True)
```

If token authentication is enabled, you can use the `get_token` method to retrieve a JWT token and that token's expiration time:

```python
token, refresh_by = service.get_token()
print(token)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to request a new token after the token's `refresh_by` time.
>
> Microsoft strongly recommends that you create your Azure Machine Learning workspace in the same region as your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. To authenticate with a token, the web service will make a call to the region in which your Azure Machine Learning workspace is created. If your workspace's region is unavailable, then you will not be able to fetch a token for your web service even, if your cluster is in a different region than your workspace. This effectively results in Token-based Authentication being unavailable until your workspace's region is available again. In addition, the greater the distance between your cluster's region and your workspace's region, the longer it will take to fetch a token.
>
> To retrieve a token, you must use the Azure Machine Learning SDK or the [az ml service get-access-token](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-ml/ml/service?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-cli-ml-az-ml-service-get-access-token) command.
