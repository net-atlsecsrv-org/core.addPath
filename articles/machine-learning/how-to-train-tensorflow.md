# Build a TensorFlow deep learning model at scale with Azure Machine Learning
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

This article shows you how to run your [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview) training scripts at scale using Azure Machine Learning's [TensorFlow estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.dnn.tensorflow?view=azure-ml-py) class. This example trains and registers a TensorFlow model to classify handwritten digits using a deep neural network (DNN).

Whether you're developing a TensorFlow model from the ground-up or you're bringing an [existing model](how-to-deploy-existing-model.md) into the cloud, you can use Azure Machine Learning to scale out open-source training jobs to build, deploy, version, and monitor production-grade models.

Learn more about [deep learning vs machine learning](concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning.md).

## Prerequisites

Run this code on either of these environments:

 - Azure Machine Learning compute instance - no downloads or installation necessary

     - Complete the [Tutorial: Setup environment and workspace](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md) to create a dedicated notebook server pre-loaded with the SDK and the sample repository.
    - In the samples deep learning folder on the notebook server, find a completed and expanded notebook by navigating to this directory: **how-to-use-azureml > ml-frameworks > tensorflow > deployment > train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow** folder. 
 
 - Your own Jupyter Notebook server

    - [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py).
    - [Create a workspace configuration file](how-to-configure-environment.md#workspace).
    - [Download the sample script files](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/ml-frameworks/tensorflow/deployment/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow) `mnist-tf.py` and `utils.py`
     
    You can also find a completed [Jupyter Notebook version](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/ml-frameworks/tensorflow/deployment/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-tensorflow.ipynb) of this guide on the GitHub samples page. The notebook includes expanded sections covering intelligent hyperparameter tuning, model deployment, and notebook widgets.

## Set up the experiment

This section sets up the training experiment by loading the required Python packages, initializing a workspace, creating an experiment, and uploading the training data and training scripts.

### Import packages

First, import the necessary Python libraries.

```Python
import os
import urllib
import shutil
import azureml

from azureml.core import Experiment
from azureml.core import Workspace, Run

from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException
from azureml.train.dnn import TensorFlow
```

### Initialize a workspace

The [Azure Machine Learning workspace](concept-workspace.md) is the top-level resource for the service. It provides you with a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create. In the Python SDK, you can access the workspace artifacts by creating a [`workspace`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace?view=azure-ml-py) object.

Create a workspace object from the `config.json` file created in the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

```Python
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

### Create a deep learning experiment

Create an experiment and a folder to hold your training scripts. In this example, create an experiment called "tf-mnist".

```Python
script_folder = './tf-mnist'
os.makedirs(script_folder, exist_ok=True)

exp = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='tf-mnist')
```

### Create a file dataset

A `FileDataset` object references one or multiple files in your workspace datastore or public urls. The files can be of any format, and the class provides you with the ability to download or mount the files to your compute. By creating a `FileDataset`, you create a reference to the data source location. If you applied any transformations to the data set, they will be stored in the data set as well. The data remains in its existing location, so no extra storage cost is incurred. See the [how-to](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-register-datasets) guide on the `Dataset` package for more information.

```python
from azureml.core.dataset import Dataset

web_paths = [
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'
            ]
dataset = Dataset.File.from_files(path=web_paths)
```

Use the `register()` method to register the data set to your workspace so they can be shared with others, reused across various experiments, and referred to by name in your training script.

```python
dataset = dataset.register(workspace=ws,
                           name='mnist dataset',
                           description='training and test dataset',
                           create_new_version=True)

# list the files referenced by dataset
dataset.to_path()
```

## Create a compute target

Create a compute target for your TensorFlow job to run on. In this example, create a GPU-enabled Azure Machine Learning compute cluster.

```Python
cluster_name = "gpucluster"

try:
    compute_target = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=cluster_name)
    print('Found existing compute target')
except ComputeTargetException:
    print('Creating a new compute target...')
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size='STANDARD_NC6', 
                                                           max_nodes=4)

    compute_target = ComputeTarget.create(ws, cluster_name, compute_config)

    compute_target.wait_for_completion(show_output=True, min_node_count=None, timeout_in_minutes=20)
```

For more information on compute targets, see the [what is a compute target](concept-compute-target.md) article.

## Create a TensorFlow estimator

The [TensorFlow estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.dnn.tensorflow?view=azure-ml-py) provides a simple way of launching a TensorFlow training job on a compute target.

The TensorFlow estimator is implemented through the generic [`estimator`](https://docs.microsoft.com//python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.estimator.estimator?view=azure-ml-py) class, which can be used to support any framework. For more information about training models using the generic estimator, see [train models with Azure Machine Learning using estimator](how-to-train-ml-models.md)

If your training script needs additional pip or conda packages to run, you can have the packages installed on the resulting Docker image by passing their names through the `pip_packages` and `conda_packages` arguments.

```python
script_params = {
    '--data-folder': dataset.as_named_input('mnist').as_mount(),
    '--batch-size': 50,
    '--first-layer-neurons': 300,
    '--second-layer-neurons': 100,
    '--learning-rate': 0.01
}

est = TensorFlow(source_directory=script_folder,
                 entry_script='tf_mnist.py',
                 script_params=script_params,
                 compute_target=compute_target,
                 use_gpu=True,
                 pip_packages=['azureml-dataprep[pandas,fuse]'])
```

> [!TIP]
> Support for **Tensorflow 2.0** has been added to the Tensorflow estimator class. See the [blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/tensorflow-2-0-on-azure-fine-tuning-bert-for-question-tagging/) for more information.

For more information on customizing your Python environment, see [Create and manage environments for training and deployment](how-to-use-environments.md). 

## Submit a run

The [Run object](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run%28class%29?view=azure-ml-py) provides the interface to the run history while the job is running and after it has completed.

```Python
run = exp.submit(est)
run.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

As the Run is executed, it goes through the following stages:

- **Preparing**: A Docker image is created according to the TensorFlow estimator. The image is uploaded to the workspace's container registry and cached for later runs. Logs are also streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor progress.

- **Scaling**: The cluster attempts to scale up if the Batch AI cluster requires more nodes to execute the run than are currently available.

- **Running**: All scripts in the script folder are uploaded to the compute target, data stores are mounted or copied, and the entry_script is executed. Outputs from stdout and the ./logs folder are streamed to the run history and can be used to monitor the run.

- **Post-Processing**: The ./outputs folder of the run is copied over to the run history.

## Register or download a model

Once you've trained the model, you can register it to your workspace. Model registration lets you store and version your models in your workspace to simplify [model management and deployment](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md). By specifying the parameters `model_framework`, `model_framework_version`, and `resource_configuration`, no-code model deployment becomes available. This allows you to directly deploy your model as a web service from the registered model, and the `ResourceConfiguration` object defines the compute resource for the web service.

```Python
from azureml.core import Model
from azureml.core.resource_configuration import ResourceConfiguration

model = run.register_model(model_name='tf-dnn-mnist', 
                           model_path='outputs/model',
                           model_framework=Model.Framework.TENSORFLOW,
                           model_framework_version='1.13.0',
                           resource_configuration=ResourceConfiguration(cpu=1, memory_in_gb=0.5))
```

You can also download a local copy of the model by using the Run object. In the training script `mnist-tf.py`, a TensorFlow saver object persists the model to a local folder (local to the compute target). You can use the Run object to download a copy.

```Python
# Create a model folder in the current directory
os.makedirs('./model', exist_ok=True)

for f in run.get_file_names():
    if f.startswith('outputs/model'):
        output_file_path = os.path.join('./model', f.split('/')[-1])
        print('Downloading from {} to {} ...'.format(f, output_file_path))
        run.download_file(name=f, output_file_path=output_file_path)
```

## Distributed training

The [`TensorFlow`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.dnn.tensorflow?view=azure-ml-py) estimator also supports distributed training across CPU and GPU clusters. You can easily run distributed TensorFlow jobs and Azure Machine Learning will manage the orchestration for you.

Azure Machine Learning supports two methods of distributed training in TensorFlow:

- [MPI-based](https://www.open-mpi.org/) distributed training using the [Horovod](https://github.com/uber/horovod) framework
- Native [distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed) using the parameter server method

### Horovod

[Horovod](https://github.com/uber/horovod) is an open-source framework for distributed training developed by Uber. It offers an easy path to distributed GPU TensorFlow jobs.

To use Horovod, specify an [`MpiConfiguration`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.runconfig.mpiconfiguration?view=azure-ml-py) object for the `distributed_training` parameter in the TensorFlow constructor. This  parameter ensures that Horovod library is installed for you to use in your training script.

```Python
from azureml.core.runconfig import MpiConfiguration
from azureml.train.dnn import TensorFlow

# Tensorflow constructor
estimator= TensorFlow(source_directory=project_folder,
                      compute_target=compute_target,
                      script_params=script_params,
                      entry_script='script.py',
                      node_count=2,
                      process_count_per_node=1,
                      distributed_training=MpiConfiguration(),
                      framework_version='1.13',
                      use_gpu=True,
                      pip_packages=['azureml-dataprep[pandas,fuse]'])
```

### Parameter server

You can also run [native distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed), which uses the parameter server model. In this method, you train across a cluster of parameter servers and workers. The workers calculate the gradients during training, while the parameter servers aggregate the gradients.

To use the parameter server method, specify a [`TensorflowConfiguration`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.runconfig.tensorflowconfiguration?view=azure-ml-py) object for the `distributed_training` parameter in the TensorFlow constructor.

```Python
from azureml.train.dnn import TensorFlow

distributed_training = TensorflowConfiguration()
distributed_training.worker_count = 2

# Tensorflow constructor
tf_est= TensorFlow(source_directory=project_folder,
                      compute_target=compute_target,
                      script_params=script_params,
                      entry_script='script.py',
                      node_count=2,
                      process_count_per_node=1,
                      distributed_training=distributed_training,
                      use_gpu=True,
                      pip_packages=['azureml-dataprep[pandas,fuse]'])

# submit the TensorFlow job
run = exp.submit(tf_est)
```

#### Define cluster specifications in 'TF_CONFIG`

You also need the network addresses and ports of the cluster for the [`tf.train.ClusterSpec`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/ClusterSpec), so Azure Machine Learning sets the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable for you.

The `TF_CONFIG` environment variable is a JSON string. Here is an example of the variable for a parameter server:

```JSON
TF_CONFIG='{
    "cluster": {
        "ps": ["host0:2222", "host1:2222"],
        "worker": ["host2:2222", "host3:2222", "host4:2222"],
    },
    "task": {"type": "ps", "index": 0},
    "environment": "cloud"
}'
```

For TensorFlow's high level [`tf.estimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator) API, TensorFlow parses the `TF_CONFIG` variable and builds the cluster spec for you.

For TensorFlow's lower-level core APIs for training, parse the `TF_CONFIG` variable and build the `tf.train.ClusterSpec` in your training code.

```Python
import os, json
import tensorflow as tf

tf_config = os.environ.get('TF_CONFIG')
if not tf_config or tf_config == "":
    raise ValueError("TF_CONFIG not found.")
tf_config_json = json.loads(tf_config)
cluster_spec = tf.train.ClusterSpec(cluster)

```

## Deploy a TensorFlow model

The model you just registered can be deployed the exact same way as any other registered model in Azure Machine Learning, regardless of which estimator you used for training. The deployment how-to contains a section on registering models, but you can skip directly to [creating a compute target](how-to-deploy-and-where.md#choose-a-compute-target) for deployment, since you already have a registered model.

## (Preview) No-code model deployment

Instead of the traditional deployment route, you can also use the no-code deployment feature (preview) for Tensorflow. By registering your model as shown above with the `model_framework`, `model_framework_version`, and `resource_configuration` parameters, you can simply use the `deploy()` static function to deploy your model.

```python
service = Model.deploy(ws, "tensorflow-web-service", [model])
```

The full [how-to](how-to-deploy-and-where.md) covers deployment in Azure Machine Learning in greater depth.
