# Troubleshooting the ParallelRunStep

In this article, you learn how to troubleshoot when you get errors using the [ParallelRunStep](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps.parallel_run_step.parallelrunstep?preserve-view=true&view=azure-ml-py) class from the [Azure Machine Learning SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?preserve-view=true&view=azure-ml-py).

For general tips on troubleshooting a pipeline, see [Troubleshooting machine learning pipelines](how-to-debug-pipelines.md).

## Testing scripts locally

 Your ParallelRunStep runs as a step in ML pipelines. You may want to [test your scripts locally](how-to-debug-visual-studio-code.md#debug-and-troubleshoot-machine-learning-pipelines) as a first step.

##  Script requirements

The script for a `ParallelRunStep` *must contain* two functions:
- `init()`: Use this function for any costly or common preparation for later inference. For example, use it to load the model into a global object. This function will be called only once at beginning of process.
-  `run(mini_batch)`: The function will run for each `mini_batch` instance.
    -  `mini_batch`: `ParallelRunStep` will invoke run method and pass either a list or pandas `DataFrame` as an argument to the method. Each entry in mini_batch will be a file path if input is a `FileDataset` or a pandas `DataFrame` if input is a `TabularDataset`.
    -  `response`: run() method should return a pandas `DataFrame` or an array. For append_row output_action, these returned elements are appended into the common output file. For summary_only, the contents of the elements are ignored. For all output actions, each returned output element indicates one successful run of input element in the input mini-batch. Make sure that enough data is included in run result to map input to run output result. Run output will be written in output file and not guaranteed to be in order, you should use some key in the output to map it to input.

```python
%%writefile digit_identification.py
# Snippets from a sample script.
# Refer to the accompanying digit_identification.py
# (https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/machine-learning-pipelines/parallel-run)
# for the implementation script.

import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from PIL import Image
from azureml.core import Model


def init():
    global g_tf_sess

    # Pull down the model from the workspace
    model_path = Model.get_model_path("mnist")

    # Construct a graph to execute
    tf.reset_default_graph()
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(os.path.join(model_path, 'mnist-tf.model.meta'))
    g_tf_sess = tf.Session()
    saver.restore(g_tf_sess, os.path.join(model_path, 'mnist-tf.model'))


def run(mini_batch):
    print(f'run method start: {__file__}, run({mini_batch})')
    resultList = []
    in_tensor = g_tf_sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name("network/X:0")
    output = g_tf_sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name("network/output/MatMul:0")

    for image in mini_batch:
        # Prepare each image
        data = Image.open(image)
        np_im = np.array(data).reshape((1, 784))
        # Perform inference
        inference_result = output.eval(feed_dict={in_tensor: np_im}, session=g_tf_sess)
        # Find the best probability, and add it to the result list
        best_result = np.argmax(inference_result)
        resultList.append("{}: {}".format(os.path.basename(image), best_result))

    return resultList
```

If you have another file or folder in the same directory as your inference script, you can reference it by finding the current working directory.

```python
script_dir = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(__file__, '..',))
file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "<file_name>")
```

### Parameters for ParallelRunConfig

`ParallelRunConfig` is the major configuration for `ParallelRunStep` instance within the Azure Machine Learning pipeline. You use it to wrap your script and configure necessary parameters, including all of the following entries:
- `entry_script`: A user script as a local file path that will be run in parallel on multiple nodes. If `source_directory` is present, use a relative path. Otherwise, use any path that's accessible on the machine.
- `mini_batch_size`: The size of the mini-batch passed to a single `run()` call. (optional; the default value is `10` files for `FileDataset` and `1MB` for `TabularDataset`.)
    - For `FileDataset`, it's the number of files with a minimum value of `1`. You can combine multiple files into one mini-batch.
    - For `TabularDataset`, it's the size of data. Example values are `1024`, `1024KB`, `10MB`, and `1GB`. The recommended value is `1MB`. The mini-batch from `TabularDataset` will never cross file boundaries. For example, if you have .csv files with various sizes, the smallest file is 100 KB and the largest is 10 MB. If you set `mini_batch_size = 1MB`, then files with a size smaller than 1 MB will be treated as one mini-batch. Files with a size larger than 1 MB will be split into multiple mini-batches.
- `error_threshold`: The number of record failures for `TabularDataset` and file failures for `FileDataset` that should be ignored during processing. If the error count for the entire input goes above this value, the job will be aborted. The error threshold is for the entire input and not for individual mini-batch sent to the `run()` method. The range is `[-1, int.max]`. The `-1` part indicates ignoring all failures during processing.
- `output_action`: One of the following values indicates how the output will be organized:
    - `summary_only`: The user script will store the output. `ParallelRunStep` will use the output only for the error threshold calculation.
    - `append_row`: For all inputs, only one file will be created in the output folder to append all outputs separated by line.
- `append_row_file_name`: To customize the output file name for append_row output_action (optional; default value is `parallel_run_step.txt`).
- `source_directory`: Paths to folders that contain all files to execute on the compute target (optional).
- `compute_target`: Only `AmlCompute` is supported.
- `node_count`: The number of compute nodes to be used for running the user script.
- `process_count_per_node`: The number of processes per node. Best practice is to set to the number of GPU or CPU one node has (optional; default value is `1`).
- `environment`: The Python environment definition. You can configure it to use an existing Python environment or to set up a temporary environment. The definition is also responsible for setting the required application dependencies (optional).
- `logging_level`: Log verbosity. Values in increasing verbosity are: `WARNING`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`. (optional; the default value is `INFO`)
- `run_invocation_timeout`: The `run()` method invocation timeout in seconds. (optional; default value is `60`)
- `run_max_try`: Maximum try count of `run()` for a mini-batch. A `run()` is failed if an exception is thrown, or nothing is returned when `run_invocation_timeout` is reached (optional; default value is `3`). 

You can specify `mini_batch_size`, `node_count`, `process_count_per_node`, `logging_level`, `run_invocation_timeout`, and `run_max_try` as `PipelineParameter`, so that when you resubmit a pipeline run, you can fine-tune the parameter values. In this example, you use `PipelineParameter` for `mini_batch_size` and `Process_count_per_node` and you will change these values when resubmit a run later. 

### Parameters for creating the ParallelRunStep

Create the ParallelRunStep by using the script, environment configuration, and parameters. Specify the compute target that you already attached to your workspace as the target of execution for your inference script. Use `ParallelRunStep` to create the batch inference pipeline step, which takes all the following parameters:
- `name`: The name of the step, with the following naming restrictions: unique, 3-32 characters, and regex ^\[a-z\]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$.
- `parallel_run_config`: A `ParallelRunConfig` object, as defined earlier.
- `inputs`: One or more single-typed Azure Machine Learning datasets to be partitioned for parallel processing.
- `side_inputs`: One or more reference data or datasets used as side inputs without need to be partitioned.
- `output`: A `PipelineData` object that corresponds to the output directory.
- `arguments`: A list of arguments passed to the user script. Use unknown_args to retrieve them in your entry script (optional).
- `allow_reuse`: Whether the step should reuse previous results when run with the same settings/inputs. If this parameter is `False`, a new run will always be generated for this step during pipeline execution. (optional; the default value is `True`.)

```python
from azureml.pipeline.steps import ParallelRunStep

parallelrun_step = ParallelRunStep(
    name="predict-digits-mnist",
    parallel_run_config=parallel_run_config,
    inputs=[input_mnist_ds_consumption],
    output=output_dir,
    allow_reuse=True
)
```

## Debugging scripts from remote context

The transition from debugging a scoring script locally to debugging a scoring script in an actual pipeline can be a difficult leap. For information on finding your logs in the portal, see  [machine learning pipelines section on debugging scripts from a remote context](how-to-debug-pipelines.md). The information in that section also applies to a ParallelRunStep.

For example, the log file `70_driver_log.txt` contains information from the controller that launches the ParallelRunStep code.

Because of the distributed nature of ParallelRunStep jobs, there are logs from several different sources. However, two consolidated files are created that provide high-level information:

- `~/logs/job_progress_overview.txt`: This file provides a high-level info about the number of mini-batches (also known as tasks) created so far and number of mini-batches processed so far. At this end, it shows the result of the job. If the job failed, it will show the error message and where to start the troubleshooting.

- `~/logs/sys/master_role.txt`: This file provides the principal node (also known as the orchestrator) view of the running job. Includes task creation, progress monitoring, the run result.

Logs generated from entry script using EntryScript helper and print statements will be found in following files:

- `~/logs/user/entry_script_log/<ip_address>/<process_name>.log.txt`: These files are the logs written from entry_script using EntryScript helper.

- `~/logs/user/stdout/<ip_address>/<process_name>.stdout.txt`: These files are the logs from stdout (e.g. print statement) of entry_script.

- `~/logs/user/stderr/<ip_address>/<process_name>.stderr.txt`: These files are the logs from stderr of entry_script.

For a concise understanding of errors in your script there is:

- `~/logs/user/error.txt`: This file will try to summarize the errors in your script.

For more information on errors in your script, there is:

- `~/logs/user/error/`: Contains full stack traces of exceptions thrown while loading and running entry script.

When you need a full understanding of how each node executed the score script, look at the individual process logs for each node. The process logs can be found in the `sys/node` folder, grouped by worker nodes:

- `~/logs/sys/node/<ip_address>/<process_name>.txt`: This file provides detailed info about each mini-batch as it's picked up or completed by a worker. For each mini-batch, this file includes:

    - The IP address and the PID of the worker process. 
    - The total number of items, successfully processed items count, and failed item count.
    - The start time, duration, process time and run method time.

You can also find information on the resource usage of the processes for each worker. This information is in CSV format and is located at `~/logs/sys/perf/<ip_address>/node_resource_usage.csv`. Information about each process is available under `~logs/sys/perf/<ip_address>/processes_resource_usage.csv`.

### How do I log from my user script from a remote context?

ParallelRunStep may run multiple processes on one node based on process_count_per_node. In order to organize logs from each process on node and combine print and log statement, we recommend using ParallelRunStep logger as shown below. You get a logger from EntryScript and make the logs show up in **logs/user** folder in the portal.

**A sample entry script using the logger:**
```python
from azureml_user.parallel_run import EntryScript

def init():
    """ Initialize the node."""
    entry_script = EntryScript()
    logger = entry_script.logger
    logger.debug("This will show up in files under logs/user on the Azure portal.")


def run(mini_batch):
    """ Accept and return the list back."""
    # This class is in singleton pattern and will return same instance as the one in init()
    entry_script = EntryScript()
    logger = entry_script.logger
    logger.debug(f"{__file__}: {mini_batch}.")
    ...

    return mini_batch
```

### How could I pass a side input such as, a file or file(s) containing a lookup table, to all my workers?

User can pass reference data to script using side_inputs parameter of ParalleRunStep. All datasets provided as side_inputs will be mounted on each worker node. User can get the location of mount by passing argument.

Construct a [Dataset](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.dataset.dataset?preserve-view=true&view=azure-ml-py) containing the reference data and register it with your workspace. Pass it to the `side_inputs` parameter of your `ParallelRunStep`. Additionally, you can add its path in the `arguments` section to easily access its mounted path:

```python
label_config = label_ds.as_named_input("labels_input")
batch_score_step = ParallelRunStep(
    name=parallel_step_name,
    inputs=[input_images.as_named_input("input_images")],
    output=output_dir,
    arguments=["--labels_dir", label_config],
    side_inputs=[label_config],
    parallel_run_config=parallel_run_config,
)
```

After that you can access it in your inference script (for example, in your init() method) as follows:

```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--labels_dir', dest="labels_dir", required=True)
args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()

labels_path = args.labels_dir
```

### How to use input datasets with service principal authentication?

User can pass input datasets with service principal authentication used in workspace. Using such dataset in ParallelRunStep requires that dataset to be registered for it to construct ParallelRunStep configuration.

```python
service_principal = ServicePrincipalAuthentication(
    tenant_id="***",
    service_principal_id="***",
    service_principal_password="***")
 
ws = Workspace(
    subscription_id="***",
    resource_group="***",
    workspace_name="***",
    auth=service_principal
    )
 
default_blob_store = ws.get_default_datastore() # or Datastore(ws, '***datastore-name***') 
ds = Dataset.File.from_files(default_blob_store, '**path***')
registered_ds = ds.register(ws, '***dataset-name***', create_new_version=True)
```
