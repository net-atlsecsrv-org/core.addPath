### Confusion matrix

#### What is a confusion matrix?
A confusion matrix is used to describe the performance of a classification model. Each row displays the instances of the true, or actual class in your dataset, and each column represents the instances of the class that was predicted by the model. 

#### What does automated ML do with the confusion matrix?
For classification problems, Azure Machine Learning automatically provides a confusion matrix for each model that is built. For each confusion matrix, automated ML will show the frequency of each predicted label (column) compared against the true label (row). The darker the color, the higher the count in that particular part of the matrix. 

#### What does a good model look like?
We are comparing the actual value of the dataset against the predicted values that the model gave. Because of this, machine learning models have higher accuracy if the model has most of its values along the diagonal, meaning the model predicted the correct value. If a model has class imbalance, the confusion matrix will help to detect a biased model.

##### Example 1: A classification model with poor accuracy
![A classification model with poor accuracy](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-confusion-matrix1.png)

##### Example 2: A classification model with high accuracy 
![A classification model with high accuracy](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-confusion-matrix2.png)

##### Example 3: A classification model with high accuracy and high bias in model predictions
![A classification model with high accuracy and high bias in model predictions](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-biased-model.png)

<a name="precision-recall-chart"></a>
### Precision-recall chart
#### What is a precision-recall chart?
The precision-recall curve shows the relationship between precision and recall from a model. The term precision represents that ability for a model to label all instances correctly. Recall represents the ability for a classifier to find all instances of a particular label.

#### What does automated ML do with the precision-recall chart?

With this chart, you can compare the precision-recall curves for each model to determine which model has an acceptable relationship between precision and recall for your particular business problem. This chart shows Macro Average Precision-Recall, Micro Average Precision-Recall, and the precision-recall associated with all classes for a model. 

Macro-average will compute the metric independently of each class and then take the average, treating all classes equally. However, micro-average will aggregate the contributions of all the classes to compute the average. Micro-average is preferable if there is class imbalance present in the dataset.

#### What does a good model look like?
Depending on the goal of the business problem, the ideal precision-recall curve could differ. Some examples are given below

##### Example 1: A classification model with low precision and low recall
![A classification model with low precision and low recall](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-precision-recall1.png)

##### Example 2: A classification model with ~100% precision and ~100% recall 
![A classification model high precision and recall](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-precision-recall2.png)
<a name="roc"></a>
### ROC chart

#### What is a ROC chart?
Receiver operating characteristic (or ROC) is a plot of the correctly classified labels vs. the incorrectly classified labels for a particular model. The ROC curve can be less informative when training models on datasets with high bias, as it will not show the false positive labels.

#### What does automated ML do with the ROC chart?
Automated ML generates Macro Average Precision-Recall, Micro Average Precision-Recall, and the precision-recall associated with all classes for a model. 

Macro-average will compute the metric independently of each class and then take the average, treating all classes equally. However, micro-average will aggregate the contributions of all the classes to compute the average. Micro-average is preferable if there is class imbalance present in the dataset.

#### What does a good model look like?
Ideally, the model will have closer to 100% true positive rate and closer to 0% false positive rate. 

##### Example 1: A classification model with low true labels and high false labels
![Classification model with low true labels and high false labels](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-roc-1.png)

##### Example 2: A classification model with high true labels and low false labels
![a classification model with high true labels and low false labels](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-roc-2.png)
<a name="lift-curve"></a>
### Lift chart
#### What is a lift chart?
Lift charts are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It shows how much better you can expect to do with the generated model compared to without a model in terms of accuracy.
#### What does automated ML do with the lift chart?
You can compare the lift of the model built automatically with Azure Machine Learning to the baseline in order to view the value gain of that particular model.
#### What does a good model look like?

##### Example 1: A classification model that does worse than a random selection model
![A classification model that does worse than a random selection model](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-lift-curve1.png)
##### Example 2: A classification model that performs better than a random selection model
![A classification model that performs better](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-lift-curve2.png)
<a name="gains-curve"></a>
### Gains chart
#### What is a gains chart?

A gains chart evaluates the performance of a classification model by each portion of the data. It shows for each percentile of the data set, how much better you can expect to perform compared against a random selection model.

#### What does automated ML do with the gains chart?
Use the cumulative gains chart to help you choose the classification cutoff using a percentage that corresponds to a desired gain from the model. This information provides another way of looking at the results in the accompanying lift chart.

#### What does a good model look like?
##### Example 1: A classification model with minimal gain
![a classification model with minimal gain](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-gains-curve1.png)

##### Example 2: A classification model with significant gain
![A classification model with significant gain](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-gains-curve2.png)
<a name="calibration-plot"></a>
### Calibration chart

#### What is a calibration chart?
A calibration plot is used to display the confidence of a predictive model. It does this by showing the relationship between the predicted probability and the actual probability, where "probability" represents the likelihood that a particular instance belongs under some label.
#### What does automated ML do with the calibration chart?
For all classification problems, you can review the calibration line for micro-average, macro-average, and each class in a given predictive model.

Macro-average will compute the metric independently of each class and then take the average, treating all classes equally. However, micro-average will aggregate the contributions of all the classes to compute the average. 
#### What does a good model look like?
 A well-calibrated model  aligns with the y=x line, where it is reasonably confident in its predictions. An over-confident model  aligns with the y=0 line, where the predicted probability is present but there is no actual probability. 


##### Example 1: A well-calibrated model

### <a name="reg-metrics"></a> Regression metrics

The following metrics are saved in each run iteration for a regression or forecasting task.

|Metric|Description|Calculation|Extra Parameters
--|--|--|--|
explained_variance|Explained variance is  the proportion to which a mathematical model accounts for the variation of a given data set. It is the percent decrease in variance of the original data to the variance of the errors. When the mean of the errors is 0, it is equal to explained variance.|[Calculation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score.html)|None|

spearman_correlation|Spearman correlation is a nonparametric measure of the monotonicity of the relationship between two datasets. Unlike the Pearson correlation, the Spearman correlation does not assume that both datasets are normally distributed. Like other correlation coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact monotonic relationship. Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.|[Calculation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html)|None|
mean_absolute_error|Mean absolute error is the expected value of absolute value of difference between the target and the prediction|[Calculation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html)|None|

### <a name="pvt"></a> Predicted vs. True chart
#### What is a Predicted vs. True chart?
Predicted vs. True shows the relationship between a predicted value and its correlating true value for a regression problem. This graph can be used to measure performance of a model as the closer to the y=x line the predicted values are, the better the accuracy of a predictive model.

#### What does automated ML do with the Predicted vs. True chart?
After each run, you can see a predicted vs. true graph for each regression model. To protect data privacy, values are binned together and the size of each bin is shown as a bar graph on the bottom portion of the chart area. You can compare the predictive model, with the lighter shade area showing error margins, against the ideal value of where the model should be.

#### What does a good model look like?
##### Example 1: A classification model with low accuracy
![A regression model with low accuracy in predictions](./media/how-to-understand-automated-ml/azure-machine-learning-auto-ml-regression1.png)

##### Example 2: A regression model with high accuracy

### <a name="histo"></a> Histogram of residuals chart
#### What is a residuals chart?
A residual represents an observed y – the predicted y. To show a margin of error with low bias, the histogram of residuals should be shaped as a bell curve, centered around 0. 
#### What does automated ML do with the residuals chart?
Automated ML automatically provides a residuals chart to show the distribution of errors in the predictions.
#### What does a good model look like?
A good model will typically have a bell curve or errors around zero.

##### Example 1: A regression model with bias in its errors
