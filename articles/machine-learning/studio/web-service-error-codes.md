# Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) REST API Error Codes
 
The following error codes could be returned by an operation on an Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) web service.
 
## BadArgument (HTTP status code 400)
 
Invalid argument provided.
 
This class of errors means an argument provided somewhere was invalid. This could be a credential or location of Azure storage to something passed to the web service. Please look at the error “code” field in the “details” section to diagnose which specific argument was invalid.
