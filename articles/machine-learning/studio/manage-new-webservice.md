# Manage a web service using the Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) Web Services portal
You can manage your Machine Learning New and Classic Web services using the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Web Services portal. Since Classic Web services and New Web services are based on different underlying technologies, you have slightly different management capabilities for each of them.

In the Machine Learning Web Services portal you can:

* Monitor how the web service is being used.
* Configure the description, update the keys for the web service (New only), update your storage account key (New only), enable logging, and enable or disable sample data.
* Delete the web service.
* Create, delete, or update billing plans (New only).
* Add and delete endpoints (Classic only)

>[!NOTE]
>You also can manage Classic web services in [Machine Learning Studio (classic)](https://studio.azureml.net) on the **Web services** tab.

## Permissions to manage New Resources Manager based web services

New web services are deployed as Azure resources. As such, you must have the correct permissions to deploy and manage New web services.  To deploy or manage New web services you must be assigned a contributor or administrator role on the subscription to which the web service is deployed. If you invite another user to a machine learning workspace, you must assign them to a contributor or administrator role on the subscription before they can deploy or manage web services. 

If the user does not have the correct permissions to access resources in the Azure Machine Learning Web Services portal, they will receive the following error when trying to deploy a web service:

*Web Service deployment failed. This account does not have sufficient access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace. In order to deploy a Web Service to Azure, the same account must be invited to the Workspace and be given access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace.*

For more information on creating a workspace, see [Create and share an Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) workspace](create-workspace.md).

For more information on setting access permissions, see [Manage access using RBAC and the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).


## Manage New Web services
To manage your New Web services:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Web Services](https://services.azureml.net/quickstart) portal using your Microsoft Azure account - use the account that's associated with the Azure subscription.
2. On the menu, click **Web Services**.

This displays a list of deployed Web services for your subscription. 

To manage a Web service, click Web Services. From the Web Services page you can:

* Click the web service to manage it.
* Click the Billing Plan for the web service to update it.
* Delete a web service.
* Copy a web service and deploy it to another region.

When you click a web service, the web service Quickstart page opens. The web service Quickstart page has two menu options that allow you to manage your web service:

* **DASHBOARD** - Allows you to view Web service usage.
* **CONFIGURE** - Allows you to add descriptive text, update the key for the storage account associated with the Web service, and enable or disable sample data.

### Monitoring how the web service is being used
Click the **DASHBOARD** tab.

From the dashboard, you can view overall usage of your Web service over a period of time. You can select the period to view from the Period dropdown menu in the upper right of the usage charts. The dashboard shows the following information:

* **Requests Over Time** displays a step graph of the number of requests over the selected time period. It can help identify if you are experiencing spikes in usage.
* **Request-Response Requests** displays the total number of Request-Response calls the service has received over the selected time period and how many of them failed.
* **Average Request-Response Compute Time** displays an average of the time needed to execute the received requests.
* **Batch Requests** displays the total number of Batch Requests the service has received over the selected time period and how many of them failed.
* **Average Job Latency** displays an average of the time needed to execute the received requests.
* **Errors** displays the aggregate number of errors that have occurred on calls to the web service.
* **Services Costs** displays the charges for the billing plan associated with the service.

### Configuring the web service
Click the **CONFIGURE** menu option.

You can update the following properties:

* **Description** allows you to enter a description for the Web service.
* **Title** allows you to enter a title for the Web service
* **Keys** allows you to rotate your primary and secondary API keys.
* **Storage account key** allows you to update the key for the storage account associated with the Web service changes. 
* **Enable Sample data** allows you to provide sample data that you can use to test the Request-Response service. If you created the web service in Machine Learning Studio (classic), the sample data is taken from the data your used to train your model. If you created the service programmatically, the data is taken from the example data you provided as part of the JSON package.

### Managing billing plans
Click the **Plans** menu option from the web services Quickstart page. You can also click the plan associated with specific Web service to manage that plan.

* **New** allows you to create a new plan.
* **Add/Remove Plan instance** allows you to "scale out" an existing plan to add capacity.
* **Upgrade/DownGrade** allows you to "scale up" an existing plan to add capacity.
* **Delete** allows you to delete a plan.

Click a plan to view its dashboard. The dashboard gives you snapshot or plan usage over a selected period of time. To select the time period to view, click the **Period** dropdown at the upper right of dashboard. 

The plan dashboard provides the following information:

* **Plan Description** displays information about the costs and capacity associated with the plan.
* **Plan Usage** displays the number of transactions and compute hours that have been charged against the plan.
* **Web Services** displays the number of Web services that are using this plan.
* **Top Web Service By Calls** displays the top four Web services that are making calls that are charged against the plan.
* **Top Web Services by Compute Hrs** displays the top four Web services that are using compute resources that are charged against the plan.

## Manage Classic Web Services
