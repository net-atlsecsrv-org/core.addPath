# Use the sample datasets in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)
[top]: #machine-learning-sample-datasets

When you create a new workspace in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic), a number of sample datasets and experiments are included by default. Many of these sample datasets are used by the sample models in the [Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/). Others are included as examples of various types of data typically used in machine learning.

Some of these datasets are available in Azure Blob storage. For these datasets, the following table provides a direct link. You can use these datasets in your experiments by using the [Import Data][import-data] module.

The rest of these sample datasets are available in your workspace under **Saved Datasets**. You can find this in the module palette to the left of the experiment canvas in Machine Learning Studio (classic).
You can use any of these datasets in your own experiment by dragging it to your experiment canvas.

  <td>Automobile price data (Raw)</td>
  <td>
Information about automobiles by make and model, including the price, features such as the number of cylinders and MPG, as well as an insurance risk score.

<p></p>
<b>Usage:</b> Predict the risk score by features, using regression or multivariate classification.

  <td>Telescope data</td>
  <td>
Record of high energy gamma particle bursts along with background noise, both simulated using a Monte Carlo process.
<p></p>
The intent of the simulation was to improve the accuracy of ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescopes. This is done by using statistical methods to differentiate between the desired signal (Cherenkov radiation showers) and background noise (hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere).
<p></p>
The data has been pre-processed to create an elongated cluster with the long axis is oriented towards the camera center. The characteristics of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination.
<p></p>
<b>Usage:</b> Predict whether image of a shower represents signal or background noise.
<p></p>
<b>Notes:</b> Simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers, the ROC graph should be used. The probability of accepting a background event as signal must be below one of the following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2.
<p></p>
Also, note that the number of background events (h, for hadronic showers) is underestimated. In real measurements, the h or noise class represents the majority of events.
