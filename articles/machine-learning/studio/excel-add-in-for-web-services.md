# Excel Add-in for Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) web services

[!INCLUDE [Notebook deprecation notice](../../../includes/aml-studio-notebook-notice.md)]
Excel makes it easy to call web services directly without the need to write any code.

## Steps to Use an Existing web service in the Workbook

1. Open the [sample Excel file](https://aka.ms/amlexcel-sample-2), which contains the Excel add-in and data about passengers on the Titanic. 
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > You will see the list of the Web Services related to the file and at the bottom a checkbox for "Auto-predict". If you enable auto-predict the predictions of **all** your services will be updated every time there is a change on the inputs. If unchecked you will have to click on "Predict All" for refresh. For enabling auto-predict at a service level go to step 6.

2. Choose the web service by clicking it - "Titanic Survivor Predictor (Excel Add-in Sample) [Score]" in this example.

3. This takes you to the **Predict** section.  This workbook already contains sample data, but for a blank workbook you can select a cell in Excel and click **Use sample data**.
4. Select the data with headers and click the input data range icon.  Make sure the "My data has headers" box is checked.
5. Under **Output**, enter the cell number where you want the output to be, for example "H1" here.
6. Click **Predict**. If you select the "auto-predict" checkbox any change on the selected areas (the ones specified as input) will trigger a request and an update of the output cells without the need for you to press the predict button.

Deploy a web service or use an existing Web service. For more information on deploying a web service, see [Tutorial 3: Deploy credit risk model](tutorial-part3-credit-risk-deploy.md).

Get the API key for your web service. Where you perform this action depends on whether you published a Classic Machine Learning web service of a New Machine Learning web service.

**Use a Classic web service** 

1. In Machine Learning Studio (classic), click the **WEB SERVICES** section in the left pane, and then select the web service.
   
    ![Studio select a Web service](./media/excel-add-in-for-web-services/image4.png)
2. Copy the API key for the web service.
   
    ![Studio API key](./media/excel-add-in-for-web-services/image5.png)
3. On the **DASHBOARD** tab for the web service, click the **REQUEST/RESPONSE** link.
4. Look for the **Request URI** section.  Copy and save the URL.

> [!NOTE]
> It is now possible to sign into the [Azure Machine Learning Web Services](https://services.azureml.net) portal to obtain the API key for a Classic Machine Learning web service.
> 
> 

**Use a New web service**

1. In the [Azure Machine Learning Web Services](https://services.azureml.net) portal, click **Web Services**, then select your web service. 
2. Click **Consume**.
3. Look for the **Basic consumption info** section. Copy and save the **Primary Key** and the **Request-Response** URL.

## Steps to Add a New web service

1. Deploy a web service or use an existing Web service. For more information on deploying a web service, see [Tutorial 3: Deploy credit risk model](tutorial-part3-credit-risk-deploy.md).
2. Click **Consume**.
3. Look for the **Basic consumption info** section. Copy and save the **Primary Key** and the **Request-Response** URL.
4. In Excel, go to the **Web Services** section (if you are in the **Predict** section, click the back arrow to go to the list of web services).
   
    ![Go to Web service selection](./media/excel-add-in-for-web-services/image3.png)
5. Click **Add Web Service**.
6. Paste the URL into the Excel add-in text box labeled **URL**.
7. Paste the API/Primary key into the text box labeled **API key**.
8. Click **Add**.

9. To use the web service, follow the preceding directions, "Steps to Use an Existing web Service."

## Sharing Your Workbook
If you save your workbook, then the API/Primary key for the web services you have added is also saved. That means you should only share the workbook with individuals you trust.
