# Import your training data into Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) from various data sources

**APPLIES TO:**  ![yes](../../../includes/media/aml-applies-to-skus/yes.png)Machine Learning Studio (classic)   ![no](../../../includes/media/aml-applies-to-skus/no.png)[Azure Machine Learning](../compare-azure-ml-to-studio-classic.md)


To use your own data in Machine Learning Studio (classic) to develop and train a predictive analytics solution, you can use data from: 

* **Local file** - Load local data ahead of time from your hard drive to create a dataset module in your workspace
* **Online data sources** - Use the [Import Data][import-data] module to access data from one of several online sources while your experiment is running
* **Machine Learning Studio (classic) experiment** - Use data that was saved as a dataset in Machine Learning Studio (classic)
* [**SQL Server database**](use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server.md) - Use data from a SQL Server database without having to copy data manually

> [!NOTE]
> There are a number of sample datasets available in Machine Learning Studio (classic) that you can use for training data. For information on these, see [Use the sample datasets in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](use-sample-datasets.md).

## Prepare data

Machine Learning Studio (classic) is designed to work with rectangular or tabular data, such as text data that's delimited or structured data from a database, though in some circumstances non-rectangular data may be used.

It's best if your data is relatively clean before you import it into Studio (classic). For example, you'll want to take care of issues such as unquoted strings.

However, there are modules available in Studio (classic) that enable some manipulation of data within your experiment after you import your data. Depending on the machine learning algorithms you'll be using, you may need to decide how you'll handle data structural issues such as missing values and sparse data, and there are modules that can help with that. Look in the **Data Transformation** section of the module palette for modules that perform these functions.

At any point in your experiment, you can view or download the data that's produced by a module by clicking the output port. Depending on the module, there may be different download options available, or you may be able to visualize the data within your web browser in Studio (classic).

## Supported data formats and data types

You can import a number of data types into your experiment, depending on what mechanism you use to import data and where it's coming from:

* Plain text (.txt)
* Comma-separated values (CSV) with a header (.csv) or without (.nh.csv)
* Tab-separated values (TSV) with a header (.tsv) or without (.nh.tsv)
* Excel file
* Azure table
* Hive table
* SQL database table
* OData values
* SVMLight data (.svmlight) (see the [SVMLight definition](http://svmlight.joachims.org/) for format information)
* Attribute Relation File Format (ARFF) data (.arff) (see the [ARFF definition](https://weka.wikispaces.com/ARFF) for format information)
* Zip file (.zip)
* R object or workspace file (.RData)

If you import data in a format such as ARFF that includes metadata, Studio (classic) uses this metadata to define the heading and data type of each column.

If you import data such as TSV or CSV format that doesn't include this metadata, Studio (classic) infers the data type for each column by sampling the data. If the data also doesn't have column headings, Studio (classic) provides default names.

You can explicitly specify or change the headings and data types for columns using the [Edit Metadata][edit-metadata] module.

The following data types are recognized by Studio (classic):

* String
* Integer
* Double
* Boolean
* DateTime
* TimeSpan

Studio uses an internal data type called ***data table*** to pass data between modules. You can explicitly convert your data into data table format using the [Convert to Dataset][convert-to-dataset] module.

Any module that accepts formats other than data table will convert the data to data table silently before passing it to the next module.

If necessary, you can convert data table format back into CSV, TSV, ARFF, or SVMLight format using other conversion modules.
Look in the **Data Format Conversions** section of the module palette for modules that perform these functions.

## Data capacities

Modules in Machine Learning Studio (classic) support datasets of up to 10 GB of dense numerical data for common use cases. If a module takes more than one input, the 10 GB value is the total of all input sizes. You can sample larger datasets by using queries from Hive or Azure SQL Database, or you can use Learning by Counts preprocessing before you import the data.  

The following types of data can expand to larger datasets during feature normalization and are limited to less than 10 GB:

* Sparse
* Categorical
* Strings
* Binary data

The following modules are limited to datasets less than 10 GB:

* Recommender modules
* Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) module
* Scripting modules: R, Python, SQL
* Modules where the output data size can be larger than input data size, such as Join or Feature Hashing
* Cross-validation, Tune Model Hyperparameters, Ordinal Regression, and One-vs-All Multiclass, when the number of iterations is very large

For datasets that are larger than a couple GBs, upload the data to Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database, or use Azure HDInsight, rather than uploading directly from a local file.

You can find information about image data in the [Import Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/import-images#bkmk_Notes) module reference.

## Import from a local file

You can upload a data file from your hard drive to use as training data in Studio (classic). When you import a data file, you create a dataset module ready for use in experiments in your workspace.

To import data from a local hard drive, do the following:

1. Click **+NEW** at the bottom of the Studio (classic) window.
2. Select **DATASET** and **FROM LOCAL FILE**.
3. In the **Upload a new dataset** dialog, browse to the file you want to upload.
4. Enter a name, identify the data type, and optionally enter a description. A description is recommended - it allows you to record any characteristics about the data that you want to remember when using the data in the future.
5. The checkbox **This is the new version of an existing dataset** allows you to update an existing dataset with new data. To do so, click this checkbox and then enter the name of an existing dataset.

![Upload a new dataset](./media/import-data/upload-dataset-from-local-file.png)

Upload time depends on the size of your data and the speed of your connection to the service. If you know the file will take a long time, you can do other things inside Studio (classic) while you wait. However, closing the browser before the data upload is complete causes the upload to fail.

Once your data is uploaded, it's stored in a dataset module and is available to any experiment in your workspace.

When you're editing an experiment, you can find the datasets you've uploaded in the **My Datasets** list under the **Saved Datasets** list in the module palette. You can drag and drop the dataset onto the experiment canvas when you want to use the dataset for further analytics and machine learning.

## Import from online data sources

Using the [Import Data][import-data] module, your experiment can import data from various online data sources while the experiment running.

> [!NOTE]
> This article provides general information about the [Import Data][import-data] module. For more detailed information about the types of data you can access, formats, parameters, and answers to common questions, see the module reference topic for the [Import Data][import-data] module.

By using the [Import Data][import-data] module, you can access data from one of several online data sources while your experiment is running:

* A Web URL using HTTP
* Hadoop using HiveQL
* Azure blob storage
* Azure table
* Azure SQL Database. SQL Managed Instance, or SQL Server
* A data feed provider, OData currently
* Azure Cosmos DB

Because this training data is accessed while your experiment is running, it's only available in that experiment. By comparison, data that has been stored in a dataset module is available to any experiment in your workspace.

To access online data sources in your Studio (classic) experiment, add the [Import Data][import-data] module to your experiment. Then select **Launch Import Data Wizard** under **Properties** for step-by-step guided instructions to select and configure the data source. Alternatively, you can manually select **Data source** under **Properties** and supply the parameters needed to access the data.

The online data sources that are supported are itemized in the table below. This table also summarizes the file formats that are supported and parameters that are used to access the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the [Import Data][import-data] and [Export Data][export-data] modules can read and write data only from Azure storage created using the Classic deployment model. In other words, the new Azure Blob Storage account type that offers a hot storage access tier or cool storage access tier is not yet supported.
>
> Generally, any Azure storage accounts that you might have created before this service option became available should not be affected.
> If you need to create a new account, select **Classic** for the Deployment model, or use Resource manager and select **General purpose** rather than **Blob storage** for **Account kind**.
>
> For more information, see [Azure Blob Storage: Hot and Cool Storage Tiers](../../storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers.md).

The supported data formats are CSV, TSV, ARFF, CSV with a specified encoding, and Excel. <br/><br/><ul>If the format is CSV or TSV, be sure to indicate whether the file contains a header row.<br/><br/>You can use the Excel option to read data from Excel workbooks. In the <i>Excel data format</i> option, indicate whether the data is in an Excel worksheet range, or in an Excel table. In the <i>Excel sheet or embedded table </i>option, specify the name of the sheet or table that you want to read from.</ul><br/> |
| Data Feed Provider |Reads data from a supported feed provider. Currently only the Open Data Protocol (OData) format is supported. |<b>Data content type</b>: Specifies the OData format.<br/><br/><b>Source URL</b>: Specifies the full URL for the data feed. <br/>For example, the following URL reads from the Northwind sample database: https://services.odata.org/northwind/northwind.svc/ |

## Import from another experiment

There will be times when you'll want to take an intermediate result from one experiment and use it as part of another experiment. To do this, you save the module as a dataset:

1. Click the output of the module that you want to save as a dataset.
2. Click **Save as Dataset**.
3. When prompted, enter a name and a description that would allow you to identify the dataset easily.
4. Click the **OK** checkmark.

When the save finishes, the dataset will be available for use within any experiment in your workspace. You can find it in the **Saved Datasets** list in the module palette.
