# Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic): Extend your experiment with R 

[!INCLUDE [Notebook deprecation notice](../../../includes/aml-studio-notebook-notice.md)]
You can extend the functionality of Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) through the R language by using the [Execute R Script][execute-r-script] module.

This module accepts multiple input datasets and yields a single dataset as output. You can type an R script into the **R Script** parameter of the [Execute R Script][execute-r-script] module.

You access each input port of the module by using code similar to the following:

    dataset1 <- maml.mapInputPort(1)

## Listing all currently-installed packages
The list of installed packages can change. A list of currently installed packages can be found in [R Packages Supported by Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt741980.aspx).

You also can get the complete, current list of installed packages by entering the following code into the [Execute R Script][execute-r-script] module:

    out <- data.frame(installed.packages(,,,fields="Description"))
    maml.mapOutputPort("out")

This sends the list of packages to the output port of the [Execute R Script][execute-r-script] module.
To view the package list, connect a conversion module such as [Convert to CSV][convert-to-csv] to the left output of the [Execute R Script][execute-r-script] module, run the experiment, then click the output of the conversion module and select **Download**.

<!--
For convenience, here is the [current full list with version numbers in Excel format](https://az754797.vo.msecnd.net/docs/RPackages.xlsx).

## Importing packages
You can import packages that are not already installed by using the following commands in the [Execute R Script][execute-r-script] module:

    install.packages("src/my_favorite_package.zip", lib = ".", repos = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
    success <- library("my_favorite_package", lib.loc = ".", logical.return = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)

where the `my_favorite_package.zip` file contains your package.
