# Configure automated ML experiments in Python
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

In this guide, learn how to define various configuration settings of your automated machine learning experiments with the [Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py). Automated machine learning picks an algorithm and hyperparameters for you and generates a model ready for deployment. There are several options that you can use to configure automated machine learning experiments.

To view examples of an automated machine learning experiments, see [Tutorial: Train a classification model with automated machine learning](tutorial-auto-train-models.md) or [Train models with automated machine learning in the cloud](service/how-to-auto-train-remote.md).

Configuration options available in automated machine learning:

* Select your experiment type: Classification, Regression or Time Series Forecasting
* Data source, formats, and fetch data
* Choose your compute target: local or remote
* Automated machine learning experiment settings
* Run an automated machine learning experiment
* Explore model metrics
* Register and deploy model

If you prefer a no code experience, you can also [Create your automated machine learning experiments in Azure Machine Learning studio](how-to-create-portal-experiments.md).

## Select your experiment type

Before you begin your experiment, you should determine the kind of machine learning problem you are solving. Automated machine learning supports task types of classification, regression and forecasting. Learn more about [task types](how-to-define-task-type.md).

Automated machine learning supports the following algorithms during the automation and tuning process. As a user, there is no need for you to specify the algorithm.

Use the `task` parameter in the `AutoMLConfig` constructor to specify your experiment type.

```python
from azureml.train.automl import AutoMLConfig

# task can be one of classification, regression, forecasting
automl_config = AutoMLConfig(task = "classification")
```

## Data source and format

Automated machine learning supports data that resides on your local desktop or in the cloud such as Azure Blob Storage. The data can be read into a **Pandas DataFrame** or an **Azure Machine Learning TabularDataset**.  [Learn more about datasets](how-to-create-register-datasets.md).

Requirements for training data:
- Data must be in tabular form.
- The value to predict, target column, must be in the data.

The following code examples demonstrate how to store the data in these formats.

* TabularDataset
  ```python
  from azureml.core.dataset import Dataset
  
  tabular_dataset = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files("https://automldemods.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/PlayaEvents2016,_1.6MB,_3.4k-rows.cleaned.2.tsv")
  train_dataset, test_dataset = tabular_dataset.random_split(percentage = 0.1, seed = 42)
  label = "Label"
  ```

* Pandas dataframe

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    df = pd.read_csv("https://automldemods.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/PlayaEvents2016,_1.6MB,_3.4k-rows.cleaned.2.tsv", delimiter="\t", quotechar='"')
    train_data, test_data = train_test_split(df, test_size = 0.1, random_state = 42)
    label = "Label"
    ```

## Fetch data for running experiment on remote compute

For remote executions, training data must be accessible from the remote compute. The class [`Datasets`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.dataset.dataset?view=azure-ml-py) in the SDK exposes functionality to:

* easily transfer data from static files or URL sources into your workspace
* make your data available to training scripts when running on cloud compute resources

See the [how-to](how-to-train-with-datasets.md#option-2--mount-files-to-a-remote-compute-target) for an example of using the `Dataset` class to mount data to your compute target.

## Train and validation data

You can specify separate train and validation sets directly in the `AutoMLConfig` constructor.

### K-Folds Cross Validation

Use `n_cross_validations` setting to specify the number of cross validations. The training data set will be randomly split into `n_cross_validations` folds of equal size. During each cross validation round, one of the folds will be used for validation of the model trained on the remaining folds. This process repeats for `n_cross_validations` rounds until each fold is used once as validation set. The average scores across all `n_cross_validations` rounds will be reported, and the corresponding model will be retrained on the whole training data set.

### Monte Carlo Cross Validation (Repeated Random Sub-Sampling)

Use `validation_size` to specify the percentage of the training dataset that should be used for validation, and use `n_cross_validations` to specify the number of cross validations. During each cross validation round, a subset of size `validation_size` will be randomly selected for validation of the model trained on the remaining data. Finally, the average scores across all `n_cross_validations` rounds will be reported, and the corresponding model will be retrained on the whole training data set. Monte Carlo is not supported for time series forecasting.

### Custom validation dataset

Use custom validation dataset if random split is not acceptable, usually time series data or imbalanced data. You can specify your own validation dataset. The model will be evaluated against the validation dataset specified instead of random dataset.

## Compute to run experiment

Next determine where the model will be trained. An automated machine learning training experiment can run on the following compute options:
*	Your local machine such as a local desktop or laptop – Generally when you have small dataset and you are still in the exploration stage.
*	A remote machine in the cloud – [Azure Machine Learning Managed Compute](concept-compute-target.md#amlcompute) is a managed service that enables the ability to train machine learning models on clusters of Azure virtual machines.

See the [GitHub site](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning) for example notebooks with local and remote compute targets.

*   An Azure Databricks cluster in your Azure subscription. You can find more details here - [Setup Azure Databricks cluster for Automated ML](how-to-configure-environment.md#azure-databricks)

See the [GitHub site](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/azure-databricks/automl) for example notebooks with Azure Databricks.

## Configure your experiment settings

There are several options that you can use to configure your automated machine learning experiment. These parameters are set by instantiating an `AutoMLConfig` object. See the [AutoMLConfig class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-automl-client/azureml.train.automl.automlconfig.automlconfig?view=azure-ml-py) for a full list of parameters.

Some examples include:

1.	Classification experiment using AUC weighted as the primary metric with experiment timeout minutes set to 30 minutes and 2 cross-validation folds.

    ```python
    automl_classifier=AutoMLConfig(
        task='classification',
        primary_metric='AUC_weighted',
        experiment_timeout_minutes=30,
        blacklist_models='XGBoostClassifier',
        training_data=train_data,
        label_column_name=label,
        n_cross_validations=2)
    ```
2.	Below is an example of a regression experiment set to end after 60 minutes with 5 validation cross folds.

    ```python
    automl_regressor = AutoMLConfig(
        task='regression',
        experiment_timeout_minutes=60,
        whitelist_models='kNN regressor'
        primary_metric='r2_score',
        training_data=train_data,
        label_column_name=label,
        n_cross_validations=5)
    ```

The three different `task` parameter values (the third task-type is `forecasting`, and uses a similar algorithm pool as `regression` tasks) determine the list of models to apply. Use the `whitelist` or `blacklist` parameters to further modify iterations with the available models to include or exclude. The list of supported models can be found on [SupportedModels Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-automl/azureml.train.automl.constants.supportedmodels?view=azure-ml-py).

### Primary Metric
The primary metric determines the metric to be used during model training for optimization. The available metrics you can select is determined by the task type you choose, and the following table shows valid primary metrics for each task type.

|Classification | Regression | Time Series Forecasting
|-- |-- |--
|accuracy| spearman_correlation | spearman_correlation
|AUC_weighted | normalized_root_mean_squared_error | normalized_root_mean_squared_error
|average_precision_score_weighted | r2_score | r2_score
|norm_macro_recall | normalized_mean_absolute_error | normalized_mean_absolute_error
|precision_score_weighted |

Learn about the specific definitions of these in [Understand automated machine learning results](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md).

### Data preprocessing & featurization

In every automated machine learning experiment, your data is [automatically scaled and normalized](concept-automated-ml.md#preprocess) to help *certain* algorithms that are sensitive to features that are on different scales.  However, you can also enable additional preprocessing/featurization, such as missing values imputation, encoding, and transforms. [Learn more about what featurization is included](how-to-create-portal-experiments.md#preprocess).

To enable this featurization, specify `"preprocess": True` for the [`AutoMLConfig` class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-automl/azureml.train.automl.automlconfig?view=azure-ml-py).

> [!NOTE]
> Automated machine learning pre-processing steps (feature normalization, handling missing data,
> converting text to numeric, etc.) become part of the underlying model. When using the model for
> predictions, the same pre-processing steps applied during training are applied to
> your input data automatically.

### Time Series Forecasting
The time series `forecasting` task requires additional parameters in the configuration object:

1. `time_column_name`: Required parameter that defines the name of the column in your training data containing a valid time-series.
1. `max_horizon`: Defines the length of time you want to predict out based on the periodicity of the training data. For example if you have training data with daily time grains, you define how far out in days you want the model to train for.
1. `grain_column_names`: Defines the name of columns which contain individual time series data in your training data. For example, if you are forecasting sales of a particular brand by store, you would define store and brand columns as your grain columns. Separate time-series and forecasts will be created for each grain/grouping. 

For examples of the settings used below, see the [sample notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/forecasting-orange-juice-sales/auto-ml-forecasting-orange-juice-sales.ipynb).

```python
# Setting Store and Brand as grains for training.
grain_column_names = ['Store', 'Brand']
nseries = data.groupby(grain_column_names).ngroups

# View the number of time series data with defined grains
print('Data contains {0} individual time-series.'.format(nseries))
```

```python
time_series_settings = {
    'time_column_name': time_column_name,
    'grain_column_names': grain_column_names,
    'drop_column_names': ['logQuantity'],
    'max_horizon': n_test_periods
}

automl_config = AutoMLConfig(task = 'forecasting',
                             debug_log='automl_oj_sales_errors.log',
                             primary_metric='normalized_root_mean_squared_error',
                             experiment_timeout_minutes=20,
                             training_data=train_data,
                             label_column_name=label,
                             n_cross_validations=5,
                             path=project_folder,
                             verbosity=logging.INFO,
                             **time_series_settings)
```

### <a name="ensemble"></a> Ensemble configuration

Ensemble models are enabled by default, and appear as the final run iterations in an automated machine learning run. Currently supported ensemble methods are voting and stacking. Voting is implemented as soft-voting using weighted averages, and the stacking implementation is using a 2 layer implementation, where the first layer has the same models as the voting ensemble, and the second layer model is used to find the optimal combination of the models from the first layer. If you are using ONNX models, **or** have model-explainability enabled, stacking will be disabled and only voting will be utilized.

There are multiple default arguments that can be provided as `kwargs` in an `AutoMLConfig` object to alter the default stack ensemble behavior.

* `stack_meta_learner_type`: the meta-learner is a model trained on the output of the individual heterogenous models. Default meta-learners are `LogisticRegression` for classification tasks (or `LogisticRegressionCV` if cross-validation is enabled) and `ElasticNet` for regression/forecasting tasks (or `ElasticNetCV` if cross-validation is enabled). This parameter can be one of the following strings: `LogisticRegression`, `LogisticRegressionCV`, `LightGBMClassifier`, `ElasticNet`, `ElasticNetCV`, `LightGBMRegressor`, or `LinearRegression`.
* `stack_meta_learner_train_percentage`: specifies the proportion of the training set (when choosing train and validation type of training) to be reserved for training the meta-learner. Default value is `0.2`.
* `stack_meta_learner_kwargs`: optional parameters to pass to the initializer of the meta-learner. These parameters and parameter types mirror those from the corresponding model constructor, and are forwarded to the model constructor.

The following code shows an example of specifying custom ensemble behavior in an `AutoMLConfig` object.

```python
ensemble_settings = {
    "stack_meta_learner_type": "LogisticRegressionCV",
    "stack_meta_learner_train_percentage": 0.3,
    "stack_meta_learner_kwargs": {
        "refit": True,
        "fit_intercept": False,
        "class_weight": "balanced",
        "multi_class": "auto",
        "n_jobs": -1
    }
}

automl_classifier = AutoMLConfig(
        task='classification',
        primary_metric='AUC_weighted',
        experiment_timeout_minutes=30,
        training_data=train_data,
        label_column_name=label,
        n_cross_validations=5,
        **ensemble_settings
        )
```

Ensemble training is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by using the `enable_voting_ensemble` and `enable_stack_ensemble` boolean parameters.

```python
automl_classifier = AutoMLConfig(
        task='classification',
        primary_metric='AUC_weighted',
        experiment_timeout_minutes=30,
        training_data=data_train,
        label_column_name=label,
        n_cross_validations=5,
        enable_voting_ensemble=False,
        enable_stack_ensemble=False
        )
```

## Run experiment

For automated ML you create an `Experiment` object, which is a named object in a `Workspace` used to run experiments.

```python
from azureml.core.experiment import Experiment

ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Choose a name for the experiment and specify the project folder.
experiment_name = 'automl-classification'
project_folder = './sample_projects/automl-classification'

experiment = Experiment(ws, experiment_name)
```

Submit the experiment to run and generate a model. Pass the `AutoMLConfig` to the `submit` method to generate the model.

```python
run = experiment.submit(automl_config, show_output=True)
```

>[!NOTE]
>Dependencies are first installed on a new machine.  It may take up to 10 minutes before output is shown.
>Setting `show_output` to `True` results in output being shown on the console.

### Exit Criteria
There are a few options you can define to end your experiment.
1. No Criteria: If you do not define any exit parameters the experiment will continue until no further progress is made on your primary metric.
1. Exit after a length of time: Using `experiment_timeout_minutes` in your settings allows you to define how long in minutes should an experiment continue in run.
1. Exit after a score has been reached: Using `experiment_exit_score` will complete the experiment after a primary metric score has been reached.

### Explore model metrics

You can view your training results in a widget or inline if you are in a notebook. See [Track and evaluate models](how-to-track-experiments.md#view-run-details) for more details.

## Understand automated ML models

Any model produced using automated ML includes the following steps:
+ Automated feature engineering (if preprocess=True)
+ Scaling/Normalization and algorithm with hyperparameter values

We make it transparent to get this information from the fitted_model output from automated ML.

```python
automl_config = AutoMLConfig(…)
automl_run = experiment.submit(automl_config …)
best_run, fitted_model = automl_run.get_output()
```

### Automated feature engineering

See the list of preprocessing and [automated feature engineering](concept-automated-ml.md#preprocess) that happens when feauturization =auto.

Consider this example:
+ There are 4 input features: A (Numeric), B (Numeric), C (Numeric), D (DateTime)
+ Numeric feature C is dropped because it is an ID column with all unique values
+ Numeric features A and B have missing values and hence are imputed by the mean
+ DateTime feature D is featurized into 11 different engineered features

Use these 2 APIs on the first step of fitted model to understand more.  See [this sample notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/forecasting-energy-demand).

+ API 1: `get_engineered_feature_names()` returns a list of engineered feature names.

  Usage:
  ```python
  fitted_model.named_steps['timeseriestransformer']. get_engineered_feature_names ()
  ```

  ```
  Output: ['A', 'B', 'A_WASNULL', 'B_WASNULL', 'year', 'half', 'quarter', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'am_pm', 'hour12', 'wday', 'qday', 'week']
  ```

  This list includes all engineered feature names.

  >[!Note]
  >Use 'timeseriestransformer' for task=’forecasting’, else use 'datatransformer' for ‘regression’ or ‘classification’ task.

+ API 2: `get_featurization_summary()` returns featurization summary for all the input features.

  Usage:
  ```python
  fitted_model.named_steps['timeseriestransformer'].get_featurization_summary()
  ```

  >[!Note]
  >Use 'timeseriestransformer' for task=’forecasting’, else use 'datatransformer' for ‘regression’ or ‘classification’ task.

  Output:
  ```
  [{'RawFeatureName': 'A',
    'TypeDetected': 'Numeric',
    'Dropped': 'No',
    'EngineeredFeatureCount': 2,
    'Tranformations': ['MeanImputer', 'ImputationMarker']},
   {'RawFeatureName': 'B',
    'TypeDetected': 'Numeric',
    'Dropped': 'No',
    'EngineeredFeatureCount': 2,
    'Tranformations': ['MeanImputer', 'ImputationMarker']},
   {'RawFeatureName': 'C',
    'TypeDetected': 'Numeric',
    'Dropped': 'Yes',
    'EngineeredFeatureCount': 0,
    'Tranformations': []},
   {'RawFeatureName': 'D',
    'TypeDetected': 'DateTime',
    'Dropped': 'No',
    'EngineeredFeatureCount': 11,
    'Tranformations': ['DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime','DateTime']}]
  ```

   Where:

   |Output|Definition|
   |----|--------|
   |RawFeatureName|Input feature/column name from the dataset provided.|
   |TypeDetected|Detected datatype of the input feature.|
   |Dropped|Indicates if the input feature was dropped or used.|
   |EngineeringFeatureCount|Number of features generated through automated feature engineering transforms.|
   |Transformations|List of transformations applied to input features to generate engineered features.|
   
### Customize feature engineering
To customize feature engineering, specify `"feauturization":FeaturizationConfig`.

Supported customization includes:

|Customization|Definition|
|--|--|
|Column purpose update|Override feature type for the specified column.|
|Transformer parameter update |Update parameters for the specified transformer. Currently supports Imputer and HashOneHotEncoder.|
|Drop columns |Columns to drop from being featurized.|
|Block transformers| Block transformers to be used on featurization process.|

Create the FeaturizationConfig object using API calls:
```python
featurization_config = FeaturizationConfig()
featurization_config.blocked_transformers = ['LabelEncoder']
featurization_config.drop_columns = ['aspiration', 'stroke']
featurization_config.add_column_purpose('engine-size', 'Numeric')
featurization_config.add_column_purpose('body-style', 'CategoricalHash')
#default strategy mean, add transformer param for for 3 columns
featurization_config.add_transformer_params('Imputer', ['engine-size'], {"strategy": "median"})
featurization_config.add_transformer_params('Imputer', ['city-mpg'], {"strategy": "median"})
featurization_config.add_transformer_params('Imputer', ['bore'], {"strategy": "most_frequent"})
featurization_config.add_transformer_params('HashOneHotEncoder', [], {"number_of_bits": 3})
```

### Scaling/Normalization and algorithm with hyperparameter values:

To understand the scaling/normalization and algorithm/hyperparameter values for a pipeline, use fitted_model.steps. [Learn more about scaling/normalization](concept-automated-ml.md#preprocess). Here is a sample output:

```
[('RobustScaler', RobustScaler(copy=True, quantile_range=[10, 90], with_centering=True, with_scaling=True)), ('LogisticRegression', LogisticRegression(C=0.18420699693267145, class_weight='balanced', dual=False, fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1, max_iter=100, multi_class='multinomial', n_jobs=1, penalty='l2', random_state=None, solver='newton-cg', tol=0.0001, verbose=0, warm_start=False))
```

To get more details, use this helper function shown in [this sample notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/classification/auto-ml-classification.ipynb).

```python
from pprint import pprint


def print_model(model, prefix=""):
    for step in model.steps:
        print(prefix + step[0])
        if hasattr(step[1], 'estimators') and hasattr(step[1], 'weights'):
            pprint({'estimators': list(
                e[0] for e in step[1].estimators), 'weights': step[1].weights})
            print()
            for estimator in step[1].estimators:
                print_model(estimator[1], estimator[0] + ' - ')
        else:
            pprint(step[1].get_params())
            print()


print_model(fitted_model)
```

The following is sample output for a pipeline using a specific algorithm (LogisticRegression with RobustScalar, in this case).

```
RobustScaler
{'copy': True,
'quantile_range': [10, 90],

## Model interpretability

Model interpretability allows you to understand why your models made predictions, and the underlying feature importance values. The SDK includes various packages for enabling model interpretability features, both at training and inference time, for local and deployed models.

See the [how-to](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability-automl.md) for code samples on how to enable interpretability features specifically within automated machine learning experiments.

For general information on how model explanations and feature importance can be enabled in other areas of the SDK outside of automated machine learning, see the [concept](how-to-machine-learning-interpretability.md) article on interpretability.
