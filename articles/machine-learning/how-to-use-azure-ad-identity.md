# Use Azure AD identity with your machine learning web service in Azure Kubernetes Service

In this how-to, you learn how to assign an Azure Active Directory (AAD) identity to your deployed machine learning model in Azure Kubernetes Service. The [AAD Pod Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity) project allows applications to access cloud resources securely with AAD by using a [Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and Kubernetes primitives. This allows your web service to securely access your Azure resources without having to embed credentials or manage tokens directly inside your `score.py` script. This article explains the steps to create and install an Azure Identity in your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster and assign the identity to your deployed web service.

## Prerequisites

- The [Azure CLI extension for the Machine Learning service](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md), the [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true), or the [Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension](tutorial-setup-vscode-extension.md).

- Access to your AKS cluster using the `kubectl` command. For more information, see [Connect to the cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#connect-to-the-cluster)

- An Azure Machine Learning web service deployed to your AKS cluster.

## Create and install an Azure Identity in your AKS cluster

1. To determine if your AKS cluster is RBAC enabled, use the following command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks show --name <AKS cluster name> --resource-group <resource group name> --subscription <subscription id> --query enableRbac
    ```

    This command returns a value of `true` if RBAC is enabled. This value determines the command to use in the next step.

1. To install [AAD Pod Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#getting-started) in your AKS cluster, use one of the following commands:

    * If your AKS cluster has **RBAC enabled** use the following command:
    
        ```azurecli-interactive
        kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/master/deploy/infra/deployment-rbac.yaml
        ```
    
    * If your AKS cluster **does not have RBAC enabled**, use the following command:
    
        ```azurecli-interactive
        kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/master/deploy/infra/deployment.yaml
        ```
    
        The output of the command is similar to the following text:

        ```text
        customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/azureassignedidentities.aadpodidentity.k8s.io created
        customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/azureidentitybindings.aadpodidentity.k8s.io created
        customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/azureidentities.aadpodidentity.k8s.io created
        customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/azurepodidentityexceptions.aadpodidentity.k8s.io created
        daemonset.apps/nmi created
        deployment.apps/mic created
        ```

1. [Create an Azure Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#2-create-an-azure-identity) following the steps shown in AAD Pod Identity project page.

1. [Install the Azure Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#3-install-the-azure-identity) following the steps shown in AAD Pod Identity project page.

1. [Install the Azure Identity Binding](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#5-install-the-azure-identity-binding) following the steps shown in AAD Pod Identity project page.

1. If the Azure Identity created in the previous step is not in the same resource group as your AKS cluster, follow [Set Permissions for MIC](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#6-set-permissions-for-mic) following the steps shown in AAD Pod Identity project page.

## Assign Azure Identity to machine learning web service

The following steps use the Azure Identity created in the previous section, and assign it to your AKS web service through a **selector label**.

First, identify the name and namespace of your deployment in your AKS cluster that you want to assign the Azure Identity. You can get this information by running the following command. The namespaces should be your Azure Machine Learning workspace name and your deployment name should be your endpoint name as shown in the portal.

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get deployment --selector=isazuremlapp=true --all-namespaces --show-labels
```

Add the Azure Identity selector label to your deployment by editing the deployment spec. The selector value should be the one that you defined in step 5 of [Install the Azure Identity Binding](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#5-install-the-azure-identity-binding).

```yaml
apiVersion: "aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1"
kind: AzureIdentityBinding
metadata:
  name: demo1-azure-identity-binding
spec:
  AzureIdentity: <a-idname>
  Selector: <label value to match>
```

Edit the deployment to add the Azure Identity selector label. Go to the following section under `/spec/template/metadata/labels`. You should see values such as `isazuremlapp: “true”`. Add the aad-pod-identity label like shown below.

```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl edit deployment/<name of deployment> -n azureml-<name of workspace>
```

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
       aadpodidbinding: "<value of Selector in AzureIdentityBinding>"
      ...
```

To verify that the label was correctly added, run the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
   kubectl get deployment <name of deployment> -n azureml-<name of workspace> --show-labels
```

To see all pod statuses, run the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl get pods -n azureml-<name of workspace>
```

Once the pods are up and running, the web services for this deployment will now be able to access Azure resources through your Azure Identity without having to embed the credentials in your code. 

## Assign the appropriate roles to your Azure Identity

[Assign your Azure Managed Identity with appropriate roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal) to access other Azure resources. Ensure that the roles you are assigning have the correct **Data Actions**. For example, the [Storage Blob Data Reader Role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader) will have read permissions to your Storage Blob while the generic [Reader Role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader) might not.

## Use Azure Identity with your machine learning web service

Deploy a model to your AKS cluster. The `score.py` script can contain operations pointing to the Azure resources that your Azure Identity has access to. Ensure that you have installed your required client library dependencies for the resource that you are trying to access to. Below are a couple examples of how you can use your Azure Identity to access different Azure resources from your service.

### Access Key Vault from your web service

If you have given your Azure Identity read access to a secret inside a **Key Vault**, your `score.py` can access it using the following code.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

my_vault_name = "yourkeyvaultname"
my_vault_url = "https://{}.vault.azure.net/".format(my_vault_name) 
my_secret_name = "sample-secret"

# This will use your Azure Managed Identity
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
secret_client = SecretClient(
    vault_url=my_vault_url,
    credential=credential)
secret = secret_client.get_secret(my_secret_name)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example uses the DefaultAzureCredential. To grant your identity access using a specific access policy, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy using the Azure CLI](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy-cli).

### Access Blob from your web service

If you have given your Azure Identity read access to data inside a **Storage Blob**, your `score.py` can access it using the following code.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

my_storage_account_name = "yourstorageaccountname"
my_storage_account_url = "https://{}.blob.core.windows.net/".format(my_storage_account_name)

# This will use your Azure Managed Identity
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
    account_url=my_storage_account_url,
    credential=credential
)
blob_client = blob_service_client.get_blob_client(container="some-container", blob="some_text.txt")
blob_data = blob_client.download_blob()
blob_data.readall()
```
