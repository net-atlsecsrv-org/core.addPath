# Enable logging in ML training runs


The Azure Machine Learning Python SDK lets you log real-time information using both the default Python logging package and SDK-specific functionality. You can log locally and send logs to your workspace in the portal.

Logs can help you diagnose errors and warnings, or track performance metrics like parameters and model performance. In this article, you learn how to enable logging in the following scenarios:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Interactive training sessions
> * Submitting training jobs using ScriptRunConfig
> * Python native `logging` settings
> * Logging from additional sources


> [!TIP]
> This article shows you how to monitor the model training process. If you're interested in monitoring resource usage and events from Azure Machine learning, such as quotas, completed training runs, or completed model deployments, see [Monitoring Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md).

## Data types

You can log multiple data types including scalar values, lists, tables, images, directories, and more. For more information, and Python code examples for different data types, see the [Run class reference page](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run%28class%29).

### Logging run metrics 

Use the following methods in the logging APIs to influence the metrics visualizations. Note the [service limits](./resource-limits-quotas-capacity.md#metrics) for these logged metrics. 

|Logged Value|Example code| Format in portal|
|----|----|----|
|Log an array of numeric values| `run.log_list(name='Fibonacci', value=[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89])`|single-variable line chart|
|Log a single numeric value with the same metric name repeatedly used (like from within a for loop)| `for i in tqdm(range(-10, 10)):    run.log(name='Sigmoid', value=1 / (1 + np.exp(-i))) angle = i / 2.0`| Single-variable line chart|
|Log a row with 2 numerical columns repeatedly|`run.log_row(name='Cosine Wave', angle=angle, cos=np.cos(angle))   sines['angle'].append(angle)      sines['sine'].append(np.sin(angle))`|Two-variable line chart|
|Log table with 2 numerical columns|`run.log_table(name='Sine Wave', value=sines)`|Two-variable line chart|
|Log image|`run.log_image(name='food', path='./breadpudding.jpg', plot=None, description='desert')`|Use this method to log an image file or a matplotlib plot to the run. These images will be visible and comparable in the run record|

### Logging with MLflow
Use MLFlowLogger to log metrics.

```python
from azureml.core import Run
# connect to the workspace from within your running code
run = Run.get_context()
ws = run.experiment.workspace

# workspace has associated ml-flow-tracking-uri
mlflow_url = ws.get_mlflow_tracking_uri()

#Example: PyTorch Lightning
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import MLFlowLogger

mlf_logger = MLFlowLogger(experiment_name=run.experiment.name, tracking_uri=mlflow_url)
mlf_logger._run_id = run.id
```

## Interactive logging session

Interactive logging sessions are typically used in notebook environments. The method [Experiment.start_logging()](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.experiment%28class%29#start-logging--args----kwargs-) starts an interactive logging session. Any metrics logged during the session are added to the run record in the experiment. The method [run.complete()](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run%28class%29#complete--set-status-true-) ends the sessions and marks the run as completed.

## ScriptRun logs

In this section, you learn how to add logging code inside of runs created when configured with ScriptRunConfig. You can use the [**ScriptRunConfig**](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.scriptrunconfig) class to encapsulate scripts and environments for repeatable runs. You can also use this option to show a visual Jupyter Notebooks widget for monitoring.

This example performs a parameter sweep over alpha values and captures the results using the [run.log()](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run%28class%29#log-name--value--description----) method.

1. Create a training script that includes the logging logic, `train.py`.

   [!code-python[](~/MachineLearningNotebooks/how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-local/train.py)]


1. Submit the ```train.py``` script to run in a user-managed environment. The entire script folder is submitted for training.

   [!notebook-python[] (~/MachineLearningNotebooks/how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-local/train-on-local.ipynb?name=src)]


   [!notebook-python[] (~/MachineLearningNotebooks/how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-local/train-on-local.ipynb?name=run)]

    The `show_output` parameter turns on verbose logging, which lets you see details from the training process as well as information about any remote resources or compute targets. Use the following code to turn on verbose logging when you submit the experiment.

```python
run = exp.submit(src, show_output=True)
```

You can also use the same parameter in the `wait_for_completion` function on the resulting run.

```python
run.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

## Native Python logging

Some logs in the SDK may contain an error that instructs you to set the logging level to DEBUG. To set the logging level, add the following code to your script.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Additional logging sources

Azure Machine Learning can also log information from other sources during training, such as automated machine learning runs, or Docker containers that run the jobs. These logs aren't documented, but if you encounter problems and contact Microsoft support, they may be able to use these logs during troubleshooting.
