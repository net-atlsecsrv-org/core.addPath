# Azure security baseline for Azure Machine Learning

The Azure Security Baseline for Microsoft Azure Machine Learning contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Machine Learning relies on other Azure services for compute resources. Compute resources (compute targets) are used to train and deploy models. You can create these compute targets in a virtual network. For example, you can use Azure Virtual Machine Learning compute instance to train a model and then deploy the model to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You can secure your machine learning lifecycles by isolating Azure Machine Learning training and inference jobs within an Azure virtual network.

Azure Firewall can be used to control access to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and the public internet.

- [Use workspace behind Azure Firewall for Azure Machine Learning](how-to-access-azureml-behind-firewall.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Azure Machine Learning relies on other Azure services for compute resources. Assign network security groups to the networks that are created as your Machine Learning deployment. 

Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. You can also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

- [Understand network security provided by Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-network-recommendations.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: You can enable HTTPS to secure communication with web services deployed by Azure Machine Learning. Web services are deployed on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) or Azure Container Instances (ACI) and secure the data submitted by clients. You can also use private IP with AKS to restrict scoring, so that only clients behind a virtual network can access the web service.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or block malicious traffic.

Select an offer from Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities.  When payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall threat intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall threat intelligence-based filtering is used to alert on and/or block traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.
