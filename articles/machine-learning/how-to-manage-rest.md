# Create, run, and delete Azure ML resources using REST



There are several ways to manage your Azure ML resources. You can use the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), [command-line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true), or [Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true). Or, you can choose the REST API. The REST API uses HTTP verbs in a standard way to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources. The REST API works with any language or tool that can make HTTP requests. REST's straightforward structure often makes it a good choice in scripting environments and for MLOps automation. 

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Retrieve an authorization token
> * Create a properly-formatted REST request using service principal authentication
> * Use GET requests to retrieve information about Azure ML's hierarchical resources
> * Use PUT and POST requests to create and modify resources
> * Use DELETE requests to clean up resources 
> * Use key-based authorization to score deployed models

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure subscription** for which you have administrative rights. If you don't have such a subscription, try the [free or paid personal subscription](https://aka.ms/AMLFree)
- An [Azure Machine Learning Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace)
- Administrative REST requests use service principal authentication. Follow the steps in [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-setup-authentication#set-up-service-principal-authentication) to create a service principal in your workspace
- The **curl** utility. The **curl** program is available in the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://aka.ms/wslinstall/) or any UNIX distribution. In PowerShell, **curl** is an alias for **Invoke-WebRequest** and `curl -d "key=val" -X POST uri` becomes `Invoke-WebRequest -Body "key=val" -Method POST -Uri uri`. 

## Retrieve a service principal authentication token

Administrative REST requests are authenticated with an OAuth2 implicit flow. This authentication flow uses a token provided by your subscription's service principal. To retrieve this token, you'll need:

- Your tenant ID (identifying the organization to which your subscription belongs)
- Your client ID (which will be associated with the created token)
- Your client secret (which you should safeguard)

You should have these values from the response to the creation of your service principal. Getting these values is discussed in [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-setup-authentication#set-up-service-principal-authentication). If you're using your company subscription, you might not have permission to create a service principal. In that case, you should use either a [free or paid personal subscription](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).

To retrieve a token:

1. Open a terminal window
1. Enter the following code at the command line
1. Substitute your own values for `{your-tenant-id}`, `{your-client-id}`, and `{your-client-secret}`. Throughout this article, strings surrounded by curly brackets are variables you'll have to replace with your own appropriate values.
1. Run the command

```bash
curl -X POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id}/oauth2/token \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F&client_id={your-client-id}&client_secret={your-client-secret}" \
```

The response should provide an access token good for one hour:

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": "3599",
    "ext_expires_in": "3599",
    "expires_on": "1578523094",
    "not_before": "1578519194",
    "resource": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "access_token": "your-access-token"
}
```

Make note of the token, as you'll use it to authenticate all subsequent administrative requests. You'll do so by setting an Authorization header in all requests:

```bash
curl -h "Authentication: Bearer {your-access-token}" ...more args...
```

Note that the value starts with the string "Bearer " including a single space before you add the token.

## Get a list of resource groups associated with your subscription

To retrieve the list of resource groups associated with your subscription, run:

```bash
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups?api-version=2019-11-01 -H "Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}"
```

Across Azure, many REST APIs are published. Each service provider updates their API on their own cadence, but does so without breaking existing programs. The service provider uses the `api-version` argument to ensure compatibility. The `api-version` argument varies from service to service. For the Machine Learning Service, for instance, the current API version is `2019-11-01`. For storage accounts, it's `2019-06-01`. For key vaults, it's `2019-09-01`. All REST calls should set the `api-version` argument to the expected value. You can rely on the syntax and semantics of the specified version even as the API continues to evolve. If you send a request to a provider without the `api-version` argument, the response will contain a human-readable list of supported values. 

The above call will result in a compacted JSON response of the form: 

```json
{
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "/subscriptions/12345abc-abbc-1b2b-1234-57ab575a5a5a/resourceGroups/RG1",
            "name": "RG1",
            "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups",
            "location": "westus2",
            "properties": {
                "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "/subscriptions/12345abc-abbc-1b2b-1234-57ab575a5a5a/resourceGroups/RG2",
            "name": "RG2",
            "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups",
            "location": "eastus",
            "properties": {
                "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```


## Drill down into workspaces and their resources

To retrieve the set of workspaces in a resource group, run the following, substituting `{your-subscription-id}`, `{your-resource-group}`, and `{your-access-token}`: 

```
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}"
```

Again you'll receive a JSON list, this time containing a list, each item of which details a workspace:

```json
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/12345abc-abbc-1b2b-1234-57ab575a5a5a/resourceGroups/DeepLearningResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/my-workspace",
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "type": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces",
    "location": "centralus",
    "tags": {},
    "etag": null,
    "properties": {
        "friendlyName": "",
        "description": "",
        "creationTime": "2020-01-03T19:56:09.7588299+00:00",
        "storageAccount": "/subscriptions/12345abc-abbc-1b2b-1234-57ab575a5a5a/resourcegroups/DeepLearningResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts/myworkspace0275623111",
        "containerRegistry": null,
        "keyVault": "/subscriptions/12345abc-abbc-1b2b-1234-57ab575a5a5a/resourcegroups/DeepLearningResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/myworkspace2525649324",
        "applicationInsights": "/subscriptions/12345abc-abbc-1b2b-1234-57ab575a5a5a/resourcegroups/DeepLearningResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.insights/components/myworkspace2053523719",
        "hbiWorkspace": false,
        "workspaceId": "cba12345-abab-abab-abab-ababab123456",
        "subscriptionState": null,
        "subscriptionStatusChangeTimeStampUtc": null,
        "discoveryUrl": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net/discovery"
    },
    "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned",
        "principalId": "abcdef1-abab-1234-1234-abababab123456",
        "tenantId": "1fedcba-abab-1234-1234-abababab123456"
    },
    "sku": {
        "name": "Basic",
        "tier": "Basic"
    }
}
```

To work with resources within a workspace, you'll switch from the general **management.azure.com** server to a REST API server specific to the location of the workspace. Note the value of the `discoveryUrl` key in the above JSON response. If you GET that URL, you'll receive a response something like:

```json
{
  "api": "https://centralus.api.azureml.ms",
  "catalog": "https://catalog.cortanaanalytics.com",
  "experimentation": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "gallery": "https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/project",
  "history": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "hyperdrive": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "labeling": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "modelmanagement": "https://centralus.modelmanagement.azureml.net",
  "pipelines": "https://centralus.aether.ms",
  "studiocoreservices": "https://centralus.studioservice.azureml.com"
}
```

The value of the `api` response is the URL of the server that you'll use for additional requests. To list experiments, for instance, send the following command. Replace `regional-api-server` with the value of the `api` response (for instance, `centralus.api.azureml.ms`). Also replace `your-subscription-id`, `your-resource-group`, `your-workspace-name`, and `your-access-token` as usual:

```bash
curl https://{regional-api-server}/history/v1.0/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/\
providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/experiments?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}"
```

Similarly, to retrieve registered models in your workspace, send:

```bash
curl https://{regional-api-server}/modelmanagement/v1.0/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/\
providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/models?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}"
```

Notice that to list experiments the path begins with `history/v1.0` while to list models, the path begins with `modelmanagement/v1.0`. The REST API is divided into several operational groups, each with a distinct path. 

|Area|Path|
|-|-|
|Artifacts|/rest/api/azureml|
|Data stores|/azure/machine-learning/how-to-access-data|
|Hyperparameter tuning|hyperdrive/v1.0/|
|Models|modelmanagement/v1.0/|
|Run history|execution/v1.0/ and history/v1.0/|

You can explore the REST API using the general pattern of:

|URL component|Example|
|-|-|
| https://| |
| regional-api-server/ | centralus.api.azureml.ms/ |
| operations-path/ | history/v1.0/ |
| subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/ | subscriptions/abcde123-abab-abab-1234-0123456789abc/ |
| resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/ | resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/ |
| providers/operation-provider/ | providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/ |
| provider-resource-path/ | workspaces/MLWorkspace/MyWorkspace/FirstExperiment/runs/1/ |
| operations-endpoint/ | artifacts/metadata/ |


## Create and modify resources using PUT and POST requests

In addition to resource retrieval with the GET verb, the REST API supports the creation of all the resources necessary to train, deploy, and monitor ML solutions. 

Training and running ML models require compute resources. You can list the compute resources of a workspace with: 

```bash
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/\
providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/computes?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}"
```

To create or overwrite a named compute resource, you'll use a PUT request. In the following, in addition to the now-familiar substitutions of `your-subscription-id`, `your-resource-group`, `your-workspace-name`, and `your-access-token`, substitute `your-compute-name`, and values for `location`, `vmSize`, `vmPriority`, `scaleSettings`, `adminUserName`, and `adminUserPassword`. As specified in the reference at [Machine Learning Compute - Create Or Update SDK Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/workspacesandcomputes/machinelearningcompute/createorupdate), the following command creates a dedicated, single-node Standard_D1 (a basic CPU compute resource) that will scale down after 30 minutes:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/computes/{your-compute-name}?api-version=2019-11-01' \
  -H 'Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "location": "{your-azure-location}",
    "properties": {
        "computeType": "AmlCompute",
        "properties": {
            "vmSize": "Standard_D1",
            "vmPriority": "Dedicated",
            "scaleSettings": {
                "maxNodeCount": 1,
                "minNodeCount": 0,
                "nodeIdleTimeBeforeScaleDown": "PT30M"
            }
        }
    },
    "userAccountCredentials": {
        "adminUserName": "{adminUserName}",
        "adminUserPassword": "{adminUserPassword}"
    }
}'
```

> [!Note]
> In Windows terminals you may have to escape the double-quote symbols when sending JSON data. That is, text such as `"location"` becomes `\"location\"`. 

A successful request will get a `201 Created` response, but note that this response simply means that the provisioning process has begun. You'll need to poll (or use the portal) to confirm its successful completion.

### Create an experimental run

To start a run within an experiment, you need a zip folder containing your training script and related files, and a run definition JSON file. The zip folder must have the Python entry file in its root directory. As an example, zip a trivial Python program such as the following into a folder called **train.zip**.

```python
# hello.py
# Entry file for run
print("Hello, REST!")
```

Save this next snippet as **definition.json**. Confirm the "Script" value matches the name of the Python file you just zipped up. Confirm the "Target" value matches the name of an available compute resource. 

```json
{
    "Configuration":{  
       "Script":"hello.py",
       "Arguments":[  
          "234"
       ],
       "SourceDirectoryDataStore":null,
       "Framework":"Python",
       "Communicator":"None",
       "Target":"cpu-compute",
       "MaxRunDurationSeconds":1200,
       "NodeCount":1,
       "Environment":{  
          "Python":{  
             "InterpreterPath":"python",
             "UserManagedDependencies":false,
             "CondaDependencies":{  
                "name":"project_environment",
                "dependencies":[  
                   "python=3.6.2",
                   {  
                      "pip":[  
                         "azureml-defaults"
                      ]
                   }
                ]
             }
          },
          "Docker":{  
             "BaseImage":"mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/base:intelmpi2018.3-ubuntu16.04"
          }
      },
       "History":{  
          "OutputCollection":true
       }
    }
}
```

Post these files to the server using `multipart/form-data` content:

```bash
curl https://{regional-api-server}/execution/v1.0/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/experiments/{your-experiment-name}/startrun?api-version=2019-11-01 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}" \
  -F projectZipFile=@train.zip \
  -F runDefinitionFile=@runDefinition.json
```

A successful POST request will generate a `200 OK` status, with a response body containing the identifier of the created run:

```json
{
  "runId": "my-first-experiment_1579642222877"
}
```

You can monitor a run using the REST-ful pattern that should now be familiar:

```bash
curl 'https://{regional-api-server}/history/v1.0/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/experiments/{your-experiment-names}/runs/{your-run-id}?api-version=2019-11-01' \
  -H 'Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}'
```

### Delete resources you no longer need

Some, but not all, resources support the DELETE verb. Check the [API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/) before committing to the REST API for deletion use-cases. To delete a model, for instance, you can use:

```bash
curl
  -X DELETE \
'https://{regional-api-server}/modelmanagement/v1.0/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}/models/{your-model-id}?api-version=2019-11-01' \
  -H 'Authorization:Bearer {your-access-token}' 
```

## Use REST to score a deployed model

While it's possible to deploy a model so that it authenticates with a service principal, most client-facing deployments use key-based authentication. You can find the appropriate key in your deployment's page within the **Endpoints** tab of Studio. The same location will show your endpoint's scoring URI. Your model's inputs must be modeled as a JSON array named `data`:

```bash
curl 'https://{scoring-uri}' \
 -H 'Authorization:Bearer {your-key}' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "data" : [ {model-specific-data-structure} ] }
```

## Create a workspace using REST 

Every Azure ML workspace has a dependency on four other Azure resources: a container registry with administration enabled, a key vault, an Application Insights resource, and a storage account. You cannot create a workspace until these resources exist. Consult the REST API reference for the details of creating each such resource.

To create a workspace, PUT a call similar to the following to `management.azure.com`. While this call requires you to set a large number of variables, it's structurally identical to other calls that this article has discussed. 

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}\
/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{your-new-workspace-name}?api-version=2019-11-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {your-access-token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "location": "{desired-region}",
    "properties": {
        "friendlyName" : "{your-workspace-friendly-name}",
        "description" : "{your-workspace-description}",
        "containerRegistry" : "/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/\
providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/{your-registry-name}",
        keyVault" : "/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}\
/providers/Microsoft.Keyvault/vaults/{your-keyvault-name}",
        "applicationInsights" : "subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/\
providers/Microsoft.insights/components/{your-application-insights-name}",
        "storageAccount" : "/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/\
providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{your-storage-account-name}"
    },
    "identity" : {
        "type" : "systemAssigned"
    }
}'
```

You should receive a `202 Accepted` response and, in the returned headers, a `Location` URI. You can GET this URI for information on the deployment, including helpful debugging information if there is a problem with one of your dependent resources (for instance, if you forgot to enable admin access on your container registry). 

## Troubleshooting

### Resource provider errors

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-resource-provider](../../includes/machine-learning-resource-provider.md)]

### Moving the workspace

> [!WARNING]
> Moving your Azure Machine Learning workspace to a different subscription, or moving the owning subscription to a new tenant, is not supported. Doing so may cause errors.

### Deleting the Azure Container Registry

The Azure Machine Learning workspace uses Azure Container Registry (ACR) for some operations. It will automatically create an ACR instance when it first needs one.
