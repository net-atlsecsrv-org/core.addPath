# Enterprise (preview) and Basic Editions of Azure Machine Learning 

Azure Machine Learning offers two editions tailored for your machine learning needs. These editions determine which machine learning tools are available to developers and data scientists from their workspace.

## Choose an edition

You assign the edition whenever you create a workspace. Customers are responsible for costs incurred on compute and other Azure resources during this time. Learn how to [manage costs for Azure Machine Learning](concept-plan-manage-cost.md).

Learn how to [upgrade a Basic workspace to Enterprise (preview) edition](how-to-manage-workspace.md#upgrade). 

## What's in each edition
