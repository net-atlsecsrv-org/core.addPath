# Monitoring Azure machine learning data reference

Learn about the data and resources collected by Azure Monitor from your Azure Machine Learning workspace. See [Monitoring Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data.

## Metrics

This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics collected for Azure Machine Learning. The resource provider for these metrics is [Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces](../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported.md#microsoftmachinelearningservicesworkspaces).

| Started runs | Count | The number of started runs. |

## Metric dimensions

For more information on what metric dimensions are, see [Multi-dimensional metrics](../azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-metrics.md#multi-dimensional-metrics).

Azure Machine Learning has the following dimensions associated with its metrics.

| Dimension | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Cluster Name | The name of the compute cluster resource. Available for all quota metrics. |
| Vm Family Name | The name of the VM family used by the cluster. Available for quota utilization percentage. |
| Vm Priority | The priority of the VM. Available for quota utilization percentage.
| CreatedTime | Only available for CpuUtilization and GpuUtilization. |
| DeviceId | ID of the device (GPU). Only available for GpuUtilization. |
| NodeId | ID of the node created where job is running. Only available for CpuUtilization and GpuUtilization. |
| RunId | ID of the run/job. Only available for CpuUtilization and GpuUtilization. |
| ComputeType | The compute type that the run used. Only available for Completed runs, Failed runs, and Started runs. |
| PipelineStepType | The type of [PipelineStep](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-core/azureml.pipeline.core.pipelinestep?preserve-view=true&view=azure-ml-py) used in the run. Only available for Completed runs, Failed runs, and Started runs. |
| PublishedPipelineId | The ID of the published pipeline used in the run. Only available for Completed runs, Failed runs, and Started runs. |
| RunType | The type of run. Only available for Completed runs, Failed runs, and Started runs. |

The valid values for the RunType dimension are:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Experiment | Non-pipeline runs. |
| PipelineRun | A pipeline run, which is the parent of a StepRun. |
| StepRun | A run for a pipeline step. |
| ReusedStepRun | A run for a pipeline step that reuses a previous run. |
