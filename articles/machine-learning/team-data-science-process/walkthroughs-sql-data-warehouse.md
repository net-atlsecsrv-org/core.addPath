# SQL Data Warehouse data science walkthroughs using T-SQL and Python on Azure

These walkthroughs use of SQL Data Warehouse to do predictive analytics. They follow the steps outlined in the Team Data Science Process. For an overview of the Team Data Science Process, see [Data Science Process](overview.md). For an introduction to SQL Data Warehouse, see [What is Azure SQL Data Warehouse?](../../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is.md)

Additional data science walkthroughs that execute the Team Data Science Process are grouped by the **platform** that they use. See [Walkthroughs executing the Team Data Science Process](walkthroughs.md) for an itemization of these examples.


## Predict taxi tips using T-SQL and IPython notebooks with SQL Data Warehouse

The [Use SQL Data Warehouse walkthrough](sqldw-walkthrough.md) shows you how to build and deploy machine learning classification and regression models using SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW).  The data are a publicly available NYC taxi trip and fare dataset.
