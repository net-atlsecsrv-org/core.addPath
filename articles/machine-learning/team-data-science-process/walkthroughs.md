# Walkthroughs executing the Team Data Science Process

These **end-to-end walkthroughs** demonstrate the steps in the Team Data Science Process for specific scenarios. They illustrate how to combine cloud, on-premises tools, and services into a workflow or pipeline to create an **intelligent application**. The walkthroughs are grouped by **platform** that they use.


## Walkthrough descriptions

Here are brief descriptions of what these walkthrough examples provide on their respective platforms:


- [HDInsight Spark walkthroughs using PySpark and Scala](walkthroughs-spark.md) These walkthroughs use PySpark and Scala on an Azure Spark cluster to do predictive analytics.
- [HDInsight Hadoop walkthroughs using Hive](walkthroughs-hdinsight-hadoop.md) These walkthroughs use Hive with an HDInsight Hadoop cluster to do predictive analytics.
- [Azure Data Lake walkthroughs using U-SQL](walkthroughs-azure-data-lake.md) These walkthroughs use U-SQL with Azure Data Lake to do predictive analytics.
- [SQL Server](walkthroughs-sql-server.md) These walkthroughs use SQL Server, SQL Server R Services, and SQL Server Python Services to do predictive analytics.
- [SQL Data Warehouse](walkthroughs-sql-data-warehouse.md) These walkthroughs use SQL Data Warehouse to do predictive analytics.
