# Create and explore Azure Machine Learning dataset with labels

In this article, you'll learn how to export the data labels from an Azure Machine Learning data labeling project and load them into popular formats such as, a pandas dataframe for data exploration or a Torchvision dataset for image transformation. 

## What are datasets with labels 

We refer to Azure Machine Learning datasets with labels as labeled datasets. These specific dataset types of labeled datasets are only created as an output of Azure Machine Learning data labeling projects. Create a data labeling project with [these steps](how-to-create-labeling-projects.md). Machine Learning supports data labeling projects for image classification, either multi-label or multi-class, and object identification together with bounded boxes.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.
* The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true), or access to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/).
    * Install the [azure-contrib-dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-contrib-dataset/?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true) package
* A Machine Learning workspace. See [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).
* Access to an Azure Machine Learning data labeling project. If you don't have a labeling project, create one with [these steps](how-to-create-labeling-projects.md).

## Export data labels 

When you complete a data labeling project, you can export the label data from a labeling project. Doing so, allows you to capture both the reference to the data and its labels, and export them in [COCO format](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data) or as an Azure Machine Learning dataset. Use the **Export** button on the **Project details** page of your labeling project.

### COCO 

 The COCO file is created in the default blob store of the Azure Machine Learning workspace in a folder within *export/coco*. 

### Azure Machine Learning dataset

You can access the exported Azure Machine Learning dataset in the **Datasets** section of your Azure Machine Learning studio. The dataset **Details** page also provides sample code to access your labels from Python.

## Explore labeled datasets

Load your labeled datasets into a pandas dataframe or Torchvision dataset to leverage popular open-source libraries for data exploration, as well as PyTorch provided libraries for image transformation and training.

### Pandas dataframe

You can load labeled datasets into a pandas dataframe with the [`to_pandas_dataframe()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.tabulardataset?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true#&preserve-view=trueto-pandas-dataframe-on-error--null---out-of-range-datetime--null--) method from the `azureml-contrib-dataset` class. Install the class with the following shell command: 

```shell
pip install azureml-contrib-dataset
```

>[!NOTE]
>The azureml.contrib namespace changes frequently, as we work to improve the service. As such, anything in this namespace should be considered as a preview, and not fully supported by Microsoft.

We offer the following file handling options for file streams when converting to a pandas dataframe.
* Download: Download your data files to a local path.
* Mount: Mount your data files to a mount point. Mount only works for Linux-based compute, including Azure Machine Learning notebook VM and Azure Machine Learning Compute.

```Python
import azureml.contrib.dataset
from azureml.contrib.dataset import FileHandlingOption
animal_pd = animal_labels.to_pandas_dataframe(file_handling_option=FileHandlingOption.DOWNLOAD, target_path='./download/', overwrite_download=True)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

#read images from downloaded path
img = mpimg.imread(animal_pd.loc[0,'image_url'])
imgplot = plt.imshow(img)
```

### Torchvision datasets

You can load labeled datasets into Torchvision dataset with the [to_torchvision()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-contrib-dataset/azureml.contrib.dataset.tabulardataset?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true#&preserve-view=trueto-torchvision--) method also from the `azureml-contrib-dataset` class. To use this method, you need to have [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) installed. 

```python
from torchvision.transforms import functional as F

# load animal_labels dataset into torchvision dataset
pytorch_dataset = animal_labels.to_torchvision()
img = pytorch_dataset[0][0]
print(type(img))

# use methods from torchvision to transform the img into grayscale
pil_image = F.to_pil_image(img)
gray_image = F.to_grayscale(pil_image, num_output_channels=3)

imgplot = plt.imshow(gray_image)
```
