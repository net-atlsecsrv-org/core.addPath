# Tutorial: Run a "Hello world!" Python script (part 2 of 4)

In this tutorial, you learn how to use the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to submit and run a Python "Hello world!" script.

This tutorial is *part 2 of a four-part tutorial series* in which you learn the fundamentals of Azure Machine Learning and complete jobs-based machine learning tasks in Azure. This tutorial builds on the work you completed in [Part 1: Set up your local machine for Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup-local.md).

In this tutorial, you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and run a "Hello world!" Python script locally.
> * Create a Python control script to submit "Hello world!" to Azure Machine Learning.
> * Understand the Azure Machine Learning concepts in the control script.
> * Submit and run the "Hello world!" script.
> * View your code output in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [part 1](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup-local.md) if you don't already have an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Introductory knowledge of the Python language and machine learning workflows.
- Local development environment, such as Visual Studio Code, Jupyter, or PyCharm.
- Python (version 3.5 to 3.7).

## Create and run a Python script locally

Create a new subdirectory called `src` under the `tutorial` directory to store code that you want to run on an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster. In the `src` subdirectory, create the `hello.py` Python script:

```python
# src/hello.py
print("Hello world!")
```

Your project directory structure will now look like:

```Bash
tutorial
└──.azureml
|  └──config.json
└──src
|  └──hello.py
└──01-create-workspace.py
└──02-create-compute.py
```

### Test your script locally

You can run your code locally, by using your favorite IDE or a terminal. Running code locally has the benefit of interactive debugging of code.

```bash
cd <path/to/tutorial>
python ./src/hello.py
```

## Create a control script

A *control script* allows you to run your `hello.py` script in the cloud. You use the control script to control how and where your machine learning code is run.  

In your tutorial directory, create a new Python file called `03-run-hello.py` and copy/paste the following code into that file:

```python
# tutorial/03-run-hello.py
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment, Environment, ScriptRunConfig

ws = Workspace.from_config()
experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='day1-experiment-hello')

config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='./src', script='hello.py', compute_target='cpu-cluster')

run = experiment.submit(config)
aml_url = run.get_portal_url()
print(aml_url)
```

### Understand the code

Here's a description of how the control script works:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `ws = Workspace.from_config()`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      [Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true) connects to your Azure Machine Learning workspace, so that you can communicate with your Azure Machine Learning resources.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `experiment =  Experiment( ... )`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      [Experiment](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.experiment.experiment?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true) provides a simple way to organize multiple runs under a single name. Later you can see how experiments make it easy to compare metrics between dozens of runs.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `config = ScriptRunConfig( ... )` 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      [ScriptRunConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.scriptrunconfig?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true) wraps your `hello.py` code and passes it to your workspace. As the name suggests, you can use this class to _configure_ how you want your _script_ to _run_ in Azure Machine Learning. It also specifies what compute target the script will run on. In this code, the target is the compute cluster that you created in the [setup tutorial](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup-local.md).
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `run = experiment.submit(config)`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
       Submits your script. This submission is called a [run](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.run%28class%29?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true). A run encapsulates a single execution of your code. Use a run to monitor the script progress, capture the output, analyze the results, visualize metrics, and more.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `aml_url = run.get_portal_url()` 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
        The `run` object provides a handle on the execution of your code. Monitor its progress from the Azure Machine Learning studio with the URL that's printed from the Python script.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Submit and run your code in the cloud

Run your control script, which in turn runs `hello.py` on the compute cluster that you created in the [setup tutorial](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup-local.md).

```bash
python 03-run-hello.py
```

## Monitor your code in the cloud by using the studio

The output will contain a link to the studio that looks something like this:
`https://ml.azure.com/experiments/hello-world/runs/<run-id>?wsid=/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/workspaces/<workspace-name>`.

Follow the link and go to the **Outputs + logs** tab. There you can see a 
`70_driver_log.txt` file that looks like this:

```txt
 1: [2020-08-04T22:15:44.407305] Entering context manager injector.
 2: [context_manager_injector.py] Command line Options: Namespace(inject=['ProjectPythonPath:context_managers.ProjectPythonPath', 'RunHistory:context_managers.RunHistory', 'TrackUserError:context_managers.TrackUserError', 'UserExceptions:context_managers.UserExceptions'], invocation=['hello.py'])
 3: Starting the daemon thread to refresh tokens in background for process with pid = 31263

10:

12: The experiment completed successfully. Finalizing run...
13: Logging experiment finalizing status in history service.

19: [2020-08-04T22:15:47.040203] TimeoutHandler __exit__
```

On line 8, you see the "Hello world!" output.

The `70_driver_log.txt` file contains the standard output from a run. This file can be useful when you're debugging remote runs in the cloud.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you took a simple "Hello world!" script and ran it on Azure. You saw how to connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace, create an experiment, and submit your `hello.py` code to the cloud.

In the next tutorial, you build on these learnings by running something more interesting than `print("Hello world!")`.
