# What is an Azure Machine Learning compute instance?

An Azure Machine Learning compute instance (preview) is a fully-managed cloud-based workstation for data scientists. 

Compute instances make it easy to get started with Azure Machine Learning development as well as provide management and enterprise readiness capabilities for IT administrators.  

Use a compute instance as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud.

Compute instances are typically used as development environments.  They can also be used as a compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing.  For large tasks, an [Azure Machine Learning compute cluster](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md#amlcompute) with multi-node scaling capabilities is a better compute target choice.

> [!NOTE]
> Compute instances are currently available only for workspaces with a region of **North Central US** or **UK South**, with support for other regions coming soon.
>If your workspace is in any other region, you can continue to create and use a [Notebook VM](concept-compute-instance.md#notebookvm) instead. 

## Why use a compute instance?

A compute instance is a fully-managed cloud-based workstation optimized for your machine learning development environment. It provides the following benefits:

|Key benefits||
|----|----|
|Productivity|Data scientists can build and deploy models using integrated notebooks and the following tools in their web browser:<br/>-  Jupyter<br/>-  JupyterLab<br/>-  RStudio|
|Managed & secure|Reduce your security footprint and add compliance with enterprise security requirements. Compute instances  provide robust management policies and secure networking configurations such as:<br/><br/>- Auto-provisioning from Resource Manager templates or Azure Machine Learning SDK<br/>- [Role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)<br/>- [Virtual network support](how-to-enable-virtual-network.md#compute-instance)<br/>- SSH policy to enable/disable SSH access|
|Preconfigured&nbsp;or&nbsp;ML|Save time on setup tasks with pre-configured and up-to-date ML packages, deep learning frameworks, GPU drivers.|
|Fully customizable|Broad support for Azure VM types including GPUs and persisted low-level customization such as installing packages and drivers makes advanced scenarios a breeze. |

## <a name="contents"></a>Tools and environments

Azure Machine Learning compute instance enables you to author, train, and deploy models in a fully integrated notebook experience in your workspace.

Compute instances are typically used as development environments.  They can also be used as a compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing.  For large tasks, an [Azure Machine Learning compute cluster](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md#amlcompute) with multi-node scaling capabilities is a better compute target choice.


## Accessing files

Notebooks and R scripts are stored in the default storage account of your workspace in Azure file share.  These files are located under your “User files” directory. This storage makes it easy to share notebooks between compute instances. The storage account also keeps your notebooks safely preserved when you stop or delete a compute instance.

The Azure file share account of your workspace is mounted as a drive on the compute instance. This drive is the default working directory for Jupyter, Jupyter Labs, and RStudio.

The files in the file share are accessible from all compute instances in the same workspace. Any changes to these files on the compute instance will be reliably persisted back to the file share.

You can also clone the latest Azure Machine Learning samples to your folder under the user files directory in the workspace file share.

Writing small files can be slower on network drives than writing to the VM itself.  If you are writing many small files, try using a directory directly on the compute instance, such as a `/tmp` directory. Please note these files will not be accessible from other compute instances in the workspace.

## Managing a compute instance

In your workspace in Azure Machine Learning studio, select **Compute**, then select **Compute Instance** on the top.

![Manage a compute instance](./media/concept-compute-instance/manage-compute-instance.png)

You can perform the following actions:

* Create a compute instance. Specify the name, Azure VM type including GPUs, enable/disable SSH access, and configure virtual network settings optionally. You can also create an instance directly from integrated notebooks, Azure portal, Resource Manager template, or Azure Machine Learning SDK. The dedicated cores per region quota which applies to compute instance creation is unified and shared with Azure Machine Learning compute cluster quota.
* Refresh the compute instances tab
* Start, stop and restart a compute instance
* Delete a compute instance

For each compute instance in your workspace you can:

* Access Jupyter, JupyterLab, RStudio, VS Code URIs on the compute instance
* SSH into compute instance. SSH access is disabled by default but can be enabled at compute instance creation time. SSH access is through public/private key mechanism. The tab will give you details for SSH connection such as IP address, username, and port number.
* Get details about a specific compute instance such as IP address, and region.

[RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) allows you to control which users in the workspace can create, delete, start, stop, restart a compute instance. All users in the workspace contributor and owner role can create, delete, start, stop, and restart compute instances across the workspace. However, only the creator of a specific compute instance is allowed to access Jupyter, JupyterLab, and RStudio on that compute instance. The creator of the compute instance has the compute instance dedicated to them, have root access, and can terminal in through Jupyter. Compute instance will have single-user login of creator user and all actions will use that user’s identity for RBAC and attribution of experiment runs. SSH access is controlled through public/private key mechanism.

You can also create an instance
* Directly from the integrated notebooks experience
* In Azure portal
* From Azure Resource Manager template
* With Azure Machine Learning SDK

The dedicated cores per region quota, which applies to compute instance creation is unified and shared with Azure Machine Learning training cluster quota. 

## Compute Target

Compute instances can be used as a [training compute target](concept-compute-target.md#train) similar to Azure Machine Learning compute training clusters. Provision a multi-GPU VM to run distributed training jobs using TensorFlow/PyTorch estimators. You can also create a run configuration and use it to run your experiment on compute instance. 
You can use compute instance as a local inferencing deployment target for testing/debugging scenarios.

## <a name="notebookvm"></a>What happened to Notebook VM?

Compute instances are replacing the Notebook VM.  In regions where compute instances are not available yet, you can continue to use Notebook VMs with full functionality and create new Notebook VMs.

Any notebook files stored in the workspace file share and data in workspace data stores will be accessible from a compute instance. However, any custom packages previously installed on a Notebook VM will need to be re-installed on the compute instance. Quota limitations which apply to compute clusters creation will apply to compute instance creation as well. 

In regions where compute instances are available, new Notebook VMs cannot be created. However, you can still access and use Notebook VMs you have created, with full functionality. Compute instances can be created in same workspace as the existing Notebook VMs.
