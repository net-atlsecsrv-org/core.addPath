# Deploy models with Azure Machine Learning
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

Learn how to deploy your machine learning model as a web service in the Azure cloud or to Azure IoT Edge devices.

The workflow is similar no matter where you deploy your model:

1. Register the model.
1. Prepare an inference configuration
1. Prepare an entry script (unless using [no-code deployment](how-to-deploy-no-code-deployment.md))
1. Deploy the model to the compute target.
1. Test the deployed model, also called a web service.

For more information on the concepts involved in the deployment workflow, see [Manage, deploy, and monitor models with Azure Machine Learning](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md).

### Understanding service state

During model deployment, you may see the service state change while it fully deploys.

The following table describes the different service states:

| Webservice state | Description | Final state?
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Transitioning | The service is in the process of deployment. | No |
| Unhealthy | The service has deployed but is currently unreachable.  | No |
| Unschedulable | The service cannot be deployed at this time due to lack of resources. | No |
| Failed | The service has failed to deploy due to an error or crash. | Yes |
| Healthy | The service is healthy and the endpoint is available. | Yes |


### <a id="azuremlcompute"></a> Batch inference
Azure Machine Learning Compute targets are created and managed by Azure Machine Learning. They can be used for batch prediction from Azure Machine Learning pipelines.

For a walkthrough of batch inference with Azure Machine Learning Compute, see [How to run batch predictions](tutorial-pipeline-batch-scoring-classification.md).

### <a id="iotedge"></a> IoT Edge inference
Support for deploying to the edge is in preview. For more information, see [Deploy Azure Machine Learning as an IoT Edge module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/tutorial-deploy-machine-learning).
