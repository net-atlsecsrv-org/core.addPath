# Authentication and authorization to Azure Spatial Anchors

In this article, you'll learn the various ways you can authenticate to Azure Spatial Anchors from your app or web service. You'll also learn about the ways you can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to control access to your Spatial Anchors accounts.

## Overview

![Diagram that shows an overview of authentication to Azure Spatial Anchors.](./media/spatial-anchors-authentication-overview.png)

To access a given Azure Spatial Anchors account, clients need to first obtain an access token from Azure Mixed Reality Security Token Service (STS). Tokens obtained from STS have a lifetime of 24 hours. They contain information that Spatial Anchors services use to make authorization decisions on the account and ensure that only authorized principals can access the account.

Access tokens can be obtained in exchange for either account keys or tokens issued by Azure AD.

Account keys enable you to get started quickly with using the Azure Spatial Anchors service. But before you deploy your application to production, we recommend that you update your app to use Azure AD authentication.

You can obtain Azure AD authentication tokens in two ways:

- If you're building an enterprise application and your company is using Azure AD as its identity system, you can use user-based Azure AD authentication in your app. You then grant access to your Spatial Anchors accounts by using your existing Azure AD security groups. You can also grant access directly to users in your organization.
- Otherwise, we recommend that you obtain Azure AD tokens from a web service that supports your app. We recommend this method for production applications because it allows you to avoid embedding the credentials for access to Azure Spatial Anchors in your client application.

## Account keys

The easiest way to get started is to use account keys for access to your Azure Spatial Anchors account. You can get your account keys on the Azure portal. Go to your account and select the **Keys** tab:

![Screenshot that shows the Keys tab with the Copy button for the Primary key highlighted.](../../../includes/media/spatial-anchors-get-started-create-resource/view-account-key.png)

Two keys are available. Both are simultaneously valid for access to the Spatial Anchors account. We recommend that you regularly update the key you use to access the account. Having two separate valid keys enables these updates without downtime. You only have to update the primary key and the secondary key alternatively.

The SDK has built-in support for authentication via account keys. You just need to set the `AccountKey` property on your `cloudSession` object:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
this.cloudSession.Configuration.AccountKey = @"MyAccountKey";
```

# [Objective-C](#tab/objc)

```objc
_cloudSession.configuration.accountKey = @"MyAccountKey";
```

# [Swift](#tab/swift)

```swift
_cloudSession!.configuration.accountKey = "MyAccountKey"
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```java
mCloudSession.getConfiguration().setAccountKey("MyAccountKey");
```

# [C++ NDK](#tab/cpp)

```cpp
auto configuration = cloudSession_->Configuration();
configuration->AccountKey(R"(MyAccountKey)");
```

# [C++/WinRT](#tab/cppwinrt)

```cpp
auto configuration = m_cloudSession.Configuration();
configuration.AccountKey(LR"(MyAccountKey)");
```

---

After you set that property, the SDK will handle the exchange of the account key for an access token and the necessary caching of tokens for your app.

> [!WARNING]
> We recommend that you use account keys for quick onboarding, but only during development/prototyping. We don't recommend that you ship your application to production with an embedded account key in it. Instead, use the user-based or service-based Azure AD authentication approaches described next.

## Azure AD user authentication

For applications that target Azure Active Directory users, we recommend that you use an Azure AD token for the user. You can obtain this token by using the [MSAL](../../active-directory/develop/msal-overview.md). Follow the steps in the [quickstart on registering an app](../../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md), which include:

**In the Azure portal**
1.    Register your application in Azure AD as a native application. As part of registering, you'll need to determine whether your application should be multitenant. You'll also need to provide the redirect URLs allowed for your application.
1.  Go to the **API permissions** tab.
2.  Select **Add a permission**.
    1.  Select **Mixed Reality Resource Provider** on the **APIs my organization uses** tab.
    2.  Select **Delegated permissions**.
    3.  Select **mixedreality.signin** under **mixedreality**.
    4.  Select **Add permissions**.
3.  Select **Grant admin consent**.

2. Grant your application or users access to your resource:
   1.    Go to your Spatial Anchors resource in the Azure portal.
   2.    Go to the **Access control (IAM)** tab.
   3.    Select **Add role assignment**.
   1.    [Select a role](#azure-role-based-access-control).
   2.    In the **Select** box, enter the names of the users, groups, and/or applications to which you want to assign access.
   3.    Select **Save**.

**In your code**
1.    Be sure to use the application ID and redirect URI of your own Azure AD application for the **client ID** and **RedirectUri** parameters in MSAL.
2.    Set the tenant information:
        1.    If your application supports **My organization only**, replace this value with your **Tenant ID** or **Tenant name**. For example, contoso.microsoft.com.
        2.    If your application supports **Accounts in any organizational directory**, replace this value with **Organizations**.
        3.    If your application supports **All Microsoft account users**, replace this value with **Common**.
3.    On your token request, set the **scope** to **"`https://sts.<account-domain>//.default`"**, where `<account-domain>` is replaced with the **Account Domain** for your Azure Spatial Anchors account. An example scope for an Azure Spatial Anchors account in the East US 2 account domain is **"`https://sts.mixedreality.azure.com//.default`"**. This scope will indicate to Azure AD that your application is requesting a token for the Mixed Reality Security Token Service (STS).

After you complete these steps, your application should be able to obtain from MSAL an Azure AD token. You can set that Azure AD token as the `authenticationToken` on your cloud session configuration object:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
this.cloudSession.Configuration.AuthenticationToken = @"MyAuthenticationToken";
```

# [Objective-C](#tab/objc)

```objc
_cloudSession.configuration.authenticationToken = @"MyAuthenticationToken";
```

# [Swift](#tab/swift)

```swift
_cloudSession!.configuration.authenticationToken = "MyAuthenticationToken"
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```java
mCloudSession.getConfiguration().setAuthenticationToken("MyAuthenticationToken");
```

# [C++ NDK](#tab/cpp)

```cpp
auto configuration = cloudSession_->Configuration();
configuration->AuthenticationToken(R"(MyAuthenticationToken)");
```

# [C++/WinRT](#tab/cppwinrt)

```cpp
auto configuration = m_cloudSession.Configuration();
configuration.AuthenticationToken(LR"(MyAuthenticationToken)");
```

## Azure AD service authentication

To deploy apps that use Azure Spatial Anchors to production, we recommend that you use a back-end service that will broker authentication requests. Here's an overview of the process:

![Diagram that provides an overview of authentication to Azure Spatial Anchors.](./media/spatial-anchors-aad-authentication.png)

Here, it's assumed that your app uses its own mechanism to authenticate to its back-end service. (For example, a Microsoft account, PlayFab, Facebook, a Google ID, or a custom user name and password.)  After your users are authenticated to your back-end service, that service can retrieve an Azure AD token, exchange it for an access token for Azure Spatial Anchors, and return it back to your client application.

The Azure AD access token is retrieved via the [MSAL](../../active-directory/develop/msal-overview.md). Follow the steps in the [register an app quickstart](../../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md), which include:

**In the Azure portal**
1.    Register your application in Azure AD:
        1.    In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **App registrations**.
        2.    Select **New registration**.
        3.    Enter the name of your application, select **Web app / API** as the application type, and enter the auth URL for your service. Select **Create**.
2.    On the application, select **Settings**, and then select the **Certificates and secrets** tab. Create a new client secret, select a duration, and then select **Add**. Be sure to save the secret value. You'll need to include it in your web service's code.
3.    Grant your application and/or users access to your resource:
        1.    Go to your Spatial Anchors resource in the Azure portal.
        2.    Go to the **Access control (IAM)** tab.
        3.    Select **Add role assignment**.
        4.    [Select a role](#azure-role-based-access-control).
        5.    In the **Select** box, enter the name or names of the applications to which you want to assign access. If you want your app's users to have different roles against the Spatial Anchors account, register multiple applications in Azure AD and assign a separate role to each one. Then implement your authorization logic to use the right role for your users.

              > [!NOTE]
              > In the **Add role assignment** pane, in **Assign access to**, select **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**.

        6.    Select **Save**.

**In your code**

>[!NOTE]
> You can use the service sample that's available on GitHub.

1.    Be sure to use the application ID, application secret, and redirect URI of your own Azure AD application as the **client ID**, **secret**, and **RedirectUri** parameters in MSAL.
2.    Set the tenant ID to your own Azure AD tenant ID in the **authority** parameter in MSAL.
3.    On your token request, set the **scope** to **"`https://sts.<account-domain>//.default`"**, where `<account-domain>` is replaced with the **Account Domain** for your Azure Spatial Anchors account. An example scope for an Azure Spatial Anchors account in the East US 2 account domain is **"`https://sts.mixedreality.azure.com//.default`"**.

After you complete these steps, your back-end service can retrieve an Azure AD token. It can then exchange it for an MR token that it will return back to the client. Using an Azure AD token to retrieve an MR token is done via a REST call. Here's a sample call:

```

```

The Authorization header is formatted as follows: `Bearer <Azure_AD_token>`

The response contains the MR token in plain text.

That MR token is then returned to the client. Your client app can then set it as its access token in the cloud session configuration:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
this.cloudSession.Configuration.AccessToken = @"MyAccessToken";
```

# [Objective-C](#tab/objc)

```objc
_cloudSession.configuration.accessToken = @"MyAccessToken";
```

# [Swift](#tab/swift)

```swift
_cloudSession!.configuration.accessToken = "MyAccessToken"
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```java
mCloudSession.getConfiguration().setAccessToken("MyAccessToken");
```

# [C++ NDK](#tab/cpp)

```cpp
auto configuration = cloudSession_->Configuration();
configuration->AccessToken(R"(MyAccessToken)");
```

# [C++/WinRT](#tab/cppwinrt)

```cpp
auto configuration = m_cloudSession.Configuration();
configuration.AccessToken(LR"(MyAccessToken)");
```

## Azure role-based access control

To help you control the level of access granted to applications, services, or Azure AD users of your service, you can assign these pre-existing roles as needed against your Azure Spatial Anchors accounts:

- **Spatial Anchors Account Owner**. Applications or users that have this role can create spatial anchors, query for them, and delete them. When you authenticate to your account by using account keys, the Spatial Anchors Account Owner role is assigned to the authenticated principal.
- **Spatial Anchors Account Contributor**. Applications or users that have this role can create spatial anchors and query for them, but they can't delete them.
- **Spatial Anchors Account Reader**. Applications or users that have this role can only query for spatial anchors. They can't create new ones, delete existing ones, or update metadata on them. This role is typically used for applications where some users curate the environment but others can only recall anchors previously placed in the environment.

## Next steps

Create your first app with Azure Spatial Anchors:
