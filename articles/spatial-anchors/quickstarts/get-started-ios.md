#Customer intent: As a mixed reality developer, I want to learn how to use Azure Spatial Anchors in my iOS app (in either Swift or Objective-C) that can place and locate a 3D object that persists across devices and platforms.

# Quickstart: Create an iOS app with Azure Spatial Anchors, in either Swift or Objective-C

This quickstart covers how to create an iOS app using [Azure Spatial Anchors](../overview.md) in either Swift or Objective-C. Azure Spatial Anchors is a cross-platform developer service that allows you to create mixed reality experiences using objects that persist their location across devices over time. When you're finished, you'll have an ARKit iOS app that can save and recall a spatial anchor.

You'll learn how to:

> * Deploy and run on an iOS device

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, make sure you have:

- A developer enabled macOS machine with <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Xcode 10+</a> and <a href="https://cocoapods.org" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a> installed.
- Git installed via HomeBrew. Enter the following command into a single line of the Terminal: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`. Then, run `brew install git`.
- A developer enabled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/verifying_device_support_and_user_permission" target="_blank">ARKit compatible</a> iOS device.

[!INCLUDE [Create Spatial Anchors resource](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-get-started-create-resource.md)]

## Open the sample project

Use the Terminal to perform the following actions.

[!INCLUDE [Clone Sample Repo](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-clone-sample-repository.md)]

Install the necessary pods using CocoaPods:

# [Swift](#tab/openproject-swift)

Navigate to `iOS/Swift/`.

```bash
cd ./iOS/Swift/
```

# [Objective-C](#tab/openproject-objc)

Navigate to `iOS/Objective-C/`.

```bash
cd ./iOS/Objective-C/
```

***

Run `pod install --repo-update` to install the CocoaPods for the project.

Now open the `.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

# [Swift](#tab/openproject-swift)

```bash
open ./SampleSwift.xcworkspace
```

# [Objective-C](#tab/openproject-objc)

```bash
open ./SampleObjC.xcworkspace
```

***

## Configure account identifier and key

The next step is to configure the app to use your account identifier and account key. You copied them into a text editor when [setting up the Spatial Anchors resource](#create-a-spatial-anchors-resource).

# [Swift](#tab/openproject-swift)

Open `iOS/Swift/SampleSwift/ViewControllers/BaseViewController.swift`.

Locate the `spatialAnchorsAccountKey` field and replace `Set me` with the account key.

Locate the `spatialAnchorsAccountId` field and replace `Set me` with the account identifier.

# [Objective-C](#tab/openproject-objc)

Open `iOS/Objective-C/SampleObjC/BaseViewController.m`.

Locate the `SpatialAnchorsAccountKey` field and replace `Set me` with the account key.

Locate the `SpatialAnchorsAccountId` field and replace `Set me` with the account identifier.

***

## Deploy the app to your iOS device

Connect the iOS device to the Mac and set the **active scheme** to your iOS device.

![Select the device](./media/get-started-ios/select-device.png)

Select **Build and then run the current scheme**.

![Deploy and run](./media/get-started-ios/deploy-run.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you see a `library not found for -lPods-SampleObjC` error, you likely opened the `.xcodeproj` file instead of the
> `.xcworkspace`. Open the `.xcworkspace` and try again.

In Xcode, stop the app by pressing **Stop**.
