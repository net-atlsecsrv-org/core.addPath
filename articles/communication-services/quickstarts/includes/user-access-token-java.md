## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable&preserve-view=true) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting Up

### Create a new Java application

Open your terminal or command window and navigate to the directory where you'd like to create your Java application. Run the command below to generate the Java project from the maven-archetype-quickstart template.

```console
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.communication.quickstart -DartifactId=communication-quickstart -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

You'll notice that the 'generate' task created a directory with the same name as the `artifactId`. Under this directory, the src/main/java directory contains the project source code, the `src/test/java directory` contains the test source, and the `pom.xml` file is the project's Project Object Model, or POM.

### Install the package

Open the **pom.xml** file in your text editor. Add the following dependency element to the group of dependencies.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-administration</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.2</version> 
</dependency>
```

### Set up the app framework

From the project directory:

1. Navigate to the */src/main/java/com/communication/quickstart* directory
1. Open the *App.java* file in your editor
1. Replace the `System.out.println("Hello world!");` statement
1. Add `import` directives

Use the following code to begin:

```java
import com.azure.communication.common.CommunicationUser;
import com.azure.communication.administration.models.CommunicationIdentityToken;
import com.azure.communication.administration.CommunicationIdentityClient;
import com.azure.communication.administration.CommunicationIdentityClientBuilder;
import java.io.*;

public class App
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    {
        System.out.println("Azure Communication Services - User Access Tokens Quickstart");
        // Quickstart code goes here
    }
}
```

[!INCLUDE [User Access Tokens Object Model](user-access-tokens-object-model.md)]

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a `CommunicationIdentityClient` with your resource's access key and endpoint. Learn how to [manage you resource's connection string](../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string).

Add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// Your can find your endpoint and access token from your resource in the Azure Portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";
String accessToken = "SECRET";

// Create an HttpClient builder of your choice and customize it
// Use com.azure.core.http.netty.NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder if that suits your needs
HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

CommunicationIdentityClient communicationIdentityClient = new CommunicationIdentityClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new CommunicationClientCredential(accessToken))
    .httpClient(httpClient)
    .buildClient();
```

You can initialize the client with any custom HTTP client the implements the `com.azure.core.http.HttpClient` interface. The above code demonstrates use of the [Azure Core Netty HTTP client](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/core-http-netty-readme?view=azure-java-stable&preserve-view=true) that is provided by `azure-core`.

## Create a user

Azure Communication Services maintains a lightweight identity directory. Use the `createUser` method to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id`. You should maintain a mapping between your application's users and Communication Services generated identities (e.g. by storing them in your application server's database).

```java
CommunicationUser user = communicationIdentityClient.createUser();
System.out.println("\nCreated a user with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Issue user access tokens

Use the `issueToken` method to issue an access token for a Communication Services user. If you do not provide the optional `user` parameter a new user will be created and returned with the token.

```java
// Issue an access token with the "voip" scope for a new user
List<String> scopes = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("voip"));
CommunicationUserToken response = communicationIdentityClient.issueToken(user, scopes);
OffsetDateTime expiresOn = response.getExpiresOn();
String token = response.getToken();
String userId = response.getUser().getId();
System.out.println("\nIssued a access token with 'voip' scope for identity with ID: " + userId + ": " + token);
System.out.println(token);
```

User access tokens are short-lived credentials that need to be reissued in order to prevent your users from experiencing service disruptions. The `expiresAt` response property indicates the lifetime of the token.

## Revoke user access tokens

In some cases, you may need to explicitly revoke user access tokens, for example, when a user changes the password they use to authenticate to your service. This use the `revokeTokens` method to invalidate all of a user's access tokens.

```java  
communicationIdentityClient.revokeTokens(user, OffsetDateTime.now());
System.out.println("\nRevoked tokens for the user with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Delete a user

Deleting a user revokes all active tokens and prevents you from issuing subsequent tokens for the identities. It also removes all the persisted content associated with the user.

```java
communicationIdentityClient.deleteUser(user);
System.out.println("\nSuccessfully deleted the identity with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Run the code

Navigate to the directory containing the *pom.xml* file and compile the project by using the following `mvn` command.

```console
mvn compile
```

Then, build the package.

```console
mvn package
```

Run the following `mvn` command to execute the app.

```console
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.communication.quickstart.App" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
```
