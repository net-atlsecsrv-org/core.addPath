## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- The latest version [.NET Core client library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) for your operating system.
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting Up

### Create a new C# application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `UserAccessTokensQuickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: **Program.cs**.

```console
dotnet new console -o UserAccessTokensQuickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder and use the `dotnet build` command to compile your application.

```console
cd UserAccessTokensQuickstart
dotnet build
```

### Install the package

While still in the application directory, install the Azure Communication Services Administration library for .NET package by using the `dotnet add package` command.

```console
dotnet add package Azure.Communication.Administration --version 1.0.0-beta.1
```

### Set up the app framework

From the project directory:

1. Open **Program.cs** file in a text editor
1. Add a `using` directive to include the `Azure.Communication.Administration` namespace
1. Update the `Main` method declaration to support async code

Use the following code to begin:

```csharp
using System;
using Azure.Communication.Administration;

namespace UserAccessTokensQuickstart
{
    class Program
    {
        static async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Azure Communication Services - User Access Tokens Quickstart");

            // Quickstart code goes here
        }
    }
}
```

## Authenticate the client

Initialize a `CommunicationIdentityClient` with your connection string. The code below retrieves the connection string for the resource from an environment variable named `COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING`. Learn how to [manage you resource's connection string](../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string).

Add the following code to the `Main` method:

```csharp
// This code demonstrates how to fetch your connection string
// from an environment variable.
string ConnectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING");
var client = new CommunicationIdentityClient(ConnectionString);
```

## Create a user

Azure Communication Services maintains a lightweight identity directory. Use the `createUser` method to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id`. You should maintain a mapping between your application's users and Communication Services generated identities (e.g. by storing them in your application server's database).

```csharp
var userResponse = await client.CreateUserAsync();
var user = userResponse.Value;
Console.WriteLine($"\nCreated a user with ID: {user.Id}");
```

## Issue user access tokens

Use the `issueToken` method to issue an access token for a Communication Services user. If you do not provide the optional `user` parameter a new user will be created and returned with the token.

```csharp
// Issue an access token with the "voip" scope for a new user
var tokenResponse = await client.IssueTokenAsync(user, scopes: new [] { CommunicationTokenScope.VoIP });
var token =  tokenResponse.Value.Token;
var expiresOn = tokenResponse.Value.ExpiresOn;
Console.WriteLine($"\nIssued a token with 'voip' scope that expires at {expiresOn}:");
Console.WriteLine(token);
```

User access tokens are short-lived credentials that need to be reissued in order to prevent your users from experiencing service disruptions. The `expiresOn` response property indicates the lifetime of the token.

## Revoke user access tokens

In some cases, you may need to explicitly revoke user access tokens, for example, when a user changes the password they use to authenticate to your service. This functionality is available via the Azure Communication Services Administration client library.

```csharp  
await client.RevokeTokensAsync(user);
Console.WriteLine($"\nSuccessfully revoked all tokens for user with ID: {user.Id}");
```

## Delete a user

Deleting an identity revokes all active tokens and prevents you from issuing subsequent tokens for the identities. It also removes all the persisted content associated with the user.

```csharp
await client.DeleteUserAsync(user);
Console.WriteLine($"\nDeleted the user with ID: {user.Id}");
```

## Run the code

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```console
dotnet run
```
