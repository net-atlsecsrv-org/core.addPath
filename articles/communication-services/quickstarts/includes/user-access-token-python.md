## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7, 3.5, or above.
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting Up

### Create a new Python application

1. Open your terminal or command window create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

   ```console
   mkdir access-tokens-quickstart && cd access-tokens-quickstart
   ```

1. Use a text editor to create a file called **issue-access-tokens.py** in the project root directory and add the structure for the program, including basic exception handling. You'll add all the source code for this quickstart to this file in the following sections.

   ```python
   import os
   from azure.communication.administration import CommunicationIdentityClient

   try:
      print('Azure Communication Services - Access Tokens Quickstart')
      # Quickstart code goes here
   except Exception as ex:
      print('Exception:')
      print(ex)
   ```

### Install the package

While still in the application directory, install the Azure Communication Services Administration client library for Python package by using the `pip install` command.

```console
pip install azure-communication-administration
```

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a `CommunicationIdentityClient` with your connection string. The code below retrieves the connection string for the resource from an environment variable named `COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING`. Learn how to [manage you resource's connection string](../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string).

Add this code inside the `try` block:

```python
# This code demonstrates how to fetch your connection string
# from an environment variable.
connection_string = os.environ['COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING']

# Instantiate the identity client
client = CommunicationIdentityClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
```

## Create an identity

Azure Communication Services maintains a lightweight identity directory. Use the `create_user` method to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id`. Store received identity with mapping to your application's users. For example, by storing them in your application server's database. The identity is required later to issue access tokens.

```python
identity = client.create_user()
print("\nCreated an identity with ID: " + identity.identifier + ":")
```

## Issue access tokens

Use the `issue_token` method to issue an access token for already existing Communication Services identity. Parameter `scopes` defines set of primitives, that will authorize this access token. See the [list of supported actions](../../concepts/authentication.md). New instance of parameter `communicationUser` can be constructed based on string representation of Azure Communication Service identity.

```python
# Issue an access token with the "voip" scope for an identity
token_result = client.issue_token(user, ["voip"])
expires_on = token_result.expires_on.strftime('%d/%m/%y %I:%M %S %p')
print("\nIssued an access token with 'voip' scope that expires at " + expires_on + ":")
print(token_result.token)
```

Access tokens are short-lived credentials that need to be reissued. Not doing so might cause disruption of your application's users experience. The `expires_on` response property indicates the lifetime of the access token.

## Refresh access tokens

To refresh an access token, use the `CommunicationUser` object to reissue:

```python  
# Value existingIdentity represents identity of Azure Communication Services stored during identity creation
identity = CommunicationUser(existingIdentity)
token_result = client.issue_token( identity, ["voip"])
```

## Revoke access tokens

In some cases, you may explicitly revoke access tokens. For example, when an application's user changes the password they use to authenticate to your service. Method `revoke_tokens` invalidates all active access tokens, that were issued to the identity.

```python  
client.revoke_tokens(identity)
print("\nSuccessfully revoked all access tokens for identity with ID: " + identity.identifier)
```

## Delete an identity

Deleting an identity revokes all active access tokens and prevents you from issuing access tokens for the identity. It also removes all the persisted content associated with the identity.

```python
client.delete_user(identity)
print("\nDeleted the identity with ID: " + identity.identifier)
```

## Run the code

From a console prompt, navigate to the directory containing the *issue-access-token.py* file, then execute the following `python` command to run the app.

```console
python ./issue-access-token.py
```
