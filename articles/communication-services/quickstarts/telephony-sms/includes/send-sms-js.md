Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services JavaScript SMS client library to send SMS messages.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

<!--**TODO: update all these reference links as the resources go live**

[API reference documentation](../../../references/overview.md) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js-pr/tree/feature/communication/sdk/communication/communication-sms) | [Package (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/communication-sms) | [Samples](#todo-samples)-->

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (8.11.1 and 10.14.1 recommended).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- An SMS enabled telephone number. [Get a phone number](../get-phone-number.md).

### Prerequisite check

- In a terminal or command window, run `node --version` to check that Node.js is installed.
- To view the phone numbers associated with your Communication Services resource, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), locate your Communication Services resource and open the **phone numbers** tab from the left navigation pane.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js Application

First, open your terminal or command window, create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir sms-quickstart && cd sms-quickstart
```

Run `npm init -y` to create a **package.json** file with default settings.

```console
npm init -y
```

Use a text editor to create a file called **send-sms.js** in the project root directory. You'll add all the source code for this quickstart to this file in the following sections.

### Install the package

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services SMS client library for JavaScript.

```console
npm install @azure/communication-sms --save
```

The `--save` option lists the library as a dependency in your **package.json** file.

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services SMS client library for Node.js.

| Name                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SmsClient | This class is needed for all SMS functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to send SMS messages. |
| SendSmsOptions | This interface provides options to configure delivery reporting. If `enable_delivery_report` is set to `true`, then an event will be emitted when delivery was successful. |
| SendMessageRequest | This interface is the model for building the sms request (eg. configure the to and from phone numbers and the sms content). |

## Authenticate the client

Import the **SmsClient** from the client library and instantiate it with your connection string. The code below retrieves the connection string for the resource from an environment variable named `COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING`. Learn how to [manage you resource's connection string](../../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string).

Add the following code to **send-sms.js**:

```javascript
const { SmsClient } = require('@azure/communication-sms');

// This code demonstrates how to fetch your connection string
// from an environment variable.
const connectionString = process.env['COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING'];

// Instantiate the SMS client
const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
```

## Send an SMS message

Send an SMS message by calling the `send` method. Add this code to the end of the **send-sms.js**:

```javascript
await smsClient.send({
  from: "<leased-phone-number>",
  to: ["<to-phone-number>"],
  message: "Hello World üëãüèª via Sms"
}, {
  enableDeliveryReport: true //Optional parameter
});
```

You should replace `<leased-phone-number>` with an SMS-enabled phone number associated with your Communication Services resource and `<to-phone-number>` with the phone number you wish to send a message to. All phone number parameters should adhere to the [E.164 standard](../../../concepts/telephony-sms/plan-solution.md#optional-reading-international-public-telecommunication-numbering-plan-e164).

The `enableDeliveryReport` parameter is an optional parameter that you can use to configure Delivery Reporting. This is useful for scenarios where you want to emit events when SMS messages are delivered. See the [Handle SMS Events](../handle-sms-events.md) quickstart to configure Delivery Reporting for your SMS messages.

## Run the code

Use the `node` command to run the code you added to the **send-sms.js** file.

```console

node ./send-sms.js

```
