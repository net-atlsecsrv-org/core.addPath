## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7, 3.5, or above.
- A deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting up

### Create a new Python application

Open your terminal or command window and create a new directory for your app, then navigate to it.

```console
mkdir phone-numbers-quickstart && cd phone-numbers-quickstart
```

Use a text editor to create a file called phone_numbers_sample.py in the project root directory and add the the following code. We'll be adding the remaining quickstart code in the following sections.

```python
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import PhoneNumbersClient

try:
   print('Azure Communication Services - Phone Numbers Quickstart')
   # Quickstart code goes here
except Exception as ex:
   print('Exception:')
   print(ex)
```

### Install the package

While still in the application directory, install the Azure Communication Services Administration client library for Python package by using the `pip install` command.

```console
pip install azure-communication-phone-numbers
```

## Authenticate the Phone Numbers Client

The `PhoneNumbersClient` is enabled to use Azure Active Directory Authentication. Using the `DefaultAzureCredential` object is the easiest way to get started with Azure Active Directory and you can install it using the `pip install` command.

```console
pip install azure-identity
```

Creating a `DefaultAzureCredential` object requires you to have `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` already set as environment variables with their corresponding values from your registered Azure AD application.

Once you have installed the `azure-identity` library, we can continue authenticating the client.

```python
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import PhoneNumbersClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# You can find your endpoint from your resource in the Azure portal
endpoint = 'https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com'
try:
    print('Azure Communication Services - Phone Numbers Quickstart')
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    phone_numbers_client = PhoneNumbersClient(endpoint, credential)
except Exception as ex:
    print('Exception:')
    print(ex)
```

Alternatively, using the endpoint and access key from the communication resource to authenticate is also possible.

```python
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import PhoneNumbersClient

# You can find your connection string from your resource in the Azure portal
connection_string = 'https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>'
try:
    print('Azure Communication Services - Phone Numbers Quickstart')
    phone_numbers_client = PhoneNumbersClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
except Exception as ex:
    print('Exception:')
    print(ex)
```

## Functions

Once the `PhoneNumbersClient` has been authenticated, we can start working on the different functions it can do.

### Search for Available Phone Numbers

In order to purchase phone numbers, you must first search for any available phone numbers. To search for phone numbers, provide the area code, assignment type, [phone number capabilities](../../../concepts/telephony-sms/plan-solution.md#phone-number-capabilities-in-azure-communication-services), [phone number type](../../../concepts/telephony-sms/plan-solution.md#phone-number-types-in-azure-communication-services), and quantity (default quantity is set to 1). Note that for the toll-free phone number type, providing the area code is optional.

```python
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import PhoneNumbersClient, PhoneNumberCapabilityType, PhoneNumberAssignmentType, PhoneNumberType, PhoneNumberCapabilities
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# You can find your endpoint from your resource in the Azure portal
endpoint = 'https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com'
try:
    print('Azure Communication Services - Phone Numbers Quickstart')
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    phone_numbers_client = PhoneNumbersClient(endpoint, credential)
    capabilities = PhoneNumberCapabilities(
        calling = PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND,
        sms = PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND
    )
    search_poller = self.phone_number_client.begin_search_available_phone_numbers(
        "US",
        PhoneNumberType.TOLL_FREE,
        PhoneNumberAssignmentType.APPLICATION,
        capabilities,
        polling = True
    )
    search_result = search_poller.result()
    print ('Search id: ' + search_result.search_id)
    phone_number_list = search_result.phone_numbers
    print('Reserved phone numbers:')
    for phone_number in phone_number_list:
        print(phone_number)

except Exception as ex:
    print('Exception:')
    print(ex)
```

### Purchase Phone Numbers

The result of searching for phone numbers is a `PhoneNumberSearchResult`. This contains a `searchId` which can be passed to the purchase numbers API to acquire the numbers in the search. Note that calling the purchase phone numbers API will result in a charge to your Azure Account.

```python
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import (
    PhoneNumbersClient,
    PhoneNumberCapabilityType,
    PhoneNumberAssignmentType,
    PhoneNumberType,
    PhoneNumberCapabilities
)
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# You can find your endpoint from your resource in the Azure portal
endpoint = 'https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com'
try:
    print('Azure Communication Services - Phone Numbers Quickstart')
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    phone_numbers_client = PhoneNumbersClient(endpoint, credential)
    capabilities = PhoneNumberCapabilities(
        calling = PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND,
        sms = PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND
    )
    search_poller = phone_numbers_client.begin_search_available_phone_numbers(
        "US",
        PhoneNumberType.TOLL_FREE,
        PhoneNumberAssignmentType.APPLICATION,
        capabilities,
        area_code="833",
        polling = True
    )
    search_result = poller.result()
    print ('Search id: ' + search_result.search_id)
    phone_number_list = search_result.phone_numbers
    print('Reserved phone numbers:')
    for phone_number in phone_number_list:
        print(phone_number)

    purchase_poller = phone_numbers_client.begin_purchase_phone_numbers(search_result.search_id, polling = True)
    purchase_poller.result()
    print("The status of the purchase operation was: " + purchase_poller.status())
except Exception as ex:
    print('Exception:')
    print(ex)
```

### Get purchased phone number(s)

After a purchasing number, you can retrieve it from the client.

```python
purchased_phone_number_information = phone_numbers_client.get_purchased_phone_number("+18001234567")
print('Phone number: ' + purchased_phone_number_information.phone_number)
print('Country code: ' + purchased_phone_number_information.country_code)
```

You can also retrieve all the purchased phone numbers.

```python
purchased_phone_numbers = phone_numbers_client.list_purchased_phone_numbers()
print('Purchased phone numbers:')
for purchased_phone_number in purchased_phone_numbers:
    print(purchased_phone_number.phone_number)
```

### Update Phone Number Capabilities

You can update the capabilities of a previously purchased phone number.
```python
update_poller = phone_numbers_client.begin_update_phone_number_capabilities(
    "+18001234567",
    PhoneNumberCapabilityType.OUTBOUND,
    PhoneNumberCapabilityType.OUTBOUND,
    polling = True
)
update_poller.result()
print('Status of the operation: ' + update_poller.status())
```

### Release Phone Number

You can release a purchased phone number.

```python
release_poller = phone_numbers_client.begin_release_phone_number("+18001234567")
release_poller.result()
print('Status of the operation: ' + release_poller.status())
```

## Run the code

From a console prompt, navigate to the directory containing the phone_numbers_sample.py file, then execute the following python command to run the app.

```console
./phone_numbers_sample.py
```
