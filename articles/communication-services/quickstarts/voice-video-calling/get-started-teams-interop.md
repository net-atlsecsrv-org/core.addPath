# Quickstart: Join your calling app to a Teams meeting

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview](../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable/disable [Teams tenant interoperability](../../concepts/teams-interop.md), complete [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR21ouQM6BHtHiripswZoZsdURDQ5SUNQTElKR0VZU0VUU1hMOTBBMVhESS4u).

Get started with Azure Communication Services by connecting your calling solution to Microsoft Teams using the JavaScript SDK.

::: zone pivot="platform-web"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with JavaScript](./includes/teams-interop-javascript.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-android"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with Android](./includes/teams-interop-android.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-ios"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with iOS](./includes/teams-interop-ios.md)]
::: zone-end

Functionality described in this document uses the General Availablity version of the Communication Services SDKs. Teams Interoperability requires the Beta version of the Communication Services SDKs. The Beta SDKs can be explored on the [release notes page](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/tree/master/releasenotes).

When executing the "Install package" step with the Beta SDKs, modify the version of your package to the latest Beta release by specifying version `@1.0.0-beta.10` (version at the moment of writing this article) in the `communication-calling` package name. You don't need to modify the `communication-common` package command. For example:

```console
npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.0.0-beta.10 --save
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
