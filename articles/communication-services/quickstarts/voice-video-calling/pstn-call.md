# Quickstart: Call To Phone

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services Calling SDK to add PSTN calling to your app.

::: zone pivot="platform-web"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with JavaScript](./includes/pstn-call-js.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-android"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with Android](./includes/pstn-call-android.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-ios"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with iOS](./includes/pstn-call-ios.md)]
::: zone-end

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
