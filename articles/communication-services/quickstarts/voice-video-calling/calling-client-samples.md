# Quickstart: Use the Communication Services Calling SDK

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services Calling SDK to add voice and video calling to your app.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
