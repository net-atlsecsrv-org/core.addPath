# Use managed identities
Get started with Azure Communication Services by using managed identities. The Communication Services Identity and SMS SDKs support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication with [managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

This quickstart shows you how to authorize access to the Identity and SMS SDKs from an Azure environment that supports managed identities. It also describes how to test your code in a development environment.
