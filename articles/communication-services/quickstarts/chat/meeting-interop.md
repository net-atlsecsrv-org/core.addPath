# Quickstart: Join your chat app to a Teams meeting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable/disable [Teams tenant interoperability](../../concepts/teams-interop.md), complete [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR21ouQM6BHtHiripswZoZsdURDQ5SUNQTElKR0VZU0VUU1hMOTBBMVhESS4u).

Get started with Azure Communication Services by connecting your chat solution to Microsoft Teams using the JavaScript SDK. 

## Prerequisites 

1. Aâ€¯[Teams deployment](/deployoffice/teams-install). 
2. A working [chat app](./get-started.md). 

## Enable Teams interoperability 

A Communication Services user that joins a Teams meeting as a guest user can access the meeting's chat only when they've joined the Teams meeting call. See the [Teams interop](../voice-video-calling/get-started-teams-interop.md) documentation to learn how to add a Communication Services user to a Teams meeting call.

You must be a member of the owning organization of both entities to use this feature.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
