## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure to:

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), we will be using Xcode to create an iOS application for the quickstart and Cocoapods to install dependencies.
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](../../create-communication-resource.md). You'll need to **record your resource endpoint** for this quickstart.
- Create **two** ACS Users and issue them a user access token [User Access Token](../../access-tokens.md). Be sure to set the scope to **chat**, and **note the token string as well as the userId string**. In this quickstart we will create a thread with an initial participant and then add a second participant to the thread.

## Setting up

### Create a new iOS application

Open Xcode and select `Create a new Xcode project`.

On the next window, select `iOS` as the platform and `App` for the template.

When choosing options enter `ChatQuickstart` as the project name. 
Select `Storyboard` as the interface, `UIKit App Delegate` as the life cycle, and `Swift` as the language.

Click next and choose the directory where you want the project to be created.

### Install the libraries

We'll use Cocoapods to install the necessary Communication Services dependencies.

From the command line navigate inside the root directory of the `ChatQuickstart` iOS project.

Create a Podfile:
`pod init`

Open the Podfile and add the following dependencies to the `ChatQuickstart` target:
```
pod 'AzureCommunication', '~> 1.0.0-beta.9'
pod 'AzureCommunicationChat', '~> 1.0.0-beta.9'
```

Install the dependencies, this will also create an Xcode workspace:
`pod install`

**After running pod install, re-open the project in Xcode by selecting the newly created `.xcworkspace`.**

### Setup the placeholders

Open the workspace `ChatQuickstart.xcworkspace` in Xcode and then open `ViewController.swift`.

In this Quickstart, we will add our code to `viewController`, and view the output in the Xcode console. This quickstart does not address building a UI in iOS. 

At the top of `viewController.swift` import the `AzureCommunication` and `AzureCommunicatonChat` libraries:

```
import AzureCommunication
import AzureCommunicationChat
```

Copy the following code into the `viewDidLoad()` method of `ViewController`:

```
override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

        let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)
        DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
            do {
                // <CREATE A CHAT CLIENT>
                
                // <CREATE A CHAT THREAD>
                
                // <CREATE A CHAT THREAD CLIENT>
                
                // <SEND A MESSAGE>
                
                // <ADD A USER>
                
                // <LIST USERS>
                
                // <REMOVE A USER>
            } catch {
                print("Quickstart failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
```

We'll use a semaphore to synchronize our code for demonstration purposes. In following steps, we'll replace the placeholders with sample code using the Azure Communication Services Chat library.


### Create a chat client

Replace the comment `<CREATE A CHAT CLIENT>` with the following code:

```
let endpoint = "<ACS_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT>"
    let credential =
    try CommunicationTokenCredential(
        token: "<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    )
    let options = AzureCommunicationChatClientOptions()

    let chatClient = try ChatClient(
        endpoint: endpoint,
        credential: credential,
        withOptions: options
    )
```

Replace `<ACS_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT>` with the endpoint of your ACS Resource.
Replace `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` with a valid ACS access token.

This quickstart does not cover creating a service tier to manage tokens for your chat application, although it is recommended. See the following documentation for more detail [Chat Architecture](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md)

Learn more about [User Access Tokens](../../access-tokens.md).

## Object model 
The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Chat SDK for JavaScript.

| Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatClient | This class is needed for the Chat functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to create, get and delete threads. |
| ChatThreadClient | This class is needed for the Chat Thread functionality. You obtain an instance via the ChatClient, and use it to send/receive/update/delete messages, add/remove/get users, send typing notifications and read receipts, subscribe chat events. |

## Start a chat thread

Now we will use our `ChatClient` to create a new thread with an initial user.

Replace the comment `<CREATE A CHAT THREAD>` with the following code:

```
let request = CreateThreadRequest(
    topic: "Quickstart",
    participants: [
        Participant(
            id: CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_ID>"),
            displayName: "Jack"
        )
    ]
)

var threadId: String?
chatClient.create(thread: request) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(result):
        threadId = result.thread?.id

    case .failure:
        fatalError("Failed to create thread.")
    }
    semaphore.signal()
}
semaphore.wait()
```

Replace `<USER_ID>` with a valid Communication Services user ID.

We're using a semaphore here to wait for the completion handler before continuing. We will use the `threadId` from the response returned to the completion handler in later steps.

## Get a chat thread client

Now that we have created a Chat thread we'll obtain a `ChatThreadClient` to perform operations within the thread.

Replace the comment `<CREATE A CHAT THREAD CLIENT>` with the following code:

```
let chatThreadClient = try chatClient.createClient(forThread: threadId!)
```

## Send a message to a chat thread

Replace the comment `<SEND A MESSAGE>` with the following code:

```
let message = SendChatMessageRequest(
    content: "Hello!",
    senderDisplayName: "Jack"
)

chatThreadClient.send(message: message) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(result):
        print("Message sent, message id: \(result.id)")
    case .failure:
        print("Failed to send message")
    }
    semaphore.signal()
}
semaphore.wait()
```

First we construct the `SendChatMessageRequest` which contains the content and senders display name (also optionally can contain the share history time). The response returned to the completion handler contains the ID of the message that was sent.

## Add a user as a participant to the chat thread

Replace the comment `<ADD A USER>` with the following code:

```
let user = Participant(
    id: CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_ID>"),
    displayName: "Jane"
)

chatThreadClient.add(participants: [user]) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(result):
        (result.errors != nil) ? print("Added participant") : print("Error adding participant")
    case .failure:
        print("Failed to list participants")
    }
    semaphore.signal()
}
semaphore.wait()
```

Replace `<USER_ID>` with the ACS user ID of the user to be added.

When adding a participant to a thread, the response returned the completion may contain errors. These errors represent failure to add particular participants.

## List users in a thread

Replace the `<LIST USERS>` comment with the following code:

```
chatThreadClient.listParticipants { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(participants):
        var iterator = participants.syncIterator
        while let participant = iterator.next() {
            let user = participant.id as! CommunicationUserIdentifier
            print(user.identifier)
        }
    case .failure:
        print("Failed to list participants")
    }
    semaphore.signal()
}
semaphore.wait()
```


## Remove user from a chat thread

Replace the `<REMOVE A USER>` comment with the following code:

```
chatThreadClient
    .remove(
        participant: CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_ID>")
    ) { result, _ in
        switch result {
        case .success:
            print("Removed user from the thread.")
        case .failure:
            print("Failed to remove user from the thread.")
        }
    }
```

Replace `<USER ID>` with the the Communication Services user ID of the participant being removed.

## Run the code

In Xcode hit the Run button to build and run the project. In the console you can view the output from the code and the logger output from the ChatClient.
