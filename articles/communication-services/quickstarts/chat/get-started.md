# Quickstart: Add Chat to your App

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services Chat SDK to add real-time chat to your application. In this quickstart, we'll use the Chat SDK to create chat threads that allow users to have conversations with one another. To learn more about Chat concepts, visit the [chat conceptual documentation](../../concepts/chat/concepts.md).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
