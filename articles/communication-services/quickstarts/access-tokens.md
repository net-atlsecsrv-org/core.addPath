# Quickstart: Create and manage access tokens

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services Administration client library. It allows you to create identities and manage your access tokens. Identity is representing entity of your application in the Azure Communication Service (for example, user or device). Access tokens let your Chat and Calling client libraries authenticate directly against Azure Communication Services. We recommend generating access tokens on a server-side service. Access tokens are then used to initialize the Communication Services client libraries on client devices.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](./create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
