# Calling client library overview

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

There are two separate families of Calling client libraries, for *clients* and *services.* Currently available client libraries are intended for end-user experiences: websites and native apps.

The Service client libraries are not yet available, and provide access to the raw voice and video data planes, suitable for integration with bots and other services.
