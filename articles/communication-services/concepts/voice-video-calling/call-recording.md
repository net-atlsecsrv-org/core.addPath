# Calling Recording overview

[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Notice](../../includes/private-preview-include.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Many countries and states have laws and regulations that apply to the recording of PSTN, voice, and video calls, which often require that users consent to the recording of their communications. It is your responsibility to use the call recording capabilities in compliance with the law. You must obtain consent from the parties of recorded communications in a manner that complies with the laws applicable to each participant.

> [!NOTE]
> Regulations around the maintenance of personal data require the ability to export user data. In order to support these requirements, recording metadata files include the participantId for each call participant in the `participants` array. You can cross-reference the MRIs in the `participants` array with your internal user identities to identify participants in a call. An example of a recording metadata file is provided below for reference.

Call Recording provides a set of APIs to start, stop, pause and resume recording. These APIs can be accessed from server-side business logic or via events triggered by user actions. Recorded media output is in `MP4 Audio+Video` format, which is the same format that Teams uses to record media. Notifications related to media and metadata are emitted via Event Grid. Recordings are stored for 48 hours on built-in temporary storage for retrieval and movement to a long-term storage solution of choice. 

## Run-time Control APIs
Run-time control APIs can be used to manage recording via internal business logic triggers, such as an application creating a group call and recording the conversation, or from a user-triggered action that tells the server application to start recording. In either scenario, `<conversation-id>` is required to record a specific meeting or call. 

#### Getting Conversation ID from a server initiated call

A `ConversationId` is returned via the `Microsoft.Communication.CallLegStateChanged` event. This event notification is emitted after a call has been established. It can be found in the `data.ConversationId` field. This value can be used directly as the `{conversationId}` parameter in run-time control APIs:
```
      {
        "id": null,
        "topic": null,
        "subject": "callLeg/<callLegId>/callState",
        "data": {
---->       "ConversationId": "<conversation-id>",    <----
            "CallLegId": "<callLegId>",
            "CallState": "Established"
        },
        "eventType": "Microsoft.Communication.CallLegStateChanged",
        "eventTime": "2021-04-14T16:32:34.1115003Z",
        "metadataVersion": null,
        "dataVersion": null
    }
```
                                                            
#### Getting the conversation ID from a user triggered event on the client

From the JavaScript `@azure/communication-calling` library, after establishing a call invoke `let result = call.info.getConversationUrl()` to get the `conversationUrl`, then 
**Base64Url encode the `conversationUrl` to get the `{conversationId}` for use in the run-time control APIs**. Encoding can be done either on the client before sending the event to the server, or server side.

Note that the `conversationUrl` *must* be Base64Url encoded, not to be confused with just Base64 encoding (i.e. btoa).

## Media output types
Call recording currently supports mixed audio+video MP4 output format. The output media matches meeting recordings produced via Microsoft Teams recording.

| Channel Type | Content Format | Video | Audio |
| :----------- | :------------- | :---- | :--------------------------- |
| audioVideo | mp4 | 1920x1080 8 FPS video of all participants in default tile arrangement | 16kHz mp4a mixed audio of all participants |

## Event Grid notifications
An Event Grid notification `Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated` is published when a recording is ready for retrieval, typically 1-2 minutes after the recording process has completed (e.g. meeting ended, recording stopped). Recording event notifications include a document ID, which can be used to retrieve both recorded media and a recording metadata file:

- <Azure_Communication_Service_Endpoint>/recording/download/{documentId}
- <Azure_Communication_Service_Endpoint>/recording/download/{documentId}/metadata

Sample code for handling event grid notifications and downloading recording and metadata files can be found [here](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/download-recording-file-sample.md). 

### Notification Schema
```
{
    "id": string, // Unique guid for event
    "topic": string, // Azure Communication Services resource id
    "subject": string, // /recording/call/{call-id}
    "data": {

                    "documentId": string, // Document id for retrieving from storage
                    "index": int, // Index providing ordering for this chunk in the entire recording
                    "endReason": string, // Reason for chunk ending: "SessionEnded", "ChunkMaximumSizeExceeded”, etc.
                }
            ]
        },
        "recordingStartTime": string, // ISO 8601 date time for the start of the recording
        "recordingDurationMs": int, // Duration of recording in milliseconds
        "sessionEndReason": string // Reason for call ending: "CallEnded", "InitiatorLeft", etc.
    },
    "eventType": string, // "Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated"
    "dataVersion": string, // "1.0"
    "metadataVersion": string, // "1"
    "eventTime": string // ISO 8601 date time for when the event was created
}
