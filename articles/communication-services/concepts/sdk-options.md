# SDKs and REST APIs

Azure Communication Services capabilities are conceptually organized into six areas. Most areas have fully open-sourced SDKs programmed against published REST APIs that you can use directly over the Internet. The Calling SDK uses proprietary network interfaces and is currently closed-source. Samples and more technical details for SDKs are published in the [Azure Communication Services GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/communication).

## REST APIs
Communication Services APIs are documented alongside other Azure REST APIs in [docs.microsoft.com](/rest/api/azure/). This documentation will tell you how to structure your HTTP messages and offers guidance for using Postman. This documentation is also offered in Swagger format on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs).


## SDKs

| Assembly | Namespaces| Protocols | Capabilities |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Resource Manager | Azure.ResourceManager.Communication | [REST](/rest/api/communication/communicationservice)| Provision and manage Communication Services resources|
| Common | Azure.Communication.Common| REST | Provides base types for other SDKs |
| Identity | Azure.Communication.Identity| [REST](/rest/api/communication/communicationidentity)| Manage users, access tokens|
| Phone numbers _(beta)_| Azure.Communication.PhoneNumbers| [REST](/rest/api/communication/phonenumbers)| Acquire and manage phone numbers |
| Chat | Azure.Communication.Chat| [REST](/rest/api/communication/) with proprietary signaling | Add real-time text based chat to your applications |
| SMS| Azure.Communication.SMS | [REST](/rest/api/communication/sms)| Send and receive SMS messages|
| Calling| Azure.Communication.Calling | Proprietary transport | Use voice, video, screen-sharing, and other real-time data communication capabilities |

The Azure Resource Manager, Identity, and SMS SDKs are focused on service integration, and in many cases security issues arise if you integrate these functions into end-user applications. The Common and Chat SDKs are suitable for service and client applications. The Calling SDK is designed for client applications. An SDK focused on service scenarios is in development.

## REST API Throttles
Certain REST APIs and corresponding SDK methods have throttle limits you should be mindful of. Exceeding these throttle limits will trigger a  `429 - Too Many Requests` error response. These limits can be increased through [a request to Azure Support](../../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

| API                                                                                                                          | Throttle            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| [All Search Telephone Number Plan APIs](/rest/api/communication/phonenumbers)         | 4 requests/day      |
| [Purchase Telephone Number Plan](/rest/api/communication/phonenumbers/purchasephonenumbers) | 1 purchase a month  |
| [Send SMS](/rest/api/communication/sms/send)                                                       | 200 requests/minute |

## API stability expectations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section provides guidance on REST APIs and SDKs marked **stable**. APIs marked pre-release, preview, or beta may be changed or deprecated **without notice**.

In the future we may retire versions of the Communication Services SDKs, and we may introduce breaking changes to our REST APIs and released SDKs. Azure Communication Services will *generally* follow two supportability policies for retiring service versions:

- You'll be notified at least three years before being required to change code due to a Communication Services interface change. All documented REST APIs and SDK APIs generally enjoy at least three years warning before interfaces are decommissioned.
- You'll be notified at least one year before having to update SDK assemblies to the latest minor version. These required updates shouldn't require any code changes because they're in the same major version. This is especially true for the Calling and Chat libraries which have real-time components that frequently require security and performance updates. We highly encourage you to keep your Communication Services SDKs updated.

### API and SDK decommissioning examples

**You've integrated the v24 version of the SMS REST API into your application. Azure Communication releases v25.**

You'll get three years warning before these APIs stop working and are forced to update to v25. This update might require a code change.

**You've integrated the v2.02 version of the Calling SDK into your application. Azure Communication releases v2.05.**

You may be required to update to the v2.05 version of the Calling SDK within 12 months of the release of v2.05. This should be a simple replacement of the artifact without requiring a code change because v2.05 is in the v2 major version and has no breaking changes.
