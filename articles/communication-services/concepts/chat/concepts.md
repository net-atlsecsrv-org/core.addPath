# Chat concepts	

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]	

Azure Communication Services Chat client libraries can be used to add real-time text chat to your applications. This page summarizes key Chat concepts and capabilities.	

See the [Communication Services Chat client library Overview](./sdk-features.md) to learn more about specific client library languages and capabilities.	

## Chat overview 	

Chat conversations happen within chat threads. A chat thread can contain many messages and many users. Every message belongs to a single thread, and a user can be a part of one or many threads. Each user in the chat thread is called a participant. Only thread participants can send and receive messages and add or remove other users in a chat thread. Communication Services stores chat history until you execute a delete operation on the chat thread or message, or until no participants are remaining in the chat thread, at which point, the chat thread is orphaned and queued for deletion. 
	
## Service limits	

- The maximum number of participants allowed in a chat thread is 250.	
- The maximum message size allowed is approximately 28 KB. 	
- For chat threads with more than 20 participants, read receipts and typing indicator features aren't supported. 	
- 
## Chat architecture	

There are two core parts to chat architecture: 1) Trusted Service and 2) Client Application.

 - **Trusted service:** To properly manage a chat session, you need a service that helps you connect to Communication Services by using your resource connection string. This service is responsible for creating chat threads, managing thread participant lists, and providing access tokens to users. More information about access tokens can be found in our [access tokens](../../quickstarts/access-tokens.md) quickstart.	
 - **Client app:**  The client application connects to your trusted service and receives the access tokens that are used to connect directly to Communication Services. After this connection is made, your client app can send and receive messages.	
We recommend generating access tokens using the trusted service tier. In this scenario the server side would be responsible for creating and managing users and issuing their tokens.	
    	
## Message types	

Communication Services Chat shares user-generated messages as well as system-generated messages called **Thread activities**. Thread activities are generated when a chat thread is updated. When you call `List Messages` or `Get Messages` on a chat thread, the result will contain the user-generated text messages as well as the system messages in chronological order. This helps you identify when a participant was added or removed or when the chat thread topic was updated. Supported message types are:  
	
 - `Text`: A plain text message composed and sent by a user as part of a chat conversation.	
 - `RichText/HTML`: A formatted text message. Note that Communication Services users currently can't send RichText messages. This message type is supported by messages sent from Teams users to Communication Services users in Teams Interop scenarios.	
 - `ThreadActivity/ParticipantAdded`: A system message that indicates one or more participants have been added to the chat thread. For example:	


```	
{	
            "id": "1613589626560",	
            "type": "participantAdded",	
            "sequenceId": "7",	
            "version": "1613589626560",	
            "content":	
            {	
                "participants":	
                [	
                    {	
                        "id": "8:acs:d2a829bc-8523-4404-b727-022345e48ca6_00000008-511c-4df6-f40f-343a0d003226",	
                        "displayName": "Jane",	
                        "shareHistoryTime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"	
                    }	
                ],	
                "initiator": "8:acs:d2a829bc-8523-4404-b727-022345e48ca6_00000008-511c-4ce0-f40f-343a0d003224"	
            },	
            "createdOn": "2021-02-17T19:20:26Z"	
        }	
```	

- `ThreadActivity/ParticipantRemoved`: System message that indicates a participant has been removed from the chat thread. For example:	

```	
{	
            "id": "1613589627603",	
            "type": "participantRemoved",	
            "sequenceId": "8",	
            "version": "1613589627603",	
            "content":	
            {	
                "participants":	
                [	
                    {	
                        "id": "8:acs:d2a829bc-8523-4404-b727-022345e48ca6_00000008-511c-4df6-f40f-343a0d003226",	
                        "displayName": "Jane",	
                        "shareHistoryTime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"	
                    }	
                ],	
                "initiator": "8:acs:d2a829bc-8523-4404-b727-022345e48ca6_00000008-511c-4ce0-f40f-343a0d003224"	
            },	
            "createdOn": "2021-02-17T19:20:27Z"	
        }	
```	

- `ThreadActivity/TopicUpdate`: System message that indicates the thread topic has been updated. For example:	
```	
{	
            "id": "1613589623037",	
            "type": "topicUpdated",	
            "sequenceId": "2",	
            "version": "1613589623037",	
            "content":	
            {	
                "topic": "New topic",	
                "initiator": "8:acs:d2a829bc-8523-4404-b727-022345e48ca6_00000008-511c-4ce0-f40f-343a0d003224"	
            },	
            "createdOn": "2021-02-17T19:20:23Z"	
        }	
```	

## Real-time signaling 	

The Chat JavaScript client library includes real-time signaling. This allows clients to listen for real-time updates and incoming messages to a chat thread without having to poll the APIs. Available events include:

 - `ChatMessageReceived` - when a new message is sent to a chat thread. This event is not sent for auto generated system messages which were discussed in the previous topic.  	
 - `ChatMessageEdited` - when a message is edited in a chat thread.	
 - `ChatMessageDeleted` - when a message is deleted in a chat thread.	
 - `TypingIndicatorReceived` - when another participant is typing a message in a chat thread. 	
 - `ReadReceiptReceived` - when another participant has read the message that a user sent in a chat thread. 	
 - `ChatThreadCreated` - when a chat thread is created by a communication user.	
 - `ChatThreadDeleted` - when a chat thread is deleted by a communication user.	
 - `ChatThreadPropertiesUpdated` - when chat thread properties are updated; currently, we support only updating the topic for the thread.	
 - `ParticipantsAdded` - when a user is added as participant to a chat thread. 	
 - `ParticipantsRemoved` - when an existing participant is removed from the chat thread.


## Chat events 	

Real-time signaling allows your users to chat in real-time. Your services can use Azure Event Grid to subscribe to chat-related events. For more details, see [Event Handling conceptual](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-schema-communication-services?tabs=event-grid-event-schema).


## Using Cognitive Services with Chat client library to enable intelligent features	

You can use [Azure Cognitive APIs](../../../cognitive-services/index.yml) with the Chat client library to add intelligent features to your applications. For example, you can:	

- Enable users to chat with each other in different languages. 	
- Help a support agent prioritize tickets by detecting a negative sentiment of an incoming issue from a customer.	
- Analyze the incoming messages for key detection and entity recognition, and prompt relevant info to the user in your app based on the message content.

One way to achieve this is by having your trusted service act as a participant of a chat thread. Let's say you want to enable language translation. This service will be responsible for listening to the messages being exchanged by other participants [1], calling cognitive APIs to translate the content to desired language[2,3] and sending the translated result as a message in the chat thread[4].

This way, the message history will contain both original and translated messages. In the client application, you can add logic to show the original or translated message. See [this quickstart](../../../cognitive-services/translator/quickstart-translator.md) to understand how to use Cognitive APIs to translate text to different languages.
