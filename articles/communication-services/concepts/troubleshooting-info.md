# Troubleshooting in Azure Communication Services

This document will help you troubleshoot issues that you may experience within your Communication Services solution. If you're troubleshooting SMS, you can [enable delivery reporting with Event Grid](../quickstarts/telephony-sms/handle-sms-events.md) to capture SMS delivery details.

## Getting help

We encourage developers to submit questions, suggest features, and report problems as issues. To aid in doing this we have a [dedicated support and help options page](../support.md) which lists your options for support.

To help you troubleshoot certain types of issues, you may be asked for any of the following pieces of information:

* **MS-CV ID**: This ID is used to troubleshoot calls and messages.
* **Call ID**: This ID is used to identify Communication Services calls.
* **SMS message ID**: This ID is used to identify SMS messages.
* **Call logs**: These logs contain detailed information that can be used to troubleshoot calling and network issues.


## Access your MS-CV ID

The MS-CV ID can be accessed by configuring diagnostics in the `clientOptions` object instance when initializing your SDKs. Diagnostics can be configured for any of the Azure SDKs including Chat, Identity, and VoIP calling.

### Client options example

The following code snippets demonstrate diagnostics configuration. When the SDKs are used with diagnostics enabled, diagnostics details will be emitted to the configured event listener:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```
// 1. Import Azure.Core.Diagnostics
using Azure.Core.Diagnostics;

// 2. Initialize an event source listener instance
using var listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
Uri endpoint = new Uri("https://<RESOURCE-NAME>.communication.azure.net");
var (token, communicationUser) = await GetCommunicationUserAndToken();
CommunicationUserCredential communicationUserCredential = new CommunicationUserCredential(token);

// 3. Setup diagnostic settings
var clientOptions = new ChatClientOptions()
{
    Diagnostics =
    {
        LoggedHeaderNames = { "*" },
        LoggedQueryParameters = { "*" },
        IsLoggingContentEnabled = true,
    }
};

// 4. Initialize the ChatClient instance with the clientOptions
ChatClient chatClient = new ChatClient(endpoint, communicationUserCredential, clientOptions);
ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = await chatClient.CreateChatThreadAsync("Thread Topic", new[] { new ChatThreadMember(communicationUser) });
```

# [Python](#tab/python)
```
from azure.communication.chat import ChatClient, CommunicationUserCredential
endpoint = "https://communication-services-sdk-live-tests-for-python.communication.azure.com"
chat_client = ChatClient(
    endpoint,
    CommunicationUserCredential(token),
    http_logging_policy=your_logging_policy)
```

## Access your call ID

When troubleshooting voice or video calls, you may be asked to provide a `call ID`. This can be accessed via the `id` property of the `call` object:

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)
```javascript
// `call` is an instance of a call created by `callAgent.startCall` or `callAgent.join` methods
console.log(call.id)
```

# [iOS](#tab/ios)
```objc
// The `call id` property can be retrieved by calling the `call.getCallId()` method on a call object after a call ends
// todo: the code snippet suggests it's a property while the comment suggests it's a method call
print(call.callId)
```

# [Android](#tab/android)
```java
// The `call id` property can be retrieved by calling the `call.getCallId()` method on a call object after a call ends
// `call` is an instance of a call created by `callAgent.startCall(…)` or `callAgent.join(…)` methods
Log.d(call.getCallId())
```

## Access your SMS message ID

For SMS issues, you can collect the message ID from the response object.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)
```
// Instantiate the SMS client
const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
async function main() {
  const result = await smsClient.send({
    from: "+18445792722",
    to: ["+1972xxxxxxx"],
    message: "Hello World 👋🏻 via Sms"
  }, {
    enableDeliveryReport: true // Optional parameter
  });
console.log(result); // your message ID will be in the result
}
```
---

## Enable and access call logs

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK relies internally on [@azure/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/logger) library to control logging.
Use the `setLogLevel` method from the `@azure/logger` package to configure the log output:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from '@azure/logger';
setLogLevel('verbose');
const callClient = new CallClient();
```

You can use AzureLogger to redirect the logging output from Azure SDKs by overriding the `AzureLogger.log` method:
This may be useful if you want to redirect logs to a location other than console.

```javascript
import { AzureLogger } from '@azure/logger';
// redirect log output
AzureLogger.log = (...args) => {
  console.log(...args); // to console, file, buffer, REST API..
};
```

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

When developing for iOS, your logs are stored in `.blog` files. Note that you can't view the logs directly because they're encrypted.

These can be accessed by opening Xcode. Go to Windows > Devices and Simulators > Devices. Select your device. Under Installed Apps, select your application and click on "Download container".

This will give you a `xcappdata` file. Right-click on this file and select “Show package contents”. You'll then see the `.blog` files that you can then attach to your Azure support request.

# [Android](#tab/android)

When developing for Android, your logs are stored in `.blog` files. Note that you can't view the logs directly because they're encrypted.

On Android Studio, navigate to the Device File Explorer by selecting View > Tool Windows > Device File Explorer from both the simulator and the device. The `.blog` file will be located within your application's directory, which should look something like `/data/data/[app_name_space:com.contoso.com.acsquickstartapp]/files/acs_sdk.blog`. You can attach this file to your support request.

## Calling SDK error codes

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK uses the following error codes to help you troubleshoot calling issues. These error codes are exposed through the `call.callEndReason` property after a call ends.

| Error code | Description | Action to take |
| -------- | ---------------| ---------------|
| 403 | Forbidden / Authentication failure. | Ensure that your Communication Services token is valid and not expired. |
| 404 | Call not found. | Ensure that the number you're calling (or call you're joining) exists. |
| 408 | Call controller timed out. | Call Controller timed out waiting for protocol messages from user endpoints. Ensure clients are connected and available. |
| 410 | Local media stack or media infrastructure error. | Ensure that you're using the latest SDK in a supported environment. |
| 430 | Unable to deliver message to client application. | Ensure that the client application is running and available. |
| 480 | Remote client endpoint not registered. | Ensure that the remote endpoint is available. |
| 481 | Failed to handle incoming call. | File a support request through the Azure portal. |
| 487 | Call canceled, locally declined, ended due to an endpoint mismatch issue, or failed to generate media offer. | Expected behavior. |
| 490, 491, 496, 487, 498 | Local endpoint network issues. | Check your network. |
| 500, 503, 504 | Communication Services infrastructure error. | File a support request through the Azure portal. |
| 603 | Call globally declined by remote Communication Services participant | Expected behavior. |
