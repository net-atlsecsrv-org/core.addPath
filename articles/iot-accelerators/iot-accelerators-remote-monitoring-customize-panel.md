# Add a custom panel to the dashboard in the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator web UI

This article shows you how to add a new panel onto a dashboard page in the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator web UI. The article describes:

- How to prepare a local development environment.
- How to add a new panel to a dashboard page in the web UI.

The example panel in this article displays on the existing dashboard page.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this how-to guide, you need the following software installed on your local development machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)

## Before you start

You should complete the steps in the [Add a custom page to the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator web UI](iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-customize-page.md) article before continuing.

## Add a panel

To add a panel to the web UI, you need to add the source files that define the panel, and then modify the dashboard to display the panel.

### Add the new files that define the panel

To get you started, the **src/walkthrough/components/pages/dashboard/panels/examplePanel** folder contains the files that define a panel, including:

**examplePanel.js**

[!code-javascript[Example panel](~/remote-monitoring-webui/src/walkthrough/components/pages/dashboard/panels/examplePanel/examplePanel.js?name=panel "Example panel")]

Copy the **src/walkthrough/components/pages/dashboard/panels/examplePanel** folder to the **src/components/pages/dashboard/panels** folder.

Add the following export to the **src/walkthrough/components/pages/dashboard/panels/index.js** file:

```js
export * from './examplePanel';
```

### Add the panel to the dashboard

Modify the **src/components/pages/dashboard/dashboard.js** to add the panel.

Add the example panel to the list of imports from panels:

```js
import {
  OverviewPanel,
  AlertsPanel,
  TelemetryPanel,
  AnalyticsPanel,
  MapPanel,
  transformTelemetryResponse,
  chartColorObjects,
  ExamplePanel
} from './panels';
```

Add the following cell definition to the grid in the page content:

```js
          <Cell className="col-2">
            <ExamplePanel t={t} />
          </Cell>
```

## Test the flyout

If the web UI is not already running locally, run the following command in the root of your local copy of the repository:

```cmd/sh
npm start
```

The previous command runs the UI locally at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`. Navigate to the **Dashboard** page to view the new panel.

## Next steps

In this article, you learned about the resources available to help you add or customize dashboards in the web UI in the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator.
