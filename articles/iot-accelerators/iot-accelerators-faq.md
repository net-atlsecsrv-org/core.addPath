# Frequently asked questions for IoT solution accelerators

See also, the [Connected Factory-specific FAQ](iot-accelerators-faq-cf.md) and the [Remote Monitoring-specific FAQ](iot-accelerators-faq-rm-v2.md) .

### Where can I find the source code for the solution accelerators?

The source code is stored in the following GitHub repositories:

* [Remote Monitoring solution accelerator (.NET)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet)
* [Remote Monitoring solution accelerator (Java)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-java)
* [Predictive Maintenance solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-predictive-maintenance)
* [Connected Factory solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-connected-factory)

### What SDKs can I use to develop device clients for the solution accelerators?

You can find links to the different language (C, .NET, Java, Node.js, Python) IoT device SDKs in the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub repositories.

If you're using the DevKit device, you can find resources and samples in the [IoT DevKit SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/devkit-sdk) GitHub repository.

### Is the new microservices architecture available for all the three solution accelerators?

Currently, only the Remote Monitoring solution uses the microservices architecture as it covers the broadest scenario.

### What advantages does the new open-sourced microservices-based architecture provide in the new update?

Over the last two years, cloud architecture has greatly evolved. Microservices have emerged as a great pattern to achieve scale and flexibility, without sacrificing development speed. This architectural pattern is used in several Microsoft services internally with great reliability and scalability results. Microsoft is putting these learnings into practice in the solution accelerators so that customers benefit from them.

### I'm a service administrator and I'd like to change the directory mapping between my subscription and a specific Azure AD tenant. How do I complete this task?

See [To add an existing subscription to your Azure AD directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory.md#to-associate-an-existing-subscription-to-your-azure-ad-directory)

### I want to change a Service Administrator or Co-Administrator when logged in with an organizational account

See the support article [Changing Service Administrator and Co-Administrator when logged in with an organizational account](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/changing-service-admin-and-co-admin).

### Why am I seeing this error? "Your account does not have the proper permissions to create a solution. Please check with your account administrator or try with a different account."

Look at the following diagram for guidance:

![Permissions flowchart](media/iot-accelerators-faq/flowchart.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you continue to see the error after validating you are a global administrator of the Azure AD tenant and a co-administrator of the subscription, have your account administrator remove the user and reassign necessary permissions in this order. First, add the user as a global administrator and then add user as a co-administrator of the Azure subscription. If issues persist, contact [Help & Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

### Why am I seeing this error when I have an Azure subscription? "An Azure subscription is required to create pre-configured solutions. You can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes."

If you're certain you have an Azure subscription, validate the tenant mapping for your subscription and check that the correct tenant is selected in the dropdown. If youâ€™ve validated the tenant is correct, follow the preceding diagram and validate the mapping of your subscription and this Azure AD tenant.

### Where can I find information about the previous version of the Remote Monitoring solution?

The previous version of the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator was known as the IoT Suite Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution. You can find the archived documentation at [https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/iot-suite/](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/iot-suite/).

### Is the new solution accelerator available in the same geographic region as the existing solution?

Yes, the new Remote Monitoring is available in the same geographic regions.

### What's the difference between deleting a resource group in the Azure portal and clicking delete on a solution accelerator in azureiotsolutions.com?

* If you delete the solution accelerator in [azureiotsolutions.com](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/), you delete all the resources that were deployed when you created the solution accelerator. If you added additional resources to the resource group, these resources are also deleted.
* If you delete the resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you only delete the resources in that resource group. You also need to delete the Azure Active Directory application associated with the solution accelerator.

### Can I continue to leverage my existing investments in Azure IoT solution accelerators?

Yes. Any solution that exists today continues to work in your Azure subscription and the source code stays available in GitHub.

### How many IoT Hub instances can I provision in a subscription?

By default you can provision [10 IoT hubs per subscription](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#iot-hub-limits). You can create an [Azure support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to raise this limit. As a result, since every solution accelerator provisions a new IoT Hub, you can only provision up to 10 solution accelerators in a given subscription.

### How many Azure Cosmos DB instances can I provision in a subscription?

Fifty. You can create an [Azure support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to raise this limit, but by default, you can only provision 50 Cosmos DB instances per subscription.

### How many Free Bing Maps APIs can I provision in a subscription?

Two. You can create only two Internal Transactions Level 1 Bing Maps for Enterprise plans in an Azure subscription. The Remote Monitoring solution is provisioned by default with the Internal Transactions Level 1 plan. As a result, you can only provision up to two Remote Monitoring solutions in a subscription with no modifications.

### Can I create a solution accelerator if I have Microsoft Azure for DreamSpark?

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure for DreamSpark is now known as Microsoft Imagine for students.

Currently, you cannot create a solution accelerator with a [Microsoft Azure for DreamSpark](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/imagine/) account. However, you can create a [free trial account for Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a couple of minutes that enables you create a solution accelerator.

### How do I delete an Azure AD tenant?

See Eric Golpe's blog post [Walkthrough of Deleting an Azure AD Tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/ericgolpe/walkthrough-of-deleting-an-azure-ad-tenant).
