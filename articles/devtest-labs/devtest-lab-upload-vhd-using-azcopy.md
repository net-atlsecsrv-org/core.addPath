# Upload VHD file to lab's storage account using AzCopy

[!INCLUDE [devtest-lab-upload-vhd-selector](../../includes/devtest-lab-upload-vhd-selector.md)]

In Azure DevTest Labs, VHD files can be used to create custom images, which are used to provision virtual machines. 
The following steps walk you through using the AzCopy command-line utility to upload a VHD file to a lab's storage account. Once you've uploaded your VHD file, the [Next steps section](#next-steps) lists some articles that illustrate how to create a custom image from the uploaded VHD file. For more information about disks and VHDs in Azure, see [Introduction to managed disks](../virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.md)

> [!NOTE] 
>  
> AzCopy is a Windows-only command-line utility.

## Step-by-step instructions

The following steps walk you through uploading a VHD file to Azure DevTest Labs using [AzCopy](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy). 

1. Get the name of the lab's storage account using the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).

1. Select **All services**, and then select **DevTest Labs** from the list.

1. From the list of labs, select the desired lab.  

1. On the lab's blade, select **Configuration**. 

1. On the lab **Configuration** blade, select **Custom images (VHDs)**.

1. On the **Custom images** blade, Select **+Add**. 

1. On the **Custom image** blade, select **VHD**.

1. On the **VHD** blade, select **Upload a VHD using PowerShell**.

1. The **Upload an image using PowerShell** blade displays a call to the **Add-AzureVhd** cmdlet. 
The first parameter (*Destination*) contains the URI for a blob container (*uploads*) in the following format:

	```
	https://<STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/...
	``` 

1. Make note of the full URI as it is used in later steps.

1. Upload the VHD file using AzCopy:
 
1. [Download and install the latest version of AzCopy](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy).

1. Open a command window and navigate to the AzCopy installation directory. Optionally, you can add the AzCopy installation location to your system path. By default, AzCopy is installed to the following directory:

	```command-line
	%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy
	```

1. Using the storage account key and blob container URI, run the following command at the command prompt. The *vhdFileName* value needs to be in quotes. The process of uploading a VHD file can be lengthy depending on the size of the VHD file and your connection speed.   

	```command-line
	AzCopy /Source:<sourceDirectory> /Dest:<blobContainerUri> /DestKey:<storageAccountKey> /Pattern:"<vhdFileName>" /BlobType:page
	```
