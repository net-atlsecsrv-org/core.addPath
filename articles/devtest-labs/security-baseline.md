### 3.4: Use single sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory
**Guidance:** DevTest Labs uses the Azure AD service for identity management. Consider these two key aspects when you give users access to an environment based on DevTest Labs:

- **Resource management:** It provides access to the Azure portal to manage resources (create VMs, create environments, start, stop, restart, delete, and apply artifacts, and so on). Resource management is done in Azure by using role-based access control (RBAC). You assign roles to users and set resource and access-level permissions.
- **Virtual machines (network-level)**: In the default configuration, VMs use a local admin account. If there's a domain available (Azure AD Domain Services, an on-premises domain, or a cloud-based domain), machines can be joined to the domain. Users can then use their domain-based identities using the domain join artifact to connect to the machines.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure
**Guidance:** Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

- [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring:** Yes

**Responsibility:** Customer

### 10.3: Test security response procedures
**Guidance:** Conduct exercises to test your systems’ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents
**Guidance:** Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system
**Guidance:** Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

#### 10.6: Automate the response to security alerts
**Guidance:** Use the Workflow Automation feature in Azure Security Center to automatically trigger responses via "Logic Apps" on security alerts and recommendations to protect your Azure resources.
