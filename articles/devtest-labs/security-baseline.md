# Azure security baseline for Azure DevTest Labs

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure DevTest Labs. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure DevTest Labs. **Controls** not applicable to Azure DevTest Labs have been excluded.

To see how Azure DevTest Labs completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure DevTest Labs security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: When you deploy Azure DevTest Labs resources you must create or use an existing virtual network. Ensure that the chosen virtual network has a network security group applied to its subnets and network access controls configured specific to your application's trusted ports and sources. When a lab resources are configured with a virtual network, they are not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from within the virtual network. You can also choose to create a network isolated lab, where alongside lab environments, lab resources such as Storage Account and Key Vaults will also be completely isolated and only accessible through specified end points. 

Depending on your organizational needs, use the Azure Firewall service to centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Deploy a network security group on the network that your Azure DevTest Labs resources are deployed to. Enable network security group flow logs on your network security groups for traffic auditing.

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics Workspace and
use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure
cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize
network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand
traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of critical web applications deployed using Azure Resource Manager templates for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Enable diagnostic setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics workspace.

- [How to deploy Azure WAF](../web-application-firewall/ag/create-waf-policy-ag.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Deploying a Azure Virtual Network (VNet) for a lab enhances security and isolation for your lab. Subnets, access control policies, and other features also aid in restricting access. When deployed in a VNet, Azure DevTest Labs is not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the VNet.

Enable DDoS Standard protection on your Azure Virtual Networks to guard against DDoS attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious IP addresses.

Deploy Azure Firewall at each of the organization's network boundaries with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic. Use Azure Security Center Just In Time Network access to configure NSGs to limit exposure of endpoints to approved IP addresses for a limited period. Use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG configurations that limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

- [How to Enable and use Traffic Analytics](../network-watcher/traffic-analytics.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Use an Azure Firewall deployed on your virtual network with Threat Intelligence enabled. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed. If your organization requires additional functionality on top of what Azure Firewall can provide, select an appropriate offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities.

Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or deny malicious traffic.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall configured for your DevTest Labs resources. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

You may also use Application Security Groups to help simplify
complex security configuration. Application security groups enable you to
configure network security as a natural extension of an application's
structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security
policies based on those groups.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for
network resources with Azure Policy.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large scale Azure
deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resources
Manager templates, RBAC controls, and policies, in a single blueprint
definition. You can apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, and fine-tune
control and management through versioning.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for network resources associated with your Azure DevTest Labs deployment in order to logically organize them into a taxonomy. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

- [Azure DevTest Labs roles](devtest-lab-add-devtest-user.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) doesn't have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password force a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differ depending on the service. You're responsible for third-party applications and Marketplace services that may use default passwords.

DevTest Labs doesn't have the concept of default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription

- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.4: Use single sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: DevTest Labs uses the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service for identity management. Consider these two key aspects when you give users access to an environment based on DevTest Labs:
- Resource management: It provides access to the Azure portal to manage resources (create VMs, create environments, start, stop, restart, delete, and apply artifacts, and so on). Resource management is done in Azure by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). You assign roles to users and set resource and access-level permissions.
- Virtual machines (network-level): In the default configuration, VMs use a local admin account. If there's a domain available (Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS), an on-premises domain, or a cloud-based domain), machines can be joined to the domain. Users can then use their domain-based identities using the domain join artifact to connect to the machines.
