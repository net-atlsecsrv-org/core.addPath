**Azure Security Center monitoring:** Yes

**Responsibility:** Customer

### 3.4: Use single sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory
**Guidance:** DevTest Labs uses the Azure AD service for identity management. Consider these two key aspects when you give users access to an environment based on DevTest Labs:

- **Resource management:** It provides access to the Azure portal to manage resources (create VMs, create environments, start, stop, restart, delete, and apply artifacts, and so on). Resource management is done in Azure by using role-based access control (RBAC). You assign roles to users and set resource and access-level permissions.
- **Virtual machines (network-level)**: In the default configuration, VMs use a local admin account. If there's a domain available (Azure AD Domain Services, an on-premises domain, or a cloud-based domain), machines can be joined to the domain. Users can then use their domain-based identities using the domain join artifact to connect to the machines.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest
**Guidance:** Azure DevTest Labs stores the following customer data:

- [Artifact results](add-artifact-vm.md) that include deployment and extension logs generated from applying artifacts
- [Formula documents](devtest-lab-manage-formulas.md) that are used to create virtual machines from formulas
- OS and data disks for lab virtual machines 

Artifact results and formula documents are sent to an Azure Storage account that's created as part of every lab deployment. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption can't be disabled. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your storage account, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. For more information, see [Encryption for lab storage account](encrypt-storage.md).

By default, all lab OS and data disks are encrypted with a platform managed key. All managed disks, snapshots, images, and data written to existing managed disks are automatically encrypted-at-rest with platform-managed keys. As a lab owner, you can configure lab OS disks to be encrypted with a customer managed key. Encryption using a customer managed key for lab data disks is currently not configurable through the lab itself. However a subscription admin can configure this setting for lab disks within a subscription for now.
