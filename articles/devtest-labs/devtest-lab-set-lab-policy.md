# Manage all policies for a lab in Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs lets you control cost and minimizes waste in your labs by managing policies (settings) for each lab. This article explains in step-by-step detail how to set each policy.  

## Set allowed virtual machine sizes
The policy for setting the allowed VM sizes helps to minimize lab waste by enabling you to specify which VM sizes are allowed in the lab. If this policy is activated, only VM sizes from this list can be used to create VMs.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040), select a lab and then select **Configuration and policies**.

    ![Access the lab's configuration and policies](./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/policies-menu.png)

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** pane, select **Allowed virtual machines sizes**.
   
    ![Allowed virtual machines sizes](./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/allowed-vm-sizes.png)

1. Select **On** to enable this policy, and **Off** to disable it.

1. If you enable this policy, select one or more VM sizes that can be created in your lab.

1. Select **Save**.

## Set virtual machines per user
The policy for **Virtual machines per user** lets you specify the number of VMs that can be created by an individual user. If a user tries to create or claim a VM when the user limit has been met, an error message indicates that the VM cannot be created/claimed. 

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** pane, select **Virtual machines per user**.
   
    ![Virtual machines per user](./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/max-vms-per-user.png)

1. Select **Yes** to limit the number of VMs per user. If you do not want to limit the number of VMs per user, select **No**. If you select **Yes**, enter a numeric value indicating the number of VMs that can be created or claimed by a user. 

1. Select **Yes** to limit the number of VMs that can use SSD (solid-state disk). If you do not want to limit the number of VMs that can use SSD, select **No**. If you select **Yes**, enter a value indicating the number of VMs that can be created using SSD. 

1. Select **Save**.

## Set virtual machines per lab
The policy for **Virtual machines per lab** lets you specify the number of VMs that can be created for the current lab. If a user tries to create a VM when the lab limit has been met, an error message indicates that the VM cannot be created. 

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** pane, select **Virtual machines per lab**.
   
    ![Virtual machines per lab](./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/max-vms-per-lab.png)

1. Select **Yes** to limit the number of VMs per lab. If you do not want to limit the number of VMs per lab, select **No**. If you select **Yes**, enter a numeric value indicating the number of VMs that can be created or claimed by a user. 

1. Select **Yes** to limit the number of VMs that can use SSD (solid-state disk). If you do not want to limit the number of VMs that can use SSD, select **No**. If you select **Yes**, enter a value indicating the number of VMs that can be created using SSD. 

1. Select **Save**.

## Set auto shutdown
The auto shutdown policy helps minimize lab waste by letting you specify the time that this lab's VMs shut down.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** pane, select **Auto shutdown**.
   
    ![Auto shutdown](./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/auto-shutdown.png)

1. Select **On** to enable this policy, and **Off** to disable it.

1. If you enable this policy, specify the time (and time zone) to shut down all VMs in the current lab.

1. Specify **Yes** or **No** for the option to send a notification 15 minutes before the specified auto shutdown time. If you choose **Yes**, enter a webhook URL endpoint or an email address specifying where you want the notification to be posted or sent. The user receives notification and is given the option to postpone the shutdown.

   For more information about webhooks, see [Create a webhook or API Azure Function](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook.md). 

1. Select **Save**.

By default, once enabled, this policy applies to all VMs in the current lab. To remove this setting from a specific VM, open the VM's management pane and change its **Auto shutdown** setting.

## Set auto shutdown policy
As a lab owner, you can configure a shutdown schedule for all the VMs in your lab. By doing so, you can save costs from running machines that aren't being used (idle). You can enforce a shutdown policy on all your lab VMs centrally but also save your lab users the effort from setting up a schedule for their individual machines. This feature enables you to set the policy on your lab schedule starting from offering no control to full control, to your lab users. As a lab owner, you can configure this policy by taking the following steps:

1. On the home page for your lab, select **Configuration and policies**.
2. Select **Auto shutdown policy** in the **Schedules** section of the left menu.
3. Select one of the options. The following sections give you more details about these options: The set policy applies only to new VMs created in the lab and not to the already existing VMs.

### User sets a schedule and can opt out
If you set your lab to this policy, the lab users can override or opt out of the lab schedule. This option grants lab users full control over auto shutdown schedule of their VMs. Lab users see no change in their VM auto shutdown schedule page.

### User sets a schedule and cannot opt out
If you set your lab to this policy, lab users can override the lab schedule. However, they can't opt out of auto shutdown policy. This option makes sure that every machine in your lab is under an auto shutdown schedule. Lab users can update auto shutdown schedule of their VMs, and set up shut down notifications.

### User has no control over the schedule set by lab admin
If you set your lab to this policy, lab users can't override or opt out of the lab schedule. This option offers lab admin the complete control on the schedule for every machine in the lab. Lab users can only set up auto shutdown notifications for their VMs.

## Set autostart
The autostart policy lets you specify when the VMs in the current lab should be started.  

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** pane, select **Autostart**.
   
    ![Screen capture shows the automatic start options for a virtual machine.](./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/auto-start.png)

2. Select **On** to enable this policy, and **Off** to disable it.

3. If you enable this policy, specify the scheduled start time, time zone, and the days of the week for which the time applies. 

4. Select **Save**.

Once enabled, this policy is not automatically applied to any VMs in the current lab. To apply this setting to a specific VM, open the VM's management pane and change its **Autostart** setting.

## Set expiration date
You can set an expiration date when you [create the VM](devtest-lab-add-vm.md). In **Advanced settings**, choose the calendar icon to specify a date on which the VM is automatically deleted. By default, the VM never expires.

  how to create a custom image from a VHD file.
* [Configure Marketplace images](devtest-lab-configure-marketplace-images.md) - Azure DevTest Labs supports creating VMs based on Azure Marketplace images. This article
  illustrates how to specify which, if any, Azure Marketplace images can be used when creating VMs in a lab.
* [Create a VM in a lab](devtest-lab-add-vm.md) - Illustrates how to create a VM from a base image (either custom or Marketplace), and how to work with
  artifacts in your VM.
