# DevTest Labs in the enterprise
Enterprises are rapidly adopting the cloud because of [benefits](/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/business-strategy/cloud-migration-business-case) that include agility, flexibility, and economics. The first steps are often development and test workloads. Azure DevTest Labs provides [features](devtest-lab-concepts.md) that benefit the enterprise and support [key dev/test scenarios](devtest-lab-guidance-get-started.md).

Common concerns for enterprises that migrate workloads to the cloud include:

- [Securing development/testing resources](devtest-lab-guidance-governance-policy-compliance.md)
- [Managing and understanding costs](devtest-lab-guidance-governance-cost-ownership.md)
- Enabling self-service for developers without compromising enterprise security and compliance
- Automating and extending DevTest Labs to cover additional scenarios
- [Scaling a DevTest Labs-based solution to thousands of resources](devtest-lab-guidance-scale.md)
- [Large-scale deployments of DevTest Labs](devtest-lab-guidance-orchestrate-implementation.md)
- [Getting started with a proof of concept](devtest-lab-guidance-orchestrate-implementation.md)

## Intended audience
This documentation is for enterprise IT planners, architects, and managers who are responsible for establishing and reviewing deployments and overseeing operations. These articles emphasize the overall process and recommended design principles. The goal is to promote a secure and stable development/testing environment, which ultimately drives adoption of Azure DevTest Labs within an organization.
