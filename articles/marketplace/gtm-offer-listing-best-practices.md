# Offer listing best practices

This article gives suggestions for creating and engaging Microsoft commercial marketplace offers. The following tables outline best practices for completing offer information in Partner Center. For an analysis of how your offers are performing, go to the [Marketplace Insights dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/marketplaceinsights) in Partner Center. 

## Online store offer details

| Setting | Best practice |
|:--- |:--- |  
| Offer name | For apps, provide a clear title that includes search keywords to help customers discover your offer. <br> <br> For Consulting Services, follow this format: [Offer Name: [Duration] [Offer Type] (for example, Contoso: 2-Week Implementation) |
| Offer description | Provide a clear description that describes your offer's value proposition in the first few sentences.  Keep in mind that these sentences may be used in search engine results. Core components of your value proposition should include: <ul> <li>Description of the product or solution. </li> <li> User persona that benefits from the product or solution. </li> <li> Customer need or pain the product or solution addresses. </li> </ul> <br> Use industry standard vocabulary or benefit-based wording when possible.  Do not rely on features and functionality to sell your product.  Instead, focus on the value you deliver. <br> <br> For Consulting Service listings, clearly state the professional service you provide. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure your offer name and offer description adhere to **[Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general.aspx)** and other relevant, product-specific guidelines when referring to Microsoft trademarks and the names of Microsoft software, products, and services.

## Online store listing details

Categories and industries for a different online store will be applicable to different offer types.

### Categories

Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace are online stores that offer different solution types. Azure Marketplace offers IT solutions built on or for Azure.  Microsoft AppSource offer business solutions, such as industry SaaS applications, Dynamics 365 add-ins, Microsoft 365 add-ins, and Power Platform apps.

Categories and subcategories are mapped to each online store based on the solution type. Your offer will be published to Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace depending on the offer type, transaction capabilities of the offer and category/subcategory selection. 

Select categories and subcategories that best align with your solution type. You can select:

* Up to two categories, including a primary and a secondary category (optional).
* Up to two subcategories for each primary and/or secondary category. If no subcategory is selected, you offer will still be discoverable on the selected category only.

[!INCLUDE [categories and subcategories](./includes/categories.md)]

#### IMPORTANT: SaaS Offers and Microsoft 365 Add-ins

See [Transacting in the commercial marketplace](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md) for specific details on how transact capabilities may affect how your offer can be viewed and purchased by marketplace customers. For SaaS offers, the offer's transaction capability as well as the category selection will determine the online store where your offer will be published.

## Link to your offer page from your website

When you link from the AppSource or Azure Marketplace badge on your site to your listing in the commercial marketplace, you can support strong analytics and reporting by including the following query parameters at the end of the URL:
* **src**: Include the source from which the traffic is routed to AppSource (for example, website, LinkedIn, or Facebook).
* **mktcmpid**: Your marketing campaign ID, which can contain up to 16 characters in any combination of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (for example, *blogpost_12*).

The following example URL contains both of the preceding query parameters:
`https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?src=website&mktcmpid=blogpost_12`

By adding the parameters to your AppSource URL, you can review the effectiveness of your campaign in the analytics dashboard in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/).
