# Add bank and tax information  
The bank and tax information is required for all commercial offers using the transact listing type.  
*   If you are publishing commercial offers for purchase, then you must add payout and tax information and request validation in Dev Center.  
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >For commercial offers (transact), you must complete the bank and tax information before you are able to push your offers to production.  

*   If you are publishing only free or BYOL offers, then you are not required to add the information. You may add the information later, but validation of the tax information takes some time. If you plan to offer commercial offers for purchase, then you should add the information as soon as possible.  

## Add bank information  
1.  Sign into Dev Center using your Microsoft ID.  
    *   To sign into Dev Center, visit the Windows Dev Center page located at [dev.windows.com](https://dev.windows.com).  
2.  Select Payout account on the left menu.
3.  On the `Choose payment method` page, select `Bank account` or `PayPal`.  
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If you have commercial offers that customers purchase on the Marketplace, then your payout account is where you receive payout for the purchases.  

4.  Enter the payment information. After you have verified that the information is correct, click on the Save button.  
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If you update or change your payout account, then you must follow the same steps replacing the current information with the new information. Changes to your payout account may delay payments up to one payment cycle. This delay occurs because Microsoft must verify the account change, this is the same as when you first set-up your payout account. You get paid the full amount after your account has been verified. Any payments due from the current payment cycle are added to the next cycle.  

4.  Click on the Next button.
