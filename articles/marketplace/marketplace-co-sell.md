# Co-sell partner engagement

You can use the Microsoft Co-sell program to work directly with us on joint selling opportunities. The program helps you reach a vast community of customers and create new sales opportunities to accelerate your business growth.

## Co-sell channels

You can co-sell your solutions through three channels:

* Directly to customers in Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace.
* In collaboration with other partners.
* In collaboration with Microsoft sellers.

The Co-sell program is available for **services** with Microsoft technology embedded and for repeatable, packaged **Intellectual Property (IP) solutions**.

Some IP solutions can qualify for Microsoft seller incentives when they're successfully sold and deployed with the Microsoft field sales teams.

## Azure IP co-sell incentivized offers

Offers in the Co-sell program are either **co-sell ready** or **co-sell incentivized**, depending on the requirements they meet.

Azure IP solutions that reach the **co-sell incentivized** status unlock these benefits:

* The marketplace Service Fee is reduced from 20% to 10% of billed sales. This discount applies to IaaS and SaaS offers sold through the Microsoft commercial marketplace. See [Reduced Service Fee](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md#reduced-service-fee) for more details.
* Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners receive a 10% sales incentive to sell your SaaS and IaaS offers. Learn more about CSP at [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).
* Your Azure IP co-sell incentivized offers will contribute towards customers’ Azure consumption commitment, when they are purchased on the commercial marketplace. Eligible customers will see the offer marked as **Azure benefit eligible** on the online stores. See [Azure consumption commitment benefit](azure-consumption-commitment-benefit.md) for more details.
* The offers receive a Microsoft preferred solutions badge in the online stores. The badge promotes the offers’ quality, performance, and ability to address customer needs in a certain industry vertical or solution area. Learn more at [Preferred solutions in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace](preferred-solutions.md).
