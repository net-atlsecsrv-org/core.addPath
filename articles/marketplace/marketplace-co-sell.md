# Co-sell partner engagement

You can use the Co-sell program to work directly with Microsoft sellers on joint selling opportunities and to unlock significant additional commercial and merchandising benefits selling through Commercial Marketplace.

The Co-sell program is available for **software built with your intellectual property (IP) as repeatable, packaged offers** and for **services with Microsoft technology embedded**. Most offer types in the Co-sell program are also available in the commercial marketplace. Offers that meet additional requirements become **Co-sell ready** or **Co-sell incentivized**.

- **Co-sell ready** offers are exposed to Microsoft field sellers. When working with Microsoft sellers, the Co-sell program helps you reach a vast community of Microsoft managed customers to collaborate on sales opportunities that accelerate your business growth.

</ul>

- **Co-sell incentivized** IP solutions can earn incentives for Microsoft field sellers when they are sold in collaboration with Microsoft sales teams, in addition to the marketplace benefits listed below.</li></ul>

## Marketplace benefits for incentivized offers

Offers that attain **Azure IP Co-sell incentivized** status gain these additional marketplace benefits:

* The marketplace service fee is reduced from 20% to 10%. This discount applies to your IaaS or SaaS offer sold through the commercial marketplace. See [Reduced Service Fee](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md#reduced-service-fee) for more details.
* Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners receive a 10% incentive to sell your IaaS or SaaS offer. Learn more about the CSP program at [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).
* Sales of your offer through commercial marketplace will contribute towards customers’ Azure consumption commitments. Eligible customers will see the offer marked as **"Azure benefit eligible"** in Azure Portal. See [Azure consumption commitment benefit](azure-consumption-commitment-benefit.md) for more details.
* Offers that achieve **Azure IP Co-sell incentivized** or **Business Applications Co-sell incentivized** status will receive a **"Preferred solutions"** badge in the storefronts. The badge promotes an offer's quality, performance, and ability to address customer needs in a certain industry vertical or solution area. Learn more at [Preferred solutions in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace](preferred-solutions.md).
