# How to configure virtual machine offer listing details

On the **Offer listing** page (select from the left-nav menu in Partner Center), you define the offer details such as offer name, description, links, and contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> Your offer listing content, such as the description, documents, screenshots, and terms of use, doesn't have to be in English, as long as the offer description begins with the phrase, "This application is available only in \<non-English language>." You can also provide a web address to link to a site that offers content in a language other than the one that's used in the offer listing content.

## Marketplace details

### Name

The name that you enter here is shown to customers as the title of your offer listing. This field is auto-filled with the name that you entered in the **Offer alias** box when you created the offer. The name:

- Can't include emojis.

### Search results summary

Provide a short description of your offer to display in Azure Marketplace search results. It can contain up to 100 characters.
