# How to configure virtual machine offer listing details

On the **Offer listing** page, you define the offer details, such as offer name, description, links, and contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> Your offer listing content, such as the description, documents, screenshots, and terms of use, doesn't have to be in English, as long as the offer description begins with the phrase, "This application is available only in \<non-English language>." You can also provide a URL to link to a site that offers content in a language other than the one that's used in the offer listing content.

## Marketplace details

### Name

The name that you enter here is shown to customers as the title of your offer listing. This field is autofilled with the name that you entered in the **Offer alias** box when you created the offer. You can change this name later. The name:

- Can be trademarked. You can include trademark and copyright symbols.
- Can't contain more than 50 characters.
- Can't include emojis.

### Search results summary
