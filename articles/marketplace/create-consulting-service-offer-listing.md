# How to configure your consulting service offer listing details

The information you provide on the **Offer listing** page of Partner Center will be displayed in the Microsoft commercial marketplace online stores. This includes your offer name, description, media, and other marketing assets.

> [!NOTE]
> If you’ll deliver your service in a language other than English, the offer listing can be in that language, but the description must begin or end with the English phrase “This service is available in &lt;language of your offer content>”. You can also provide supporting documents in a language that's different from the one used in the offer listing details.

On the **Offer listing** page, provide the information described below. To learn more about the listing details for your consulting service offer, review [Offer listing details](./plan-consulting-service-offer.md#offer-listing-details).

## Offer details

1.	The **Name** box is pre-filled with the name you entered earlier in the **New offer** dialog box, but you can change it at any time. This name will appear as the title of your offer listing on the online store.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The offer name must be in the format *Name: Duration + type*. For more information, see [offer listing details](./plan-consulting-service-offer.md#offer-listing-details).

2. In the **Search results summary** box, describe the purpose or goal of your offer in 200 characters or less.
3. In the **Description** field, describe your consulting service offer. You can use HTML tags to format your description. You can enter up to 2,000 characters of text in this box, including HTML tags and spaces. For information about HTML formatting, see [HTML tags supported in the offer descriptions](./supported-html-tags.md).
4. You have the option to enter up to three **search keywords**. These keywords will help customers find your offer in the online store. You don't need to include the offer name and description.
5. Enter the expected duration of your consulting service in the **Duration** drop-down lists. The duration you select must match the duration you mentioned in the offer name.

## Contact information

Enter the name, email address, and phone number of two people in your company (you can be one of them). Microsoft will use this information to communicate with you about your offer. This information isn’t shown to customers but may be provided to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners.

## Supporting documents

Add at least one and up to three PDF documents to support your offer listing. After you’ve uploaded each file, provide a name for the document. This name will be displayed in your offer listing.

## Marketplace media

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an issue uploading files, make sure your local network does not block the `https://upload.xboxlive.com` service used by Partner Center.

### Add logos

Under **Logos**, upload a **Large** logo in PNG format between 216 x 216 and 350 x 350 pixels. Partner Center will automatically create a **Small** (48 x 48) logo, which you can replace later.

The two logo sizes are used in different places in the online stores:

* The **Large** logo appears on your offer listing page on Azure Marketplace or AppSource.
* The **Small** logo appears on Azure Marketplace search results or on the AppSource main page and search result pages.

### Add screenshots

Add at least one and up to five images that demonstrate your offer. All images must be 1280 x 720 pixels in size and in .PNG format.

1. Under **Screenshots**, drag and drop your .PNG file onto the **Screenshot** box.
2.	Next to **Add image caption**, select the **Edit** icon.
3.	In the dialog box that appears, enter a caption.
4.	Repeat steps 1 through 3 to add additional screenshots

### Add videos (optional)

You can add links to YouTube or Vimeo videos that demonstrate your offer. These videos are shown to customers along with your offer. You must enter a thumbnail image of the video, sized to 1280 x 720 pixels in size and in .PNG format. Add a maximum of four videos per offer.

1.	Under **Videos**, select the **Add video** link.
2.	In the boxes that appear, enter the name and link for your video.
3.	Drag and drop a .PNG file (1280 x 720 pixels) onto the gray Thumbnail box.
4.	To add another video, repeat steps 1 through 3.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab: **Pricing and availability**.
