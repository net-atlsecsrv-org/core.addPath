# Programmatic access paradigm

This diagram shows the API call pattern used to create a new report template, schedule the custom report, and retrieve failure data.

[![Illustrates the API call pattern used to create a new report template, schedule the custom report, and retrieve failure data.](./media/analytics-programmatic-access/analytics-high-level-flow.png)](./media/analytics-programmatic-access/analytics-high-level-flow.png#lightbox)
***Figure 1: High-level flow of the API call pattern***

This list provides more details about Figure 1.

1. The Client Application can define the custom report schema/template by calling the [Create Report Query API](#create-report-query-api). Alternately, you can use a report template (`QueryId`) from the [list of system queries](analytics-system-queries.md).
1. On success, the Create Report Template API returns the `QueryId`.
1. The client application then calls the [Create Report API](#create-report-api) using the `QueryID` along with the report start date, Repeat Interval, Recurrence, and an optional Callback URI.
1. On success, the [Create Report API](#create-report-api) returns the `ReportID`.
1. The client application gets notified at the callback URI as soon as the report data is ready for download.
1. The client application then uses the [Get Report Executions API](#get-report-executions-api) to query the status of the report with the `Report ID` and date range.
1. On success, the report download link is returned and the application can initiate download of the data.

## Report query language specification

While we provide [system queries](analytics-system-queries.md) you can use to create reports, you can also create your own queries based on your business needs. To learn more about custom queries, see [Custom query specification](analytics-custom-query-specification.md).

## Create report query API

This API helps to create custom queries that define the dataset from which columns and metrics need to be exported. The API provides the flexibility to create a new reporting template based on your business needs.

You can also use the [system queries](analytics-system-queries.md) we provide. When custom report templates are not needed, you can call the [Create Report API](#create-report-api) directly using the [QueryIds](analytics-system-queries.md) of the system queries we provide.

The following example shows how to create a custom query to get _Normalized Usage and Estimated Financial Charges for PAID SKUs_ from the [ISVUsage](analytics-make-your-first-api-call.md#programmatic-api-call) dataset for the last month.

## Create report API

On creating a custom report template successfully and receiving the `QueryID` as part of [Create Report Query](#create-report-query-api) response, this API can be called to schedule a query to be executed at regular intervals. You can set a frequency and schedule for the report to be delivered. For system queries we provide, the Create Report API can also be called with [QueryId](analytics-sample-queries.md).

## Get report executions API

You can use this method to query the status of a report execution using the `ReportId` received from the [Create Report API](#create-report-api). The method returns the report download link if the report is ready for download. Otherwise, the method returns the status. You can also use this API to get all the executions that have happened for a given report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API has default query parameters set for `executionStatus=Completed` and  `getLatestExecution=true`. Hence, calling the API before the first successful execution of the report will return 404. Pending executions can be obtained by setting `executionStatus=Pending`.

| Method | Request URI |

| `executionId` | No | string | Filter to get details of only reports with `executionId` given in this argument. Multiple `executionIds` can be specified by separating them with a semicolon ‚Äú;‚Äù. |

Multiple statuses can be specified by separating them with a semicolon ‚Äú;‚Äù. |
| `getLatestExecution` | No | boolean | The API will return details of the latest report execution.<br>By default, this parameter is set to `true`. If you choose to pass the value of this parameter as `false`, then the API will return the last 90 days execution instances. |
