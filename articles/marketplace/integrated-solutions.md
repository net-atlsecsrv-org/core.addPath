# Integrated Solutions in Azure Marketplace and AppSource

An Integrated Solution brings together best-of-breed technologies from Microsoft partners, along with consultation, deployment, and supports provided by expert Systems Integrators (SI).

These solutions are built to address a specific customer need or scenario, which begins with an understanding of the industry challenge or pain points. Two or more best-of-breed technologies are then integrated by an SI to create a unified and repeatable deployment experience for customers, to get them up and running rapidly. The systems integrator also provides a single point of contact for the customer, providing relevant customization and consulting, and support around the solution.  The outcome is an integrated solution, including technology and services.

## Advantages

Advantages of an integrated approach are:

* *Industry expertise*: Systems Integrators providing industry-specific solutions and knowledge
