# Configure a solution template plan

This article applies only to solution template plans for an Azure application offer. If you are configuring a managed application plan, go to [Configure a managed application plan](create-new-azure-apps-offer-managed.md).

## Choose who can see your plan

You can configure each plan to be visible to everyone or to only a specific audience. You grant access to a private audience using Azure subscription IDs with the option to include a description of each subscription ID you assign. You can add a maximum of 10 subscription IDs manually or up to 10,000 subscription IDs using a .CSV file. Azure subscription IDs are represented as GUIDs and letters must be lowercase.

> [!NOTE]
> If you publish a private plan, you can change its visibility to public later. However, once you publish a public plan, you cannot change its visibility to private.

On the **Availability** tab, under **Plan visibility**, do one of the following:

- To make the plan public, select the **Public** option button (also known as a _radio button_).
- To make the plan private, select the **Private** option button and then add the Azure subscription IDs manually or with a CSV file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A private or restricted audience is different from the preview audience you defined on the **Preview** tab. A preview audience can access your offer before its published live in the marketplace. While the private audience choice only applies to a specific plan, the preview audience can view all plans (private or not) for validation purposes.

### Manually add Azure subscription IDs for a private plan

1. Under **Plan visibility**, select the **Private** option button.
1. In the **Azure Subscription ID** box that appears, enter the Azure subscription ID of the audience you want to grant access to this private plan. A minimum of one subscription ID is required.
1. (Optional) Enter a description of this audience in the **Description** box.
1. To add another subscription ID, select the **Add ID (Max 10)** link and repeat steps 2 and 3.

## Use a .CSV file to add Azure subscription IDs for a private plan

1. Under **Plan visibility**, select the **Private** option button.
1. Select the **Export Audience (csv)** link.
1. Open the .CSV file and add the Azure subscription IDs you want to grant access to the private offer to the **ID** column.
1. Optionally, enter a description for each audience in the **Description** column.
1. Add "SubscriptionId" in the **Type** column, for each row with a subscription ID.
1. Save the .CSV file.
1. On the **Availability** tab, under **Plan visibility**, select the **Import Audience (csv)** link.
1. In the dialog box that appears, select **Yes**.
1. Select the .CSV file and then select **Open**. A message appears indicating that the .CSV file was successfully imported.

### Hide your plan

If your solution template is intended to be deployed only indirectly when referenced though another solution template or managed application, select the check box under **Hide plan** to publish your solution template but hide it from customers who search and browse for it directly.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next section: Define the technical configuration.

## Define the technical configuration

On the **Technical configuration** tab, you’ll upload the deployment package that lets customers deploy your plan and provide a version number for the package.

> [!NOTE]
> This tab won’t be visible if you chose to re-use packages from another plan on the **Plan setup** tab. If so, go to [View your plans](#view-your-plans).

### Assign a version number for the package

In the **Version** box provide the current version of the technical configuration. Increment this version each time you publish a change to this page. The version number must be in the format: integer.integer.integer. For example, `1.0.2`.

### Upload a package file

Under **Package file (.zip)**, drag your package file to the gray box or select the **browse for your file(s)** link.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an issue uploading files, make sure your local network does not block the `https://upload.xboxlive.com` service used by Partner Center.

### Previously published packages

After you publish your offer live, the **Previously published packages** sub-tab appears on the **Technical configuration** page. This tab lists all previously published versions of your technical configuration.

## View your plans

- Select **Save draft**, and then in the upper left of the page, select **Plan overview** to return to the **Plan overview** page.

After you create one or more plans, you'll see your plan name, plan ID, plan type, availability (Public or Private), current publishing status, and any available actions on the **Plan overview** tab.

The actions that are available in the **Action** column of the **Plan overview** tab vary depending on the status of your plan, and may include the following:

- If the plan status is **Draft**, the link in the **Action** column will say **Delete draft**.
- If the plan status is **Live**, the link in the **Action** column will be either **Stop selling plan** or **Sync private audience**. The **Sync private audience** link will publish only the changes to your private audiences, without publishing any other updates you might have made to the offer.
- To create another plan for this offer, at the top of the **Plan overview** tab, select **+ Create new plan**. Then repeat the steps in [How to create plans for your Azure application offer](create-new-azure-apps-offer-plans.md). Otherwise, if you're done creating plans, go to the next section: Next steps.
