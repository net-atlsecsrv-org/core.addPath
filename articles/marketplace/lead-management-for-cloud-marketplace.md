# Lead management for the commercial marketplace

Customers are the center of any good business. In the transformation of today's product acquisitions, marketers need to focus on connecting with customers directly and building a relationship. This is why generating high-quality leads is a vital tool for your sales cycle. After listing your offer in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/), there are tools enabled for you to programmatically receive customer contact information immediately after a customer expresses interest or deploys your product in the marketplace. 

## What are leads in the commercial marketplace?

The leads are from customers who are interested or deploying your products from the commercial marketplace. Once you connect your CRM with your listing(s) in Partner Center, you will be able to receive leads from Azure Marketplace and AppSource customers.

## How to connect your CRM system with Partner Center

The Lead Management connector in Partner Center is designed so that it can be easily plugged in with your CRM information to a list of CRM system available. Now you can easily leverage the leads generated by the marketplace without a significant engineering effort to integrate with an external system.

Here are step-by-step instructions on how to connect each of the possible lead destinations:

**Dynamics CRM Online** - See [configure lead management for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics.md) for instructions on how to configure Dynamics CRM Online for getting leads.

**Marketo** - See [configure lead management in Marketo](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo.md) for instructions on setting up Marketo Lead Configuration to get leads.

**Salesforce** - See [configure lead management for Salesforce](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-salesforce.md) for instructions on setting up your Salesforce instance to get leads.

**Azure Table** - See [configure lead management using an Azure Table](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md) for instructions on setting up your Azure storage account for getting leads in an Azure table.

**Https Endpoint** - See [configure lead management using an HTTPS endpoint](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https.md) for instructions on setting up your Https Endpoint to get leads.

Once you have configured your lead destination properly and request to publish your offer, we will validate the connection and send you a test lead. When you are viewing the offer before you go live, you can also test your lead connection by trying to acquire the offer yourself in the preview environment. It's important to make sure that your lead settings stay up-to-date so that you don't lose any leads, so make sure you update these connections whenever something has changed on your end.

### What are the next steps?

Once the technical setup is in place, you should incorporate these leads into your current sales & marketing strategy and operational processes. We are interested in understanding your overall sales process and want to work closely with you on providing high-quality leads and enough data to make you successful. We welcome your feedback on how we can optimize and enhance the leads we send you with additional data to help make these customers successful. Let us know if you're interested in providing feedback and suggestions to enable your sales team to be more successful with commercial marketplace leads.

## Frequently asked questions

**What are leads and why are they important to me as a publisher on Marketplace?** 

Leads are customers who are deploying your products from the Marketplace. Whether your product is listed on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you will be able to receive leads of customers who are interested in your product if you have setup the lead destination on your offer.  

**Where can I get help in setting up my lead destination?** 

You can find documentation at [Get customer leads](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md) or submit a support ticket at [Help and support](https://aka.ms/marketplacepublishersupport). Select offer type and lead management. 

**Am I required to configure a lead destination in order to publish an offer on Marketplace?**

Yes, if you are publishing a Contact Me SaaS app, or Consulting Services.  

**How can I confirm that the lead configuration is correct?**

After setting up your offer, and lead destination, publish your offer. On lead validation step, Marketplace will send a test lead to the lead destination configured in your offer.

**I have configured Azure BLOB as my lead destination, why don't I see the lead?** 

The lead only gets written when you select Azure BLOB storage as your lead destination. Switch to Azure table to receive the lead real time.

**I received an email from Marketplace, why can't I find the lead in my CRM?**  

It's possible that the end user's email domain is from .edu. For privacy reasons, we don't pass personal identifiable data from .edu domain. Submit a support ticket at [Help and support](https://aka.ms/marketplacepublishersupport).

**I have configured Azure Table/Azure BLOB as my lead destination, how can I view the leads?** 

You can access the blob or table from Azure portal, or you can download and install [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) for free to view your Azure storage account's tables/blobs. 

**I have configured Azure Table as my lead destination, can I get notified whenever a new lead is sent by Marketplace?** 

Yes, follow the instructions to set up Azure Table + Function on the documentation [here](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md). 

**I have configured Salesforce as my lead destination, why can't I find the leads?**

Check if the web to lead form is a mandatory field based on a picklist. If yes, switch over the field to a non-mandatory text field.  
 
**There was an issue with my lead destination, and I missed some leads. Can I have them sent to me in an email?** 

Due to privacy policies, we cannot share lead information through unsecured email. 

**I have configured Azure Storage (BLOB/Table) as my lead destination, how much will it cost?** 

Lead generation data is low (<1 GB for almost all publishers). The cost will depend on number of leads received, if 1,000 leads are received in a month, it costs around 50 cents.
