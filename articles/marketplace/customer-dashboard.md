## Elements of the Customers dashboard

The following sections describe how to use the Customers dashboard and how to read the data.

### Month range

You can find a month range selection at the top-right corner of each page. Customize the output of the **Customers** page graphs by selecting a month range based on the past 6, or 12 months, or by selecting a custom month range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default month range (computation period) is six months.

> [!NOTE]
> All metrics in the visualization widgets and export reports honor the computation period selected by the user.

### Active and churned customers’ trend

In this section, you will find your customers growth trend for the selected computation period. Metrics and growth trends are represented by a line chart and displays the value for each month by hovering over the line on the chart. The percentage value below **Active customers** in the widget represents the amount of growth during the selected computation period. For example, the following screenshot shows a growth of 0.92% for the selected computation period.

There are three _customer types_: new, existing, and churned.

- A new customer has acquired one or more of your offers for the first time within the selected month.
- An existing customer has acquired one or more of your offers prior to the month selected.
- A churned customer has canceled all offers previously purchased. Churned customers are represented in the negative axis in the Trend widget.

### Customer growth trend including existing, new, and churned customers

In this section, you will find trend and count of all customers, including new, existing, and churned, with a month-by-month growth trend.

- The line chart represents the overall customer growth percentages.
- The month column represents the count of customers stacked by new, existing, and churned customers.
- The churned customer count is displayed on the negative direction of the X-Axis.
- You can select specific legend items to display more detailed views. For example, select new customers from the legend to display only new customers.
- Hovering over a column in the chart displays details for that month only.
