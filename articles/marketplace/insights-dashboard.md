# Marketplace Insights dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics

This article provides information on the Marketplace Insights dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays a summary of commercial marketplace web analytics that enables publishers to measure customer engagement for their respective product detail pages listed in the commercial marketplace online stores: Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace.

To access the **Marketplace Insights** dashboard in Partner Center, under Commercial Marketplace, select **[Analyze](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary)** > **Marketplace Insights**.

For detailed definitions of analytics terminology, see [Commercial marketplace analytics terminology and common questions](./partner-center-portal/faq-terminology.md).

## Marketplace Insights dashboard

The Marketplace Insights dashboard presents an overview of the Azure Marketplace and AppSource offers’ business performance. This dashboard provides a broad overview of the following:

- Page visits trend
- Call to actions trend
- Page visits and Call to actions against offers, referral domains, and campaign ids
- Marketplace Insights by geography
- Marketplace Insights details table

The Marketplace Insights dashboard provides clickstream data, which shouldn't be correlated with leads generated in the lead destination endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum latency between users visiting offers on Azure Marketplace or AppSource and reporting in Partner Center is 48 hours.

## Elements of the Marketplace Insights dashboard

The Marketplace Insights dashboard displays web telemetry details for Azure Marketplace and AppSource in two separate tabs. The following sections describe how to use the Marketplace Insights dashboard and how to read the data.

### Month range

You can find a month range selection at the top-right corner of each page. Customize the output of the **Marketplace Insights** page graphs by selecting a month range based on the past 6, or 12 months, or by selecting a custom month range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default month range (computation period) is six months.

> [!NOTE]
> All metrics in the visualization widgets and export reports honor the computation period selected by the user.

### Page visits trends

The Marketplace Insights **Visitors** chart displays a count of _Page visits_ and _Unique visitors_ for the selected computation period.

**Page visits**: This number represents the count of distinct user sessions on the offer listing page (product detail page) for a selected computation period. The red and green percentage indicators represent the growth percentage of page visits. The trend chart represents the month-to-month count of page visits.

**Unique visitors**: This number represents the distinct visitor count during the selected computation period for the offer(s) in Azure Marketplace and AppSource. A visitor who has visited one or more product detail pages will be counted as one unique visitor.

### Call to actions trend

This number represents the count of **Call to Action** button clicks completed on the offer listing page (product detail page). _Calls to action_ are counted when users select the **Get It Now**, **Free Trial**, **Contact Me**, or **Test Drive** buttons.
