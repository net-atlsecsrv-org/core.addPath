# Comparing AppSource and the Azure Marketplace
Storefronts in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) serve unique customer requirements. Use storefronts to target customers by role. You can offer the right solution or service based on your customer.

## Understanding the differences between storefronts
To choose a storefront, begin by identifying the target audience for your offer. If you're targeting audiences in multiple storefronts, you can publish once to sell in multiple storefronts.

| Azure Marketplace | AppSource |
|:--- |:--- |
| IT Professionals and Developers | Business Users and Business Decision Makers |
 
The following table describes the benefits of using a storefront:

| Benefits | AppSource | Azure Marketplace |
|:--- |:--- | :--- |
| **Billing flexibility** | Provisions a trial experience. Currently, doesn't offer a commerce-enabled publishing option. You can use your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes. | For VMs, Pay-As-You-Go billing options use Microsoft Enterprise Agreements (EAs) or web direct sales models. Pricing options include a Free Tier subscription, in which an offering is perpetually free. Pricing options also include a Try It Now subscription. A Try It Now subscription is promotionally free for a limited period. When the period ends, the VM is converted to a paid subscription. Bring Your Own License (BYOL) activation is also an option that you can use for customers.<br /><br/>For both billing options and the following VM offers, all provisioned Azure resources are billed directly to the customer:<ul> <li>Azure apps: Managed app</li> <li>Azure apps: Solution template</li> </ul> |
| **Connections with other partners** | Links independent software vendors, system integrators, and managed service providers to specific implementation scenarios. You can collaboratively sell to new customers. | Currently, you can't link a service provider or delivery partners to your offer. | 
| **Automation** | Links independent software vendors, system integrators, and managed service providers to specific implementation scenarios. You can collaboratively sell to new customers. | Currently, you can't link a service provider or delivery partners to your offer. Take advantage of automated software as a service (SaaS) with add-on provisioning. Use the Azure apps: Solution template publishing option to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios. |
| **Multiple cloud types** | Currently, doesn't support Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds. | Publish solutions for both the public cloud and on-premises by using the following types:<ul> <li>Azure Stack</li> <li>Azure Government</li> <li>Regional clouds, including China and Germany</li></ul> |
| **In-context presentation to customers** | Reach more customers through the in-app experience for Microsoft products such as Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Office 365. | Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search. Use the Virtual machine and Azure apps: Solution template publishing options. |
