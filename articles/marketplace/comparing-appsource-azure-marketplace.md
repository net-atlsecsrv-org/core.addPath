# Comparing AppSource and the Azure Marketplace
Storefronts in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) serve unique customer requirements. Use storefronts to target customers by role. You can offer the right solution or service based on your customer.

## Understanding the differences between storefronts
To choose a storefront, begin by identifying the target audience for your offer. If you're targeting audiences in multiple storefronts, you can publish once to sell in multiple storefronts.

The following table describes the benefits of using a storefront:

| Benefits | AppSource | Azure Marketplace |
|:--- |:--- | :--- |
| **Billing flexibility** | AppSource supports free, trial, BYOL, and transactable offer types. Transactable offers are subscription-based SaaS products that can be billing monthly or annually on a per seat or flat rate.| Azure Marketplace supports free, trial, BYOL, and transactable offer types. Transactable offers are either consumption-based or subscription-based. Consumption-based offers are billed by hourly usage and can provide an initial free period. Subscription-based services are billed monthly or annually on a per-seat or flat rate.|

| **In-context presentation to customers** | Reach more customers through the in-app experience for Microsoft products such as Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Office 365. | Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search. Use the Virtual machine and Azure apps: Solution template publishing options. |
