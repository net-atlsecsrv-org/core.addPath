## Publishing Process
Listing your consulting-service offer on the Azure Marketplace and AppSource
 involves the following stages:

1. **Listing**: Start drafting a new offer listing by logging in to your [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) account. Select 'New Offer' and 'Consulting Services' from the drop-down menu. Enter your listing artifact and publish.
2. **Validation**: Your request is reviewed to ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria. We then send you instructions for listing your consulting services offering. 
3. **Submit**: Provide the required information that's listed in the instructions. All content and supporting material must be submitted in English. 
4. **Review**: Our marketing and editorial team reviews your submission and optimizes it for readability, grammar, and effectiveness. 
5. **Staging**: Your submission is staged for your review. 
6. **Publishing**: When you and Microsoft are satisfied with the staged content, your listing is ready to go live on the marketplace. The go-live date for your listing depends on the country/region that's specified in your offering. If the catalog for your selected country/region is already live on the Azure Marketplace or AppSource, your listing will appear within a few hours. Otherwise, the listing will appear as soon as the catalog goes live.

## Offer Listings and Content Review Criteria
Offerings must be of one of the following five service types (you can list more than one): 

* **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer's environment to determine the applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of cost and timing. 
* **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a consulting service to draw customer interest by using frameworks, demos, and customer examples. 
* **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution. We recommend limiting it to solutions that can be implemented in two weeks or less. 
* **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets customer requirements. 
* **Workshop**: An interactive engagement that's conducted on a customer's premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos that are built on the customer's data or environment. 

**Note:** Except for the *Briefing* service type, consulting services can be offered in person (that is, onsite at a customer's location or a partner's facility) or virtually (that is, via teleconferencing, web conferencing, or remote implementation). Briefings must be offered in person.

Once you have configured the required elements listed above, the content review team will validate that your offer description is informative and complete for your target audience. 

#### Listing Title

The title field has a 50-character limit and must transmit the duration and service type of the offer to maximize search engine optimization. The required format is as follows: NAME: DURATION TYPE

Within Cloud Partner Portal, you can add formatting to your listing by using [Markdown](/contribute/markdown-reference). This is a lightweight design language that will help add polish to your listing.
