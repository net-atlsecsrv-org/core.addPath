# Publishing guide for container offers

Container offers help you publish your container image to Azure Marketplace. Use this guide to understand the requirements for this offer. 

Container offers are transaction offers that are deployed and billed through Azure Marketplace. The listing option that a user sees is "Get It Now."

Use the *Container* offer type when your solution is a Docker container image that's set up as a Kubernetes-based Azure container service instance. 

> [!NOTE]
> Examples of Kubernetes-based Azure container service instances are Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Instances, the choice of Azure customers for a Kubernetes-based container runtime.  

Microsoft currently supports free and bring-your-own-license (BYOL) licensing models.
