# How to create a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offer

This article describes how to create a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offer. All offers for Dynamics 365 go through our certification process. The trial experience allows users to deploy your solution to a live Dynamics 365 environment.

Before you start, create a commercial marketplace account in [Partner Center](partner-center-portal/create-account.md) and ensure it is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Before you begin

Review [Plan a Dynamics 365 offer](marketplace-dynamics-365.md). It will explain the technical requirements for this offer and list the information and assets you’ll need when you create it.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-nav menu, select **Commercial Marketplace** > **Overview**.
3. On the Overview page, select **+ New offer** > **Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & Power Apps**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dynamics-365/new-offer-dynamics-365-customer-engagement.png" alt-text="Shows the left pane menu options and the 'New offer' button with Customer Engagement select.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After an offer is published, any edits you make to it in Partner Center appear on Microsoft AppSource only after you republish the offer. Be sure to always republish an offer after changing it.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the offer and in Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. The ID can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if your Publisher ID is `testpublisherid` and you enter **test-offer-1**, the offer web address will be `https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/testpublisherid.test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used on AppSource. It is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.
- This name can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Select **Create** to generate the offer. Partner Center opens the **Offer setup** page.

## Alias

Enter a descriptive name that we'll use to refer to this offer solely within Partner Center. The offer alias (pre-populated with what you entered when you created the offer) won't be used in the marketplace and is different than the offer name shown to customers. If you want to update the offer name later, see the [Offer listing](dynamics-365-customer-engage-offer-listing.md) page.

## Setup details

For **How do you want potential customers to interact with this listing offer?**, select the option you want to use for this offer:

- **Enable app license management through Microsoft** – Manage your app licenses through Microsoft. To let customers run your app’s base functionality without a license and run premium features after they’ve purchased a license, select the **Allow customers to install my app even if licenses are not assigned box**. If you select this second box, you need to configure your solution package to not require a license.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot change this setting after you publish your offer. To learn more about this setting, see [Third-party app license management through Microsoft](third-party-license.md).

- **Get it now (free)** – List your offer to customers for free.
- **Free trial (listing)** – List your offer to customers with a link to a free trial. Offer listing free trials are created, managed, and configured by your service and do not have subscriptions managed by Microsoft.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The tokens your application will receive through your trial link can only be used to obtain user information through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to automate account creation in your app. Microsoft accounts are not supported for authentication using this token.

- **Contact me** – Collect customer contact information by connecting your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The customer will be asked for permission to share their information. These customer details, along with the offer name, ID, and marketplace source where they found your offer, will be sent to the CRM system that you've configured. For more information about configuring your CRM, see [Customer leads](#customer-leads).

## Test drive

A test drive is a great way to showcase your offer to potential customers by giving them access to a preconfigured environment for a fixed number of hours. Offering a test drive results in an increased conversion rate and generates highly qualified leads. To learn more, start with [What is a test drive?](what-is-test-drive.md).

> [!TIP]
> A test drive is different from a free trial. You can offer either a test drive, free trial, or both. They both provide customers with your solution for a fixed period-of-time. But, a test drive also includes a hands-on, self-guided tour of your product’s key features and benefits being demonstrated in a real-world implementation scenario.

To enable a test drive, select the **Enable a test drive** check box and select the **Type of test drive**. You will configure the test drive later. With test drive, you must also configure your offer to a CRM system for customer leads (see next section). To remove test drive from your offer, clear this check box.

## Customer leads

[!INCLUDE [Connect lead management](partner-center-portal/includes/connect-lead-management.md)]

For more information, see [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Properties**.
