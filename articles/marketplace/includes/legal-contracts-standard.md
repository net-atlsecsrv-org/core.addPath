To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a standard contract you can use for your offers in the commercial marketplace. When you offer your software under the standard contract, customers only need to read and accept it one time, and you don't have to create custom terms and conditions.

1. Select the **Use the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace** check box.

1. In the **Confirmation** dialog box, select **Accept**. Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to scroll up to see it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After you publish an offer using the Standard Contract for the commercial marketplace, you can't use your own custom terms and conditions. Either offer your solution under the standard contract or under your own terms and conditions.
