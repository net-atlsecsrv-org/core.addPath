You can enable a test drive that gives customers access to your offer in a preconfigured environment for a fixed number of hours. You can enable test drives for any publishing option, however, this feature has additional requirements. To learn more about test drives, see [What is a test drive?](../what-is-test-drive.md) For information about configuring different kinds of test drives, see [Test drive technical configuration](../test-drive-technical-configuration.md).

> [!TIP]
> A test drive is different from a [free trial](../plans-pricing.md#free-trials). You can offer a test drive, free trial, or both. They both provide your customers with your solution for a fixed period-of-time. But, a test drive also includes a hands-on, self-guided tour of your productâ€™s key features and benefits being demonstrated in a real-world implementation scenario.
