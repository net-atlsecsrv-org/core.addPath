You can choose to provide your own terms and conditions, instead of the standard contract. Customers must accept these terms before they can try your offer.

1. Under **Legal**, clear the **Use the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace** check box.
1. In the **Terms and conditions** box, enter up to 10,000 characters of text.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you require a longer description, enter a single web address that points to where your terms and conditions can be found. It will be displayed to customers as an active link.
