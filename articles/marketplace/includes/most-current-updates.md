The base images of operating system VMs must contain the latest updates up to their published date. Before publishing, ensure you updated the OS and all installed services with all the latest security and maintenance patches.

- For Windows Server, run the Check for Updates command.
- For Linux distributions, updates are commonly downloaded and installed through a command-line tool or a graphical utility. For example, Ubuntu Linux provides the [apt-get](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man8/apt-get.8.html) command and the [Update Manager](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man8/update-manager.8.html) tool for updating the OS.
