Follow these guidelines for your logos:

- The Azure design has a simple color palette. Limit the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo.
- The theme colors of the portal are white and black. Don't use these colors as the background color for your logo. Use a color that makes your logo prominent in the portal. We recommend simple primary colors.
- If you use a transparent background, make sure that the logo and text aren't white, black, or blue.
- The look and feel of your logo should be flat and avoid gradients in the logo or background.
Don't place text on the logo, not even your company or brand name.
- Make sure the logo isn't stretched.
