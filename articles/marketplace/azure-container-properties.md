# Configure Azure Container offer properties

This page lets you define the categories used to group your offer on Azure Marketplace, your application version, and the legal contracts that support your offer.

## Categories

Select categories and subcategories to place your offer in the appropriate marketplace search areas. Be sure to describe later in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

- Select a Primary category.
- To add a second optional category (Secondary), select the **+Categories** link.
- Select up to two subcategories for the Primary and/or Secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**. Use Ctrl+click to select a second subcategory.

See the full list of categories and subcategories in [Offer Listing Best Practices](gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md).

### Legal

<!-- Don't use [!INCLUDE [Legal contracts section](includes/legal-contracts-intro.md)] because amendments are not applicable to containers. -->
Under **Legal**, provide terms and conditions for your offer. You have two options:

- [Use the standard contract](#use-the-standard-contract)
- [Use your own terms and conditions](#use-your-own-terms-and-conditions)

To learn about the standard contract, see [Standard Contract for the Microsoft commercial marketplace](standard-contract.md). You can download the [Standard Contract](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178) PDF (make sure your pop-up blocker is off).

#### Use the standard contract

[!INCLUDE [Legal contracts section](includes/legal-contracts-standard.md)]

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.

#### Use your own terms and conditions

[!INCLUDE [Legal contracts section](includes/legal-contracts-custom.md)]

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.
