# How to configure your consulting service pricing and availability

This article explains how to define the market and pricing details for your consulting service offer in the Microsoft commercial marketplace.

> [!NOTE]
> Consulting service offers are listing-only. Any transactions must be managed between you and your customers outside of the commercial marketplace.

## Markets

In the **Markets** drop-down list, select the country or region where your consulting service will be available.

For the United States or Canada, select **Edit states** or **Edit provinces** to specify the states, provinces, and territories you want to provide your services in.

## Preview audience

When you publish or update your consulting service offer, Partner Center creates a preview version of the listing. This preview is visible only to users that have a **hide key**.

In the **Hide Key** field, enter an alphanumeric string that youâ€™ll use to access the preview version of your offer.

## Pricing (informational only)

In the **Pricing** section, you define whether this is a free or paid offer. For paid offers, specify the currency and whether the price is fixed or estimated. If the price is estimated, your offer description must describe what factors will affect the price.

For information on what currencies are supported for each country or region, see [Geographic availability and currency support for the commercial marketplace](./marketplace-geo-availability-currencies.md).

Select **Save draft** before continuing.
