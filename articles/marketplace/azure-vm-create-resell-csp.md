# How to resell your offer through CSP

## Resell through CSP

On the **Resell through CSPs** page (select from the left-nav menu in Partner Center) you can expand the reach of your offer by making it available to partners in the [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0145p/) program. This allows resellers to sell your offer to their customers and create bundled solutions. All Bring-your-own-license (BYOL) plans are automatically opted in to the program. You can also choose to opt in your non-BYOL plans.

Select which partners should be able to resell your offer:

- Any partner in the CSP program
- Specific partners in the CSP program I select
- No partners in the CSP program

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Test drive**.

## Next steps

- [Configure a test drive](azure-resource-manager-test-drive.md)
- After setting up a test drive (optional), [review and publish your offer](review-publish-offer.md)
