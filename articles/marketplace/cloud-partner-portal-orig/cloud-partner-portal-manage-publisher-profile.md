# Manage 'Azure Marketplace' and 'AppSource' publisher profile

This document is a walk-through on viewing and managing users to your
registered publisher profile.

By this time, you've completed the steps to become an Azure
Marketplace and AppSource publisher. The publisher profile is registered
on the **[Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/)**
following approval of your partner request. Your publisher profile will
apply to all the offers and SKUs published from the account used during
partner registration.

If you haven't registered your company as a cloud partner, see [Get started with the cloud partner portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-getting-started-with-the-cloud-partner-portal).

**Publisher Profile**: Your publisher profile distinguishes your company
on the Azure Marketplace and AppSource. It consists of your publisher
ID, display name, and owner email(s). A well-managed profile will
increase your visibility and help marketplace users easily identify and
select an appropriate offer.

> [!NOTE]
> Your publisher ID and registered owner email isn't editable once you publish your first offer. However you can view your profile and edit the publisher display name from the Cloud Partner Portal.

<!-- Dummy comment added to suppress MD linter warning -->

> [!NOTE]
> Add users (contributors and owners) to your publishing profile from the Users section on the left navigation pane from the Users Section of the cloud partner portal`

**To view and manage your publisher profile**, from the top-right menu
bar, click the **Publisher profile tab**.

**Link your Dev Center Account**: You can also link your existing Dev
Center account with your publisher profile on the Cloud Partner Portal.
First sign in to the portal with the same email address used to register
your Dev Center account. Then your publisher profile page displays your Dev Center account status, Dev Center account owner email, and Dev Center account name.

>[!NOTE]
>Dev Center Account registration is mandatory for publishing paid market place SKUs.

If you don't have a [Developer Center Account](./cloud-partner-portal-dev-center-accounts-registration.md),
you can create an account. Then add the registered email address as an
owner on the Cloud Partner Portal for your offer. An owner can only add
the registered email address to your publishing profile from the
**User** section. Then, sign in to the portal using the same email
address, and link your Dev Center account.
