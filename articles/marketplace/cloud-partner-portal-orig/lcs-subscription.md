In this tutorial, you will learn how create a subscription. This subscription will give you a Microsoft Online test tenant and a Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services project where you can deploy an
environment. You will also set up additional users in your Microsoft Online tenant and gain experience with the following service administration capabilities. Here are the skills that you will learn:

- Subscribing and creating a new Microsoft Online test tenant.
- Navigating to Lifecycle Services projects.
- Using features on Lifecycle Services.
- Adding additional users to Microsoft Azure Active Directory and the client.
- Viewing resources in your subscription email.

## Key terms

**Microsoft Online Services tenant** - A tenant is the group of all subscriptions and users for your organization. The tenant is created at the same time as your first subscription in Microsoft Online Services.

**Subscription** - A subscription provides you with an online environment. This environment lets you experience Dynamics 365 for Operations in the cloud and also lets you see how customizations that
you develop can be deployed to the cloud.

**Microsoft Azure Active Directory** - The cloud environment includes Azure Active Directory (AD), which helps you manage users, groups, security roles, and licenses for online applications, similarly to the
way that you manage them for on-premises environments.

**Users** - Users of the services that your organization has subscribed to are managed in Azure AD. Any users in your tenant can be added and assigned to security roles.

**Developers and administrators** - Developers and administrators are users who also have access to Lifecycle Services that lets them manage projects and environments. These users are also end users.
