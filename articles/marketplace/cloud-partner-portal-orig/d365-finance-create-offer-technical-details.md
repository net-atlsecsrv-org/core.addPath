# How to fill out the Technical Info form

The [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of Dynamics 365 Business Central offers. Instead, this functionality has been moved to the Microsoft [Partner Center portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/). For more information, see [Create a new Dynamics 365 Business Central offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-business-central-offer).

## Next steps

Before you create a new Dynamics 365 Business Central offer, you should read [Create a Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) and then open the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/directory) with the **Overview** page selected. Follow the instructions in [Create a new Dynamics 365 Business Central offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-business-central-offer) to create your offer.
