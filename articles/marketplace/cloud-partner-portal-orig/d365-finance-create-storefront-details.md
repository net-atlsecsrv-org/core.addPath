How to fill out the Storefront Details form
===========================================

Simply listing your app's features and functionality will not convert
prospects to buyers. For more information about how to best market your
app in the AppSource marketplace, see the white paper 
[Developing Apps for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=841518).  


### Offer Summary

This summary will appear on AppSource, as a summary in the overview of
apps, as well as on the app detail page just below your app name and the
publisher name. We recommend you to create curiosity and a positive
mental acknowledgement by asking prospects a question they either do not
know the answer to or can relate to. The question should stimulate a
strong emotional response. Speak to a core pain they are likely
experiencing that has a negative measurable impact. It should be a
maximum of 100 characters.

### Offer Description

This description will appear on AppSource, just below your
**Offer Summary**. When describing your solution, do not focus on the
underlying technology or operational features. Prospects can learn about
the details later. Your primary objective is conversion, which means
motivating prospects into action. The optimal approach is to remind them
of the pain they are likely experiencing and reference the benefits they
will experience once they start using your solution. Clearly articulate
a compelling desired outcome and result. We recommend you to add a link
to your app landing page at the end of your description. Maximum allowed
is 1300 characters

### Industries

Select the industry that your app is best aligned to. If your app
relates to multiple industries, you can leave this blank

### Categories

Select the categories that are relevant to your app. Select at
least one category and a maximum of three. Choose carefully
because customers can search on AppSource based on the categories

### App type

Select the type of trial that your app will enable on AppSource.
**Free** means your app is free. **Trial** means customers can try your
app for a short period on AppSource. **Request for trial** means
customers can request a trial of the app from AppSource.

### Help link for your app

There must be an active help link that guides customers to online
product help related to your app. It is best practice to include
instructions about set up, links to existing videos and documentation,
and to the most frequently asked questions.

### Supported countries/regions

This field determines the countries/regions in which your offer will be
available for trial. You can only choose countries/regions where Microsoft
Dynamics 365 Business Central is already available or in preview. For the current list, see
[Countries/Regions and Translations Supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics-nav/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).
