# Prerequisites for Application Curation

Microsoft requires specific reviews in order to validate that the
following requirements are met:

- A partner\'s custom code meets Microsoft guidelines.
- A Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution package can be successfully deployed.
- Transactions can be completed.

Currently, partners must demonstrate that these requirements have been met by doing test deployments and then sharing the results with
Microsoft. No code will be deployed on a customer environment that Microsoft hasn\'t validated. Partners must complete the following
curation artifacts and tests:

- Code analysis report (CAR)
- Business process modeler (BPM)/test scripts
- Project name and description
- Business database backup
- Data packages and Process data packages (PDPs)
- Methodology
- Binaries (optional)
- Deployable packages
- Models (code and tests)
- Marketing content

For more information on technical and process requirements, see [Validate applications for Finance and Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lcs-solutions/app-validation-lcs-solutions).  Also, if you have not already done so, review the [Office 365, Dynamics 365, PowerApps, and Power BI Offer Publishing Guide](../appsource-offer-publishing-guide.md).
