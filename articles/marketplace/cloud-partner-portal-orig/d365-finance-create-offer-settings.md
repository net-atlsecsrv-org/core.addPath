How to fill out the Offer Settings form
=======================================

The offer settings form is a basic form to specify the offer settings.
The required fields are described below.

### Offer ID

`OfferId` is a unique identifier for the offer within a publisher profile.
This ID will be visible in product URLs. It can only be composed of
lowercase alphanumeric characters or dashes (-). The ID cannot end in a
dash and can have a maximum of 50 characters. This field is
locked once an offer goes live.

If, for example,  the partner "Contoso" creates an offer ID called
"sample-Web App", it will show up in AppSource as:

&emsp; `https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/contoso.sample-Web App?tab=Overview`


### Publisher ID

This dropdown allows you to choose the publisher profile you want to
publish this offer under. This field is locked once an offer
goes live.


### Name

This is the display name for your app/offer, which will
be displayed in Microsoft [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). It can have a
maximum of 50 characters.

> [!NOTE]
> The short name must be the same as the publisher name specified in the app manifest.

Click on **Save** to save your progress. Next step would be to add
technical information for your offer.
