* Url of your package location: This is the URL to the Azure Storage account that contains the package file name specified above. It is the URL created in Step 9 of the section above.
* Is there more than one crm package in your package file: Select Yes **ONLY** if you are supporting multiple versions of crm with different packages. For most partners this will be "No". If you select Yes, you need to create AppSource Packages for each version of your solution. _Note: This is NOT asking if you have multiple **zip** files.
