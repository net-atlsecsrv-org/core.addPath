# Cancel operation 

This API cancels an operation currently in progress on the offer. Use the [Retrieve operations
API](./cloud-partner-portal-api-retrieve-operations.md) to get an
`operationId` to pass to this API. Cancellation is usually a synchronous
operation, however in some complex scenarios a new operation may be
required to cancel an existing one. In this case, the HTTP response body
contains the operation's location that should be used to query status.

You can provide a comma-separated list of email addresses with the
request, and the API will notify these addresses about the progress of
the operation.

  `POST https://cloudpartner.azure.com/api/publishers/<publisherId>/offers/<offerId>/cancel?api-version=2017-10-31`
