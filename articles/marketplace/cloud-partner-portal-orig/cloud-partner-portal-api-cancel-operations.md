# Cancel operation

> [!NOTE]
> The Cloud Partner Portal APIs are integrated with Partner Center and will continue to work after your offers are migrated to Partner Center. The integration introduces small changes. Review the changes listed in [Cloud Partner Portal API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-api-overview) to ensure your code continues to work after the migration to Partner Center.

This API cancels an operation currently in progress on the offer. Use the [Retrieve operations
API](./cloud-partner-portal-api-retrieve-operations.md) to get an
`operationId` to pass to this API. Cancellation is usually a synchronous
operation, however in some complex scenarios a new operation may be
required to cancel an existing one. In this case, the HTTP response body
contains the operation's location that should be used to query status.

  `POST https://cloudpartner.azure.com/api/publishers/<publisherId>/offers/<offerId>/cancel?api-version=2017-10-31`
