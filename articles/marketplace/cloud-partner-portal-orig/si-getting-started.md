Getting Started with Seller Insights
====================================

This article discusses the Seller Insights feature available to you within the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights).


Insights Tour
-------------

The Cloud Partner Portal offers you insights related to your Azure and VS
Marketplace customers and usage. Here's a quick overview of the various data and
insights that you will likely interact with the most.

Top Navigation Bar
------------------

After you select **Insights** from the left menubar, you will see a
navigation bar across the top indicating which insights modules you have access
to.

1.  **Summary** - This tab shows graphs, trends, and values of the data that is most
    sought after by publishers.

2.  **Payout** - This tab shows information on payouts and related transactions in
    graphs and downloadable formats.

3.  **Orders & Usage** - This tab shows orders and usage information in graphs and
    downloadable formats.

4.  **Customer** - This tab shows information about your customers and their purchases.

5.  **Deployment** - This tab shows deployment success and failure information in
    both graphs and event level formats.

6.  **Downloads** - Downloading big data sets is easier and less disruptive with a
    new download experience.

You may find that you can only see a limited set of the modules listed above.
Only users with *Owner* permissions can see the **Payout** and **Customer** modules
due to sensitive customer and company information. Work with an Owner role
inside of your organization to change your permissions if you need access to
these modules.


Tips:
-----

-   Be sure to adjust the dates to view the information you are most interested in.
-   Download the transaction level data to perform additional analysis on the
    information provided by Seller Insights.
-   If you are looking for payout or customer information, make sure you are
    logged in as an Owner role and not a Contributor role. To learn more about user
    permissions, see [Manage users](./cloud-partner-portal-manage-users.md).
