Retrieve offers
===============

> [!NOTE]
> The Cloud Partner Portal APIs are integrated with Partner Center and will continue to work after your offers are migrated to Partner Center. The integration introduces small changes. Review the changes listed in [Cloud Partner Portal API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-api-overview) to ensure your code continues to work after the migration to Partner Center.
