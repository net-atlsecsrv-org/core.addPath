Managing users on cloud partner portal
======================================

The Cloud Partner Portal allows you to add users with role-based access to virtual machine offers. It helps to manage access and
permissions while multiple people are working on offers.

To **add users and assign roles** for offer publishing, follow the steps
below:

Step 1. To add users and assign roles, click the Users tab on the left side navigation pane.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3. Type email address and select a role assignment.
--------------------------------------------------------

You can add the new user as an 'owner' or 'contributor'.

**Email**: Add the email addresses of teammates who will be working on
publishing the offer. Microsoft accounts (Outlook, Hotmail, and Live)
and Org IDs are supported.

o Add a 'team/group email alias/security group' in case the individual
working on the offer leaves the organization.

o Ensure that email IDs provided on the Cloud Partner Portal are
monitored for any communication from Microsoft.

**Role**: Refer to the table below to identify the appropriate user role
type.

Currently, only owners can access the Azure Payouts and Azure Customer tabs in Insights.

Step 4. Select the Publisher Name you want to add to the new user then click Add to complete user addition.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> [!NOTE]
> The 'publisher names' for which your email is added as an owner or contributor will show up in the drop-down list of Publisher for selection.`

If you need to remove a user that has been added, all you need to do is
search for their email on the Users tab, and then press the delete
button on the right-hand side.
