# Go Live

> [!NOTE]
> The Cloud Partner Portal APIs are integrated with and will continue working in Partner Center. The transition introduces small changes. Review the changes listed in [Cloud Partner Portal API Reference](./cloud-partner-portal-api-overview.md) to ensure your code continues working after transitioning to Partner Center. CPP APIs should only be used for existing products that were already integrated before transition to Partner Center; new products should use Partner Center submission APIs.

This API starts the process for pushing an app to production. This operation is usually
long-running. This call uses the notification email list
from the [Publish](./cloud-partner-portal-api-publish-offer.md) API operation.
