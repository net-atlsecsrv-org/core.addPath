## Find IDs for debugging

This section describes how to find tenant, object, and partner ID association for debugging purposes.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-and-object-id/icon-azure-cloud-shell-1.png" alt-text="PowerShell icon at the top right of the screen.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-and-object-id/icon-powershell.png" alt-text="Select the PowerShell link.":::

4. Select the **Subscription** box to choose the one to which the partner is linked, then **Create Storage**. This is a one-time action; if you already have storage set up, proceed to the next step.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-and-object-id/create-storage-window.png" alt-text="Select the Create Storage button.":::

5. Creating (or already having) storage opens the Azure Cloud Shell window.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-and-object-id/cloud-shell-window-1.png" alt-text="The Azure Cloud Shell window.":::

6. For partner association details, install the extension with this command:<br>`az extension add --name managementpartner`.<br>Azure Cloud Shell will note if the extension is already installed:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-and-object-id/cloud-shell-window-2.png" alt-text="The Azure Cloud Shell window showing the extension is already installed.":::

7. Check partner details using this command:<br>`az managementpartner show --partner-id xxxxxx`<br>Example: `az managementpartner show --partner-id 4760962`.<br>Snap a screenshot of the command results, which will look similar to this:

>[!NOTE]
>If multiple subscriptions require a screenshot, use this command to switch between subscriptions:<br>`az account set --subscription "My Demos"`
