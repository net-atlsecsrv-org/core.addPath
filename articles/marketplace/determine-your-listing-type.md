# Introduction to listing options

You can use the available _listing options_ in the commercial marketplace to engage with potential customers in a variety of ways. After your offer is published, the listing option(s) you chose for your offer appear as a button in the upper-left corner of your offer’s listing page in the online store(s). For example, the following screenshot shows an offer listing page in the Microsoft AppSource online store with the **Contact Me** and **Test Drive** buttons.

## Available listing options by offer type

When you create an offer type, you choose one or more listing options. These options determine the buttons customers see on the offer listing page in the online stores. The listing options include _Free Trial_, _Test Drive_, _Contact Me_, and _Get It Now_.

This table shows which listing options are available for each offer type.

| Offer type | Free Trial | Test Drive | Contact Me | Get It Now (Transactable) |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Azure Application (Managed app) |   | &#10004; |   | &#10004; |
| Azure Application (Solution template) |  |  |  |  |
| Consulting service |  |  | &#10004; |  |
| Azure Container |  |  |  |  |
| Dynamics 365 business central | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; |  |
| Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement & PowerApps | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; |  |
| Dynamics 365 for operations | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; |  |
| IoT Edge module |  |  |  |  |
| Managed Service |  |  |  |  |
| Power BI App |  |  |  |  |
| Azure Virtual Machine | &#10004; | &#10004; |  | &#10004; |
| Software as a service | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; |

### Free Trial

Use the commercial marketplace to enhance discoverability and automate provisioning of your solution's trial experience. This enables prospective customers to use your software as a service (SaaS), IaaS or Microsoft in-app experience at no cost from 30 days to six months, depending on the offer type.

Customers use the _Free Trial_ button on your offer’s listing page to try your offer. If you provide a free trial on multiple plans within the same offer, customers can switch to a free trial on another plan, but the trial period does not restart.

For virtual machine offers, customers are charged Azure infrastructure costs for using the offer during a trial period. Upon expiration of the trial period, customers are automatically charged for the last plan they tried based on standard rates unless they cancel before the end of the trial period.

### Test Drive

Customers use the _Test Drive_ button on your offer’s listing page to get access to a preconfigured environment for a fixed number of hours. To learn more about test drives, see [What is a test drive?](what-is-test-drive.md)

> [!TIP]
> A test drive is different from a free trial. You can offer a test drive, free trial, or both. They both provide your customers with your solution for a fixed period-of-time. But a test drive also includes a hands-on, self-guided tour of your product’s key features and benefits being demonstrated in a real-world implementation scenario.

### Contact Me

Simple listing of your application or service. Customers use the _Contact Me_ button on your offer’s listing page to request that you connect with them about your offer.

### Get It Now

This listing option includes transactable offers (subscriptions and user-based pricing), bring your own license offers, and Get It Now (Free). Transactable offers are sold through the commercial marketplace. Microsoft is responsible for billing and collections. Customers use the _Get It Now button_ to get the offer.

The Get It Now listing option can include the following pricing options, depending on the offer type:

- Get It Now (Free)
- Bring your own license (BYOL)
- Subscription
- Usage-based pricing

This table shows which offer types support the additional pricing options that are included with the Get It Now listing option.

| Offer type | Get It Now (Free) | BYOL | Subscription | Usage-based pricing |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Azure Application (Managed app) |   |   | &#10004; | &#10004; |

Use this listing option to offer your application for free. Customers use the _Get It Now_ button to get your free offer.

#### BYOL

Use the commercial marketplace to enhance discoverability, automate provisioning of your solution, and complete the financial transaction separate from the marketplace.

- Azure Application (Managed app) offers support monthly subscriptions.
- SaaS offers support both monthly and annual subscriptions.

#### Usage-based pricing

The following offer types support usage-based pricing:

- Azure Application (Managed app) offer support metered billing. For more details, see [Managed application metered billing](./partner-center-portal/azure-app-metered-billing.md).
- SaaS offers supports Metered billing and per user (per seat) pricing. For more information about metered billing, see [Metered billing for SaaS using the commercial marketplace metering service](./partner-center-portal/saas-metered-billing.md).
- Azure virtual machine offers support Per core, Per core size, and Per market and core size pricing. These pricing options are priced per hour and billed monthly.

When creating a transactable offer, it is important to understand the pricing, billing, invoicing, and payout considerations before selecting an offer type and creating your offer. To learn more, see [Commercial marketplace online stores](overview.md#commercial-marketplace-online-stores).

## Listing and pricing options by online store
