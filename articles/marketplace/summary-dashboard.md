> For detailed definitions of analytics terminology, see [Commercial marketplace analytics terminology and common questions](./partner-center-portal/faq-terminology.md).

## Summary dashboard

The Summary dashboard presents an overview of Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource offers’ business performance. The dashboard provides a broad overview of the following:

- Customers' orders
- Customers
- Customers' usage of the offers
- Customers' page visits in Azure Marketplace and AppSource

## Elements of the Summary dashboard

The following sections describe how to use the summary dashboard and how to read the data.

### Month range

You can find a month range selection at the top-right corner of each page. Customize the output of the **Summary** page graphs by selecting a month range based on the past 3, 6, or 12 months, or by selecting a custom month range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default month range (computation period) is six months.

> All metrics in the visualization widgets and export reports honor the computation period selected by the user.

### Orders widget

The Orders widget on the Summary** dashboard displays the current orders for all your transact-based offers. The Orders widget displays a count and trend of all purchased orders (excluding canceled orders) for the selected computation period. The percentage value **Orders** represents the amount of growth during the selected computation period.

You can also go to the Orders report by selecting the **Orders Dashboard** link in the lower-left corner of the widget.

### Customers widget

The **Customers** widget of the **Summary** dashboard displays the total number of customers who have acquired your offers for the selected computation period.

You can also go to the detailed Customers report by selecting the **Customers dashboard** link in the lower-left corner of the widget.

### Usage widget

The **Usage** widget of the **Summary** dashboard represents the total normalized and raw usage hours for all Azure Virtual Machine (VM) offers. The Usage widget displays a count and trend of total usage hours for the selected computation period.

The usage summary table displays the customer usage hours for all offers they have purchased.

- Normalized usage hours are defined as the usage hours normalized to account for the number of VM cores ([number of VM cores] x [hours of raw usage]). VMs designated as "SHAREDCORE" use 1/6 (or 0.1666) as the [number of VM cores] multiplier.
- Raw usage hours are defined as the amount of time VMs have been running in terms of hours.

The percentage value below the total usage hours represents the amount of growth in usage hours during the selected computation period.
