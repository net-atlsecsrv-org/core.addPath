# Commercial marketplace policies and terms

The _Microsoft commercial marketplace_ is a Microsoft owned or operated platform, through which offers may be presented to or acquired by customers. Unless otherwise specified, the commercial marketplace includes Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace.

Thank you for your interest in publishing offers on the commercial marketplace. We're committed to partnering with you to build a rich source of cloud solutions and a collection of business offers that both delight customers worldwide and help you build your business.

Offers on the commercial marketplace must comply with our policies and terms. We update them from time to time to ensure a good customer experience and help our partners succeed. You can leave feedback on our policies or terms, in the [Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace forum](https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/Azure-Marketplace-and-AppSource/bd-p/2222).
