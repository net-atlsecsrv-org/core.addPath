# Co-sell with Microsoft sales teams and partners overview

Co-selling with Microsoft is defined as any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and our partner ecosystem. This process includes building demand, sales planning, sharing sales leads, accelerating partner-to-partner empowered selling, and delivering marketplace-led commerce.

When you choose to co-sell an offer, you can work directly with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners on joint selling opportunities. This unlocks benefits when selling through the commercial marketplace online stores: Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource.

Co-selling opportunities are the result of [acting on a lead](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md), collaborating on it with Microsoft sales teams or Microsoft partners to provide a solution for a customer need.

These solutions (also called offers) can include software built with your intellectual property (IP) and services that support Microsoft technologies.

## Co-sell opportunities

A co-sell opportunity is any type of collaboration with Microsoft sales teams, Microsoft partners, or both to sell products and solutions that meet customer needs. Some of the key categories of co-sell are:

- **Co-sell with Microsoft sales teams** – Work with one or more Microsoft sales teams to actively fulfill customer needs. This can include selling your offers, Microsoft’s offers, or both. You and Microsoft sales teams can identify and share customer opportunities in which your solutions may be a good fit.
- **Partner to Partner (P2P)** – Work with another Microsoft partner to actively solve a customer problem.
- **Private deal** – Share what you are independently working on with Microsoft so it will be reflected in the Microsoft reporting system for analysis and forecasting.
- **Solution Assessment (SA)** – Work with partners who are vetted by the solution assessments business team to assess the technology needs of customers who are using or planning to use Microsoft technologies.

## Co-sell statuses

These are the levels of co-sell status that can be applied to an offer.

Co-sell statuses for Azure:

- Not co-sell ready
- Co-sell ready
- Azure IP co-sell incentivized

Co-sell statuses for business applications
- Business Applications Co-sell incentivized Standard
- Business Applications Co-sell incentivized Premium

## Benefits of co-sell ready status

Co-sell ready status exposes your solutions to Microsoft sales teams. Co-selling with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners helps you reach a vast community of Microsoft-managed customers to collaborate on sales opportunities that accelerate your business growth.
