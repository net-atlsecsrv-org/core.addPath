# Enable lead sharing
Ensuring that lead management is enabled for your listing in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) or [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) can help you receive contact information for the following audiences:

| Storefront | Audience |
|:--- |:--- |
| AppSource | Business customers |
| Azure Marketplace | All customers |

Your leads provide the basis of outreach for the campaigns listed in the following table, for related sales motions by your field sales staff, and for information about how your app or offer is performing:

| Storefront | Campaign |
|:--- |:--- |
| AppSource | Nurture |
| Azure Marketplace | In-demand generation |

Use the following practices for your leads:
*   Qualify your leads and score the leads as sales opportunities.
*   Nurture your leads to enter a sales pipeline.
*   Align your efforts with your overall marketing campaign strategy.

Your leads demonstrate customer interest in the following listings:

| Storefront | Listing |
|:--- |:--- |
| AppSource | <table> <tr><td>App</td></tr> <tr><td>Consulting Services</td></tr> </table> |
| Azure Marketplace | <table> <tr><td>Offer</td></tr> <tr><td>Technology</td></tr> </table> |

You should have a process in place to follow up with your leads as described in the following table:

| Storefront | Leads |
|:--- |:--- |
| AppSource | <table> <tr><td>Your CRM</td></tr> <tr><td>Microsoft field seller CRM</td></tr> </table> |
| Azure Marketplace | <table> <tr><td>Azure Marketplace</td></tr> <tr><td>Microsoft field seller CRM</td></tr> </table> |

Your leads in storefronts in the Marketplace are different from Microsoft seller-qualified leads that are a feature of the Co-Sell program.

For more information about how to access the Co-Sell program, see [Promote your business with Microsoft](./promote-your-business-with-microsoft.md).
