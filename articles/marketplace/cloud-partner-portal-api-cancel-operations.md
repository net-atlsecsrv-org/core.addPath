# Cancel operation

> [!NOTE]
> The Cloud Partner Portal APIs are integrated with and will continue working in Partner Center. The transition introduces small changes. Review the changes listed in [Cloud Partner Portal API Reference](./cloud-partner-portal-api-overview.md) to ensure your code continues working after transitioning to Partner Center. CPP APIs should only be used for existing products that were already integrated before transition to Partner Center; new products should use Partner Center submission APIs.

This API cancels an operation currently in progress on the offer. Use the [Retrieve operations
API](./cloud-partner-portal-api-retrieve-operations.md) to get an
`operationId` to pass to this API. Cancellation is usually a synchronous
operation, however in some complex scenarios a new operation may be
required to cancel an existing one. In this case, the HTTP response body
contains the operation's location that should be used to query status.

  `POST https://cloudpartner.azure.com/api/publishers/<publisherId>/offers/<offerId>/cancel?api-version=2017-10-31`
