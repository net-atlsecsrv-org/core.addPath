# Configure Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & Power Apps offer listing details

This page lets you define the offer details such as offer name, description, links, contacts, logo, and screenshots.

> [!NOTE]
> Provide offer listing details in one language only. English is not required as long as the offer description begins with the phrase, "This application is available only in [non-English language]." It is also acceptable to provide a *Useful link URL* to offer content in a language other than the one used in the Offer listing content.

Here's an example of how offer information appears in Microsoft AppSource (any listed prices are for example purposes only and not intended to reflect actual costs):

## Marketplace details

The **Name** you enter here is shown to customers as the title of the offer. This field is pre-populated with the name you entered for **Offer alias** when you created the offer, but you can change it. The name:

- Can include trademark and copyright symbols.
- Must be 50 characters or less.
- Can't include emojis.

Provide a short description of your offer for the **Search results summary** (up to 100 characters). This description may be used in marketplace search results.

[!INCLUDE [Long description-1](includes/long-description-1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Long description-2](includes/long-description-2.md)]

Use HTML tags to format your description so it's more engaging. For a list of allowed tags, see [Supported HTML tags](supported-html-tags.md).

You can optionally enter up to three **Search keywords** to help customers find your offer in the marketplace. For best results, also use these keywords in your description.

If you want to let customers know what **Products your app works with**, enter up to three product names.

#### Help/Privacy URLs

Enter the **Help link for your app** (URL) where customers can learn more about your offer. Your Help URL cannot be the same as your Support URL.

Enter the **Privacy policy link** (URL) to your organization's privacy policy. You are responsible for ensuring your app complies with privacy laws and regulations, and for providing a valid privacy policy.

### Contact information

Provide the name, email, and phone number for a **Support contact** and an **Engineering contact**. This information is not shown to customers, but will be available to Microsoft, and may be provided to CSP partners.

In the **Support contact** section, provide the **Support URL** where CSP partners can find support for your offer. Your Support URL cannot be the same as your Help URL.

## Supporting documents

Provide at least one (and up to three) related PDF marketing documents here, such as white papers, brochures, checklists, or presentations.

## Marketplace media

Provide logos and images to use with your offer. All images must be in PNG format. Blurry images will cause your submission to be rejected.

[!INCLUDE [logo tips](includes/graphics-suggestions.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>If you have an issue uploading files, ensure that your local network doesn't block the https://upload.xboxlive.com service that's used by Partner Center.

### Logos

Provide a PNG file for the **Large** size logo. Partner Center will use this to create other required sizes. You can optionally replace this with a different image later.

These logos are used in different places in the listing:

[!INCLUDE [logos-appsource-only](includes/logos-appsource-only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Logo tips](includes/graphics-suggestions.md)]
