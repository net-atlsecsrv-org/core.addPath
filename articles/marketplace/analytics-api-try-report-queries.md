# Try report queries API

This API executes a Report query statement. The API returns only 10 records that you as a partner can use to verify if the data is as you expected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API has a query execution timeout of 100 seconds. If you notice the API is taking more than 100 seconds, it is highly likely that the query is syntactically correct or else you would have received an error code other than 200. The actual report generation will pass if the query syntax is correct.
