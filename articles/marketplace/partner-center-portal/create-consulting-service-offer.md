# Create a Consulting service offer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We're moving the management of your Consulting service offers from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center. Until your offers are migrated, please follow the instructions in [Azure and Dynamics 365 consulting service offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/consulting-services/cloud-partner-portal-consulting-services-publishing-offer) for Cloud Partner Portal to manage your offers.

This article describes how to publish a Consulting service offer to either [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). List Consulting service offers based on Microsoft [Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/) and Power Platform on AppSource. List Consulting service offers based on Microsoft Azure on Azure Marketplace.

To create a Consulting service offer in either Azure Marketplace or AppSource Consulting services, you must first [have a publisher account in Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account), and your account must be enrolled in the commercial marketplace program. Before you create your offer, review the prerequisites in [Consulting service prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/consulting-service-prerequisites).

## Publishing benefits

Benefits of publishing to the commercial marketplace:

- Promote your company by using the Microsoft brand.
- Potentially reach more than 100 million Office 365 and Dynamics 365 users on AppSource and more than 200,000 organizations through Azure Marketplace.
- Receive high-quality leads from these marketplaces.
- Have your services promoted by the Microsoft field and telesales teams

## Create a new offer

After meeting the requirements described above, follow these steps to create a Consulting service offer.

1. Log in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com), and then select **Dashboard** from the top menu.
2. In the left-nav bar, select **Commercial Marketplace**, then select **Overview**.

3. Select **+ New Offer**, then select **Consulting service**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/cs-menu-newoffer.png" alt-text="Illustrates the button to create a new offer.":::

4. Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

    - This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the marketplace offer.
    - Use only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores, but no spaces. The length is limited to 50 characters. For example, if you enter **test-offer-1**, the offer URL will be `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`.
    - The Offer ID can&#39;t be changed after you select **Create**.

5. Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used to refer to the offer in Partner Center.

    - This name isn&#39;t used in the marketplace. It&#39;s different from the offer name and other values that are shown to customers. You can use this field to assign a name to the offer that is more useful to you for identifying the offer internally; it is not shown to customers.
    - The offer alias can&#39;t be changed after you select **Create**.

After you enter these two values, select **Create** to continue to the **Offer setup** page.

## Offer setup

After you enter an Offer ID and Offer alias, Partner Center creates a draft offer and displays the **Offer setup** page. Follow these steps to set up your offer.

### Connect lead management

When publishing your offer to the marketplace with Partner Center, you _must_ connect it to a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or marketing automation system. This let you receive customer contact information as soon as someone expresses interest in or uses your product.

1. Select **Connect** to specify where you want us to send customer leads. Partner Center supports the following systems:

    - [Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics) for Customer Engagement
    - [Marketo](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo)
    - [Salesforce](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-salesforce)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your CRM system isn&#39;t listed above, use [Azure Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table) or [Https Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https) to store customer lead data, then export the data to your CRM system.

2. Connect your offer to the lead destination when publishing in Partner Center.
3. Confirm that the connection to the lead destination is configured properly. After you publish it in Partner Center, we&#39;ll validate the connection and send you a test lead. While you preview the offer before it goes live, you can also test your lead connection by trying to purchase the offer yourself in the preview environment.
4. Make sure the connection to the lead destination stays updated so you don&#39;t lose any leads.
