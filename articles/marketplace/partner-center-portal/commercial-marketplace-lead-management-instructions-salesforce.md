# Configure lead management for Salesforce

This article describes how to set up your Salesforce system to process sales leads from your commercial marketplace offer.

> [!Note]
> Marketplace does not support pre-populated lists, such as a list of values for the **Country** field. Make sure there are no lists set up before you continue. Alternatively, you can configure an [HTTPS endpoint](./commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https.md) or an [Azure table](./commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md) to receive leads.

## Set up your Salesforce system

1. Sign in to Salesforce.
2. If you are using the Salesforce lighting experience.
    1. Select **Setup** from Salesforce Home page.

7. You will be presented with some HTML text. Search for the text "oid" and copy the **oid value** from the HTML text (only the text in between quotation marks) and save it. You'll paste this value in the **Organization Identifier** field on the publishing portal.
