# Power BI app creation overview

This article explains how to publish a Power BI app to Microsoft [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). A Power BI app packages customizable content, including datasets, reports, and dashboards. You can then use the app with other Power BI platforms using AppSource, perform the adjustments and customizations allowed by the developer, and connect it to your own data.

## Publishing benefits

Benefits of publishing to the commercial marketplace:

- Promote your company by using the Microsoft brand.
- Potentially reach more than 100 million Office 365 and Dynamics 365 users on AppSource and more than 200,000 organizations through Azure Marketplace.
- Receive high-quality leads from these marketplaces.
- Have your services promoted by the Microsoft field and telesales teams.

These are the key publishing steps:

1. Create your application in Power BI. You'll receive a package install link, which is the main technical asset for the offer. Send the test package to pre-production before creating the offer in Partner Center. For details, see [What are Power BI apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-template-apps-overview).
2. Add the marketing materials, such as official name, description, and logos.
3. Include the offer's legal and support documents, such as terms of use, privacy policy, support policy, and user help.
4. Create the offer â€“ Use Partner Center to edit the details, including the offer description, marketing materials, legal information, support information, and asset specifications.
5. Submit it for publishing.
6. Monitor the process in Partner Center, where the AppSource onboarding team tests, validates, and certifies your app.
7. After it's certified, review the app in its test environment and release it. This will list it on AppSource (it "goes live").
8. In Power BI, send the package into production. For details, see [Manage the Power BI app release](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-template-apps-create#manage-the-template-app-release).

## Requirements

To be published in the commercial marketplace, your Power BI app offer must meet the following technical and business requirements.

### Technical requirements

The main technical asset you'll need is a [Power BI app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636). This is a collection of primary datasets, reports, or dashboards. It also includes optional connected services and embedded datasets, previously known as a [content pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-organizational-content-pack-introduction). For more information about developing this type of app, see [What are Power BI apps?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).

#### Get an installation web address

You can only build a Power BI app within the [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) environment.

1. Sign in with a [Power BI Pro license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro).
2. Create and test your app in Power BI.
3. When you receive the app installation web address, add it to the **Technical Configuration** page in Partner Center.

After your app is created and tested in Power BI, save the application installation web address, as you'll need it to [create a Power BI app offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-power-bi-app-offer).

### Business requirements

The business requirements include procedural, contractual, and legal obligations. You must:

- Be a registered commercial marketplace publisher. If you're not registered, follow the steps in [Become a Commercial Marketplace Publisher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher).
- Provide content that meets the criteria for your offering to be listed on AppSource. For more information, see [Have an app to list on AppSource? Here's how](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/have-an-app-to-list-on-appsource-here-s-how).
