## Payment schedules

The following sections describe our payouts process.

### Enterprise Agreement transactions after May 1, 2020

#### Update to our Commercial Marketplace publisher payout model

Beginning May 1, 2020, we are updating our payouts policy relating to products purchased in Azure Marketplace or AppSource by customers with a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement. When a customer purchases a product from Azure Marketplace or AppSource using their existing Microsoft Enterprise Agreement for transactions after May 1, 2020 we will begin issuing payouts in the next payout cycle 30-days post customer invoice. Transactions where a customer uses a credit card are unchanged and will continue to have a 30-day holding period prior to payout. This tables shows details on the payout schedule.

> [!NOTE]
> See [Process for customer non-payment](#process-for-customer-non-payment) below for the actions we take if the customer fails to pay but we have already issued a payout to you.

## Process for customer non-payment

On rare occasions, Microsoft is unable to collect payments from customers for their commercial marketplace purchases. When a customer fails to pay Microsoft according to their billing schedule, we begin the collections process. This process takes approximately four months and involves persistent communication from Microsoft. If payment is not received by the end of this process, Microsoft writes off the funds as uncollectable.

Per the payout process articulated here, Microsoft may have already paid out funds to publishers (you) that are ultimately uncollectable. Therefore, we have a process for reconciling these amounts. To ensure you have warning that your (already received) payment may be reconciled, you will be notified when a customer is in the collections process and purchases are likely to be written off.

Microsoft will recoup any payouts already paid to you using one of the following methods: (1) Microsoft may subtract the unpaid amounts from future payouts; for example, if $1,000 in payouts are deemed uncollectable and written off, your future payouts will be withheld until the $1,000 is recovered, or (2) Microsoft may request a refund or invoice publishers for any uncollected amounts.

The following is an example schedule:

| Event | Approximate date | Partner visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Example payout date | 10/15/2020 | Marked as **Sent** in Transaction History and in Payments section in Payout Dashboard |
| <font color="red">If customer does not pay Microsoft</font> | 12/2/2020 – 12/5/2020 | No change, same as above |
| Customer receives first late payment email | 12/6/2020 | None |
| Customer receives regular emails of increasing urgency | 12/7/2020 – 1/31/2020 | None |
| Publisher is notified write-off is likely | 1/7/2020 | Email notification sent to publisher that their customer has not yet sent payment. Transaction ID and dollar amount are included. |
| Customer receives termination notice | 2/1/2020 | None |
| Collection process ends / funds are written off | 2/15/2020 | Email notification sent to publisher that funds have been written off. Transaction ID and dollar amount are included. |
| Payout is deducted | 3/1/2020 | Publisher will see negative transaction in Partner Center Payout Statement |
| Payout is withheld | 3/15/2020 | Future payouts will be shown in Partner Center Payout Statement. Publisher will not receive payment until balance is no longer negative.  |
