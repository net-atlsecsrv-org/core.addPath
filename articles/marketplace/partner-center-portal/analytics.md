# Analytics for the Commercial Marketplace in Partner Center

Learn how to access analytic reports in Microsoft Partner Center to monitor sales, evaluate performance, and optimize your offers in the marketplace. As a partner, you can monitor your offer listings using the data visualization and insight graphs supported by Partner Center and find ways to maximize your sales. The improved analytics tools enable you to act on performance results and maintain better relationships with your customers and resellers. 

To access the Partner Center analytics tools, open the **[Analyze](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary)** dashboard under Commercial Marketplace.

|**Dashboard**|**Displayed content**|
|:---|:---|
|[Summary](#summary-dashboard)|Graphs, trends, and values of aggregate data that summarize marketplace activity for your offers|
|[Orders](#orders-dashboard)|Information about your orders in a graphical and downloadable format|
|[Customers](#customer-dashboard)|Information about your customers, including growth trends, presented in a  graphical and downloadable format|
|[Downloads](#downloads-dashboard)|A list of your download requests over the last 30 days|
|[Ratings and reviews](#ratings-and-reviews)| Information about ratings and reviews your customers leave for the offers they've acquired.

## Summary dashboard

The **Summary** dashboard presents an overview based on each offer type. **Insights** show critical information at a glance and provide a broad view of the sales activity of your offers. You can visualize these reports using the **Summary** dashboard:

- [Total orders](#totals)
- [Total customers](#totals)
- [Geographic location of your customers](#customers-by-geography)
- [Trends emerging based on your customer and order information](#growth-trend-chart)
- [Customer leaderboard with highest orders](#customer-leaderboard)
- [Number of orders organized by offer name](#offers-by-orders)

### Date range

You can find a date range selection at the top-right corner of each page. The output of the **Summary** page graphs can be customized by selecting a date range based on the past 3, 6, or 12 months, or by selecting a custom date range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default date range is six months.

### Totals

The **Totals** section displays a count of all orders created, or customers acquired, during the selected date range. 

- The percentage value next to **Total Orders** and **Total Customers** represents the amount of growth compared to the previous month. 
- A green triangle pointing upward indicates a positive growth trend. A red triangle pointing downward indicates a negative growth trend relative to the previous month. 
- Order and Customer growth trends are represented by bar graphs and will display the value for each month by hovering over the columns of the chart.

### Customers by geography

The **Customers by geography** heatmap displays a customer count on a world map.

- You can move the map to view the exact location.
- You can zoom into a specific location.
- The heatmap has a supplementary grid to view the details of customer count (or [order count](#orders-by-geography)) in the specific location.
- You can search and select a country in the grid to zoom to the location in the map. Revert to the original view by pressing the **Home** button in the map.
- A **new** customer has purchased one of your offers for the first time during the month within the selected date range.

### Growth trend chart

You can view trends based on the growth of your **Orders created** or **Customers acquired**, displayed month by month according to the selected date range. You can further analyze these trends by selecting links below the chart, which navigate to the respective **Order** or **Customer** pages.

### Customer leaderboard

The top 50 customers with the highest number of orders are displayed on a *leader board*, sorted by highest order count and order percentage. 

- Select a customer to view their profile details, orders organized by offer, or orders organized by Azure license type and pricing channel.

Users with the **Contributor** role will not be able to view this information. [Learn more about user roles and permissions](./manage-account.md#define-user-roles-and-permissions).

![Partner Center Analyze growth trends](./media/analyze-growth-trends.png)

### Offers by orders

The **Offers by orders** chart organizes your active orders according to the Offer name.

## Orders dashboard

The **Orders** dashboard of the **Analyze** menu displays the current orders for all of your SaaS offers. You can view graphical representations of:

One specific way is that the **Seller Insights** in CPP has a **Orders & Usage** tab, which displays data for usage-based offers and non-usage-based offers. In Partner Center, the **Orders** page has a separate tab for SaaS Offers.

### Order totals
