# Create a Power BI app offer

This article describes how to create and publish a Power BI app offer to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

Before starting, [Create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center](create-account.md) if you haven't done so yet. Ensure your account is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-nav menu, select **Commercial Marketplace** > **Overview**.
3. On the Overview page, select **+ New offer** > **Power BI Service App**.

   ![Illustrates the left-navigation menu.](./media/new-offer-power-bi-app.png)

> [!NOTE]
> After an offer is published, edits made to it in Partner Center only appear in online stores after republishing the offer. Make sure you always republish after making changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If **Power BI Service App** isn't shown or enabled, your account doesn't have permission to create this offer type. Please check that you've met all the [requirements](create-power-bi-app-overview.md) for this offer type, including registering for a developer account.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the marketplace offer and Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. It can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if you enter **test-offer-1** here, the offer web address will be `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used in the marketplace and is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.
- The Offer alias can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Select **Create** to generate the offer and continue.

## Offer overview

This page shows a visual representation of the steps required to publish this offer (both completed and upcoming) and how long each step should take to complete.

It includes links to perform operations on this offer based on the selection you make. For example:

- If the offer is a draft - Delete draft offer
- If the offer is live - [Stop selling the offer](update-existing-offer.md#stop-selling-an-offer-or-plan)
- If the offer is in preview - [Go-live](../review-publish-offer.md#previewing-and-approving-your-offer)
- If you haven't completed publisher sign-out - [Cancel publishing.](../review-publish-offer.md#cancel-publishing)

## Offer setup

### Customer leads

When publishing your offer to the marketplace with Partner Center, you must connect it to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This lets you receive customer contact information as soon as someone expresses interest in or uses your product.

1. Select a lead destination where you want us to send customer leads. Partner Center supports the following CRM systems:

    - [Dynamics 365](commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics.md) for Customer Engagement
    - [Marketo](commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo.md)
    - [Salesforce](commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-salesforce.md)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your CRM system isn't in this list, use [Azure Table](commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md) or and [HTTPS endpoint](commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https.md) to store customer lead data. Then export the data to your CRM system.

2. Connect your offer to the lead destination when publishing in Partner Center.
3. Confirm that the connection to the lead destination is configured properly. After you publish it in Partner Center, we'll validate the connection and send you a test lead. While you preview the offer before it goes live, you can also test your lead connection by trying to purchase the offer yourself in the preview environment.
4. Make sure the connection to the lead destination stays updated so you don't lose any leads.

Here are some additional lead management resources:

- [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md)
- [Common questions about lead management](../lead-management-faq.md#common-questions-about-lead-management)

- [Lead Management Overview](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/mpn/cloud-marketplace-lead-management.pdf) PDF (Make sure your pop-up blocker is turned off).
