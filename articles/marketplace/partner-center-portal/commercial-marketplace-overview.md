# Overview of the Commercial Marketplace portal in Partner Center

Welcome to the Commercial Marketplace portal in Microsoft Partner Center. The [Commercial Marketplace portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/) is designed to help you monetize your products and services, reach customers, and grow your business.

In this documentation, we will cover the basics of creating and using your Partner Center account, creating new Software as a Service (SaaS) offers that can be listed on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), managing your existing SaaS offers, and providing resources to assist you with questions and collect your feedback. 

## About Microsoft's Commercial Marketplace

Enterprises, governments, and organizations of all sizes find business solutions, innovative technology, and enablement services through the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) web stores, [Azure portal's in-product experience](https://portal.azure.com), [Cloud Solution Providers](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider), and Microsoft Sales teams. 

Partner Center is the hub of a Microsoft partner's experience. For organizations who go to market with Microsoft and take advantage of the marketplace, Partner Center is the portal through which publishers create and manage offers, provide test drive demonstrations, and view analytics on offer performance. 

## Migration from Cloud Partner Portal

Partner Center is evolving to better integrate all aspects of Microsoft's relationship with software publishers. As part of this evolution, we are migrating the functions of the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) to Partner Center. 

**Currently, Partner Center only supports the creation and management of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offers.**

Existing marketplace publishers will find a familiar but improved user experience with an intuitive interface. Notifications in the portal and via email will inform publishers of the migration. Users will be seamlessly directed to the appropriate location. Customers will not be impacted by this partner experience upgrade. 

### Improvements on user experience and billing

With the transition to Partner Center, new functionality is available to publishers, in addition to improvements on the user experience. SaaS offerings, which can be billed monthly or annually, support per-user licensing (seat-based) in addition to per-site licensing (flat-rate). This new monetization model is ideal for business software. The introduction of SaaS per-user licensing aligns with new functionality that allows customers to complete purchases in AppSource, the Microsoft commercial marketplace for business and industry solutions. 

### Account and user management updates

Account and user management in Partner Center make it easy for individuals to access the portal and for administrators to apply appropriate permissions. Compared to prior offer management portals, the role-based access control capabilities in Partner Center provide security enhancements that will make the publishing process simpler for large organizations. 

### Improved certification experience

Partner Center provides an improved certification experience. Certification will now leverage automation and machine learning for improved turnaround times and quicker processing. Maintaining accuracy will remain a top priority, ensuring that the cloud marketplace is safe and contains valuable offers for our customers. Requirements will not change, but now when you submit offers through Partner Center, you will receive more detailed and descriptive certification reports referencing [public-facing policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies). 

### Analytics for performance reporting

Partner Center analytics provides a view into the performance of your offers and improved reporting tools. Publishers can monitor sales using the data visualization and insight graphs to optimize listings. The improved analytics tools enable you to act on performance results and maintain better relationships with customers and resellers.
