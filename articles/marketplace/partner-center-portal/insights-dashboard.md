- Page filters
- Date filters

## Marketplace Insights summary

The Marketplace insights summary section displays a count of **Page visits**, **Calls to action**, and **Unique visitors** for the selected date range.

### Page visits

This number represents the count of distinct user sessions on the offer page (product detail page) for a selected date range. The red/green percentage indicator represents the growth % of page visits. The trend chart represents the month-to-month count of page visits.

### Unique visitors

This number represents the distinct visitor count during the selected date range for the offer(s) selected in the page filter. A visitor who has visited one or more product detail pages will be counted as one unique visitor.

### Call to action

This number represents the count of **Call to Action** button clicks completed on the offer page (product detail page). **Calls to action** are counted when the **Get it now**, **Free trial**, **Contact me**, and **Test drive** buttons are selected.
