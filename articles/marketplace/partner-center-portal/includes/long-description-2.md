Here are some tips for writing your description:

- Clearly describe the value of your offer in the first few sentences, including:
  - Description of the offer.
  - The type of user who benefits from the offer.
  - Customer needs or issues that the offer addresses.
- Remember that the first few sentences might be displayed in search results.
- Don't rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Focus on the value your offer provides.
- Use industry-specific vocabulary or benefit-based wording.
