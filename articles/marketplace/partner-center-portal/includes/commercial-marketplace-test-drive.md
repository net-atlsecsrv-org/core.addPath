The **Test drive** tab enables you to set up a demonstration (or "test drive") which will enable customers to try your offer before committing to purchase it. Learn more in the article [What is Test Drive?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/what-is-test-drive). If you no longer want to provide a test drive for your offer, return to the **Offer setup** page and un-check **Enable test drive**.

### Technical configuration
The following types of test drives are available, each with their own technical configuration requirements.

- [Azure Resource Manager](#technical-configuration-for-azure-resource-manager-test-drive)
- [Dynamics 365](#technical-configuration-for-dynamics-365-test-drive)
- [Logic app](#technical-configuration-for-logic-app-test-drive)
- [Power BI](#technical-configuration-not-required-for-power-bi-test-drives) (Technical configuration not required)

#### Technical configuration for Azure Resource Manager test drive

A deployment template that contains all the Azure resources that comprise your solution. Products that fit this scenario use only Azure resources. Learn more about setting up an [Azure Resource Manager test drive](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/azure-resource-manager-test-drive).

- **Regions** (required): Currently there are 26 Azure-supported regions where your test drive can be made available. Typically, you will want to make your test drive available in the regions where you anticipate the largest number of customers, so that they can select the closest region for the best performance. You will need to make sure that your subscription is allowed to deploy all of the resources needed in each of the regions you are selecting.

- **Instances**: Select the type (hot or cold) and number of available instances, which will be multiplied by the number of regions where your offer is available.

**Hot**: This type of instance is deployed and awaiting access per selected region. Customers can instantly access *Hot* instances of a test drive, rather than having to wait for a deployment. The tradeoff is that these instances are always running on your Azure subscription, so they will incur a larger uptime cost. It is highly recommended to have at least one *Hot* instance, as most customers don't want to wait for full deployments, resulting in a drop-off in customer usage if no *Hot* instance is available.

**Cold**: This type of instance represents the total number of instances that can possibly be deployed per region. Cold instances require the entire Test Drive Resource Manager template to deploy when a customer requests the test drive, so *Cold* instances are much slower to load than *Hot* instances. The tradeoff is that you only have to pay for the duration of the test drive, it is *not* always running on your Azure subscription as with a *Hot* instance.

- **Test drive Azure Resource Manager template**: Upload the .zip containing your Azure Resource Manager template.  Learn more about creating an Azure Resource Manager template in the quickstart article [Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates by using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal).

- **Test drive duration** (required): Enter the length of time that the Test Drive will stay active, in # of hours. The Test Drive terminates automatically after this time period ends. This duration may only be set by a whole number of hours (e.g. "2" hours, "1.5" is not valid).

#### Technical configuration for Dynamics 365 test drive

Microsoft can remove the complexity of setting up a test drive by hosting and maintaining the service provisioning and deployment using this type of test drive. The configuration for this type of hosted test drive is the same regardless of whether the test drive is targeting a Business Central, Customer Engagement, or Operations audience.

- **Max concurrent test drives** (required): Set the maximum number of customers that can use your test drive at one time. Each concurrent user will consume a Dynamics 365 license while the test drive is active, so you will need to ensure that you have enough licenses available to support the maximum limit set. Recommended value of 3-5.

- **Test drive duration** (required): Enter the length of time that the Test Drive will stay active by defining the number of hours. After this many hours, the session will end and no longer consume one of your licenses. We recommend a value of 2-24 hours depending on the complexity of your offer. This duration may only be set by a whole number of hours (e.g. "2" hours, "1.5" is not valid).  The user can request a new session if they run out of time and want to access the test drive again.

- **Instance URL** (required): The URL where the customer will begin their test drive. Typically the URL of your Dynamics 365 instance running your app with sample data installed (e.g. https://testdrive.crm.dynamics.com).

- **Instance Web API URL** (required): Retrieve the Web API URL for your Dynamics 365 instance by logging into your Microsoft 365 account and navigating to **Settings** \&gt; **Customization** \&gt; **Developer Resources** \&gt; **Instance Web API (Service Root URL)**, copy the URL found here (e.g. https://testdrive.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0).

- **Role name** (required): Provide the security role name you have defined in your custom Dynamics 365 test drive. This will be assigned to the user during their test drive (e.g. test-drive-role).

#### Technical configuration for Logic app test drive

Any custom products should use this type of test drive deployment template which encompasses a variety of complex solution architectures. For more information about setting up Logic App test drives, visit [Operations](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppSource/blob/master/Setup-your-Azure-subscription-for-Dynamics365-Operations-Test-Drives.md) and [Customer Engagement](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppSource/wiki/Setting-up-Test-Drives-for-Dynamics-365-app) on GitHub.

- **Region** (required, single-selection dropdown list): Currently there are 26 Azure-supported regions where your test drive can be made available. The resources for your Logic app will be deployed in the region you select. If your Logic App has any custom resources stored in a specific region, make sure that region is selected here. The best way to do this is to fully deploy your Logic App locally on your Azure subscription in the portal and verify that it functions correctly before making this selection.

- **Max concurrent test drives** (required): Set the maximum number of customers that can use your test drive at one time. These test drives are already deployed, enabling customers to instantly access them without waiting for a deployment.

- **Test drive duration** (required): Enter the length of time that the Test Drive will stay active, in # of hours. The test drive terminates automatically after this time period ends.

- **Azure resource group name** (required): Enter the [Azure resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups) name where your Logic App test drive is saved.

- **Azure logic app name** (required): Enter the name of the Logic app that assigns the test drive to the user. This Logic app must be saved in the Azure resources group above.

- **Deprovision logic app name** (required): Enter the name of the Logic app that deprovisions the test drive once the customer is finished. This Logic app must be saved in the Azure resources group above.

#### Technical configuration not required for Power BI test drives

Products that want to demonstrate an interactive Power BI visual can use an embedded link to share a custom-built dashboard as their test drive, no further technical configuration required. Learn more about setting up[Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-template-apps-overview) template apps.

### Deployment subscription details

In order to deploy the Test Drive on your behalf, please create and provide a separate, unique Azure Subscription. (Not required for Power BI test drives).

- **Azure subscription ID** (required for Azure Resource Manager and Logic apps): Enter the subscription ID to grant access to your Azure account services for resource usage reporting and billing. We recommend that you consider [creating a separate Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-create-subscription) to use for test drives if you don't have one already. You can find your Azure subscription ID by logging in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigating to the **Subscriptions** tab of the left-side menu. Selecting the tab will display your subscription ID (e.g. "a83645ac-1234-5ab6-6789-1h234g764ghty").

- **Azure AD tenant ID** (required): Enter your Azure Active Directory (AD) [tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in).
