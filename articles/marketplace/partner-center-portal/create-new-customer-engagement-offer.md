# Create a new Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offer

This topic explains how to create a new Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offer. All apps for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (PowerApps, Sales, Service, Project Service, and Field Service) must go through our certification process and support a trial experience. The certification process checks your solution for standard requirements, compatibility, and proper practices. The trial experience allows users to deploy your solution to a live Dynamics 365 environment.

To begin creating Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offers, ensure that you first [Create a Partner Center account](./create-account.md) and open the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers), with the **Overview** tab selected.

>[!Note]
> Once an offer has been published, edits to the offer made in Partner Center will only be updated in the system and store fronts after re-publishing. Please ensure that you submit the offer for publication after you make changes.

## Create a new offer

Select the **+ New offer** button, then select the **Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps** menu item. The **New offer** dialog box will appear.

### Offer ID and alias

- **Offer ID**: Unique identifier for each offer in your account. This ID will be visible to customers in the URL address for the marketplace offer and Azure Resource Manager templates (if applicable). Offer ID must be lowercase alphanumeric characters (including hyphens and underscores, but no whitespace). This is limited to 50 characters and can’t be changed after you select **Create**.  For example, if you enter *test-offer-1* here, the offer URL will be `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`.

- **Offer alias**: The name used to refer to the offer within the Partner Center. This name won't be used in the marketplace, and is different than the offer name and other values that will be shown to customers. This value can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Once you enter your **Offer ID** and **Offer alias**, select **Create**. You'll then be able to work on all of the different parts of your offer.

## Offer setup

The **Offer setup** page asks for the following information. Be sure to select **Save** after completing these fields.

### How do you want potential customers to interact with this listing offer?

Select the option you'd like to use for this offer.

#### Get it now (free)

List your offer to customers for free by providing a valid URL (beginning with *http* or *https*) where they can access your app.  For example: `https://contoso.com/my-app`

#### Free trial (listing)

List your offer to customers with a link to a free trial by providing a valid URL (beginning with *http* or *https*) where they can get a trial.  For example: `https://contoso.com/trial/my-app`. Offer listing free trials are created, managed, and configured by your service and do not have subscriptions managed by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> The tokens your application will receive through your trial link can only be used to obtain user information through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to automate account creation in your app. Microsoft accounts are not supported for authentication using this token.

#### Contact me

Collect customer contact information by connecting your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The customer will be asked for permission to share their information. These customer details, along with the offer name, ID, and marketplace source where they found your offer, will be sent to the CRM system that you’ve configured. For more information about configuring your CRM, see [Connect lead management](#connect-lead-management). 

### Test drive

A test drive is a great way to showcase your offer to potential customers by giving them the option to 'try before you buy', resulting in increased conversion and the generation of highly qualified leads. [Learn more about test drives.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/what-is-test-drive)

To enable a test drive, check the **Enable a test drive** box. You'll then need to configure a demonstration environment in the [Test drive technical configuration](#test-drive-technical-configuration) configure to let customers to try your offer for a fixed period of time. 

#### Type of test drive

Select from the following options:

- **[Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/azure-resource-manager-test-drive)**: A deployment template that contains all the Azure resources that comprise your solution. Products that fit this scenario use only Azure resources.
- **[Dynamics 365 for Business Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cpp-business-central-offer)**: Microsoft hosts and maintains the test drive service (including provisioning and deployment) for a Business Central enterprise resource planning system (finance, operations, supply chain, CRM, etc.).  
- **[Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/dyn365ce/cpp-customer-engagement-offer)**: Microsoft hosts and maintains the test drive service (including provisioning and deployment) for a Customer Engagement system (sales, service, project service, field service, etc.).  
- **[Dynamics 365 for Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cpp-dynamics-365-operations-offer)**: Microsoft hosts and maintains the test drive service (including provisioning and deployment) for a Finance and Operations enterprise resource planning system (finance, operations, manufacturing, supply chain, etc.). 
- **[Logic app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/logic-app-test-drive)**: A deployment template encompassing all complex solution architectures. Any custom products should use this type of Test Drive.
- **[Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-template-apps-overview)**: An embedded link to a custom-built dashboard. Products that want to demonstrate an interactive Power BI visual should use this type of Test Drive. All you need to upload here is your embedded Power BI URL.

See [Lead management overview](./commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md) for more information.

Remember to **Save** before moving on to the next section!

## Properties

The **Properties** page lets you define the categories and industries used to group your offer on the marketplace, your app version, and the legal contracts supporting your offer. Select **Save** after completing this page. 

### Category

Select a minimum of one and a maximum of three categories. These will be used to place your offer into the appropriate marketplace search areas. Be sure to call out how your offer supports these categories in the offer description. 

### Industry

You can optionally select up to two industries to help categorize your offer in the marketplace. If your offer is not specific to an industry, leave this section blank. Be sure to call out how your offer supports the selected industries in the offer description. 

### Applicable Dynamics 365 products

Select all of the Dynamics 365 products that this offer applies to.

### App version

Enter the version number of your offer. Customers will see this version listed on the offer's detail page. If you are only updating the version number due to marketing/descriptive changes, check the **Marketing only change** box. This allows the offer to bypass the certification and provisioning stages.

### Standard contract

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a Standard Contract template in order to help facilitate a transaction in the marketplace. 

Rather than crafting custom terms and conditions, you can choose to offer your software under the Standard Contract, which customers only need to vet and accept once. 

The Standard Contract can be found here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178

To use the Standard Contract, check the **Use Standard Contract?** box.

#### Terms of use

If you do not check the **Use Standard Contract?** box, you'll need to provide your own legal terms of use in the **Terms of use** field. Enter up to 10,000 characters of text, or, if your terms of use require a longer description, provide the URL where your additional license terms can be found. Customers will be required to accept these terms before they can try your app.

## Offer listing

The Offer listing page displays the languages in which your offer will be listed. Note that currently, **English (United States)** is the only available option.

You will need to define marketplace details (offer name, description, images, etc.) for each language/market. Select the language/market name to provide this info.

> [!NOTE]
> Offer listing content (such as the description, documents, screenshots, terms of use, etc.) is not required to be in English, as long as the offer description begins with the phrase, "This application is available only in [non-English language].” It is also acceptable to provide a *Useful Link URL* to offer content in a language other than the one used in the Offer listing content.

### Name

The name you enter here will be shown to customers as the title of your offer listing. This field is prepopulated with the text you entered for **Offer alias** when you created the offer, but you can change this value. This name may be trademarked (and you may include trademark or copyright symbols). The name can't be more than 50 characters and can't include any emojis.

### Short description

Provide a short description of your offer (up to 100 characters). This may be used in marketplace search results.

### Description

Provide a longer description of your offer (up to 3,000 characters). This description will be displayed to customers in the marketplace listing overview. Include your offer's value proposition, key benefits, category and/or industry associations, in-app purchase opportunities, and any required disclosures. 

Some tips for writing your description:  

- Clearly describe your offer's value proposition in the first few sentences of your description. Include the following in your value proposition:
  - Description of the product
  - The type of user that benefits from the product
  - Customer needs or pain that the product addresses
- Keep in mind that the first few sentences might be displayed in search engine results.  
- Do not rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Instead, focus on the value you deliver.  
- Use industry-specific vocabulary or benefit-based wording as much as possible. 
- Consider using HTML tags to format your description and make it more engaging.

### Search keywords

You can optionally enter up to three search keywords to help customers find your offer in the marketplace. For best results, try to use these keywords in your description as well.

### Products your app works with

If you want to let customers know that your app works with specific products, enter up to three product names here.

### Support URLs

This section lets you provide links to help customers understand more about your offer.

#### Help link

Enter the URL where customers can learn more about your offer.

#### Privacy policy URL

Enter the URL to your organization's privacy policy. You are responsible for ensuring your app complies with privacy laws and regulations, and for providing a valid privacy policy.

### Contacts

In this section, you must provide the name, email, and phone number for a **Support contact** and an **Engineering contact**. This info is not shown to customers, but will be available to Microsoft, and may be provided to CSP partners.

In the **Support contact** section, you must also provide the **Support URL** where CSP partners can find support for your offer.

### Supporting documents

You must provide at least one (and up to three) related marketing documents here, such as white papers, brochures, checklists, or presentations. These documents must be in .pdf format.

### Marketplace images

In this section, you can provide logos and images that will be used when showing your offer to customer. All images must be in .png format.

#### Store logos

You can provide your offer's logo in three sizes: **Small (48 x 48)**, **Large (216 x 216)**, and **Wide (255 x 115)**. The Small and Large sizes are required.

#### Hero

The hero image is optional. If you provide one, it must measure 815 x 290 pixels.

#### Additional marketplace listing resources

- [Best practices for marketplace offer listings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-offer-listing-best-practices)

## Availability

The **Availability** page gives you options about where and how to make your offer available.

### Markets

This section lets you specify the markets in which your offer should be available. To do so, select **Edit markets.** This will display the **Market selection** popup window.

By default, no markets are selected, but you must select at least one market in order to publish your offer. Click  **Select all** to make your offer available in every possible market, or select the specific markets that you want to add. Once you’ve finished, select **Save**.

Note that your selections here apply only to new acquisitions; if someone already has your app in a certain market, and you later remove that market, the people who already have the offer in that market can continue to use it, but no new customers in that market will be able to get your offer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to meet any local legal requirements, even if those requirements aren't listed here or in Partner Center.

Keep in mind that even if you select all markets, local laws and restrictions or other factors may prevent certain offers from being listed in some countries and regions.

### Preview audience

Before you publish your offer live to the broader marketplace offer, you'll first need to make it available to a limited **Preview audience**. Enter a **Hide key** (any string using only lowercase letters and/or numbers) here. Members of your preview audience can use this hide key as a token to view a preview of your offer in the marketplace.

Then, when you're ready to make your offer available and remove the preview restriction, you'll need to remove the **Hide key** and publish again.

## Technical configuration

The **Technical configuration** page defines the technical details used to connect to your offer. This connection enables us to provision your offer for the end customer if they choose to acquire it.

### Base license model

The base license model determines how customers are assigned your application in the CRM Admin Center. Select **Resource** for instance-based licensing or **User** if licenses are assigned one per tenant.

### Requires S2S outbound and CRM Secure Store Access

Check this box to enable configuration of CRM Secure Store or Server-to-Server (S2S) outbound access. Note that this feature requires specialized consideration from the Dynamics 365 Team during the certification phase. Microsoft will contact you to complete additional steps to support this feature.

### Application configuration URL

Provide the URL for the configuration web page that enables the customer to configure your app.

### CRM package

In the **URL of your package location** field, enter the URL of an Azure Storage account that contains the uploaded CRM package .zip file. This URL should include a read-only SAS key to allow Microsoft to pick up your package for verification.

Check the box labeled **There is more than one CRM package in my package file**, if applicable. If so, be sure to include all the packages in your .zip file.

### CRM package availability

In this section, select **+ Add region** to specify the geographic regions in which your CRM package will be available to customers. Deploying to the following sovereign regions require special permission and validation during the certification process: [Germany](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/germany/), [US Government Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome), and TIP.

By default, the **Application configuration URL** you entered above will be used for each region. If you prefer, you can enter a separate Application Configuration URL for one or more specific regions. 

## Test drive technical configuration

If you selected **Enable a test drive** in the [Offer setup](#offer-setup) page, you'll need to provide details here to let customers experience a test drive of your offer.

The **Test drive** page enables you to set up a demonstration (or "test drive") which will enable customers to try your offer before committing to purchase it. Learn more in the article [What is Test Drive?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/what-is-test-drive). If you no longer want to provide a test drive for your offer, return to the **[Offer setup](#offer-setup)** page and uncheck **Enable test drive**.

The following types of test drives are available, each with their own technical configuration requirements.

- [Azure Resource Manager](#technical-configuration-for-azure-resource-manager-test-drive)
- [Dynamics 365](#technical-configuration-for-dynamics-365-test-drive)
- [Logic app](#technical-configuration-for-logic-app-test-drive)
- [Power BI](#technical-configuration-not-required-for-power-bi-test-drives) (Technical configuration not required)

### Technical configuration for Azure Resource Manager test drive

A deployment template that contains all the Azure resources that comprise your solution. Products that fit this scenario use only Azure resources. Learn more about setting up an [Azure Resource Manager test drive](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/azure-resource-manager-test-drive).

- **Regions** (required): Currently there are 26 Azure-supported regions where your test drive can be made available. Typically, you will want to make your test drive available in the regions where you anticipate the largest number of customers, so that they can select the closest region for the best performance. You will need to make sure that your subscription is allowed to deploy all of the resources needed in each of the regions you are selecting.

- **Instances**: Select the type (hot or cold) and number of available instances, which will be multiplied by the number of regions where your offer is available.

**Hot**: This type of instance is deployed and awaiting access per selected region. Customers can instantly access *Hot* instances of a test drive, rather than having to wait for a deployment. The tradeoff is that these instances are always running on your Azure subscription, so they will incur a larger uptime cost. It is highly recommended to have at least one *Hot* instance, as most customers don't want to wait for full deployments, resulting in a drop-off in customer usage if no *Hot* instance is available.

**Cold**: This type of instance represents the total number of instances that can possibly be deployed per region. Cold instances require the entire Test Drive Resource Manager template to deploy when a customer requests the test drive, so *Cold* instances are much slower to load than *Hot* instances. The tradeoff is that you only have to pay for the duration of the test drive, it is *not* always running on your Azure subscription as with a *Hot* instance.

- **Test drive Azure Resource Manager template**: Upload the .zip containing your Azure Resource Manager template.  Learn more about creating an Azure Resource Manager template in the quickstart article [Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates by using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal).

- **Test drive duration** (required): Enter the length of time that the Test Drive will stay active, in # of hours. The Test Drive terminates automatically after this time period ends. This duration may only bet set by a whole number of hours (e.g. "2" hours, "1.5" is not valid).

### Technical configuration for Dynamics 365 test drive

Microsoft can remove the complexity of setting up a test drive by hosting and maintaining the service provisioning and deployment using this type of test drive. The configuration for this type of hosted test drive is the same regardless of whether the test drive is targeting a Business Central, Customer Engagement, or Operations audience.

- **Max concurrent test drives** (required): Set the maximum number of customers that can use your test drive at one time. Each concurrent user will consume a Dynamics 365 license while the test drive is active, so you will need to ensure that you have enough licenses available to support the maximum limit set. Recommended value of 3-5.

- **Test drive duration** (required): Enter the length of time that the Test Drive will stay active by defining the number of hours. After this many hours, the session will end and no longer consume one of your licenses. We recommend a value of 2-24 hours depending on the complexity of your offer. This duration may only bet set by a whole number of hours (e.g. "2" hours, "1.5" is not valid).  The user can request a new session if they run out of time and want to access the test drive again.

- **Instance URL** (required): The URL where the customer will begin their test drive. Typically the URL of your Dynamics 365 instance running your app with sample data installed (e.g. https://testdrive.crm.dynamics.com).

- **Instance Web API URL** (required): Retrieve the Web API URL for your Dynamics 365 instance by logging into your Microsoft 365 account and navigating to **Settings** \&gt; **Customization** \&gt; **Developer Resources** \&gt; **Instance Web API (Service Root URL)**, copy the URL found here (e.g. https://testdrive.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0).

- **Role name** (required): Provide the security role name you have defined in your custom Dynamics 365 test drive. This will be assigned to the user during their test drive (e.g. test-drive-role).

### Technical configuration for Logic app test drive

Any custom products should use this type of test drive deployment template which encompasses a variety of complex solution architectures. For more information about setting up Logic App test drives, visit [Operations](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppSource/blob/master/Setup-your-Azure-subscription-for-Dynamics365-Operations-Test-Drives.md) and [Customer Engagement](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppSource/wiki/Setting-up-Test-Drives-for-Dynamics-365-app) on GitHub.

- **Region** (required, single-selection dropdown list): Currently there are 26 Azure-supported regions where your test drive can be made available. The resources for your Logic app will be deployed in the region you select. If your Logic App has any custom resources stored in a specific region, make sure that region is selected here. The best way to do this is to fully deploy your Logic App locally on your Azure subscription in the portal and verify that it functions correctly before making this selection.

- **Max concurrent test drives** (required): Set the maximum number of customers that can use your test drive at one time. These test drives are already deployed, enabling customers to instantly access them without waiting for a deployment.

- **Test drive duration** (required): Enter the length of time that the Test Drive will stay active, in # of hours. The test drive terminates automatically after this time period ends.

- **Azure resource group name** (required): Enter the [Azure resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups) name where your Logic App test drive is saved.

- **Azure logic app name** (required): Enter the name of the Logic app that assigns the test drive to the user. This Logic app must be saved in the Azure resources group above.

- **Deprovision logic app name** (required): Enter the name of the Logic app that deprovisions the test drive once the customer is finished. This Logic app must be saved in the Azure resources group above.

### Technical configuration not required for Power BI test drives

Products that want to demonstrate an interactive Power BI visual can use an embedded link to share a custom-built dashboard as their test drive, no further technical configuration required. Learn more about setting up[Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-template-apps-overview) template apps.

### Deployment subscription details

In order to deploy the Test Drive on your behalf, please create and provide a separate, unique Azure Subscription. (Not required for Power BI test drives).

- **Azure subscription ID** (required for Azure Resource Manager and Logic apps): Enter the subscription ID to grant access to your Azure account services for resource usage reporting and billing. We recommend that you consider [creating a separate Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-create-subscription) to use for test drives if you don't have one already. You can find your Azure subscription ID by logging in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigating to the **Subscriptions** tab of the left-side menu. Selecting the tab will display your subscription ID (e.g. "a83645ac-1234-5ab6-6789-1h234g764ghty").

- **Azure AD tenant ID** (required): Enter your Azure Active Directory (AD) [tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in). To find this ID, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the Active Directory tab in the left-menu, select **Properties** , then look for the **Directory ID** number listed (e.g. 50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e). You can also look up your organization's tenant ID using your domain name URL at:  [https://www.whatismytenantid.com](https://www.whatismytenantid.com).

- **Azure AD tenant name** (required for Dynamic 365): Enter your Azure Active Directory (AD) name. To find this name, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the upper right corner your tenant name will be listed under your account name.

- **Azure AD app ID** (required): Enter your Azure Active Directory (AD) [application ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in). To find this ID, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the Active Directory tab in the left-menu, select **App registrations**, then look for the **Application ID** number listed (e.g. 50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e).

- **Azure AD app client secret** (required): Enter your Azure AD application [client secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#certificates-and-secrets). To find this value, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Select the **Azure Active Directory** tab in the left menu, select **App registrations**, then select your test drive app. Next, select **Certificates and secrets**, select **New client secret**, enter a description, select **Never** under **Expires**, then choose **Add**. Make sure to copy down the value. (Don't navigate away from the page before you do this, or else you won't have access to the value.)

### Test drive marketplace listings
