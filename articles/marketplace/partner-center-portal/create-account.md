# How to create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center

In order to publish offers to [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) via the [Commercial Marketplace portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers), you'll need to create a Partner Center account.  

In this article, we'll cover how to create a Partner Center account, including how to: 

- [Register using the Partner Center enrollment page](#register-for-an-account-using-the-enrollment-page)
- [Sign in with a work account](#sign-in-with-a-work-account)
- [Agree to the terms and conditions](#agree-to-terms-and-conditions) 
- [Provide your publisher profile](#provide-your-publisher-profile)

If you had an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) that has been migrated over to Partner Center, you do not need to create a new account. See [Publishers migrated from CPP](#publishers-migrated-from-cpp). 

## Prerequisites

To create an account on Partner Center, make sure you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf
- Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you)

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Register for an account using the enrollment page 

Visit the [**Welcome to Microsoft Partner Center**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv) enrollment page and review the registration information found there.

### Sign in with a work account

As part of your Partner Center enrollment, we ask that you link your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. By associating these accounts, your company employees can sign in to Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords.

For help with how to check on whether your company already has a work account, how to create a new work account, or how to set up multiple work accounts to use with Partner Center, visit [Your company work account and Partner Center](./company-work-accounts.md). 

### Agree to terms and conditions

You will need to agree to two sets of terms and conditions, including the [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=870457) and the [Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843476).


### Provide your Publisher profile

Your publisher profile includes your company name and MPN ID. If you have not yet done so, you will need to join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/commercial). By joining the Microsoft Partner Network, you will be provided with an MPN ID. 

You will also need to declare your Publisher ID at this time. Your Publisher ID will uniquely identify your company in the Azure Marketplace and AppSource. 

Once you've confirmed your publisher profile information, you can agree to the terms and conditions and create your Partner Center account by selecting **Accept and continue**. *You must be authorized to act on your company's behalf in order to accept these terms.*

You've now completed your Partner Center enrollment and will be taken to the [Commercial Marketplace Overview](./commercial-marketplace-overview.md) page.


## Publishers migrated from CPP

If your account was migrated from the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com), you do not need to create a new Partner Center account, but will have received a customized link to your new Partner Center account via email and in a banner notification displayed after logging in to your existing CPP account.

Once you've enabled your new Partner Center account by visiting this customized link, you can return to your account by visiting the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/) in Partner Center.

The publishing agreement and company profile information will be migrated to your new Partner Center account, along with any previously set up account payout profile information, user accounts and permissions, and active offers associated with your CPP account. 

Once your account is migrated from CPP to Partner Center, the Partner Center account becomes the master account to be used for any account updates, user management, permissions, and payout management. These account updates will automatically be synced back to your read-only CPP account until the CPP portal is eventually deprecated.
