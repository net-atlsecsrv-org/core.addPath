# Create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center

To publish your offers to [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you need to create an account in the commercial marketplace program in Partner Center. This article covers how to create a Partner Center account and how to add new publishers to the commercial marketplace program.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) that has been moved to Partner Center, you don't need to create a new account. For more information, see [For publishers who are moving from the Cloud Partner Portal](#for-publishers-who-are-moving-from-the-cloud-partner-portal).

## Before you begin

To create an account in Partner Center, make sure you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company's legal business name, address, and primary contact. This person can be you.

We'll verify this information during the account creation process.

There are two ways to create an account:

- If you're new to Partner Center and don't have a Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) account, go to [Create an account by using the Partner Center enrollment page](#create-an-account-by-using-the-partner-center-enrollment-page).
- If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network, create an account directly from Partner Center by going to [Create an account by using existing Partner Center enrollments](#create-an-account-by-using-existing-microsoft-partner-center-enrollments).

## Create an account by using the Partner Center enrollment page

Use this method if you're new to Partner Center and are not enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network. This section covers how to create a new Partner Center account, including how to:

- [Register on the Partner Center enrollment page](#register-on-the-partner-center-enrollment-page)
- [Sign in with a work account](#sign-in-with-a-work-account)
- [Agree to the terms and conditions](#agree-to-the-terms-and-conditions)
- [Provide your publisher profile](#provide-your-publisher-profile)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have a [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) account that has been moved to Partner Center, you don't need to create a new account. For more information, see [For publishers who are moving from the Cloud Partner Portal](#for-publishers-who-are-moving-from-the-cloud-partner-portal).

### Register on the Partner Center enrollment page

Review the information on the [**Welcome to Microsoft Partner Center**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) enrollment page, and then register for an account.

### Sign in with a work account

Sign in with a work account so that you can link your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. After you've associated these two accounts, your company's employees can sign in to Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords.

>[!NOTE]
>To see whether your company already has a work account, learn how to create a new work account, or learn how to set up multiple work accounts to use with Partner Center, visit [Your company work account and Partner Center](./company-work-accounts.md).

### Agree to the terms and conditions

As part of the registration process, you need to agree to the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560).

### Provide your publisher profile

Your publisher profile includes your company name and MPN ID. If you haven't yet done so, join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/commercial). After you join the Microsoft Partner Network, you'll be provided with an MPN ID.

1. Create a Publisher ID. Your Publisher ID uniquely identifies your company and your offers on Azure Marketplace and AppSource.

1. After you've confirmed your publisher profile information, agree to the terms and conditions, and then create your Partner Center account by selecting **Accept and continue**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To accept these terms, you must be authorized to act on your company's behalf.

    After you're enrolled, you're taken to the commercial marketplace overview page. The commercial marketplace account is displayed in the left pane. 
    
1. To verify that the commercial marketplace account is listed as registered,  select **Settings** > **Partner Settings** > **Programs**.

You've now created a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center. For more information, see [Commercial marketplace overview](./commercial-marketplace-overview.md). For help with adding publishers, see [Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

## Create an account by using existing Microsoft Partner Center enrollments

Use this section to create a commercial marketplace account if you already have an enrollment in Microsoft Partner Center.

There are two types of existing enrollments that you can use to set up your commercial marketplace account. Choose the one that applies to you:

- If you have an existing Microsoft Partner Network enrollment, create your account by using [Enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network](#what-if-im-already-enrolled-in-the-microsoft-partner-network).
- If you have an existing developer program enrollment, create your account by using [What if I'm already enrolled in a developer program?](#what-if-im-already-enrolled-in-a-developer-program).

For both enrollment types, you will:

- Sign in to Partner Center with your existing credentials.
- Enter your publishing profile information.

Be sure to have your account information handy.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) that has been moved to Partner Center, you don't need to create a new account. For more information, see [For publishers who are moving from the Cloud Partner Portal](#for-publishers-who-are-moving-from-the-cloud-partner-portal).

### What if I'm already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network?

If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network, use this section to create your account directly from Partner Center.

Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) with your Microsoft Partner Network account to link your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. After you've associated these two accounts, your company's employees can sign in to Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords.

>[!NOTE]
>To see whether your company already has a work account, learn how to create a new work account, or learn how to set up multiple work accounts to use with Partner Center, visit [Your company work account and Partner Center](./company-work-accounts.md).

After you sign in, finish setting up your account by doing the following:

>[!NOTE]
> You must have an **account admin** or a **global admin** role to sign in to Microsoft Partner Network.

1. From [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/), select **Settings** > **Partner Settings** > **Programs** > **Get Started**.

   Microsoft Partner Network detects your subscription and displays the **Publisher profile** pane.
   
1. Enter your company name and MPN ID.
1. Read the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560), and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To accept these terms, you must be authorized to act on your company's behalf.

    After you're enrolled, you're taken to the commercial marketplace overview page. The commercial marketplace account is displayed in the left pane. 
    
1. To verify that the commercial marketplace account is listed as registered,  select **Settings** > **Partner Settings** > **Programs**.

You've now created a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center. For more information, see [Commercial marketplace overview](./commercial-marketplace-overview.md). For help with adding publishers, see [Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

### What if I'm already enrolled in a developer program?

If you're already enrolled in a Partner Center developer program, use this section to create your account directly from Partner Center.

>[!NOTE]
>To register for the commercial marketplace under the same account that you're signed in with, you need to have registered in Partner Center with a company account. If you registered with an individual account, your commercial marketplace enrollment will appear under a new account.
>
>Individual accounts are for developers who are working on their own. Company accounts are for organizations and businesses. Company accounts give you access to submit apps with additional functionality. 
>
> To ascertain that you're authorized to set up the account for your company, we require additional verification of company accounts after you've registered. This verification can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and it often includes a phone call to your company. Both types of accounts allow you to submit apps, add-ins, and services. For more information, seeâ€¯[Account types, locations, and fees](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/account-types-locations-and-fees).

Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) with your Microsoft Partner Center account to enroll in the commercial marketplace program under the same account. By registering for the commercial marketplace with the same account, you can see both your existing program enrollments and your commercial marketplace enrollment in the left pane of Partner Center.

After you sign in to Partner Center, finish setting up your account by doing the following:

1. In Partner Center, select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs** > **Get Started**, and enter your work email address.
1. Complete the details on the **Publisher profile** page.
1. Read the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560), and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

    >[!Important]
    > To accept these terms, you must be authorized to act on your company's behalf.

    After you're enrolled, you're taken to the commercial marketplace overview page. The commercial marketplace account is displayed in the left pane. 
    
1. To verify that the commercial marketplace account is listed as registered,  select **Settings** > **Partner Settings** > **Programs**.

You've now created a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center. For more information, see [Commercial marketplace overview](./commercial-marketplace-overview.md). For help with adding publishers, see [add new publishers to the commercial marketplace](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

## For publishers who are moving from the Cloud Partner Portal

If your account has been migrated from the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com), you don't need to create a new Partner Center account. You should have received a customized link to your new Partner Center account both in email and in a banner notification after you signed in to your existing Cloud Partner Portal account.

After you've selected the customized link and enabled your new Partner Center account, you can return to your account by going to the [commercial marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview) in Partner Center.

The publishing agreement and company profile information are migrated to your new Partner Center account, along with any previously set up account payout profile information, user accounts and permissions, and active offers that are associated with your Cloud Partner Portal account.

After your account information is moved from the Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center, you'll no longer use the Cloud Partner Portal to make account updates, or to manage users, permissions, and billing. For a limited time, any account updates you make in Partner Center are automatically updated in your read-only Cloud Partner Portal account until it is eventually deprecated.

## Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace program

An organization can have multiple publishers associated with a commercial marketplace account. An existing user can add more publishers after signing in to Partner Center by selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers** > **Add Publisher**.

>[!NOTE]
>Before you add a new publisher, review your list of existing publishers by signing in to Partner Center and selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers**.

Additional users from the same Azure Active Directory tenant can add a new publisher by doing the following:

1. Kick off the sign-up flow at [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership).
2. Select **Sign in with a work account**, and enter your work email address.
3. Select the **Add Publisher** button.
4. Choose the MPN ID that you want to associate with the publisher.
5. Update the **Publisher details** on the form.

   * **Publisher name**: The name that's displayed in the commercial marketplace with the offer.  
   * **PublisherID**: An identifier that's used by Partner Center to uniquely identify the publisher. The default value for this field maps to an existing and unique Publisher ID in the system. Because the Publisher ID can't be reused, this field needs to be updated.  
   * **Contact information**: Update the contact information when necessary.

After this process is complete, you can manage the newly created publisher by going to the commercial marketplace account that's listed in the left pane. If you don't see the commercial marketplace account, refresh the page. The new publisher appears in the **Publishers** list.
