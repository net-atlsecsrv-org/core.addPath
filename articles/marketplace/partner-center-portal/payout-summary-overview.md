# Payout summary overview

The [Payout summary](./payout-summary.md) shows you details about the money you've earned with Microsoft. It also lets you know when you'll receive payments and how much you'll be paid.

If you sell offerings in the Azure Marketplace, you'll also see info on successful payouts in the Payout summary. For more information about Azure Marketplace payment, see [Azure Marketplace participation policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/participation-policy) and [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4xqkx).

> [!NOTE]
> To be eligible for payout, your proceeds must reach the [payment threshold](./payment-thresholds-methods-timeframes.md) of $50. For details about the payment threshold, see the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4xqkx).
