# Create a Dynamics 365 for Operations offer

This topic explains how to create a new Dynamics 365 for Operations offer. [Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/finance-and-operations) is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) service that supports advanced finance, operations, manufacturing, and supply chain management. All offers for Dynamics 365 for Operations must go through our certification process.

Before starting, [Create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center](create-account.md) if you haven't done so yet. Ensure your account is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

>[!NOTE]
> Once an offer has been published, edits to the offer made in Partner Center will only be updated in the system and store fronts after re-publishing. Ensure that you submit the offer for publication after you make changes.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-nav menu, select **Commercial Marketplace** > **Overview**.
3. On the Overview page, select **+ New offer** > **Dynamics 365 for operations**.

    ![Illustrates the left-navigation menu.](./media/new-offer-dynamics-365-operations.png)

> [!NOTE]
> After an offer is published, edits made to it in Partner Center only appear in storefronts after republishing the offer. Make sure you always republish after making changes.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the marketplace offer and Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. It can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if you enter **test-offer-1** here, the offer web address will be `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used in the marketplace and is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.

Select **Create** to generate the offer and continue.

## Offer setup

### How do you want potential customers to interact with this listing offer?

Select the option you'd like to use for this offer.

#### Get it now (free)

List your offer to customers for free by providing a valid URL (beginning with *http* or *https*) where they can access your app.  For example, `https://contoso.com/my-app`

#### Free trial (listing)

List your offer to customers with a link to a free trial by providing a valid URL (beginning with `http` or `https`) where they can get a trial. For example, `https://contoso.com/trial/my-app`. Offer listing free trials are created, managed, and configured by your service and do not have subscriptions managed by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> The tokens your application will receive through your trial link can only be used to obtain user information through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to automate account creation in your app. Microsoft accounts are not supported for authentication using this token.

#### Contact me

Collect customer contact information by connecting your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The customer will be asked for permission to share their information. These customer details, along with the offer name, ID, and marketplace source where they found your offer, will be sent to the CRM system that you've configured. For more information about configuring your CRM, see [Customer leads](#customer-leads).

### Test drive

A test drive is a great way to showcase your offer to potential customers by giving them the option to "try before you buy", resulting in increased conversion and the generation of highly qualified leads. To learn more, start with [What is test drive](../what-is-test-drive.md).

To enable a test drive for a fixed period of time, select the **Enable a test drive** check box. To remove test drive from your offer, clear this check box.

### Customer leads

Select **Save draft** before continuing.

## Availability

This page gives you options about where and how to make your offer available.

### Markets

This section lets you specify the markets in which your offer should be available. To do so, select **Edit markets,** which will display the **Market selection** popup window.

By default, no markets are selected. Select at least one market to publish your offer. Click  **Select all** to make your offer available in every possible market, or select the specific markets that you want to add. Once you've finished, select **Save**.

Your selections here apply only to new acquisitions; if someone already has your app in a certain market, and you later remove that market, the people who already have the offer in that market can continue to use it, but no new customers in that market will be able to get your offer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to meet any local legal requirements, even if those requirements aren't listed here or in Partner Center.

Keep in mind that even if you select all markets, local laws and restrictions or other factors may prevent certain offers from being listed in some countries and regions.

### Preview audience

Before you publish your offer live to the broader marketplace offer, you'll first need to make it available to a limited **Preview audience**. Enter a **Hide key** (any string using only lowercase letters and/or numbers) here. Members of your preview audience can use this hide key as a token to view a preview of your offer in the marketplace.

Then, when you're ready to make your offer available and remove the preview restriction, you'll need to remove the **Hide key** and publish again.

Select **Save draft** before continuing.

## Technical configuration

This page defines the technical details used to connect to your offer. This connection enables us to provision your offer for the end customer if they choose to acquire it.

### Solution identifier

Provide the solution identifier (GUID) for your solution.

To find your solution identifier:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), select **Solution Management**.
2. Select your solution, then look for the **Solution Identifier** in the **Package overview**. If the identifier is blank, select **Edit** and republish your package, then try again.

### Release version

Select the version of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations that this solution works with.

Select **Save draft** before continuing.

## Test drive technical configuration

This page lets you set up a demonstration ("test drive") that allows customers to try your offer before purchasing it. Learn more in [What is test drive](../what-is-test-drive.md).

To enable a test drive, select the **Enable a test drive** check box on the [Offer setup](#test-drive) tab. To remove test drive from your offer, clear this check box.

When you've finished setting up your test drive, select **Save draft** before continuing.

## Supplemental content

This page lets you provide additional information about your offer to help us validate your offer. This information is not shown to customers or published to the marketplace.

### Validation assets

Upload a [Customization Analysis Report (CAR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/dev-tools/customization-analysis-report) in this section. This report is generated by analyzing your customization and extension models, based on a predefined set of best practice rules.

This file must be in .xls or .xlsx format. If you have more than one report, you can upload a .zip file containing all of the reports.

### Does solution include localizations?

If it's your first time publishing this offer, you can:

- See the completion status for each section of the offer.
    - **Not started** – The section has not been touched and should be completed.
