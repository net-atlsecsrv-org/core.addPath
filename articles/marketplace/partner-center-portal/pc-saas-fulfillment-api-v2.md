# SaaS fulfillment APIs version 2 in the commercial marketplace

This article details the APIs that enable partners to sell their SaaS offers in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace. A publisher is required to implement integration with these APIs to publish a transactable SaaS offer in Partner Center.

## Managing the SaaS subscription life cycle

The commercial marketplace manages the entire life cycle of a SaaS subscription following its purchase by the end customer.  It uses the Landing page, Fulfillment APIs, Operations APIs and the webhook as a mechanism to drive the actual SaaS subscription activation and usage, updates, and subscription's cancellation.  The end customer's bill is based on the state of the SaaS subscription that Microsoft maintains. 

### States of a SaaS subscription

The states of a SaaS subscription and applicable actions are shown.

![Lifecycle of a SaaS Subscription in Marketplace](./media/saas-subscription-lifecycle-api-v2.png)

#### Purchased but not yet activated (*PendingFulfillmentStart*)

After an end customer (or CSP) purchases a SaaS offer in the marketplace, the publisher should be notified of the purchase so that a new SaaS account will be created and configured for the end customer on the publisher side.

For account creation to happen:

1. The customer needs to click on the **Configure** button that is available for a SaaS offer after its successful purchase in Microsoft AppSource or Azure portal. Or in the email that the customer will receive shortly after the purchase.
2. Then Microsoft notifies the partner about the purchase by opening in the new browser tab the landing page URL with the token parameter (the commercial marketplace purchase identification token).

An example of such call is `https://contoso.com/signup?token=<blob>`, whereas the Landing page URL for this SaaS offer in Partner Center is configured as `https://contoso.com/signup`. This token provides the publisher with an ID that uniquely identifies the SaaS purchase and the customer.

>[!NOTE]
>The publisher will not get notified of the SaaS purchase until the customer initiates the configuration process from Microsoft side.

The landing page url must be up and running 24x7, and ready to receive new calls from Microsoft at all times. If the landing page becomes unavailable, customers won't be able to sign up for the SaaS service and start using it.

Then, the *token* must be passed back to Microsoft from the publisher by calling the [SaaS Resolve API](#resolve-a-purchased-subscription), as the value of the `x-ms-marketplace-token header` header parameter.  As the result of the Resolve API call, the token is exchanged for the details of the SaaS purchase such as unique ID of the purchase, purchased offer ID, purchased plan ID, etc.

On the landing page, the customer should be logged on to the new or existing SaaS account via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Single Sign On (SSO).

The publisher should implement SSO log in to provide the user experience required by Microsoft for this flow.  Make sure to use multi-tenant Azure AD application, allow both work and school accounts or personal Microsoft accounts, when configuring the SSO.  This requirement only applies to the landing page, and for users who are redirected to the SaaS service when already logged in with Microsoft credentials. It doesn't apply to all logins to the SaaS service.

> [!NOTE]
>If SSO log in requires that an admin grant permission to an app, the description of the offer in Partner Center must disclose that admin-level access is required. This is to comply with [commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10003-authentication-options).

Once logged in, the customer should complete the SaaS configuration on the publisher side. Then the publisher must call [Activate Subscription API](#activate-a-subscription) to send a signal to Marketplace that the provisioning of the SaaS account is complete.
This will start the customer's billing cycle. If the Activate Subscription API call is not successful, the customer is not billed for the purchase.


![API calls for a provisioning scenario](./media/saas-update-api-v2-calls-from-saas-service-a.png) 

#### Active (Subscribed)

This state is the steady state of a provisioned SaaS subscription. Once the [Activate Subscription API](#activate-a-subscription) call is processed on Microsoft side, the SaaS subscription is marked as Subscribed. The SaaS service is now ready to be used by the customer on the publisher's side, and the customer is billed.

When the SaaS subscription is already active, and the customer chooses to launch **Manage** SaaS experience from the Azure portal or M365 Admin Center, **Landing page URL** is again called by Microsoft with *token* parameter, same as in the activate flow.  The publisher should distinguish between new purchases and management of existing SaaS accounts and handle this landing page URL call accordingly.

#### Being updated (Subscribed)

This action means that an update to an existing active SaaS subscription is been processed by both Microsoft and the publisher. Such an update can be initiated by:

- the customer from the commercial marketplace.
- the CSP from the commercial marketplace.
- the customer from the publisher's SaaS site (doesn't apply to CSP made purchases).

Two types of updates are available for a SaaS subscription:

- Update plan when the customer chooses another plan for the subscription.
- Update quantity when the customer changes the number of purchased seats for the subscription

Only an active subscription can be updated. While the subscription is being updated, its state remains Active on the Microsoft side.

##### Update initiated from the marketplace

In this flow, the customer changes the subscription plan or quantity of seats from the Azure portal or M365 Admin Center.  

1. Once an update is entered, Microsoft will call the publisher's webhook URL, configured in **Connection webhook** field in Partner Center, with an appropriate value for *action* and other relevant parameters.  
1. The publisher side should make the required changes to the SaaS service, and notify Microsoft when the change is complete by calling the [Update Status of Operation API](#update-the-status-of-an-operation).
1. If the Patch is sent with fail status, the update process will not be completed on Microsoft side.  The SaaS subscription will be left with existing plan and quantity of seats.

> [!NOTE]
> The publisher should invoke PATCH to [update the status of operation API](#update-the-status-of-an-operation) with a Failure/Success response *within a 10-second time window* after receiving the webhook notification. If PATCH of operation status is not received within the 10 seconds, the change plan is *automatically patched as Success*. 

The sequence of API calls for a Marketplace initiated update scenario is shown below.

![API calls for a marketplace initiated update](./media/saas-update-status-api-v2-calls-marketplace-side.png)

##### Update initiated from the publisher

In this flow, the customer changes the subscription plan or quantity of seats purchased from the SaaS service itself. 

1. The publisher code must call the [Change Plan API](#change-the-plan-on-the-subscription) and/or [Change Quantity API](#change-the-quantity-of-seats-on-the-saas-subscription) before making the requested change on the publisher side. 

1. Microsoft will apply the change to the subscription, and then notify the publisher via **Connection Webhook** to apply the same change.  

1. Only then the publisher should make the required change to the SaaS subscription, and notify Microsoft when the change is done by calling [Update Status of Operation API](#update-the-status-of-an-operation).

The sequence of API calls for the publisher-side initiated update scenario.

![API calls for a publisher side initiated update](./media/saas-update-status-api-v2-calls-publisher-side.png)

#### Suspended (*Suspended*)

This state indicates that a customer's payment for the SaaS service has not been received. The publisher will be notified of this change in SaaS subscription status by Microsoft. The notification is done via a call to webhook with *action* parameter set to *Suspended*.

The publisher may or may not make changes to the SaaS service on the publisher side. We recommend that the publisher makes this information available to the suspended customer and limits or blocks customer's access to the SaaS service.  There is a probability the payment will never be received.

Microsoft gives the customer a 30-day grace period before automatically canceling the subscription. When a subscription is in Suspended state:

* The SaaS account must be kept in a recoverable state by the ISV. Full functionality can be restored without any loss of data or settings.
* Expect to get a reinstate request for this subscription if the payment is received during the grace period, or a de-provisioning request at the end of the grace period, both via the webhook mechanism.

The subscription state is changed to Suspended on Microsoft side before the publisher takes any action. Only Active subscriptions can be suspended.

#### Reinstated (*Suspended*)

The subscription is being reinstated.

This action indicates the customer's payment instrument became valid again, and a payment is made for the SaaS subscription.  The subscription is being reinstated. In this case: 

1. Microsoft calls webhook with an *action* parameter set to the *Reinstate* value.  
1. The publisher makes sure this subscription is fully operational again on the publisher side.
1. The publisher calls the [Patch Operation API](#update-the-status-of-an-operation) with success status.  
1. Then the Reinstate will be successful and the customer will be billed again for the SaaS subscription. 
1. If the patch is sent with fail status, the reinstatement process will not be completed on Microsoft side. The subscription will remain Suspended.

If the patch is sent with fail status, the reinstatement process will not be completed on Microsoft side.  The subscription will remain Suspended.

Only a suspended subscription can be reinstated.  While a SaaS subscription is being reinstated, its state remains Suspended.  Once this operation is completed, the subscription's status will become Active.

#### Renewed (*Subscribed*)

At the end of subscription term (after a month or a year), the SaaS subscription is being automatically renewed by Microsoft.  The default for auto-renewal setting is *true* for all SaaS subscriptions. Active SaaS subscriptions will continue to be renewed with regular cadence. Microsoft does not notify the publisher when a subscription is being renewed. A customer can turn off automatic renewal for a SaaS subscription via the M365 Admin Portal or via Azure portal.  In this case, the SaaS subscription will be automatically canceled at the end of the current billing term.  Customers can also cancel the SaaS subscription at any point in time.

Only active subscriptions are automatically renewed.  Subscriptions stay active during the renewal process, and if automatic renewal succeeds.  After renewal, the start and end dates of the subscription term will be updated to new term's dates.

If an auto-renew fails because of an issue with payment, the subscription will become Suspended.  The publisher will be notified.

#### Canceled (*Unsubscribed*) 

Subscriptions reach this state in response to either an explicit customer or CSP action by the cancellation of a subscription from the publisher site, Azure portal, or M365 Admin Center.  A subscription can also be canceled implicitly, due to nonpayment of dues, after being in Suspended state for 30 days.

Upon receiving a cancellation webhook call, publisher should retain customer data for recovery on request for at least seven days. Only then, customer data can be deleted.

A SaaS subscription can be canceled at any point in its life cycle. Once canceled, a subscription cannot be reactivated.

## API reference

This section documents the SaaS Subscription and Operations APIs.

**Subscription APIs** should be used to handle the SaaS subscription life cycle from purchase to cancellation.

**Operations APIs** should be used to:

* verify and acknowledge the processed webhook calls
* get a list of apps pending operations that are waiting to be acknowledged by the publisher

### Enforcing TLS 1.2 Note

TLS version 1.2 version will be enforced soon as the minimal version for HTTPS communications. Make sure you use this TLS version in your code.  TLS version 1.0 and 1.1 will soon be deprecated.

### Subscription APIs

#### Resolve a purchased subscription

The resolve endpoint enables the publisher to exchange the marketplace purchase identification token (referred to as *token* in [Purchased but not yet activated](#purchased-but-not-yet-activated-pendingfulfillmentstart)) to a persistent purchased SaaS subscription ID and its details.

When a customer is redirected to the partner's Landing Page URL, the customer identification token is passed as *token* parameter in this URL call. The partner is expected to use this token and make a request to resolve it. The resolve API response contains the SaaS subscription ID and other details to uniquely identify the purchase. The *token* provided with the Landing page URL call is usually valid for 24 hours. If the *token* that you receive has already expired, we recommend that you provide the following guidance to the end customer:

"We couldn't identify this purchase, please reopen this SaaS subscription in Azure portal or in M365 Admin Center and click "Configure Account" or "Manage Account" button again."

Calling Resolve API will return subscription details and status for SaaS subscriptions in all supported statuses.

#### List available plans

Retrieves all plans for a SaaS offer identified by the `subscriptionId` of a specific purchase of this offer.  Use this call to get a list of all private and public plans that the beneficiary of a SaaS subscription can update for the subscription.  The plans returned will be available in the same geography as the already purchased plan.

This call returns a list of plans available for that customer in addition to the one already purchased.  The list can be presented to an end customer on the publisher site.  An end customer can change the subscription plan to any one of the plans in the returned list.  Changing plan to one not listed in the list will fail.

#### Change the quantity of seats on the SaaS subscription

Update (increase or decrease) the quantity of seats purchased for a SaaS subscription.  The publisher must call this API when the number of seats is changed from the publisher side for a SaaS subscription created in marketplace.

Quantity of seats cannot be more than what is allowed in the current plan.  In this case, the plan should be changed before changing quantity.

#### Cancel a subscription

Unsubscribe a specified SaaS subscription.  The publisher doesn't have to use this API and we recommend that the customers be directed to marketplace, to cancel SaaS subscriptions.

If the publisher decides to implement the cancellation of SaaS subscription purchased in marketplace on publisher's side, he must call this API.  After the completion of this call, the subscription's status will become *Unsubscribed* on Microsoft side.

If a subscription is canceled within the following grace periods, the customer will not be billed:

* 24 hours for a monthly subscription after activation.
* 14 days for a yearly subscription after activation.

The customer will be billed if a subscription is canceled after the above grace periods.  Once the cancellation succeeds, the customer will immediately lose access to the SaaS subscription on Microsoft side.

## Implementing a webhook on the SaaS service

When creating a transactable SaaS offer in Partner Center, the partner provides the **Connection Webhook** URL to be used as an HTTP endpoint.  This webhook is called by Microsoft using the POST HTTP call to notify the publisher side of following events that happen on Microsoft side:

* When the SaaS subscription is in Subscribed status:
    * ChangePlan 
    * ChangeQuantity
    * Suspend
    * Unsubscribe
* When SaaS subscription is in Suspended status:
    * Reinstate
    * Unsubscribe

The publisher must implement a webhook in the SaaS service to keep the SaaS subscription status consistent with the Microsoft side.  The SaaS service is required to call the get operation API to validate and authorize the webhook call and payload data before taking action based on the webhook notification.  The publisher should return HTTP 200 to Microsoft as soon as the webhook call is processed.  This value acknowledges that the webhook call has been received successfully by the publisher.

>[!Note]
>The webhook url service must be up and running 24x7, and ready to receive new calls from Microsoft time at all times.  Microsoft does have a retry policy for the webhook call (500 retries over 8 hours), but if the publisher does not accept the call and return a response, the operation that webhook notifies about will eventually fail on Microsoft side.

*Webhook payload examples:*

```json
// end customer changed a quantity of purchased seats for a plan on Microsoft side
{
  "id": "<guid>", // this is the operation ID to call with get operation API
  "activityId": "<guid>", // do not use
  "subscriptionId": "guid", // The GUID identifier for the SaaS resource which status changes
  "publisherId": "contoso", // A unique string identifier for each publisher
  "offerId": "offer1", // A unique string identifier for each offer
  "planId": "silver", // the most up-to-date plan ID
  "quantity": " 25", // the most up-to-date number of seats, can be empty if not relevant
  "timeStamp": "2019-04-15T20:17:31.7350641Z", // UTC time when the webhook was called
  "action": "ChangeQuantity", // the operation the webhook notifies about
  "status": "Success" // Can be either InProgress or Success
}
```

```json
// end customer's payment instrument became valid again, after being suspended, and the SaaS subscription is being reinstated
{
  "id": "<guid>",

## Development and testing

To start the development process, we recommend creating dummy API responses on the publisher side.  These responses can be based on sample responses provided in this document.

When the publisher is ready for the end to end testing:

* Publish a SaaS offer to a limited preview audience and keep it in preview stage.
* This offer should have a plan with 0 price, so not to trigger actual billing expense while testing.  Another option is to set a non-zero price and cancel all test purchases within 24 hours.
* Ensure all flows are invoked end to end, just like a customer would purchase the offer.
* If the partner wants to test full purchase and billing flow, do so with offer that is priced above 0$.  The purchase will be billed, and an invoice will be generated.

A purchase flow can be triggered from the Azure portal or Microsoft AppSource sites, depending on where the offer is being published.

*Change plan*, *change quantity*, and *unsubscribe* actions are tested from the publisher side.  From Microsoft side, *unsubscribe* can be triggered from both the Azure portal and Admin Center (the portal where Microsoft AppSource purchases are managed).  *Change quantity and plan* can only be triggered from Admin Center.
