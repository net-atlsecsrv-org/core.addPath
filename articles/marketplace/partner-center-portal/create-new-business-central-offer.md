# Create a Dynamics 365 Business Central offer

This article explains how to create a new Dynamics 365 Business Central offer. [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central) is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that handles a wide range of business processes, including finance, operations, supply chain, CRM, and project management and electronic commerce. Premium packages also support classic deployment model and manufacturing. All offers for Dynamics 365 Business Central must go through our certification process.

Before starting, [Create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center](create-account.md) if you haven't done so yet. Ensure your account is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-nav menu, select **Commercial Marketplace** > **Overview**.
3. On the Overview page, select **+ New offer** > **Dynamics 365 business central**.

> [!NOTE]
> After an offer is published, edits made to it in Partner Center only appear in online stores after republishing the offer. Make sure you always republish after making changes.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the marketplace offer and Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- The Offer ID combined with the Publisher ID must be under 40 characters in length.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. It can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces. For example, if your Publisher ID is testpublisherid and you enter **test-offer-1** here, the offer web address will be `https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/testpublisherid.test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used in the marketplace and is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.
- The Offer alias can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Select **Create** to generate the offer and continue.
