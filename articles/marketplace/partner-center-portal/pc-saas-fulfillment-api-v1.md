# SaaS Fulfillment APIs version 1 (deprecated)

This article explains how to create a SaaS offer with APIs. The APIs, composed of REST methods and endpoints, are necessary for allowing subscriptions to your SaaS offer if you have Sell
through Azure selected.  

> [!WARNING]
> This initial version of the SaaS Fulfillment API is deprecated; instead, use [SaaS Fulfillment API V2](./pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md).  This intial version of the API is currently being maintained only to serve existing publishers. 

The following APIs are provided to help you integrate your SaaS service with Azure:

-   Resolve
-   Subscribe
-   Convert
-   Unsubscribe


## API methods and endpoints

The following sections describe the API methods and endpoints available for enabling subscriptions for a SaaS offer.


### Marketplace API endpoint and API version

The endpoint for Azure Marketplace API is `https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com`.

The current API version is `api-version=2017-04-15`.


### Resolve subscription

POST action on resolve endpoint allows users to resolve a marketplace token to a persistent Resource ID.  The Resource ID is the unique identifier for SAAS subscription. 

When a user is redirected to an ISV's website, the URL contains a token in the query parameters. The ISV is expected to use this token, and make a request to resolve it. The response contains the unique SAAS subscription ID, name, offer ID, and plan for the resource. This token is valid for an hour only.
