# SaaS Fulfillment APIs version 1 (deprecated)

> [!WARNING]
> This initial version of the SaaS Fulfillment API is deprecated; instead, use [SaaS Fulfillment API V2](./pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md).  This initial version of the API is currently being maintained only to serve existing publishers. 

The documentation for this version of the API is no longer available. If you feel that you need to access it, please contact saas-api-v1@microsoft.com.

For all new developments, move to [V2 version of the API](./pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md) even if you already use V1. This version will be completely deprecated in the future.
