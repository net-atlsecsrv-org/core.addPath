This article describes how to set up Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (previously Dynamics CRM Online), read more about the change [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/admin/on-prem-server-based-sharepoint-online) to process sales leads from your marketplace offer. 

>[!Note]
>These instructions are specific for the Microsoft hosted cloud Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement environment. Connecting directly to a Dynamics on-prem environment is not currently supported, there are other options for you to receive leads such as configuring an [https endpoint](./commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https.md) or an [Azure table](./commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md) to receive leads.

The following user permissions are needed for completing the steps in this article:

## Configure user permissions

To write leads into your Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement instance, you must share a service account with us, and configure permissions for the account.

Use the following steps to create the service account and assign permissions. You can use **Azure Active Directory** or **Office 365**.

>[!Note]
>Based on the authentication option you select, you can skip to the corresponding instructions based on your choice. See [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics#azure-active-directory) or [Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics#office-365).

### Azure Active Directory

We recommend this option because you get the added benefit of never needing to update your username/password to keep getting leads. To use the Azure Active Directory option, you provide the App ID, Application Key, and Directory ID from your Active Directory application.

Use the following steps to configure Azure Active Directory for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then select the Azure Active Directory service from the left navigation.

2. Select **Properties** from the Azure Active Directory left navigation, and copy the **Directory ID** value on that page. Save this value, as it is the *Directory ID* value that you need to provide in the publishing portal to receive leads for your marketplace offer.

    ![Azure Active Directory - Properties](./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics/aad-properties.png)

3. Select **App registrations** from the Azure Active Directory left navigation, and then select **New registration** on that page.
4. Enter a name for the application name. Provide a meaningful application name.
5. Under Supported account types, select **Accounts in any organizational directory**.
6. Under Redirect URI, select **Web** and provide a URI (such as `https://contosoapp1/auth`). 
7. Select **Register**.

    ![Register an application](./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics/register-an-application.png)

8. Now that your application is registered, access the application's overview page and copy the **Application (client) ID** value on that page. Save this value, as it is the *Application (client) ID* value that you need to provide in the publishing portal and in Dynamics to receive leads for your marketplace offer.

    ![Application (client) ID](./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics/application-id.png)

9. Select **Certificates and secrets** from the app's left navigation, and select **New client secret** on that page. Enter a meaningful description for the client secret, and select the **Never** option under Expires. Select **Add** to create the client secret.

    ![Application - Certification and Secrets](./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics/aad-certificates-secrets.png)

10. As soon as the client secret is successfully created, **Copy the client secret value**. You won't be able to retrieve the value after you navigate away from the page. Save this value, as it is the *Client secret* value you need to provide in the publishing portal to receive leads for your marketplace offer. 
11. Select **API permissions** from the apps' left navigation, and then select **Add a permission**.
12. Select Microsoft APIs, and then select **Dynamics CRM** as the API.
13. Under *What type of permissions does your application require*, make sure **Delegated permissions** is selected. Check the permission for **user_impersonation** *Access Common Data Service as organization users*. Select **Add permissions**.

15. Access Settings by selecting the gear icon, and **Advanced Settings** on the top navigation bar.
16. Once on Settings page, access the Setting menu from the top navigation bar and select **Security**.
17. Once on the Security page, select **Users**.  On the Users page, select the "Enabled Users" dropdown to switch over to **Application Users**.

19. In **New User**, make sure the USER: APPLICATION USER is selected. Provide a username, full name, and email address for the user that you want to use with this connection. Also, paste in the **Application ID** for the app you created in the Azure portal from step 8. Select **Save and Close** to complete adding the user.

### Office 365

If you don't want to use Azure Active Directory, you can register a new user on the *Microsoft 365 admin center*. You'll be required to update your username/password every 90 days to continue getting leads.

    * Provide a username
    * Provide a password, and deselect the "Make this user change their password when they first sign in" option.
    * Select "User (no administrator access)" as the role for the user.
    * Select "Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement plan" as product license shown in the next screen capture. You'll be charged for the license you choose. 

Save these values as they are the *Username and Password* values you need to provide in the publishing portal to receive leads for your marketplace offer.
