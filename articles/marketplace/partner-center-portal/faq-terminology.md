# Frequently asked questions and terminology for commercial marketplace analytics

This article addresses commonly asked questions about analytics messages in Partner Center and also provides a dictionary of analytics terminology.

## Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to commonly asked questions about **No Analytics Available Yet** messages in Partner Center.

**I am unable to view my analytics data in Partner Center. When I access these pages, I see the message below. Why is this?**

![No data for your offers yet](./media/analytics-faq-no-data.png)

Why you may be getting this message:

- No acquisitions currently exist for your published offers in marketplace. This can mean that your offers are live in marketplace and gaining views from customers in the product display pages, but customers haven't yet taken action to purchase and deploy them.
- The publishing of your offer might be in process and isn't live yet. Only live offers can be acquired by customers. To check the status of your offers, see Overview in the [Analyze dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary). For more information, see [Summary Dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics](./summary-dashboard.md).
- Your offers may be listed as **Contact Me**, which are list-only offers and cannot be purchased by customers in the marketplace. Although these offers generate leads and are shared with you, orders aren't created for these offers as they cannot be purchased. To check your offer listing type, go to setup page.

**I know I have analytics data, but the message below is appearing:**

![No data for given date range](./media/analytics-faq-data-range.png)

If you're receiving this message, it means  you have analytics data but there isn't data for the date range you selected. Select a different date range or custom date range to view any data since 2010. For more information, see the Date Range section of [Summary Dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics](./summary-dashboard.md).
