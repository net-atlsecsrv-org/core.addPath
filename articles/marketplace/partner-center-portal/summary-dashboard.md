# Summary dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics

This article provides information on the Summary dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays graphs, trends, and values of aggregate data that summarize marketplace activity for your offers.

To access the Summary dashboard, open the **[Analyze dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary)** under Commercial Marketplace.

>[!NOTE]
> For detailed definitions of analytics terminology, see [Frequently asked questions and terminology for commercial marketplace analytics](./faq-terminology.md).

## Summary dashboard

The **Summary** dashboard presents an overview based on each offer type. **Insights** show critical information at a glance and provide a broad view of the sales activity of your offers. You can visualize these reports using the **Summary** dashboard. This article goes into more details on each of the following elements:

- [Date range](#date-range)
- [Summary section](#summary-section)
- [Customers by geography](#customers-by-geography)
- [Growth trend charts](#growth-trend-charts)
- [Customer leaderboard](#customer-leaderboard)
- [Seat count trend](#seat-count-trend)
- [Free trials SaaS orders trend](#free-trials-saas-orders-trend)

## Elements of the Summary dashboard

The following sections describe how to use the summary dashboard and how to read the data.

### Date range

You can find a date range selection at the top-right corner of each page. Customize the output of the **Summary** page graphs by selecting a date range based on the past 3, 6, or 12 months, or by selecting a custom date range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default date range is six months.

### Summary section

The Summary section displays a count of all orders created, customers acquired, and usage reported during the selected date range. Partial current month will be excluded from the computation of these metrics. For example: If you have selected the 6M time frame, the usage hours are computed for the six months prior to the current month. If a custom date range is selected, a partial amount from the current month will be excluded from the computation.

#### Reading the summary section

- **Orders**: Count of all orders purchased (excludes canceled orders) for offers you've published so far.
- **Customers**: Count of all customers who purchased your offers and have at least one non canceled order.
- **Normalized usage hours**: Defined as the usage hours normalized to account for the number of VM cores ([number of VM cores] x [hours of raw usage]). VMs designated as "SHAREDCORE" use 1/6 (or 0.1666) as the [number of VM cores] multiplier.
- **Raw usage hours**: The amount of time VMs have been running in terms of hours. The percentage value next to **total orders**, **total customers**, **normalized usage hours**, **raw usage hours**, **page visits**, and **call to actions** represent the amount of usage growth for the selected date range ([last month usage â€“ first month usage])/ first month usage). As described above, a partial amount of the current month will be excluded from this metric.
- **Growth trends**: If you hover over the columns of the chart, bar graphs display the value for each month.
- **Green triangle pointing upward**: Indicates a positive growth trend.
- **Red triangle pointing downward**: Indicates a negative growth trend relative to the previous month.

### Customers by geography

The **Customers by geography** heatmap displays a customer count on a world map.

- You can zoom into a specific location.
- The heatmap has a supplementary grid to view the details of customer count, order count, normalized usage hours in the specific location.
- You can search and select a country/region in the grid to zoom to the location in the map. Revert to the original view by pressing the **Home** button in the map.
- A **new** customer has purchased one of your offers for the first time during the month within the selected date range.

### Growth trend charts

You can view trends based on the growth of your **orders purchased** (includes canceled orders), **customers acquired** (includes lost customers), and **usage** reported, which are displayed month by month according to the selected date range. You can further analyze these trends by selecting links below the chart, which navigate to the respective **order**, **usage**, **customer**, or **Marketplace Insights** pages.
