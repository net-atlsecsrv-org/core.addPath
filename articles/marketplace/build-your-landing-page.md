# Build your landing page

A landing page on your company website is a gateway from your demand generation activities to your listing in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).

Begin by identifying your goals. For your solutions, choose your target customer and the action that your customer will take. Your solution might include the following actions:
*   Test-drive the solution
*   Get a solution now

You can reference your landing page across multiple marketing tactics. You might use the following marketing tactics: 
*   Events
*   Webcasts
*   Social media
*   White papers
*   Technical training sessions
*   Press releases

The more consistent you are in your messaging and in your call to action, the easier it is for your customers to find your solution.

## Recommendations

When you have a campaign plan ready, create your landing page in the Marketplace. The following table describes ways you can help maximize the effectiveness of your landing page: 

| Best practice | Avoid |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Communicate what customer problem your solution solves, and how you use Azure to make it happen** | Not communicating the ways in which your solution works with Azure. |
| **Create a short, easy-to-remember URL** | Using long URLs. Long URLs are not memorable and are hard to locate. |
| **Add relevant visual content, like a customer testimonial video or a solution architecture** | Using too much text causes your customers to ignore your content and stop exploring.|
| **Create a clear call to action to direct visitors to your Marketplace catalog page** | Having too many links or actions on the page. |
| **Put your call to action in a header or clearly delineated section** | Embedding the links to your listing in the Marketplace in a paragraph of text. |
| **Research the best keywords and optimize the page for search** | Assuming that your product name generates higher search rankings. |
| **Use keywords from your advertising campaigns** | Using many different keywords across your web properties dilutes your advertising investments. |
| **Put relevant product names and keywords "above the fold"** | Making users scroll to see the product or solution that you are showcasing. |
| **Use brand imagery to validate your solution in accordance with Microsoft branding guidelines, such as Azure Certified** | Using Microsoft brand imagery that is not approved. |
