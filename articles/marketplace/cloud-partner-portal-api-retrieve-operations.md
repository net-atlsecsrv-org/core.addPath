# Retrieve operations

> [!NOTE]
> The Cloud Partner Portal APIs are integrated with and will continue working in Partner Center. The transition introduces small changes. Review the changes listed in [Cloud Partner Portal API Reference](./cloud-partner-portal-api-overview.md) to ensure your code continues working after transitioning to Partner Center. CPP APIs should only be used for existing products that were already integrated before transition to Partner Center; new products should use Partner Center submission APIs.

Retrieves all the operations on the offer or to get a particular operation for the specified operationId. The client may use
query parameters to filter on running operations.
