## How we convert currency

For all paid offer types, you have the option of entering prices in USD or uploading prices in local currency. Prices entered in USD are automatically converted to local currency when the page is saved. The rates Partner Center uses are updated daily. You can export the prices and review the converted equivalents.

To adjust any price before you publish, just export the pricing spreadsheet, modify it, and upload it with changes.

> [!NOTE]
> After a price for a market in your plan is published, it can't be changed. To ensure that the prices are right before you publish them, export the pricing spreadsheet and review the prices in each market.

The price of an offer is always shown to customers in their local currency. The price you select in Partner Center is converted to the local currency of customers according to the exchange rate at the time you saved the price in Partner Center. The price shown to customers in the online stores doesn't change, unless you republish your offer.

Microsoft receives payments from customers in their local currency, and pays you in the currency you selected in Partner Center. Microsoft converts the customer local currency using the exchange rate of the day of purchase.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft converts offer prices using the Microsoft Treasury exchange rates.

## Retrieving currency information by API

Individual prices (which, depending on how they were set, may have been influenced by the exchange rates on the day they were saved) can be retrieved using an API; currency information can't.
