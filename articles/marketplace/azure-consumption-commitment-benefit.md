# Azure consumption commitment benefit

A select set of Microsoft commercial marketplace offers will contribute towards your organization’s Microsoft Azure consumption commitment if your organization has one of these agreements:

- Microsoft Azure consumption commitment (MACC)
- Azure commit to consume (CtC)

We validate all offers that participate in this program to ensure you receive high-quality solutions.

To take advantage of this benefit, simply purchase a qualifying offer on Azure Marketplace using a subscription that’s related to your Azure agreement. Azure prepayment and monetary commitments are not eligible for this benefit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Exclusions may apply to CtC agreements signed prior to this marketplace benefit. If you have questions about eligibility, contact your Microsoft account executive.
