# How to plan a SaaS offer for the commercial marketplace

This article explains the different options and requirements for publishing software as a service (SaaS) offers to the Microsoft commercial marketplace. SaaS offers let you deliver and license software solutions to your customers via online subscriptions. As a SaaS publisher, you manage and pay for the infrastructure required to support your customers' use of your offer. This article will help you prepare your offer for publishing to the commercial marketplace with Partner Center.

## Listing options

As you prepare to publish a new SaaS offer, you need to decide which _listing_ option to choose. The listing option you choose determines what additional information you’ll need to provide as you create your offer in Partner Center. You will define your listing option on the  **Offer setup** page as explained in [How to create a SaaS offer in the commercial marketplace](create-new-saas-offer.md).

The following table shows the listing options for SaaS offers in the commercial marketplace.

| Listing option | Transaction process |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Contact me | The customer contacts you directly from information in your listing.``*`` |
| Free trial | The customer is redirected to your target URL via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).``*`` |
| Get it now (Free) | The customer is redirected to your target URL via Azure AD.``*`` |
| Sell through Microsoft  | Offers sold through Microsoft are called _transactable_ offers. An offer that is transactable is one in which Microsoft facilitates the exchange of money for a software license on the publisher’s behalf. We bill SaaS offers using the pricing model you choose, and manage customer transactions on your behalf. Azure infrastructure usage fees are billed to you, the partner, directly. You should account for infrastructure costs in your pricing model. This is explained in more detail in [SaaS billing](#saas-billing) below.  |
|||

``*`` Publishers are responsible for supporting all aspects of the software license transaction, including but not limited to order, fulfillment, metering, billing, invoicing, payment, and collection.

For more information about these listing options, see [Commercial marketplace transact capabilities](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md).

After your offer is published, the listing option you chose for your offer appears as a button in the upper-left corner of your offer’s listing page. For example, the following screenshot shows an offer listing page in Azure Marketplace with the **Get it now** button.

![Illustrates an offer listing in the online store.](./media/saas/listing-options-saas.png)

## Technical requirements

The technical requirements differ depending on the listing option you choose for your offer.

The _Contact me_ listing option has no technical requirements. You have the option to connect a customer relationship management (CRM) system to manage customer leads. This is described in the [Customer leads](#customer-leads) section, later in this article.

The _Get it now (Free)_, _Free trial_, and _Sell through Microsoft_ listing options have the following technical requirements:

- Your SaaS application must be a multitenant solution.
- You can enable both Microsoft Accounts (MSA) and [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) for authenticating users.
- You must create a landing page. After a user purchases your offer, they’re directed to the landing page. This helps them complete any additional provisioning or setup that’s required. For guidance on creating the landing page, see these articles:
  - [Build the landing page for your transactable SaaS offer in the commercial marketplace](azure-ad-transactable-saas-landing-page.md)
  - [Build the landing page for your free or trial SaaS offer in the commercial marketplace](azure-ad-free-or-trial-landing-page.md)

These additional technical requirements apply to the _Sell through Microsoft_ (transactable) listing option only:

- Azure AD with single sign-on (SSO) identity management and authentication is required for the buying user accessing the landing page. For detailed guidance, see [Azure AD and transactable SaaS offers in the commercial marketplace](azure-ad-saas.md).
- You must use the [SaaS Fulfillment APIs](./partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md) to integrate with Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. You must expose a service that can interact with the SaaS subscription to create, update, and delete a user account and service plan. Critical API changes must be supported within 24 hours. Non-critical API changes will be released periodically. Diagrams and detailed explanations describing the usage of the collected fields are available in documentation for the [APIs](./partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md).
- You must create at least one plan for your offer. Your plan is priced based on the pricing model you select before publishing: _flat rate_ or _per-user_. More details about [plans](#plans) are provided later in this article.
- The customer can cancel your offer at any time.

### Technical information

If you’re creating a transactable offer, you'll need to gather the following information for the **Technical configuration** page. If you choose to process transactions independently instead of creating a transactable offer, skip this section and go to [Test drives](#test-drives).

- **Landing page URL**: The SaaS site URL (for example: `https://contoso.com/signup`) that users will be directed to after acquiring your offer from the commercial marketplace, triggering the configuration process from the newly created SaaS subscription. This URL will receive a token that can be used to call the fulfillment APIs to get provisioning details for your interactive registration page.

  This URL will be called with the marketplace purchase identification token parameter that uniquely identifies the specific customer's SaaS purchase. You must exchange this token for the corresponding SaaS subscription details using the [resolve API](./partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md#resolve-a-purchased-subscription). Those details and any others you wish to collect as part of a customer-interactive web page can be used to kick off the customer onboarding experience, which has to eventually conclude with an activate call on the API for starting the subscription period. On this page, the user should sign up through one-click authentication by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

  This URL with marketplace purchase identification token parameter will also be called when the customer launches a managed SaaS experience from the Azure portal or Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You should handle both flows: when the token is provided for the first time after a new customer purchase, and when it's provided again for an existing customer managing their SaaS solution.

    The Landing page you configure should be up and running 24/7. This is the only way you’ll be notified about new purchases of your SaaS offers made in the commercial marketplace, or configuration requests for an active subscription of an offer.

- **Connection webhook**: For all asynchronous events that Microsoft needs to send to you (for example, when a SaaS subscription has been canceled), we require you to provide a connection webhook URL. We will call this URL to notify you on the event.

  The webhook you provide should be up and running 24/7. This is the only way you’ll be notified about updates about your customers' SaaS subscriptions purchased via the commercial marketplace.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Inside the Azure portal, we require that you create a single-tenant [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app registration](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md). Use the app registration details to authenticate your solution when calling the marketplace APIs. To find the [tenant ID](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in), go to your Azure Active Directory and select **Properties**, then look for the Directory ID number that’s listed. For example, `50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e`.

- **Azure Active Directory tenant ID**: (also known as directory ID). Inside the Azure portal, we require you to [register an Azure Active Directory (AD) app](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md) so we can add it to the access control list (ACL) of the API to make sure you are authorized to call it. To find the tenant ID for your Azure Active Directory (AD) app, go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) blade in Azure Active Directory. In the **Display name** column, select the app. Then look for the **Directory (tenant) ID** number listed (for example, `50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e`).

- **Azure Active Directory application ID**: You also need your [application ID](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in). To get its value, go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) blade in Azure Active Directory. In the **Display name** column, select the app. Then look for the Application (client) ID number listed (for example, `50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e`).

  The Azure AD application ID is associated with your publisher ID in your Partner Center account. You must use the same application ID for all offers in that account.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the publisher has two or more different accounts in Partner Center, the Azure AD app registration details can be used in one account only. Using the same tenant ID, app ID pair for an offer under a different publisher account is not supported.

## Test drives
You can choose to enable a test drive for your SaaS app. Test drives give customers access to a preconfigured environment for a fixed number of hours. You can enable test drives for any publishing option, however this feature has additional requirements. To learn more about test drives, see [What is a test drive?](what-is-test-drive.md). For information about configuring different kinds of test drives, see [Test drive technical configuration](test-drive-technical-configuration.md).

> [!TIP]
> A test drive is different from a [free trial](plans-pricing.md#free-trials). You can offer a test drive, free trial, or both. They both provide your customers with your solution for a fixed period-of-time. But, a test drive also includes a hands-on, self-guided tour of your product’s key features and benefits being demonstrated in a real-world implementation scenario.

## Customer leads

You must connect your offer to your customer relationship management (CRM) system to collect customer information. The customer will be asked for permission to share their information. These customer details, along with the offer name, ID, and online store where they found your offer, will be sent to the CRM system that you've configured. The commercial marketplace supports a variety of CRM systems, along with the option to use an Azure table or configure an HTTPS endpoint using Power Automate.

You can add or modify a CRM connection at any time during or after offer creation. For detailed guidance, see
[Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).

## Selecting an online store

When you publish a SaaS offer, it will be listed in Microsoft AppSource, Azure Marketplace, or both. Each online store serves unique customer requirements. AppSource is for business solutions and Azure Marketplace is for IT solutions. Your offer type, transact capabilities, and categories will determine where your offer will be published. Categories and subcategories are mapped to each online store based on the solution type. 

If your SaaS offer is *both* an IT solution (Azure Marketplace) and a business solution (AppSource), select a category and a subcategory applicable to each online store. Offers published to both online stores should have a value proposition as an IT solution *and* a business solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SaaS offers with [metered billing](partner-center-portal/saas-metered-billing.md) are available through Azure Marketplace and the Azure portal. SaaS offers with only private plans are available through the Azure portal.

| Metered billing | Public plan | Private plan | Available in: |
|---|---|---|---|
| Yes             | Yes         | No           | Azure Marketplace and Azure portal |
| Yes             | Yes         | Yes          | Azure Marketplace and Azure portal * |
| Yes             | No          | Yes          | Azure portal only |
| No              | No          | Yes          | Azure portal only |
|||||

&#42; The private plan of the offer will only be available via the Azure portal

For example, an offer with metered billing and a private plan only (no public plan), will be purchased by customers in the Azure portal. Learn more about [Private offers in Microsoft commercial marketplace](private-offers.md).

For detailed information about listing options supported by online stores, see [Listing and pricing options by online store](determine-your-listing-type.md#listing-and-pricing-options-by-online-store). For more information about categories and subcategories, see [Categories and subcategories in the commercial marketplace](categories.md).

## Legal contracts

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a standard contract you can use for your offers in the commercial marketplace. When you offer your software under the standard contract, customers only need to read and accept it one time, and you don't have to create custom terms and conditions.

If you choose to use the standard contract, you have the option to add universal amendment terms and up to 10 custom amendments to the standard contract. You can also use your own terms and conditions instead of the standard contract. You will manage these details in the **Properties** page. For detailed information, see [Standard contract for Microsoft commercial marketplace](standard-contract.md).

> [!NOTE]
> After you publish an offer using the standard contract for the commercial marketplace, you cannot use your own custom terms and conditions. It is an "or" scenario. You either offer your solution under the standard contract or your own terms and conditions. If you want to modify the terms of the standard contract you can do so through Standard Contract Amendments.

## Offer listing details

When you [create a new SaaS offer](create-new-saas-offer.md) in Partner Center, you will enter text, images, optional videos, and other details on the **Offer listing** page. This is the information that customers will see when they discover your offer listing in the commercial marketplace, as shown in the following example.

> [!Note]
> Your offer must meet the general [commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#100-general) and the [software as a service policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1000-software-as-a-service-saas) to be published to the commercial marketplace.

> [!NOTE]
> A preview audience differs from a private plan. A private plan is one you make available only to a specific audience you choose. This enables you to negotiate a custom plan with specific customers. For more information, see the next section: Plans.

You can send invites to Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) email addresses. Add up to 10 email addresses manually or import up to 20 with a .csv file. If your offer is already live, you can still define a preview audience for testing any changes or updates to your offer.

## Plans

Transactable offers require at least one plan. A plan defines the solution scope and limits, and the associated pricing. You can create multiple plans for your offer to give your customers different technical and pricing options. If you choose to process transactions independently instead of creating a transactable offer, the **Plans** page is not visible. If so, skip this section and go to [Additional sales opportunities](#additional-sales-opportunities).

See [Plans and pricing for commercial marketplace offers](plans-pricing.md) for general guidance about plans, including pricing models, free trials, and private plans. The following sections discuss additional information specific to SaaS offers.

### SaaS pricing models

SaaS offers can use one of two pricing models with each plan: either _flat rate_ or _per user_. All plans in the same offer must be associated with the same pricing model. For example, an offer cannot have one plan that's flat rate and another plan that’s per user.

**Flat rate** – Enable access to your offer with a single monthly or annual flat rate price. This is sometimes referred to as site-based pricing. With this pricing model, you can optionally define metered plans that use the marketplace metering service API to charge customers for usage that isn't covered by the flat rate. For more information on metered billing, see [Metered billing for SaaS using the commercial marketplace metering service](./partner-center-portal/saas-metered-billing.md). You should also use this option if usage behavior for your SaaS service is in bursts.

**Per user** – Enable access to your offer with a price based on the number of users who can access the offer or occupy seats. With this user-based model, you can set the minimum and maximum number of users supported by the plan. You can create multiple plans to configure different price points based on the number of users. These fields are optional. If left unselected, the number of users will be interpreted as not having a limit (min of 1 and max of as many as your service can support). These fields may be edited as part of an update to your plan.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After your offer is published, you cannot change the pricing model. In addition, all plans for the same offer must share the same pricing model.

### SaaS billing

For SaaS apps that run in your (the publisher’s) Azure subscription, infrastructure usage is billed to you directly; customers do not see actual infrastructure usage fees. You should bundle Azure infrastructure usage fees into your software license pricing to compensate for the cost of the infrastructure you deployed to run the solution.

SaaS app offers that are sold through Microsoft support monthly or annual billing based on a flat fee, per user, or consumption charges using the [metered billing service](./partner-center-portal/saas-metered-billing.md). The commercial marketplace operates on an agency model, whereby publishers set prices, Microsoft bills customers, and Microsoft pays revenue to publishers while withholding an agency fee.

The following example shows a sample breakdown of costs and payouts to demonstrate the agency model. In this example, Microsoft bills $100.00 to the customer for your software license and pays out $80.00 to the publisher.

| Your license cost | $100 per month |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Azure usage cost (D1/1-Core) | Billed directly to the publisher, not the customer |
| Customer is billed by Microsoft | $100.00 per month (Publisher must account for any incurred or pass-through infrastructure costs in the license fee) |
| **Microsoft bills** | **$100 per month** |
| Microsoft pays you 80% of your license cost<br>`*` For qualified SaaS apps, Microsoft pays 90% of your license cost| $80.00 per month<br>``*`` $90.00 per month |
|||

**`*` Reduced Marketplace Service Fee** – For certain SaaS offers that you have published on the commercial marketplace, Microsoft will reduce its Marketplace Service Fee from 20% (as described in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement) to 10%. For your offer(s) to qualify, your offer(s) must have been designated by Microsoft as Azure IP Co-sell incentivized. Eligibility must be met at least five (5) business days before the end of each calendar month to receive the Reduced Marketplace Service Fee. Once eligibility is met, the reduced service fee is awarded to all transactions effective the first day of the following month and will continue to be applied until Azure IP Co-sell incentivized status is lost. For details about IP co-sell eligibility, see [Requirements for co-sell status](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#3000-requirements-for-co-sell-status). The Reduced Marketplace Service Fee also applies to Azure IP Co-sell incentivized VMs, Managed Apps, and any other qualified transactable IaaS offers made available through the commercial marketplace.

## Preview audience

A preview audience can access your offer prior to being published live in the online stores. They can see how your offer will look in the commercial marketplace and test the end-to-end functionality before you publish it live. 

On the **Preview audience** page, you can define a limited preview audience. This setting is not available if you choose to process transactions independently instead of selling your offer through Microsoft. If so, you can skip this section and go to [Additional sales opportunities](#additional-sales-opportunities).

## Test offer

Before you publish your offer live, you should use the preview functionality to develop your technical implementation, test and experiment with different pricing models.

To develop and test your SaaS offer with the lowest amount of risk, we recommend that you create a test and development (DEV) offer for experimentation and testing. The DEV offer will be separate from your production (PROD) offer.

To prevent accidental purchases of the DEV offer, you’ll never push the **Go live** button to publish the DEV offer live.

![Illustrates the Offer overview page for an offer in Partner Center. The Go live button and preview links are shown. The View validation report link is also shown under Automated validation.](./media/review-publish-offer/publish-status-saas.png)

Here are some reasons to create a separate DEV offer for the development team to use for development and testing of the PROD offer:

- Avoid accidental customer charges
- Evaluate pricing models
- Not adding plans that do not target actual customers

### Avoid accidental customer charges

By using a DEV offer instead of the PROD offer and treating them as development and production environments, you can avoid accidental charges to customers.

We recommend that you register two different Azure AD apps for calling the marketplace APIs. Developers will use one Azure AD app with the DEV offer’s settings, and the operations team will use the PROD app registration. By doing this, you can isolate the development team from making inadvertent mistakes, such as calling the API to cancel a customer’s subscription who pays $100K per month. You can also avoid charging a customer for metered usage they didn’t consume.

### Evaluate pricing models

Testing pricing models in the DEV offer reduces risk when developers experiment with different pricing models.

Publishers can create the plans they need in the DEV offer to determine which pricing model works best for their offer. Developers might want to create multiple plans in the DEV offer to test different pricing combinations. For example, you might create plans with different sets of custom metered dimensions. You might create a different plan with a mix of flat rate and custom metered dimensions.

To test multiple pricing options, you need to create a plan for each unique pricing model. To learn more, see [Plans](#plans).

### Not adding plans that do not target actual customers

By using a DEV offer for development and testing, you can reduce unnecessary clutter in the PROD offer. For example, you can’t delete plans you create to test different pricing models or technical configurations (without filing a support ticket). So by creating plans for testing in the DEV offer, you reduce the clutter in the PROD offer.

Clutter in the PROD offer frustrates product and marketing teams, as they expect all the plans to target actual customers. Especially with large teams that are disjointed who all want different sandboxes to work with, creating two offers will provide two different environments for DEV and PROD. In some cases, you might want to create multiple DEV offers to support a larger team who have different people running different test scenarios. Letting different team members work in the DEV offer separate from the PROD offer , helps to keep production plans as close to production-ready as possible.

Testing a DEV offer helps to avoid the 30 custom metered dimensions limit per offer. Developers can try different meter combinations in the DEV offer without affecting the custom metered dimension limit in the PROD offer.

## Additional sales opportunities

You can choose to opt into Microsoft-supported marketing and sales channels. When creating your offer in Partner Center, you will see two tabs toward the end of the process:

- **Resell through CSPs**: Use this option to allow Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) partners to resell your solution as part of a bundled offer. For more information about this program, see [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).

- **Co-sell with Microsoft**: This option lets Microsoft sales teams consider your IP co-sell eligible solution when evaluating their customers’ needs. For details about co-sell eligibility, see [Requirements for co-sell status](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#3000-requirements-for-co-sell-status). For detailed information on how to prepare your offer for evaluation, see [Co-sell option in Partner Center](commercial-marketplace-co-sell.md).
