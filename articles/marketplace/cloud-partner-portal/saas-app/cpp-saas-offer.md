# Azure SaaS application offer

The [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of SaaS application offers.  Instead, this functionality has been moved to the Microsoft [Partner Center portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/).  For more information, see [Create a new SaaS offer](../../partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer.md). 


## Next steps

Before you create a new SaaS app offer, you should read the [SaaS applications Offer Publishing Guide](../../marketplace-saas-applications-technical-publishing-guide.md) and review the Partner Center portal steps listed in the [Offer creation checklist](../../partner-center-portal/offer-creation-checklist.md).
