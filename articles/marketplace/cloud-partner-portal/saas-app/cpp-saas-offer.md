# Azure SaaS application offer

This section explains how to publish a software as a service (SaaS) application offer to the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com">Azure Marketplace</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> SaaS offer functionality is being migrated to the [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/directory).  All new publishers must 
> use Partner Center for creating new SaaS offers and managing existing offers.  Current publishers with SaaS offers are being batchwise migrated from the 
> Cloud Partner Portal to the Partner Center.  The Cloud Partner Portal will display status messages to indicate when specific existing offers have been migrated.
> For more information, see [Create a new SaaS offer](../../partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer.md).


Use SaaS applications when your solution will be deployed in your own Azure subscription and customers will sign in through an interface you design and manage to test the application. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory">Azure Active Directory (AAD)</a> is used to leverage your existing trial environment.

## Benefits

Some of the benefits of listing your applications on a Microsoft marketplace include:

- Reaching 100 million Azure Active Directory users across Office 365 and Dynamics 365.

- Extending your sales team: reach business users worldwide and gain a sales channel that engages end users, helps generate leads, and initiates conversations with new customers across industries.

- Getting actionable insights: we will share insights into how your app is performing on AppSource, what works well, and how to further improve your sales procedures.
 
>[!Note]
>Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) partner channel opt-in is now available.  Please see [Cloud Solution Providers](../../cloud-solution-providers.md) for more information on marketing your offer through the Microsoft CSP partner channels.

## Offer components
 
This section describes the elements of publishing a SaaS offer, and is intended as a guide for the publisher to the Azure Marketplace. Publishing's divided into the following main parts: 

- [Prerequisites](./cpp-prerequisites.md) - Lists the technical and business requirements before creating or publishing a SaaS offer. 
- [Create the offer](./cpp-create-offer.md) - Gives the steps required to create a new SaaS offer entry using the Cloud Partner Portal. 
- [Publish the offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md) - Explains how to submit the offer for publishing to the Azure Marketplace. 

## SaaS publishing process 

The high-level steps for publishing a SaaS offer are:
 
1. Create the offer - Provide detailed information about the offer. This information includes: the offer description, marketing materials, support information, and asset specifications. 
2. Create the business and technical assets - Create the business assets (legal documents and marketing materials) and technical assets for the associated solution. 
3. Certify and publish the offer - After the offer and the technical assets are completed, you can submit the offer. This submission starts the publishing process. During this process, the solution is tested, validated, certified, then "goes live" on the Azure Marketplace.

## Next steps

Before you consider these steps, you must meet the [technical and business requirements](./cpp-prerequisites.md) for publishing a SaaS offer to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.
