# SaaS Fulfillment APIs Version 2 

This article details the API that enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to sell their SaaS applications in the AppSource and Azure Marketplace. This API is a requirement for transactable SaaS offers on the AppSource and Azure Marketplace.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> SaaS offer functionality has been migrated to the [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/directory).  All new publishers must 
> use Partner Center for creating new SaaS offers and managing existing offers.  Current publishers with SaaS offers are being batchwise migrated from the 
> Cloud Partner Portal to the Partner Center.  The Cloud Partner Portal will display status messages to indicate when specific existing offers have been migrated.
> For more information, see [Create a new SaaS offer](../../partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer.md).

## Managing the SaaS subscription lifecycle

Microsoft SaaS Service manages the entire lifecycle of a SaaS subscription purchase and uses the fulfillment API as a mechanism to drive the actual fulfillment, changes to plans, and deletion of the subscription with the ISV. The customer is billed based on the state of the SaaS subscription that Microsoft maintains. The following diagram depicts the states and the operations that drive the changes between states.

![SaaS subscription lifecycle states](./media/saas-subscription-lifecycle-api-v2.png)


### States of a SaaS subscription

The following table lists the provisioning states for a SaaS subscription, including a description and sequence diagram for each (if applicable). 

#### Provisioning

When a customer initiates a purchase, the ISV receives this information in an Auth Code on a customer interactive web page using a URL parameter. For example: `https://contoso.com/signup?token=..`, where the landing page URL provider in partner center is `https://contoso.com/signup`. The Auth code can be validated and exchanged for the details of what needs to be provisioned by calling the Resolve API.  When the SaaS service finishes provisioning, it sends an activate call to signal that the fulfillment is complete and the customer can be billed.  The following diagram shows the sequence of API calls for a provisioning scenario.  

![API calls for provisioning a SaaS service.](./media/saas-post-provisioning-api-v2-calls.png)

#### Provisioned

This state is the steady state of a provisioned service.

#### Provisioning for update
(from marketplace) 

This state represents an update to an existing service is pending. Such an update can be initiated by the customer either on the marketplace, or on the SaaS service (only for direct to customer transactions.) The following diagram shows the actions when an update is initiated from the marketplace.

![API calls when update is initiated from marketplace.](./media/saas-update-api-v2-calls-from-marketplace-a.png)

#### Provisioning for update  
(from SaaS service) 

The following diagram shows the actions when an update is initiated by SaaS service. (The webhook call is replaced by an update to the subscription initiated by the SaaS Service. 

![API calls when update is initiated by SaaS service.](./media/saas-update-api-v2-calls-from-saas-service-a.png) 

#### Suspended

This state indicates that a customer’s payment hasn't  been received. By policy, we will provide the customer a grace period before unfulfilling the subscription. When a subscription is in this state: 

- As an ISV, you may choose to degrade or block the user’s access to the service. 
- The subscription must be kept in a recoverable state that can restore full functionality without any loss of data or settings. 
- You can expect to get a reinstate request for this subscription via the fulfillment API, or a de-provisioning request at the end of the grace period. 

#### Unsubscribed 

Subscriptions reach this state in response to an explicit customer request or as a response to non-payment of dues. The expectation from the ISV is that the customer’s data is retained for recovery on request for a minimum of X days and then deleted. 


## API reference

This section documents the SaaS *Subscription API* and *Operations API*.  The value of the `api-version` parameter for version 2 APIs is `2018-08-31`.  


### Parameter and entity definitions

The following table lists the definitions for common parameters and entities used by Fulfillment APIs.

|     Entity/Parameter     |     Definition                         |
|     ----------------     |     ----------                         |
| `subscriptionId`         | GUID identifier for a SaaS resource  |
| `name`                   | Friendly name provided for this resource by the customer |
| `publisherId`            | Unique string identifier for each publisher, for example "contoso" |
| `offerId`                | Unique string identifier for each offer, for example "offer1"  |
| `planId`                 | Unique string identifier for each plan/sku, for example "silver" |
| `operationId`            | GUID identifier for a particular operation  |
|  `action`                | The action being performed on a resource, either `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `suspend`,  `reinstate`, or `changePlan`, `changeQuantity`, `transfer`  |
|   |   |

Globally unique identifiers ([GUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) are 128-bit (32 hexadecimal) numbers that are typically automatically generated. 

#### Resolve a subscription 

The resolve endpoint enables the publisher to resolve a marketplace token to a persistent Resource ID. The Resource ID is the unique identifier for SAAS subscription.  When a user is redirected to an ISV’s website, the URL contains a token in the query parameters. The ISV is expected to use this token, and make a request to resolve it. The response contains the unique SAAS subscription ID, name, offer ID, and plan for the resource. This token is valid for an hour only. 

**Post:<br>`https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com/api/saas/subscriptions/resolve?api-version=<ApiVersion>`**

## Webhook on the SaaS service

The publisher must implement a webhook in this SaaS service to proactively notify users of changes in its service. The API is expected to be unauthenticated and will be called by the Microsoft SaaS service. The SaaS service is expected to call the operations API to validate and authorize before taking an action on the webhook notification.

```json
{
  "id": "<this is a Guid operation id, you can call operations API with this to get status>",
  "activityId": "<this is a Guid correlation id>",
  "subscriptionId": "<Guid to uniquely identify this resource>",
  "publisherId": "<this is the publisher’s name>",
  "offerId": "<this is the offer name>",
  "planId": "<this is the plan id>",
  "quantity": "<the number of seats, will be null if not per-seat saas offer>",
  "timeStamp": "2019-04-15T20:17:31.7350641Z",
  "action": "Unsubscribe",
  "status": "NotStarted"  
}
```

Where action can be one of these: 
- `Subscribe`, (When the resource has been activated)
- `Unsubscribe`, (When the resource has been deleted)
- `ChangePlan`, (When the change plan operation has completed)
- `ChangeQuantity`, (When the change quantity operation has completed),
- `Suspend`, (When resource has been suspended)
- `Reinstate`, (When resource has been reinstated after suspension)

Where status can be one of these: <br>
        - NotStarted, <br>
        - InProgress, <br>
        - Succeeded, <br>
        - Failed, <br>
        - Conflict <br>

Actionable statuses are Succeeded and Failed in a webhook notification. An operation's lifecycle is from NotStarted to a terminal state like Succeeded/Failed/Conflict. If you receive Not started or in progress, please continue to request the status via GET operation API until the operation reaches a terminal state before taking any action. 

## Mock API

You can use our mock APIs to help you get started with development, particularly prototyping, and testing projects. 

Host Endpoint: `https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com/api` <br/>
API Version: `2018-09-15` <br/>
No authentication required <br/>
Sample Uri: `https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com/api/saas/subscriptions?api-version=2018-09-15` <br/>

The API endpoint paths are the same across both Mock and Real APIs, but the API versions are different. The version is 2018-09-15 for Mock and 2018-08-31 for the production version. 

Any of the API calls in this article can be made to the mock host endpoint. You can expect to get mock data back as a response. In general, you can expect to get mock data back as a response. Calls to the update subscription methods on the mock API always return 500. 

## Next steps

Developers can also programmatically retrieve and manipulation of workloads, offers, and publisher profiles using the [Cloud Partner Portal REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-api-overview).
