# Create a new SaaS application offer

This article describes how to create and publish a SaaS application (app) offer entry for the Azure Marketplace.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> SaaS offer functionality is being migrated to the [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/directory).  All new publishers must 
> use Partner Center for creating new SaaS offers and managing existing offers.  Current publishers with SaaS offers are being batchwise migrated from the 
> Cloud Partner Portal to the Partner Center.  The Cloud Partner Portal will display status messages to indicate when specific existing offers have been migrated.
> For more information, see [Create a new SaaS offer](../../partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer.md).
