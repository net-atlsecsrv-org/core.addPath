# SaaS Sell through Azure - APIs

This article explains how to create a SaaS offer with APIs. The APIs are
necessary for allowing subscriptions to your SaaS offer if you have Sell
through Azure selected.  This article is divided into two sections:

-   Service-to-service Authentication between a SaaS Service and Azure Marketplace
-   API Methods and Endpoints

The following APIs are provided to help you integrate your SaaS service with Azure:

-   Resolve
-   Subscribe
-   Convert
-   Unsubscribe

The following diagram shows the subscription flow of a new customer and
when these APIs are used:

## Service to service authentication between SaaS service and Azure marketplace

Azure does not impose any constraints on the authentication that the
SaaS service exposes to its end users. However, when it comes to the
SaaS service communicating with Azure Marketplace APIs, the
authentication is done in the context of an Azure Active Directory
(Azure AD) application.

The following section describes how to create an Azure AD application.


### Register an Azure AD Application

Any application that wants to use the capabilities of Azure AD must
first be registered in an Azure AD tenant. This registration process
involves giving Azure AD details about your application, such as the URL
where it's located, the URL to send replies after a user is
authenticated, the URI that identifies the app, and so on.

To register a new application using the Azure portal, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. If your account gives you access to more than one, click your
   account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the
   desired Azure AD tenant.
3. In the left-hand navigation pane, click the **Azure Active
   Directory** service, click **App registrations**, and click **New application registration**.

   ![SaaS AD App Registrations](./media/saas-offer-app-registration.png)

4. On the Create page, enter your application\'s registration
   information:
   - **Name**: Enter a meaningful application name
   - **Application type**: 
     - Select **Native** for [client applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#client-application) that are installed locally on a device. This setting is used for OAuth public [native clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#native-client).
     - Select **Web app / API** for
     [client applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#client-application)
     and [resource/API applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#resource-server)
     that are installed on a secure server. This setting is used for
     OAuth confidential [web clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#web-client)
     and public [user-agent-based  clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#user-agent-based-client).
     The same application can also expose both a client and resource/API.
   - **Sign-On URL**: For Web app/API applications, provide the base
     URL of your app. For example, **http:\//localhost:31544** might
     be the URL for a web app running on your local machine. Users
     would then use this URL to sign in to a web client application.
   - **Redirect URI**: For Native applications, provide the URI used
     by Azure AD to return token responses. Enter a value specific to
     your application, for example **http:\//MyFirstAADApp**.

     ![SaaS AD App Registrations](./media/saas-offer-app-registration-2.png)
     For specific examples for web applications or native
     applications, check out the quick start guided setups that are
     available in the Get Started section of the [Azure AD Developers Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-developers-guide).

5. When finished, click **Create**. Azure AD assigns a unique
   Application ID to your application, and you\'re taken to your
   application\'s main registration page. Depending on whether your
   application is a web or native application, different options are
   provided to add additional capabilities to your application.

   **Note:**By default, the newly registered application is configured
   to allow only users from the same tenant to sign in to your
   application.

for enabling subscriptions for a SaaS offer.

### Marketplace API endpoint and API version

The endpoint for Azure Marketplace API is `https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com`.

The current API version is `api-version=2017-04-15`.


### Resolve subscription

POST action on resolve endpoint allows users to resolve a marketplace token to a persistent Resource ID.  The Resource ID is the unique identifier for SAAS subscription. 

When a user is redirected to an ISV’s website, the URL contains a token in the query parameters. The ISV is expected to use this token, and make a request to resolve it. The response contains the unique SAAS subscription ID, name, offer ID, and plan for the resource. This token is valid for an hour only.

### SaaS Webhook
