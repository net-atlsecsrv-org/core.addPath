|    **Logos**      |  If this is a Sell through Microsoft SaaS app, you should provide all logo images. If this is a Listing, then only 2 logos are required. Use following guidelines for logos uploaded in the Cloud Partner Portal:<br><ul><li>Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low. The Azure design has a simple color palette. </li><li>Avoid using black or white as the background color of your logo. The theme colors of the Azure Portal are black and white. Instead, use some color that would make your logo prominent in the Azure Portal. We recommend simple primary colors. If you’re using a transparent background, then make sure that the logo and text are not black, white, or blue. </li><li>Don’t use a gradient background on the logo. </li><li>Avoid placing text, even your company or brand name, on the logo. The look and feel of your logo should be 'flat' and should avoid gradients.</li><li>The logo image should not be stretched.</li></ul>    |
