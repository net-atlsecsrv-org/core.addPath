# SaaS application Test Drive tab

Use the Test Drive tab to provide a trial experience for your customers.

## Test Drive benefits

Creating a trial experience for your customers is a best practice to ensure they can buy with confidence. Of the trial options available, Test Drive is the most effective at generating high-quality leads and increased conversion of those leads.

Test drive provides customers with a hands-on, self-guided trial of your product's key features and benefits, demonstrated in a real-world implementation scenario.


## How a test drive works

A potential customer searches and discovers your application on the Marketplace. The customer signs in and agrees to the terms of use. At this point, the customer receives your pre-configured environment to try for a fixed number of hours, while you receive a highly qualified lead to follow up with. For more information, see [What is Test Drive?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/what-is-test-drive)


## Publishing steps

The main publishing steps for adding a test Drive are:

1. Define your Test Drive scenario
2. Build and/or modify your Resource Manager template
3. Create your Test Drive step-by-step manual
4. Republish your offer


## Setting up a test drive

There are four different types of Test Drives available, each based on the type of product, scenario, and marketplace you’re on.

|  ---------------   |  ---------------  |  ---------------  |
|     Azure Resource Manager               |    An Azure Resource Manager Test Drive is a deployment template that contains all the Azure resources that comprise a solution being built by the publisher. Products that fit this type of Test Drive are ones that use only Azure resources.               |       [Azure Resource Manager Test Drive](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/test-drive/azure-resource-manager-test-drive)            |

|       Power BI             |         A Power BI Test Drive consists of an embedded link to a custom-built dashboard. Any product that wants to demonstrate an interactive Power BI visual should use this type of Test Drive. All you need to upload is your embedded Power BI URL.          |        [Power BI Test Drive](#power-bi-test-drive)           |
