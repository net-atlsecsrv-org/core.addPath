# Create Power BI App offer technical assets

>[!Important]
>Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving management of your Power BI app offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Power BI app creation overview](https://aka.ms/AzureCreatePBIServiceApp) to manage your migrated offers.

The primary technical asset that you need for this offer type is a Power BI app. A Power BI app is a collection of primary datasets, reports or dashboards, and optional connected services and embedded datasets. It has evolved from an asset type previously known as a [content pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-organizational-content-pack-introduction). For more information about developing this type of app, see [What are Power BI template apps?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).


## Obtain an installation URL

You can build a Power BI app only within the [Power BI service](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). To begin, you sign in with a [Power BI Pro license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro). After you create and test your service application in Power BI, save the app installation URL that Power BI generates. Finally, supply the URL on the [Technical Info](./cpp-technical-info-tab.md) tab of the Cloud Partner Portal submission form.
â€ƒ

## Next steps

After you've created and tested your Power BI app and you've created the associated offer, you can [publish the Power BI App offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md).
