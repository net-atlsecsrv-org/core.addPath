# Power BI App offer prerequisites

This article provides the technical and business requirements that you need to meet before you can publish a Power BI App offer to the AppSource marketplace.  If you have not already done so, review the [Office 365, Dynamics 365, PowerApps, and Power BI Offer Publishing Guide](../../appsource-offer-publishing-guide.md).


## Technical requirements

The main technical asset you'll need for this offer type is a [Power BI app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636). For more
information, see [Create Power BI technical assets](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md).

After your service application is created and tested in Power BI, you should save the application installation URL that Power BI generates. You'll need it to [create a Power BI App offer](./cpp-create-offer.md).

## Business requirements

The business requirements include procedural, contractual, and legal obligations.  You must:

- Be a registered cloud marketplace publisher. If you're not registered, follow the steps in [Become a Cloud Marketplace Publisher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher).

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Use the same Microsoft Developer Center registration account to sign in to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com). You should have only one Microsoft account for your AppSource offerings. Accounts shouldn't be specific to individual services or offers.
 
- Make technical support available to customers in a commercially reasonable manner.
- Provide content that meets the criteria for your offering to be listed on AppSource. For more information, see [Have an app to list on AppSource? Hereâ€™s how](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/have-an-app-to-list-on-appsource-here-s-how).
- Comply with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).


## Next steps

After you've met all the requirements, you're ready to [create a Power BI App offer](./cpp-create-offer.md) in the Cloud Partner Portal.
