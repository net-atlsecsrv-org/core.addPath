# Power BI app offer

Cloud Partner Portal no longer supports the creation and management of Power BI app offers. This functionality has been moved to Microsoft [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/). For more information, see [Create a Power BI app for Microsoft AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-power-bi-app-offer).
