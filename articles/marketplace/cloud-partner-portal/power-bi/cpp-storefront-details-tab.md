# Power BI app Storefront Details tab

>[!Important]
>Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving management of your Power BI app offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Power BI app creation overview](https://aka.ms/AzureCreatePBIServiceApp) to manage your migrated offers.

On the **New Offer** page, use the **Storefront Details** tab to provide marketing, sales, and legal information for your prospective customers. On this tab you can also set up management for leads that the Azure Marketplace generates. This long form is divided into six sections: **Offer Details**, **Listing Details**, **Marketing Artifacts**, **Legal**, **Customer Support**, and **Lead Management**.  An asterisk (*) at the end of a field label means the field is required.


## Offer Details section

In the **Offer Details** section, enter general information about your AppSource offer.

|   |    |

## Marketing Artifacts section

In the **Marketing Artifacts** section, upload branding and marketing materials to display on AppSource.  This section is divided into four subsections: **Logos**, **Videos**, **Documents**, and **Screenshots**. Logos and screenshots are the only required marketing artifacts. But for the best customer appeal, we recommend adding videos and documents as well.

## Lead Management section

In the **Lead Management** section, set up your system to collect the customer leads that your AppSource offers generate. To choose your storage options for the leads, use the following table:

| **Azure Blob (deprecated)** | Specify [Azure Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) by using a container name and a connection string.  This choice is deprecated. Use **Azure Table** instead.  |

After you publish your offer, the lead connection is validated, and a test lead is automatically sent to the specified destination. Continuously manage lead
information, and promptly update your settings to reflect your current customer management architecture.
