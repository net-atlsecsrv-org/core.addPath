# Create a Power BI App offer

This article lists the steps to follow to create a new Power BI App offer for [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). Every offer appears as its own entity in AppSource. When you create a new offer in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/), you're required to supply four groups of assets for your offer.

The asset groups are described in the following table:

|   Asset group      | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------   | ----------------                                                                    |
| Offer Settings     | The primary identifications and the name for the offer.                                      |
| Technical Info     | The installer URL that you use to install the app in the clientâ€™s Power BI workspace. For more information about how to generate this URL, see [Power BI App documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636). |
| Storefront Details | Contains marketing, legal, and lead management assets. Marketing assets include an offer description and logos. Legal assets include a privacy policy, terms of use, and other legal documentation. The lead management policy lets you specify how to handle leads from the AppSource user portal. |
| Contacts           | Contains support contact and policy information.                                     |

## New Offer form

After you sign in to the Cloud Partner Portal, select **New Offer** in the left pane. Then, to display the New Offer form and start the process of defining assets for a new app offer, select **Power BI Apps**.
