| <div style="font-size:1em"> This section explains how to publish a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement solution to the Microsoft [AppSource Marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com). All apps for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (Sales, Service, Project Service, and Field Service) must go through our certification process and support a trial experience. The certification process checks your solution for standard requirements, compatibility, and proper practices. The trial experience allows users to deploy your solution to a live Dynamics 365 environment. </div>|  ![Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement icon](./media/dynce-icon1.png)  |
