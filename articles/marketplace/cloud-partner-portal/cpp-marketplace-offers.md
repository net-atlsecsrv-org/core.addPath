# Azure and AppSource Marketplace Offers

This first part of this section introduces the general operations used to create and manage offers for the Azure and AppSource Marketplaces.  This part provides the background you need to understand to manage specific offer types, as well as technical information that is common to all offer types.  The majority of this section contains detailed instructions on how to create and manage specific offer types.  

The following video introduces the various capabilities and different offer types available in Azure Marketplace or AppSource.  It also covers important technical and business aspects of publishing an application or service in these marketplaces.

**Building Apps and Services for Azure Marketplace and AppSource - Build 2018**

For more information about these marketplaces, see [Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishing guide](../marketplace-publishers-guide.md).


## Common offer operations

The process of creating a new offer differs greatly across offer types, for example between an [Azure application offer](./azure-applications/cpp-azure-app-offer.md) and a [consulting service offer](./consulting-services/cloud-partner-portal-consulting-services-publishing-offer.md).  In contrast, many of the other operations you perform on an offer in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) are fairly standardized across offer types.  These common operations—including publish, view status, update, and delete—are covered in the section [Manage offers](./manage-offers/cpp-manage-offers.md)


## Test Drive

*Test Drive* is a marketplace feature that provides customers a "try before you buy" demonstration option for each offer so enabled.  The Test Drive capability is limited to the following subset of offer types: [Azure applications](./azure-applications/cpp-azure-app-offer.md), [Dynamics 365 Business Central](../cloud-partner-portal-orig/cpp-business-central-offer.md), [Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](./dyn365ce/cpp-customer-engagement-offer.md), [Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](../cloud-partner-portal-orig/cpp-dynamics-365-operations-offer.md), [SaaS applications](./saas-app/cpp-saas-offer.md), and [virtual machines](./virtual-machine/cpp-virtual-machine-offer.md).  This capability requires the publisher to create a Test Drive template, customized for its offer.  For more information, see the section [Test Drive](./test-drive/what-is-test-drive.md).

You can browse the existing marketplace offers that have Test Drive demonstrations by applying the [test drive filter](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?filters=test-drive). 


## Azure Marketplace and AppSource offer types

The following table lists the current offer types supported by the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com).  For each offer type, it lists the marketplace(s) where the offer can be listed, as well as a general description of the offer solution technology.

|                Offer Type                |  Marketplace  |   Description                                                           |
