### Logo guidelines

<!-- It seems like this section could be better located in some common area, maybe an AMP Marketing/Design section 
+1 this should all be in a common area and referenced from here to that location.-->

All the logos uploaded to the Cloud Partner Portal should follow the guidelines:

*  The Azure design has a simple color palette. Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low.
*  The theme colors of the Azure portal are white and black. Avoid using these colors as the background color for your logos. Use a color that will make your logos prominent in the Azure portal. We recommend simple primary colors. If you're using a transparent background, make sure that the logos/text aren't white, black, or blue.
*  Don't use a gradient background on your logo.
*  Avoid placing text—even your company or brand name—on the logo. The look and feel of your logo should be "flat" and should avoid gradients.
*  Don't stretch the logo.


#### Hero logo

The Hero logo is optional.

>[!Important]
>After the Hero logo is uploaded, it can't be deleted.

Use the following guidelines for a Hero logo: 

*  Black, white, and transparent backgrounds aren't allowed.
*  Avoid using any light color as the background for the logo.  The publisher display name, plan title and the offer long summary are displayed in white font color, and must stand out against the background.
*  Avoid using most text when you're designing the logo. The publisher name, plan title, the offer long summary, and a create button are embedded programmatically inside the logo when the offer's listed. 
* Include an unused rectangular space on the  right-side of your hero logo. This blank space is 415x100 pixels, and offset from the left by 370 pixels.  

<!-- P2: would be nice to also have an picture int he context of iot edge of the hero image
As an example, the following hero icon is for the Azure Container Service.

## Lead management

This section enables you set up the options for collecting customer leads generated from your Azure Marketplace offers. You can select the following storage options from a dropdown list.

* **None** - the default, lead information is not collected.
* Azure Table - written to the Azure table specified by a connection string.
* Dynamics CRM Online - written to the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/) instance, specified by a URL and authentication credentials.
* HTTPS Endpoint - written to the specified HTTPS endpoint as a JSON payload.
* Marketo - written to the specified [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) instance, specified by server ID, munchkin ID, and form ID.
* Salesforce - written to a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) database, specified by an object Identifier.

After you successfully publish your offer, the lead connection is verified and a test lead is automatically sent to the destination that you configured. 

>[!Note]
>Lead information should be continuously managed and these settings should be promptly updated whenever changes are made to your customer management architecture.
