>[!Important]
>Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving management of your IoT Edge module offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Create an IoT Edge module offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/azure-iot-edge-module-creation) to manage your migrated offers.

<table> <tr> <td>This section explains how to publish a new Azure IoT Edge module offer to the Microsoft <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com">Azure Marketplace</a>. An IoT Edge module is a Docker-compatible container that's made to run on an IoT Edge device.

## Publishing process

The high-level steps for publishing an IoT Edge module offer are:

1. Create the offer<br> Provide detailed information about the offer. This information includes:  the offer description, marketing materials, support information, and asset specifications.

2. Create the business and technical assets<br> Create the business assets (legal documents and marketing materials) and technical assets for the associated solution (the IoT Edge module images hosted in an Azure Container Registry.

3. Create the SKU<br> Create the SKU(s) associated with the offer. A unique SKU is required for each image you're planning to publish.

4. Certify and publish the offer <br>After the offer and the technical assets are completed, you can submit the offer. This submission starts the publishing process. During this process the solution is tested, validated, certified, then "goes live" on the Azure Marketplace.
