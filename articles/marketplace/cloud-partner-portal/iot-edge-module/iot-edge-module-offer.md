# IoT Edge module offer

[Cloud Partner portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of IoT Edge module offers. This functionality has been moved to Microsoft [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/). For more information, see [Create, configure, and publish an IoT Edge module offer in Azure Marketplace](../../partner-center-portal/azure-iot-edge-module-creation.md).
