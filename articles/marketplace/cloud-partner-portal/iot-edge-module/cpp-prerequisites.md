# IoT Edge module publishing prerequisites

This article describes the prerequisites for publishing an IoT Edge module offer.  If you have not already done so, review the [IoT Edge modules publishing guide](../..//iot-edge-module.md).


## Publishing prerequisites

To publish an IoT Edge module to the Azure Marketplace, you have to meet the following prerequisites:

<!-- P2: It would be great to point to the terms of use of CPP here. This can often be a blocker for big companies and these terms of use are not anonymously visible yet.-->
- Access to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). For more information, see [Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishing guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide).
- Agreement to the [Azure Marketplace Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace-terms/)
- Host your IoT Edge module technical asset in an Azure Container Registry.  For more information, see [how to prepare your IoT Edge module technical asset](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md)
- Have your IoT Edge module metadata ready to use. For example, prepare the following assets:
    - A title
    - A description (in HTML format)
    - A logo image (PNG format and fixed image sizes including 40x40px, 90x90px, 115x115px, 255x115px)
    - A term of use and privacy policy
    - A default module configuration that includes: routes, twin desired properties, createOptions, and environment variables.
    - Module documentation
    - Support contacts


## Next steps

Once you have [prepared your IoT Edge module technical asset](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md), you will be ready to [create your IoT Edge module offer](./cpp-create-offer.md).
