# Update an existing Azure application offer

There are various kinds of updates that you might want to do to your offer after it has been published and is live. Any change you make to your new version of your offer should be saved and republished to have it reflect in the Marketplace. This article steps through the different aspects of updating your managed application offer in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).

There are several reasons why you might want to update your offer, such as:

- Adding a new image version to existing SKUs.
- Adding new SKUs.
- Updating the marketplace metadata for the offer or individual SKUs.

To assist you in these modifications, the portal provides the **Compare** and **History** features.

## Unpermitted changes to an Azure application offer or SKU

There are attributes of a container offer or SKU that can't be changed after the offer is live on the Azure Marketplace. You can't change the following settings:

- Offer ID and Publisher ID of the offer
- SKU ID of existing SKUs
- Version tags, for example: `1.0.1`
- Billing/license model changes to existing SKUs

## Common update operations

The following update operations are common.

### Update image version for a SKU

It's common for an image to be periodically updated with security patches, additional features, and so on. In this scenario, you want to update the image that your SKU references by using the following steps:

1. Sign into the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).
2. Under **All offers**, find the offer you want to update.
3. In the **SKUs** tab, select the SKU associated with the image to update.
4. Select **+ New Image Version** to add a new  image.
5. Provide the new image versions. The image version needs to follow the same tags guidelines as previous versions. Version tags should be of the form X.Y.Z, where X, Y, and Z are integers. Verify that the new version you provide is greater than all previous versions.
6. Select **Publish** to start the workflow to publish your new container image version to the Azure Marketplace.

### Add a new SKU

Use the following steps to make a new SKU available for your offer:

1. Sign into the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).
2. Under **All offers**, find the offer you want to update.
3. Under the **SKUs** tab, select **Add new SKU** and provide a **SKU ID** in the pop-up window.
4. Republish the offer using the steps described in [Publish Azure application offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md).
5. Select **Publish** to start the workflow to publish your new SKU.

### Update offer marketplace metadata

Use the following steps to update the marketplace metadata associated with your offer. (For example: company name, logos, etc.)

1. Sign into the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).
2. Under **All offers**, find the offer you'd like to update.
3. Go to the **Marketplace** tab. Use the instructions in [Publish Azure application offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md) to make metadata changes.
4. Select **Publish** to start the workflow to publish your changes.

>Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) partner channel opt-in is now available.  Please see [Cloud Solution Providers](../../cloud-solution-providers.md) for more information on marketing your offer through the Microsoft CSP partner channels.

## Deleting an existing offer

You may decide to remove your offer from the Marketplace. Deleting an offer does not affect current purchases of that offer. Those customer purchases will continue to work as before. However, the offer will not be available for any new purchases after the deletion is complete.

Offer Termination is the process of terminating the service and/or licensing agreement between you and your existing customers.
Guidance and policies related to offer removal and termination are governed by Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement (see Section 7) and the Participation Policies (see Section 6.2).

For more information, see [Delete and offer/SKU from Azure Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-managed-app-offer-delete).

## Compare feature

When you make changes to a published offer, you can use the Compare feature to audit the changes that you've made.

To use the Compare feature:

1. At any point in the editing process, select Compare for your offer.
2. Look at side-by-side versions of marketing assets and metadata.

## History of publishing actions

To see historical publishing activity, select the **History** tab on the left navigation menu bar of Cloud Partner Portal. You can see the timestamped actions taken during the lifetime of your Azure Marketplace offers.
