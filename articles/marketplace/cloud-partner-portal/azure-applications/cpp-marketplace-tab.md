### Logo guidelines

All the logos uploaded to the Cloud Partner Portal should follow the guidelines:

- The Azure design has a simple color palette. Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low.
- The theme colors of the Azure Portal are white and black. Avoid using these colors as the background color for your logos. Use a color that will make your logos prominent in the Azure portal. We recommend simple primary colors. If you're using a transparent background, make sure that the logos/text aren't white, black, or blue.
- Don't use a gradient background on your logo.
- Avoid placing text, even your company or brand name, on the logo. The look and feel of your logo should be "flat" and should avoid gradients.
- Don't stretch the logo.


#### Hero logo

The Hero logo is optional.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can't delete the Hero logo after it's uploaded.

Use the following guidelines for a Hero logo:

- Black, white, and transparent backgrounds aren't allowed.
- Avoid using any light color as the background for the logo. The publisher display name, plan title and the offer long summary are displayed in white font color and must stand out against the background.
- Avoid using most text when you're designing the logo. The publisher name, plan title, the offer long summary, and a create button are embedded programmatically inside the logo when the offer's listed.
- Include an unused rectangular space on the right-side of your hero logo. This blank space is 415x100 pixels and offset from the left by 370 pixels.


## Lead Management

The Lead Management form has an optional field to configure lead management. To configure lead management, select the Lead destination from the dropdown list. The next screen capture shows the available destinations.
