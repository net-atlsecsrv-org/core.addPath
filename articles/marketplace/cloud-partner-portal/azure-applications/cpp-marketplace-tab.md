# Azure application Marketplace tab

The [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of Azure application  offers. Instead, this functionality has been moved to the Microsoft [Partner Center portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/). For more information, see [Create an Azure application offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-azure-apps-offer).

Before you create a new Azure application offer, you should read [Create a Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) and then open the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/directory) with the **Overview** page selected. Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure application offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-azure-apps-offer) to create your offer.
