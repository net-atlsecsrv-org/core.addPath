# All offers page

The [**All offers**](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#alloffers) page enables partners to view a list of created offers, including their name, type, publisher, and current status.  You can specify a string to filter the results.   The status area at the bottom of the page displays aggregate and page counts, and enables you to navigate between list pages. Selecting an offer in this list will display that offer in the associated offer editor. 


## Example page

The following image shows the **All offers** page filtered on the string `Contoso`.

## Next steps

The next navigation menubar item displays an [Approvals page](./cpp-approvals-page.md), which lists approved offers.  Approved offers are either already published or in the process of being published.
