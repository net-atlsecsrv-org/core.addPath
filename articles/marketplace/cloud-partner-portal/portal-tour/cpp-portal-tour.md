# Cloud Partner Portal Tour

This article provides an introduction to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com): its contents, navigation mechanisms, and functionality.   This portal enables registered partners to create new offers and manage existing offers for the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [AppSource Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).  The Cloud Partner Portal is only accessible to registered partners; for more information, see [Become a Cloud Marketplace Publisher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher).
