# Container Support tab

Use the **Support** tab of the **New Offer** page to provide technical and user support resources for your offer.  The following input areas are provided on the Support form: **Engineering Contact**, **Customer Support**, and **Support Urls**. An asterisk (*) appended to the field name indicates that it's required.
