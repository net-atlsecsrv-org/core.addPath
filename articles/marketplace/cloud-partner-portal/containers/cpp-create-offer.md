# Create a new container offer with the Cloud Partner Portal

This article describes how to create and publish a container offer entry for the Azure Marketplace. Every offer appears as its own entity in Azure Marketplace and is associated with one or more SKUs.  A container offer is composed of the following groupings of assets and supporting services:

|  **Asset group**   |  **Description**  |
|  ---------------   |  ---------------  |
|    SKUs            |  The smallest deployable unit of an offer. A single offer (product class) can have multiple SKUs associated with the offer. You can use SKUs to differentiate between supported features and billing models. |
|  Marketplace       | Contains marketing, legal and lead management assets and specifications.  <ul><li> Marketing assets include offer name, description, and logos</li> <li> Legal assets include a privacy policy, terms of use, and other legal documentation</li>  <li> Lead management policy enables you to specify how to handle leads from the Azure Marketplace end-user portal.</li> </ul> |
| Support            | Contains support contact and policy information |
