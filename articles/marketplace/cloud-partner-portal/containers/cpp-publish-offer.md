# Publish container offer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving the management of your Azure Container offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure Container offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-azure-container-offer) to manage your migrated offers.

 After you create a new offer using the **New Offer** page, you can publish the offer. Select **Publish** to start the publishing process.

The following diagram shows the main steps in the publishing process for an offer to "go live".
