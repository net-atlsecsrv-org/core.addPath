>[!Important]
>Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving management of your Consulting service offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Consulting service creation overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-consulting-service-offer) to manage your migrated offers.

Define your packaged consulting service offering. Focus on fixed scope, fixed duration, estimated fixed price (or free), and primarily presales-oriented offerings for a single customer. Select repeatable packaged engagements that are popular and effective at driving new business for you.
