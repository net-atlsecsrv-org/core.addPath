### Offer description\*

Enter the description of the consulting service offer in the **Offer description** box. A good offer description covers exact details of what the engagement looks like and the end deliverable to the customer. It should clearly help the customer understand what they get. Include how your offering relates to the Microsoft product for which you're offering consulting services.

Don't include your email address or phone number in your offer description. A **Contact Me** button is included with your offer to upload leads to the lead management target that you identify for your offer.

Enter the offer description in Markdown format. If you're not familiar with Markdown or formatting for HTML, see [Use Markdown for writing docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/how-to-write-use-markdown).

Use these formats to make sure that your offer is easy for your customers to read.

Keep your offer description brief and adhere to the character limit because users don't like to read long text. You also can upload marketing brochures, fact sheets, and other documents that describe your offer in deeper detail.

## Listing details

**Consulting service type**

Microsoft focuses exclusively on fixed scope, fixed duration, estimated or fixed price (or free), and primarily presales-oriented consulting service offerings for a single customer. Types of services are assessment, briefing, implementation, proof of concept, and workshop offers conducted either on-site or virtually. The AppSource consulting services marketplace doesn't support listings for managed or subscription services.

>[!Note]
>AppSource consulting services aren't the appropriate marketplace for subscription or on-demand trainings.

The following five types of offerings are included:

-   **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer's environment to
    determine applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of
    cost and timing.
-   **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a consulting service
    to draw customer interest by using frameworks, demos, and customer
    examples. Briefings must be conducted on-site.
-   **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully
    working solution. For this pilot, Microsoft recommends limiting to
    solutions that can be implemented in one week or less.
-   **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine if
    a solution meets a customer's requirements.
-   **Workshop**: An interactive engagement conducted on a customer's
    premises that can include training sessions, briefings, assessments,
    or demos built on the customer's data or environment.

**Country/region availability**

Select the country and region where this consulting service offer 
is available. A single offer can't be published in multiple countries
or regions. A new offer must be created for each country or region.

>[!Note]
>AppSource consulting services are currently live in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. You can submit an offer for a country/region that isn't yet live, and it will be reviewed and prepared to go live. A minimum number of offers ready to go live are needed to open a new country/region, so offers for countries/regions that aren't live are encouraged.

**Industries**

Select the industries that your consulting service offer is most
applicable to.

**Duration**

Select a number (for example, 3 or 4) under **Duration**, and then
select **Hour**, **Day**, or **Week**.

**Primary products**

To publish to the Azure Marketplace, select **Azure** as the primary
product. Then select the relevant **Solution Areas**.

To publish to AppSource, select **Dynamics 365**, **Power BI**, or
**PowerApps** as your primary product. You also can select other relevant
**Applicable Products**. Then your consulting service offer shows in
listings that are associated with each of these products on AppSource.
