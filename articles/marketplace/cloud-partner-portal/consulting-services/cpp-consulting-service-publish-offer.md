# Publish a consulting service offer

>[!Important]
>Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving management of your Consulting service offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Consulting service creation overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-consulting-service-offer) to manage your migrated offers.

After you finish **Offer Settings**, **Storefront Details**, and **Contacts**, select **Publish** and provide an email address. When Microsoft is ready to publish your offer, you receive an email to preview it before it goes live. You can return to the portal to check the status of your offer at any time.

Offers might appear in a "Publish canceled" or "Publish failed" status during the publishing process. These designations are a normal part of the process and allow Microsoft to make edits to your offer. If your offer appears as "Publish canceled," leave it as that status.

## Lead destination

You can select a CRM system where your lead information is stored. The CRM system you select here is where we write information about the users who try your app on AppSource.

Based on the CRM system you choose, select the corresponding URL from the following list for information on how to fill out the next set of fields.

Select [Azure Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-lead-management-instructions-azure-table) if you have one of the following CRM systems:  
* [Marketo](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-lead-management-instructions-marketo)
