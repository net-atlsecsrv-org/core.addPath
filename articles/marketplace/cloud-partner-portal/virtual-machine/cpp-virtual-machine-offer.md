# Azure Virtual Machine offer

[Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of Azure Virtual Machine offers. This functionality has been moved to Microsoft [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/). For more information, see [Create an Azure Virtual Machine offer](../../partner-center-portal/azure-vm-create-offer.md).
