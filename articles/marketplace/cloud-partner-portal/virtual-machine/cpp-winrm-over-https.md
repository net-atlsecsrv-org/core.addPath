# Windows Remote Management over HTTPS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving the management of your Azure Virtual Machine offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure Virtual Machine offer](https://aka.ms/CreateAzureVMoffer) to manage your migrated offers.

This section explains how to configure an Azure-hosted, Windows-based VM so that it can be managed and deployed remotely with PowerShell.  To enable PowerShell remoting, the target VM must expose a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) HTTPS endpoint.  For more information about PowerShell remoting, see [Running Remote Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands).  For more information about WinRM, see [Windows Remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinRM/portal).

If you created a VM using one of the "classic" Azure approaches—either the Azure Service Manager Portal or the deprecated [Azure Service Management API](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/ee460799(v=azure.100))—then it is automatically configured with a WinRM endpoint.  However, if you create a VM using any of the following "modern" Azure approaches, then your VM will *not* be configured for WinRM over HTTPS.

- Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), typically from an approved base, as described in the section [Create an Azure-compatible VHD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-create-vhd)
- [Using the Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/ps-template)
- Using either the Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI command shell.  For examples, see [Quickstart: Create a Windows virtual machine in Azure with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-powershell) and [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine with the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli).

This WinRM endpoint is also required to run the Certification tool kit for onboarding the VM, as described in [Certify your VM image](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-certify-vm).

In contrast, typically Linux VMs are remotely managed using either [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure) or Linux commands from an SSH console.  Azure also provides several alternative methods to [run scripts in your Linux VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/run-scripts-in-vm).  For more complex scenarios, there are a number of automation and integration solutions available for Windows- or Linux-based VMs.


## Configure and deploy with WinRM

The WinRM endpoint for a windows-based VM can be configured during two different stages of its development:

- During creation - during the deployment of a VM to an existing VHD.  This is the preferred approach for new offers.  This approach requires the creation of an Azure certificate, using supplied Azure Resource Manager templates, and running customized PowerShell scripts.
- After deployment - on an existing VM hosted on Azure.  Use this approach if you already have a VM solution deployed on Azure, and need to enable Window Remote Management for it.  This approach requires manual changes in the Azure portal and the execution of a script on the target VM.


## Next steps
If you are creating a new VM, you can enable WinRM during [deployment of your VM from its VHDs](./cpp-deploy-vm-vhd.md).  Otherwise, WinRM can be enabled in an existing VM
