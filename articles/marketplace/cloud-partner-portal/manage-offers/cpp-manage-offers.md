# Manage Azure and AppSource Marketplace offers

This section introduces the general operations used to manage offers for the Azure and AppSource Marketplaces.  For example, it explains how to use the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) to create and publish a marketplace offer.  This section also explains technical issues that are common to most of the offer types, such as text-based and image assets.


## Standard offer operations

The Cloud Partner Portal enables a publisher to perform the following basic operations on an offer.

|     Operation      |  Description                                           |
|     ---------      |  -----------                                           |
| [Create offer](./cpp-create-offer.md)   | Creates a pending offer entry in onboarding repository, but does not automatically publish it to a Microsoft marketplace | 
| [View offer status](./cpp-view-status-offer.md)   | Provides the publishing status of an offer.  There are multiple places in the portal where status information is displayed. |
| [Publish offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md) | Validates, then posts a completed offer entry to the appropriate Microsoft marketplace.  The offer is then said to be *live*. |
| [Update offer](./cpp-update-offer.md)   | Allows modification of certain characteristics of an existing offer.  Applies to both pending and published offers. |
| [Delete offer](./cpp-delete-offer.md)   | Deletes an existing pending or live offer.  | 
|  |  |
