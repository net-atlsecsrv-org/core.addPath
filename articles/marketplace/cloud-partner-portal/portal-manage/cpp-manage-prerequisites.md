# Prerequisites for managing accounts on the Cloud Partner Portal 

Before you can use the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) for any function, including managing accounts, you must follow a series of steps to register themselves and their organization as Microsoft cloud publishers.


## Account terms and guidelines

Carefully review your rights and responsibilities under the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and the [Microsoft Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/copyright) before you create an account.  

Choose your account name carefully.  It represents your organization, so it should not contain any copyrighted or contentious words.  For example, Microsoft forbids the use of its copyrighted terms, such as "Azure" and "Microsoft", in account names.  For more information, see [Guidelines for Azure Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/guidelines)


## Registration steps

The following table lists the steps necessary to fully register as a Microsoft cloud publisher.  For full instructions, see [Become a Cloud Marketplace Publisher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher). 


|                   Step                   |  Resulting registration or resource                     |
|                  ------                  |  -----------------------------------                    |
| 1. Register in Microsoft Partner Network |  A Microsoft Partner Network ID for your organization |
| 2. Create a Microsoft account*           |  A verified Microsoft account, ending in @outlook.com, @live.com, etc. |
| 3. Submit the marketplace registration form | A publisher account on the Cloud Partner Portal      |
| 4. Sign into Cloud Partner Portal        | Authority to create and publish offers, manage users, collect marketplace metrics, etc. |
| 5. Register in Microsoft Developer Center* | A verified Dev Center account; authority to conduct marketplace transactions  |
|   |   |

\* These steps are required for Azure Marketplace transact offers, but highly recommended for all offers.  Once you establish a Microsoft account and register as a Microsoft Developer, you can access additional Microsoft customer and developer resources as well as optional partner offers.  


## Next steps

After you have completed the registration steps, you should be able to sign in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).  You can use this portal to and manage publisher profiles and manage user accounts.
