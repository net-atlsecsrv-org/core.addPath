No, Azure provides no warning when deleting a purchase, even if it is currently in use, or an application is dependent upon.

**If my Azure Marketplace purchase has any dependencies on other assets such as an Azure website, do I have to manage them?**

Dependencies are not automatically managed for Azure Marketplace offerings. Carefully review the description of Azure Marketplace purchase before using it to determine if there are any dependencies needed prior to deploying the solution.

**Can I buy Azure Marketplace solutions from an Azure Cloud Solution Provider?**

If the publisher has configured their offering to be available through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channel, Cloud Solution Provider partners have the option of reselling the solution.

### Deploying a solution from Azure Marketplace

**I have deployed an Azure Marketplace Virtual Machine (VM) to a subscription, and I now want to migrate the subscription from one Azure account to another. Is this currently supported?**

To migrate an Azure subscription, including Azure Marketplace VMs and services, delete or cancel any prior Azure subscription before associating to the new Azure Account. Once the migration is completed, resulting usage fees are billed using the new registered account's method of payment.

**I want to migrate an Azure Marketplace Virtual Machine (VM) subscription to my Enterprise Agreement. Is this currently supported?**

To migrate an Azure Marketplace Virtual Machine (VM) subscription to an Enterprise Agreement, stop or cancel any prior subscription before the migration. Once the migration of your Azure account and associated subscriptions is complete, you can repurchase the Azure Marketplace VM or service.  The resulting usage fees are billed quarterly under your Enterprise Agreement.

### Pricing and payment

**How are Azure Marketplace subscriptions priced?**

Pricing varies based on product types and publisher specifications. Software license fees and Azure usage costs are charged separately through your Azure subscription.

*Unbundled:*

+ *Bring-your-own-license (BYOL) model*: When obtaining a software license directly from the publisher or a reseller, there are no additional software-related charges or fees.

*Bundled:*

Azure subscription is included with the publisher's Independent Software Vendors (ISV) solution pricing.

*Charged:*

+ *Free:* Free SKU. No charges are applied for software license fees or usage of the offering.

+ *Free software trial:* An offer that is free for a limited period. There is no charge for the publisher's software license fees for use during the trial period. Upon expiration, it automatically converts to a paid offer based on standard rates issued by the publisher.

+ *Usage-Based:* Rates are charged or billed based on the extent usage of the offering. For Virtual Machines Images, it is charged on an hourly fee. For Developer services and APIs, it is charged per unit of measurement as defined by the offering.

+ *Flat fee:* SaaS subscriptions can be priced as a flat fee that is billed monthly or annually. This can also include additional billing dimensions that charge according to consumption (for example, bandwidth, emails, or tickets). 

+ *Per-user:* SaaS subscriptions can be priced on a per-user basis that is billed monthly or annually. 

Offer-specific pricing details can be found on the solution details page on [https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) or within the [Azure portal].

> [!Note]
> Except for monthly fees, Azure usage charges are applicable to all pricing models unless otherwise stated.

**How should I provide my software license key for BYOL marketplace solutions and what role does Azure Marketplace play?**

Acquisition and enforcement of license credentials for BYOL solutions are the responsibility of the publisher. For Virtual Machine offers, the acquisition of the license key typically occurs in the publisher's application after the application has started. When using a Virtual Machine offer deployed via an Azure Application Solution Template, the Resource Manager template can be configured to prompt the user for a range of inputs including license credentials.

These are the most common options per offer type:

*Virtual Machine Offer:*

+ *Option 1:* The acquisition of the license key typically occurs in the publisher's application after the application has started.

+ *Option 2:* The license key is entered by the end user (via command line / web interface provided by the offer) after the deployment of the VM offer in the selected subscription. The license can be a key and/or file, as determined by the publisher.

*Azure Apps (Solution Template and Managed Apps):*

+ *Option 1:* The Resource Manager template can be configured to prompt you for a range of inputs including license credentials. This can be done as a license file (File upload) or a key (textbox input), before the deployment of the offer, in the end-user subscription.

+ *Option 2:* You can enter the license key via command line / web interface provided by the offer.  It is done  after the deployment of the Azure Apps offer in the selected subscription. The license can be a key and/or file, as determined by the publisher.

**What kinds of trials are supported?**

Publishers can add one free month for paid SaaS offers and one or three free months of consumption for VM images. Free trial offers are listings with a call to action to initiate a trial. These lead the customer to a website defined by the publisher to set up the trial experience. Trials can also be added to paid offerings where the first month is free. 

**Do I need to have a payment instrument (for example, credit card) on file to deploy Free Tier or bring your own license (BYOL) offerings?**

No. A payment instrument is not required to deploy Free Tier or BYOL offerings. However, Free Trial offerings require a payment instrument. Listings that include the **Get it now** or **Free software trial** buttons are deployed into the selected Azure subscription.  These listings are billed using the selected account's registered method of payment. Azure usage charges are billed separately from software license fees.

**If they have questions about pricing for offers sold on the Azure Marketplace, who does an Enterprise Agreement (EA) indirect customer contact?**

Enterprise Agreement (EA) indirect customers must contact their Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) for all Azure Marketplace pricing questions.

**Can I control my employees' access to Azure Marketplace and purchasing privileges?**

Yes, for Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers, the enrollment administrator may turn off purchase privileges for all accounts on the enrollment and turn it back on long enough to make a purchase. Additionally, all customers can use Azure Policy to restrict deployment options for their Azure subscriptions, including management of Azure Marketplace resources.

**What payment methods are supported for commercial marketplace purchases?**

Customers can purchase offerings from Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource using credit cards. If you have an existing Azure subscription, purchases from Azure Marketplace will use the payment method configured on the account and appear on the same invoice as a separate line item. Some offers consume Azure monetary commitment, but most commercial marketplace purchases do not draw down Enterprise Agreement commitments although Azure infrastructure consumption will.

**Can I apply Azure subscription credits or monetary commitment funds in my account towards Azure Marketplace offers?**

Specific Azure Marketplace offers can use Azure subscription credits or monetary commitment funds. See [Azure monetary commitment](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-marketplace-third-party-reseller-services-now-use-azure-monetary-commitment/) for a complete list of products participating in this program. These offers do not include BYOL or BYOS options. All other Azure Marketplace offers cannot use Azure subscription credits or monetary commitment: such as the free one-month trial credit, monthly MSDN credits, credits from Azure promotions, monetary commitment balances, and any other free credits provided from Azure.

**Do Volume License discounts apply to Azure Marketplace purchases?**

No. The publisher that owns solutions in Azure Marketplace can set pricing.  Standard Microsoft volume license discounts do not apply towards Azure Marketplace purchases.

**Where can I view my Azure Marketplace subscription details and billing information?**

MOSP - [Microsoft Online Subscription Program](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/?country=us&language=en) (web direct) customers can view Marketplace purchase details in the Invoices tab of the Cost Management + Billing section of the [Azure portal].

Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers can view Marketplace purchase details in the Invoices tab of the Cost Management + Billing section of the [Azure portal].

Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners can view Marketplace purchase details for each customer in Partner Center within the Order History tab after selecting a company in the Customers view.

**How do I cancel an Azure Marketplace add-on to Azure VM?**

Since the add-on is associated to the Azure Virtual Machine (VM), to cancel the Azure Marketplace purchase, first stop the VM by deleting it. Thus stopping all subscription usage and charges on the Azure Marketplace purchase.

**How often am I billed for my Azure Marketplace purchases?**

All Azure Marketplace offers that do not deduct from monetary commitment, are billed monthly in arrears. Annual SaaS subscriptions are billed once for a full year's services.

MOSP - [Microsoft Online Subscription Program](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/) (web direct) customers are charged monthly against the same credit card that is on file for their Azure subscription profile. Annual SaaS subscriptions are billed once for a full year's services.

**How can I move my Azure Marketplace purchases from my MOSP subscription to my direct Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscription?**

Although most Microsoft subscriptions can be easily converted to an Enterprise Agreement, Azure Marketplace purchases within those subscriptions cannot.

To migrate other services purchased from the Azure Marketplace to an EA subscription, first cancel the applications from within the existing MOSP subscription, and repurchase those applications within the EA subscription. By doing so, you can submit a credit request for a refund during the potential month of overlapping coverage between the Marketplace service subscriptions - create a [support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).

**What is the difference between *price*, *software price*, and *total price* in the cost structure for Virtual Machine offers in the Azure Marketplace?**

*Price* refers to the cost of the Azure Virtual Machine to run the software. *Software price* refers to the cost of the Marketplace publisher's software running on an Azure Virtual Machine. *Total price* refers to the combined total cost of the Azure Virtual Machine and the Marketplace publisher's software running on an Azure Virtual Machine.

**How do I find out how much of my Azure Marketplace purchase I have used?**

An estimated usage information can be found in the [Azure portal]. Such estimated usage information may not include recent activities, and may be based on projections derived from past consumption. During the public preview, this capability may not be available for all purchases and may vary based on product type.

Licenses that are cancelled will be subject to the refund policy found in this FAQ.  All licenses that are cancelled are immediately removed from your account and will no longer be available for use.

**Are refunds supported for consumption-based offers?**

Any charges based on consumption – whether it’s hourly VMs or custom meters – are not refundable through cancellation. Once the consumption has taken place, the charges are processed by Microsoft’s commerce platform, and any quality of service disputes where a refund is requested would be handled outside Microsoft systems between the publisher and the customer directly. Offers that support a flat rate plus metered billing follows the standard refund policy for the flat rate charges.

**Is it possible to change plans mid-term?**

No, it is not possible to transition between monthly and annual.

**Can a customer purchase two plans from the same offer?**

Yes, it is possible for a customer to own two plans from the same offer simultaneously.

**How can a publisher change the geographic availability for an existing offer?**

The publisher can edit an existing offer, select the new countries/regions, and use the spreadsheet download/upload function to set pricing.

**In what countries/regions can customers purchase Azure Marketplace offerings?**

Azure Marketplace supports 141 buy-from geographies as defined by the customer's billing address. See [participation policies](/legal/marketplace/participation-policy) for a list of countries/regions.

**What currencies are supported by Azure Marketplace?**

Transactions can be conducted in the following 17 currencies: AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, INR, JPY, KRW, NOK, NZD, RUB, SEK, TWD, and USD.

### Pricing and Payment

**What is the difference between Free Tier and Free Software Trial?**

A Free Tier subscription offering is perpetually free.  A Free Software Trial (Try It Now) offering is a paid subscription, only free for a limited period of time.

**What is the process to validate the end to end purchase and provisioning flow?**

During the publishing process, you will be provided with access to a preview of your offer. Access is restricted to users that you specified in the Preview tab, and this is a live offer that is not visible to anyone else. You can purchase this and test the process; however, you will be charged the full amount according to your offer’s configuration.

To complete a purchase at a very low price, Microsoft suggests publishing a private Plan to yourself set at a price you can accept as the cost of testing. Zero is supported but will not reflect the full experience like a paid subscription.

**Will Microsoft provide a refund outside standard policies?**

Yes, upon your request via support ticket, Microsoft will process credits to your customer if you deem it appropriate.
