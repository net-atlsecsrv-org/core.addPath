# Configure Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & Power Apps offer properties

This page lets you define the categories used to group your offer on Microsoft AppSource, your application version, and the legal contracts that support your offer.

## Categories

Select categories and subcategories to place your offer in the appropriate AppSource search areas. Be sure to describe later in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

- Select a Primary category.
- To add a second optional category (Secondary), select the **+Categories** link.
- Select up to two subcategories for the Primary and/or Secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**. Use Ctrl+click to select a second subcategory.

See the full list of categories and subcategories in [Offer Listing Best Practices](gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md).

## Industries

[!INCLUDE [Industry Taxonomy](./includes/industry-taxonomy.md)]

Select the **Applicable products** in Dynamics 365 this offer applies to.

Enter an **App version** for your offer. Customers will see this number listed on the offer's detail page.

## Legal

Provide the **Terms and conditions** customers must accept before they can try your offer. You can also provide the web address where your terms and conditions can be found.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.
