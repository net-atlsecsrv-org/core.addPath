# How to get featured in AppSource and Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace and AppSource have **featured apps** sections, where you can get your app featured:

* First, if you have a TRIAL or TRANSACTION offer, you can use your "category promotion" benefit through [commercial marketplace benefits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-your-marketplace-benefits).
* Second, review the list of best practices and criteria below to earn a spot.

The featured apps selection algorithm generates a score to an app by Microsoft, just like a person's credit score in the US.  The weekly selection of featured apps will be based on a calculation of app and service performance.

## Steps to take

You can take the following action items to improve your score:

1. *Ensure that your app or service is appropriately categorized*: choose three categories that represent your app or service's capabilities.
2. *Azure Marketplace Apps: grow your Azure consumption month-over-month.* If you are able to achieve 1,000 hours of Azure usage a month, you will greatly increase your chances of being featured.
3. *AppSource Apps: increase the acquisitions coming to your offer.* If you are able to achieve 10 acquisitions per month, you will greatly increase your chances of being featured. 
4. *Achieve Co-Sell ready status*: complete the requirements for co-sell ready.
5. *Improve the quality of your offer*: see  [content listing guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-criteria-content-validation) for information on how to modify your offer
6. Publish multiple offers in Marketplace: are all your core apps and services listed? Do you have a trial experience?
7. Encourage your customers to write reviews.

Featured Apps promotions operate separately from the search algorithm.
