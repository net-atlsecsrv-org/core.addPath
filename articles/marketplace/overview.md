# What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace?

The Microsoft commercial marketplace is a catalog of solutions from our independent software vendor (ISV) partners. As an ISV member of the Microsoft Partner Network, you can create, publish, and manage your commercial marketplace offers in Partner Center. Your solutions are listed in our online stores, alongside our own Microsoft solutions, connecting you with businesses, organizations, and government agencies around the world.

The commercial marketplace is available in more than 100 countries and regions, and we manage tax payment in many of them. If you sell to established Microsoft customers, they have the added benefit of including commercial marketplace purchases in their existing Microsoft purchase agreements to receive a consolidated invoice from Microsoft.

## Commercial marketplace online stores

The Microsoft commercial marketplace has two online stores: [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/). Microsoft AppSource contains business solutions and Azure Marketplace contains IT solutions. Commercial marketplace software and services can also be found in Microsoft products such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and Azure. Our online stores and in-product experiences draw millions of potential customers each month. Each online store offers different scenarios to make sure your solution or service is available to the right customers.

When you create a commercial marketplace offer in Partner Center, it may be listed on either or both online stores based on the offer type, categories, and other options you select. In the rare case that the offer is relevant to the users of both online stores, it can appear in both. To learn more, see [Select an online store](determine-your-listing-type.md#selecting-an-online-store) and [A Buyer’s Guide to Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace](https://aka.ms/MarketplaceBuyerGuide).

### Microsoft AppSource

[Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) is for business solutions, such as software as a service (SaaS) applications, and also apps that extend directly into Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Power Platform. AppSource consulting services are professional services offerings that help customers get started with or accelerate usage of Dynamics 365 and Power BI.

Here’s an example of an offer listing page in AppSource:

####  AppSource in-product experience

Customers can also access your AppSource offers through Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, the Power Platform, and Azure. The following example shows how to access AppSource add-ins from the Power BI **File** menu.

[Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) is for solutions that are built on or built for Azure and intended for IT professionals and developers. This includes listings for consulting and managed services. Azure Marketplace consulting services are professional service offerings that help customers get started with or accelerate the use of Azure.

Here’s an example of an offer listing page in Azure Marketplace:
