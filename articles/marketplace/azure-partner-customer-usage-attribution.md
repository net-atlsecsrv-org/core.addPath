# Azure partner customer usage attribution

As a software partner for Azure, your solutions require Azure components or they need to be deployed directly on the Azure infrastructure. Customers who deploy a partner solution and provision their own Azure resources can find it difficult to gain visibility into the status of the deployment, and get optics into the impact on Azure growth. When you add a higher level of visibility, you align with the Microsoft sales teams and gain credit for Microsoft partner programs.

Microsoft now offers a method to help partners better track Azure usage of customer deployments of their software on Azure. The new method uses Azure Resource Manager to orchestrate the deployment of Azure services.

As a Microsoft partner, you can associate Azure usage with any Azure resources that you provision on a customer's behalf. You can form the association via the Azure Marketplace, the Quickstart repository, private GitHub repositories, and one-on-one customer engagement. Customer usage attribution supports three deployment options:

- Azure Resource Manager templates: Partners can use Resource Manager templates to deploy the Azure services to run the partner's software. Partners can create a Resource Manager template to define the infrastructure and configuration of their Azure solution. A Resource Manager template allows you and your customers to deploy your solution throughout its lifecycle. You can be confident that your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
- Azure Resource Manager APIs: Partners can call the Resource Manager APIs directly to deploy a Resource Manager template or to generate the API calls to directly provision Azure services.
- Terraform: Partners can use cloud orchestrator such as Terraform to deploy a Resource Manager template or directly deploy Azure services.

Customer usage attribution is for new deployment and does NOT support tagging existing resources that have already been deployed.

Customer usage attribution is required on [Azure Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/azure-applications/cpp-azure-app-offer): solution template offer published to Azure Marketplace.

## Use Resource Manager templates
Many partner solutions are deployed on a customer's subscription by using Resource Manager templates. If you have a Resource Manager template that's available in the Azure Marketplace, on GitHub, or as a Quickstart, the process to modify your template to enable customer usage attribution should be straight forward.

For more information on creating and publishing Solution Templates, see

* [Create and deploy your first Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal).
* [Azure Application offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/azure-applications/cpp-azure-app-offer).
* Video: [Building Solution Templates, and Managed Applications for the Azure Marketplace](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/BRK3603).


## Add a GUID to your template

To add a globally unique identifier (GUID), you make a single modification to the main template file:

1. [Create a GUID](#create-guids) using the suggested method and [register the GUID](#register-guids-and-offers).

1. Open the Resource Manager template.

1. Add a new resource in the main template file. The resource needs to be in the **mainTemplate.json** or **azuredeploy.json** file only, and not in any nested or linked templates.

1. Enter the GUID value after the **pid-** prefix (e.g., pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063).

1. Check the template for any errors.

1. Republish the template in the appropriate repositories.

1. [Verify GUID success in the template deployment](#verify-the-guid-deployment).

### Sample Resource Manager template code

To enable tracking resources for your template, you need to add the following additional resource under the resources section. Please make sure to modify the below sample code with your own inputs when you add it to the main template file.
The resource needs to be added in the **mainTemplate.json** or **azuredeploy.json** file only, and not in any nested or linked templates.

```
// Make sure to modify this sample code with your own inputs where applicable

{ // add this resource to the resources section in the mainTemplate.json (do not add the entire file)
    "apiVersion": "2018-02-01",
    "name": "pid-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX", // use your generated GUID here
    "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
    "properties": {
        "mode": "Incremental",
        "template": {
            "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
            "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
            "resources": []
        }
    }
} // remove all comments from the file when complete
```

## Use the Resource Manager APIs

In some cases, you might prefer to make calls directly against the Resource Manager REST APIs to deploy Azure services. [Azure supports multiple SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/?pivot=sdkstools) to enable these calls. You can use one of the SDKs, or call the REST APIs directly to deploy resources.

If you're using a Resource Manager template, you should tag your solution by following the instructions described earlier. If you aren't using a Resource Manager template and making direct API calls, you can still tag your deployment to associate usage of Azure resources.

### Tag a deployment with the Resource Manager APIs

To enable customer usage attribution, when you design your API calls, include a GUID in the user agent header in the request. Add the GUID for each offer or SKU. Format the string with the **pid-** prefix and include the partner-generated GUID. Here's an example of the GUID format for insertion into the user agent:

![Example GUID format](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/tracking-sample-guid-for-lu-2.PNG)

> [!Note]
> The format of the string is important. If the **pid-** prefix isn't included, it's not possible to query the data. Different SDKs track differently. To implement this method, review the support and tracking approach for your preferred Azure SDK.

#### Example: The Python SDK

For Python, use the **config** attribute. You can only add the attribute to a UserAgent. Here's an example:

![Add the attribute to a user agent](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/python-for-lu.PNG)

> [!Note]
> Add the attribute for each client. There's no global static configuration. You might tag a client factory to be sure every client is tracking. For more information, see this [client factory sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/7402fb2c20be2cdbcaa7bdb2eeb72b7461fbcc30/src/azure-cli-core/azure/cli/core/commands/client_factory.py#L70-L79).

#### Tag a deployment by using the Azure PowerShell

If you deploy resources via Azure PowerShell, append your GUID by using the following method:

```powershell
[Microsoft.Azure.Common.Authentication.AzureSession]::ClientFactory.AddUserAgent("pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063")
```

#### Tag a deployment by using the Azure CLI

When you use the Azure CLI to append your GUID, set the **AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT** environment variable. You can set this variable within the scope of a script. You can also set the variable globally for shell scope:

```
export AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT='pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063'
```
For more information, see [Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/go/).

## Use Terraform

The support for Terraform is available through Azure Provider's 1.21.0 release: [https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1210-january-11-2019](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1210-january-11-2019).  This support applies to all partners who deploy their solution via Terraform, and all resources deployed and metered by the Azure Provider (version 1.21.0 or later).

Azure provider for Terraform added a new optional field called [*partner_id*](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/#partner_id) which is where you specify the tracking GUID that you use for your solution. The value of this field can also be sourced from the *ARM_PARTNER_ID* Environment Variable.

```
provider "azurerm" {
          subscription_id = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
          client_id = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
          ……
          # new stuff for ISV attribution
          partner_id = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}
```
Partners who want to get their deployment via Terraform tracked by customer usage attribution need to do the following:

* Create a GUID (the GUID should be added for each Offer or SKU)
* Update their Azure Provider to set the value of *partner_id* to the GUID (DO NOT pre-fix the GUID with "pid-", just set it to the actual GUID)

## Create GUIDs

A GUID is a unique reference number that has 32 hexadecimal digits. To create GUIDs for tracking, you should use a GUID generator. The Azure Storage team has created a [GUID generator form](https://aka.ms/StoragePartners) that will email you a GUID of the correct format and can be reused across the different tracking systems.

> [!Note]
> It is highly recommended that you use [Azure Storage's GUID generator form](https://aka.ms/StoragePartners) to create your GUID. For more information, see our [FAQ](#faq).

We recommend you create a unique GUID for every offer and distribution channel for each product. You can opt to use a single GUID for the product's multiple distribution channels if you do not want reporting to be split.

If you deploy a product by using a template and it is available on both the Azure Marketplace and on GitHub, you can create and register 2 distinct GUIDS:

*    Product A in Azure Marketplace
*    Product A on GitHub

Reporting is done by the partner value (Microsoft Partner ID) and the GUIDs.

You can also track GUIDs at a more granular level like the SKU, where SKUs are variants of an offer.

## Register GUIDs and offers

The GUIDs must be registered to enable customer usage attribution.

All registrations for template GUIDs are done within Partner Center.

After you add the GUID to your template or in the user agent, and register the GUID in Partner Center, all deployments are tracked.

1. Sign up as a [commercial marketplace publisher](https://aka.ms/JoinMarketplace).

   * Partners are required to [have a profile in Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher). You're encouraged to list the offer in the commercial marketplace.
   * Partners can register multiple GUIDs.
   * Partners can register a GUID for the non-Marketplace solution templates and offers.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).

1. In the upper-right corner, select the settings gear icon, and then select **Developer settings**.

1. On the **Account settings page**, select **Add Tracking GUID.**

1. In the **GUID** box, enter your tracking GUID. Enter just the GUID without the **pid-** prefix. In the **Description** box, enter your offer name or description.

1. To register more than one GUID, select **Add Tracking GUID** again. Additional boxes appear on the page.

1. Select **Save**.


## Verify the GUID deployment

After you modify your template and run a test deployment, use the following PowerShell script to retrieve the resources that you deployed and tagged.

You can use the script to verify that the GUID is successfully added to your Resource Manager template. The script doesn't apply to Resource Manager API or Terraform deployments.

Sign in to Azure. Select the subscription with the deployment that you want to verify before you run the script. Run the script within the subscription context of the deployment.

The **GUID** and **resourceGroup** name of the deployment are required parameters.

You can get [the original script](https://gist.github.com/bmoore-msft/ae6b8226311014d6e7177c5127c7eba1#file-verify-deploymentguid-ps1) on GitHub.

```powershell
Param(
    [GUID][Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]$guid,
    [string][Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]$resourceGroupName
)

# Get the correlationId of the pid deployment

$correlationId = (Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName
$resourceGroupName -Name "pid-$guid").correlationId

# Find all deployments with that correlationId

$deployments = Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName | Where-Object{$_.correlationId -eq $correlationId}

# Find all deploymentOperations in a deployment by name
# PowerShell doesn't surface outputResources on the deployment
# or correlationId on the deploymentOperation

foreach ($deployment in $deployments){

# Get deploymentOperations by deploymentName
# then the resourceId for any create operation

($deployment | Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation | Where-Object{$_.properties.provisioningOperation -eq "Create" -and $_.properties.targetResource.resourceType -ne "Microsoft.Resources/deployments"}).properties.targetResource.id

}
```

## Report

You can find the report for customer usage attribution in your Partner Center dashboard ([https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/mpn/analytics/CPP/MicrosoftAzure](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/mpn/analytics/CPP/MicrosoftAzure)). In order to see the report, you have to use your Partner Center credentials to sign in. If you encounter any issues with report or sign in, create a support request following the instruction in the Get support section.

Choose Tracked Template in the dropdown list of Partner Association Type to see the report.

## Notify your customers

Partners should inform their customers about deployments that use customer usage attribution. Microsoft reports the Azure usage that's associated with these deployments to the partner. The following examples include content that you can use to notify your customers about these deployments. In the examples, replace \<PARTNER> with your company name. Partners should make sure the notification aligns with their data privacy and collection policies, including options for customers to be excluded from tracking.

### Notification for Resource Manager template deployments

When you deploy this template, Microsoft is able to identify the installation of \<PARTNER> software with the Azure resources that are deployed. Microsoft is able to correlate the Azure resources that are used to support the software. Microsoft collects this information to provide the best experiences with their products and to operate their business. The data is collected and governed by Microsoft's privacy policies, which can be found at https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter.

### Notification for SDK or API deployments

When you deploy \<PARTNER> software, Microsoft is able to identify the installation of \<PARTNER> software with the Azure resources that are deployed. Microsoft is able to correlate the Azure resources that are used to support the software. Microsoft collects this information to provide the best experiences with their products and to operate their business. The data is collected and governed by Microsoft's privacy policies, which can be found at https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter.

## FAQ

**What's the benefit of adding the GUID to the template?**

Microsoft provides partners with a view of customer deployments of their solutions and insights on their influenced usage. Both Microsoft and the partner can use this information to drive closer engagement between sales teams. Both Microsoft and the partner can use the data to get a more consistent view of an individual partner's impact on Azure growth.

**After a GUID is added, can it be changed?**

Yes, a customer or implementation partner may customize the template and can change or remove the GUID. We suggest that partners proactively describe the role of the resource and GUID to their customers and partners to prevent removal or edits to the GUID. Changing the GUID affects only new, not existing, deployments, and resources.

**Can I track templates deployed from a non-Microsoft repository like GitHub?**

Yes, as long as the GUID is present when the template is deployed, usage is tracked. Partners are required to have a profile in the commercial marketplace enrollment in Partner Center to register GUIDs used for the deployment outside of the Azure Marketplace.

**Does the customer receive reporting as well?**

Customers can track their usage of individual resources or customer-defined resource groups within the Azure portal.

**Is this methodology similar to the Digital Partner of Record (DPOR)?**

This new method of connecting the deployment and usage to a partner's solution provides a mechanism to link a partner solution to Azure usage. DPOR is intended to associate a consulting (Systems Integrator) or management (Managed Service Provider) partner with a customer's Azure subscription.

**What's the benefit to using Azure Storage's GUID Generator form?**

Azure Storage's GUID Generator form is guaranteed to generate a GUID of the required format. Additionally, if you are using any of Azure Storage's data plane tracking methods, you can leverage the same GUID for Marketplace control plane tracking. This allows you to leverage a singled unified GUID for Partner attribution without having to maintain separate GUIDS.

**Can I use a private, custom VHD for a solution template offer in the Azure Marketplace?**

No, you cannot. The virtual machine image must come from the Azure Marketplace, see: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-virtual-machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-virtual-machines).

You can create a VM offer in marketplace using your custom VHD and mark it as Private so that no one can see it. Then reference to this VM in your solution template.

**Failed to update *contentVersion* property for the main template?**

Likely a bug in some cases when the template is being deployed by using a TemplateLink from another template that expect older contentVersion for some reason. The workaround is to use the metadata property:

```
"$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "metadata": {
        "contentVersion": "1.0.1.0"
    },
    "parameters": {
```
