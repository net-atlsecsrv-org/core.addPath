# Sample queries for programmatic analytics

This article provides sample queries for the Microsoft commercial marketplace Orders, Usage, and Customer reports. You can use these queries by calling the [Create Report Query](analytics-programmatic-access.md#create-report-query-api) API endpoint. If required, the [Create Report Query](analytics-programmatic-access.md#create-report-query-api) API call can be modified to add more columns, adjust the computation period, and add filter conditions. The supported time periods are six months (6M), 12 months (12M), and Custom Time Period.

For details about the column names, attributes, and descriptions, refer to the following tables:

- [Customer details table](customer-dashboard.md#customer-details-table)
- [Orders details table](orders-dashboard.md#orders-details-table)
- [Usage details table](usage-dashboard.md#usage-details-table)
