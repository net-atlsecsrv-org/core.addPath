# How to configure your Managed Service offer listing details

The information you provide on the **Offer listing** page of Partner Center will be displayed on Azure Marketplace. This includes your offer name, description, media, and other marketing assets.

> [!NOTE]
> If your offer is in a language other than English, the offer listing can be in that language, but the description must begin or end with the English phrase “This service is available in &lt;language of your offer content>”. You can also provide supporting documents in a language that's different from the one used in the offer listing details.

On the **Offer listing** page in Partner Center, provide the information described below. To learn more about the listing details for your Managed Service offer, review [Plan a Managed Service offer](./plan-managed-service-offer.md).

## Marketplace details

1. The **Name** box is pre-filled with the name you entered earlier in the New offer dialog box, but you can change it at any time. This name will appear as the title of your offer listing on the online store.
2. In the **Search results summary** box, describe the purpose or goal of your offer in 100 characters or less.
3. In the **Short description** field, provide a short description of your offer (up to 256 characters). It’ll be displayed on your offer listing in the Azure portal.
4. In the **Description** field, describe your Managed Service offer. You can enter up to 2,000 characters of text in this box, including HTML tags and spaces. For information about HTML formatting, see [HTML tags supported in the offer descriptions](./supported-html-tags.md).
5. In the **Privacy policy link** box, enter a link (starting with https) to your organization's privacy policy. You're responsible to ensure your offer complies with privacy laws and regulations, and for providing a valid privacy policy.

## Useful links

You have the option to provide supplemental online documents about your solution:

1. Select **Add a link**.
2. Provide a name and web address (starting with https) for each document.

## Contact information

Enter the name, email address, and phone number of two people in your company (you can be one of them): a support contact and an engineering contact. We'll use this information to communicate with you about your offer. This information isn’t shown to customers but may be provided to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners.

## Support URLs

If you have support websites for Azure Global Customers and/or Azure Government customers, enter their URL, starting with https.

## Marketplace media

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an issue uploading files, make sure your local network does not block the `https://upload.xboxlive.com` service used by Partner Center.

### Add logos

Under **Logos**, upload a **Large** logo in .PNG format between 216 x 216 and 350 x 350 pixels. Partner Center will automatically create **Medium** and **Small** logos, which you can replace later.

* The large logo (from 216 x 216 to 350 x 350 px) appears on your offer listing on Azure Marketplace.
* The medium logo (90 x 90 px) is shown when a new resource is created.
* The small logo (48 x 48 px) is used on the Azure Marketplace search results.

### Add screenshots (optional)

Add up to five images that demonstrate your offer. All images must be 1280 x 720 pixels in size and in .PNG format.

1. Under **Screenshots**, drag and drop your PNG file onto the **Screenshot** box.
2. Select **Add image caption**.
3. In the dialog box that appears, enter a caption.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 to add additional screenshots.

### Add videos (optional)

You can add links to YouTube or Vimeo videos that demonstrate your offer. These videos are shown to customers along with your offer. You must enter a thumbnail image of the video, sized 1280 x 720 pixels and in .PNG format. Add a maximum of five videos per offer.

1. Under **Videos**, select the **Add video link**.
2. In the boxes that appear, enter the name and link for your video.
3. Drag and drop a PNG file (1280 x 720 pixels) onto the gray **Thumbnail** box.
4. To add another video, repeat steps 1 through 3.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab: **Preview audience**.
