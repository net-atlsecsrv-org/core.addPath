# Promote Your Business with Microsoft 

Microsoft has the goal to support partners (you) and to simplify the selling of your app or offer in the storefronts on the marketplace. By listing on the marketplace, you access the programs and resources on the marketplace. 

If you have not already signed up to the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN), then do this before continuing.  
*   For more information about MPN, visit the Microsoft Partner Network page located at [partner.microsoft.com](https://partner.microsoft.com).  

MPN provides guidance on the following topics.  
*   New business opportunities  
*   Connecting with teams or partners  
*   Solutions and training to help grow your skillset  

To promote your offer or app, use the following table to access more benefits and resources.
