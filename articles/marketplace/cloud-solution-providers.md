# Cloud Solution Providers

Software offers can reach millions of qualified Microsoft customers served by partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, in addition to public availability of offers through [Microsoft web storefronts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/comparing-appsource-azure-marketplace).

Publishers configure offers for availability in the CSP program on an opt-in basis, for a new offer or an existing one, enabling partners to sell your products and create bundled solutions for customers.

Publishers are responsible for providing break-fix support to end customers and for providing a mechanism for partners in the CSP program and/or customers to contact you for support. It is a best practice to provide partners in the CSP program with user documentation, training, and service health/outage notifications (as applicable) so that partners in the CSP program are equipped to handle tier 1 support requests from customers.  

The following offers are eligible to be opted in to be sold by partners in the CSP program:

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) transact offers
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Solution templates
- Managed applications

> [!NOTE]
> Containers and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) VM SKUs are opted in to be sold by partners in the CSP program by default.

## How to configure an offering

The CSP program opt-in setting is configured in the Partner Center or Cloud Partner Portal offer creation experience. [Learn more about the changing publisher experience](https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/Azure-Marketplace-and-AppSource/Cloud-Marketplace-In-Partner-Center/m-p/9738#M293).

### Partner Center opt-in

In Partner Center, you'll find the opt-in experience under the CSP Reseller audience module.

![CSP Reseller audience](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-audience.png)

In the CSP Reseller audience module, you have three options to choose from:

- Option one: Any partner in the CSP program
- Option two: Specific partners in the CSP program I select
- Option three: No partners in the CSP program

#### Option one: Any partner in the CSP program

![Any partner in the CSP program](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-option-one.png)

 By choosing this option, all partners in the CSP program are eligible to resell your offer to their customers.

#### Option two: Specific partners in the CSP program I select

![Specific partners in the CSP program I select](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-option-two.png)

By choosing this option, you authorize which partners in the CSP program are eligible to resell your offer.

To authorize partners, click **Select CSP Partners** and a menu appears that lets you search by partner name or CSP Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant ID.

![Select CSP menu](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-pop-up-module.png)

You can apply search filters, such as **Country**, **Competency**, or **Skill**.

![Country, competency, and skill filters for partner search](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-add-resellers.png)

Once you've chosen the list of partners, select **Add**.

![Example list of authorized partners in the CSP program](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-add-resellers-details.png)

A table showing the list of partners you selected appears on the CSP Reseller audience page.

![Table with list of partners on CSP Reseller audience page](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-option-two-add-reseller.png)

Select **Save draft** to register your changes.

If this offer is unpublished, you'll need to publish your offer to make it available to your selected partners.

>[!NOTE]
>If you authorize a partner in the CSP program in a given region, they can sell the offer to any customer that belongs to that particular region. See [Cloud Solution Provider program regional markets and currency](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview) for more information on how CSP offers are classified under regions.

If you're updating the CSP list of an already published offer, add the additional partners and select **Sync CSP audience**.

If you have an offer that already has a list of authorized partners and you'd like to use the same list for another offer, use **Import/Export**. Navigate to the offer that has the CSP list and select **Export CSPs**. The function develops a .csv file that can be imported into another offer.

#### Option three: No partners in the CSP program

![No partners in the CSP program](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-option-three.png)

By choosing this option, you're opting your offer out of the CSP program. You can change this selection at any time.

### Cloud Partner Portal opt-in

In Cloud Partner Portal, the opt-in is set on the Marketplace or Storefront tab. The ability to choose specific partners in the CSP program is only available in Partner Center.

## Deauthorize Partners in the CSP program

If you've authorized a partner in the CSP program and that partner has already resold the product to their customers, you won't be allowed to deauthorize that partner.

If a partner in the CSP program has not sold your product to their customers and you'd like to remove the CSP after your offer has been published, use the following instructions:

1. Go to the [Support request page](https://aka.ms/marketplacepublishersupport). The first few dropdown menus are automatically filled in for you.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't change the pre-populated dropdown menu selections.

2. For **Select the product version**, select **Live offer management**.
3. For **Select a category that best describe the issue**, choose the category that refers to your offer.
4. For **Select a problem that best describes the issue**, select **Update existing offer**.
5. Select **Next** to be directed to the **Issue details page** to enter more details about your issue.
6. Use **Deauthorize CSP** as the issue title and fill out the rest of the required sections.

## Sharing sales and support materials with partners in the CSP program

To help partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program most effectively represent your offering and engage with your organization, you must submit sales and support materials that will be available to the resellers. These resources will not be exposed to customers in the marketplace storefronts.

### Partner Center CSP channel

If you've opted into the CSP channel in Partner Center, publishers must enter a URL that hosts relevant marketing materials and channel contact information to the CSP channel under the offer listing module:

### Cloud Partner Portal CSP channel

If you have opted into the CSP channel in Cloud Partner Portal, publishers must enter a URL that hosts relevant marketing materials and channel contact information to the CSP channel:
