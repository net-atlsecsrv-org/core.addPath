# Cloud Solution Provider program

This article explains how to configure your offer to be available to the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. In addition to publishing your offers through [commercial marketplace online stores](overview.md#commercial-marketplace-online-stores), you can also sell through the CSP program to reach millions of qualified Microsoft customers that the program serves.

You can configure new or existing offers for availability in the CSP program on an opt-in basis, which allows CSP partners to sell your products and create bundled solutions for customers.

Publishers are responsible for providing break-fix support to end customers and for providing a mechanism for partners in the CSP program and/or customers to contact you for support. It is a best practice to provide partners in the CSP program with user documentation, training, and service health/outage notifications (as applicable) so that partners in the CSP program are equipped to handle tier 1 support requests from customers.  

The following offers are eligible to be opted in to be sold by partners in the CSP program:

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) transact offers
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Solution templates
- Managed applications

> [!NOTE]
> Containers and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) VM plans are opted in to be sold by partners in the CSP program by default.

## How to configure an offer

Configure the CSP program opt-in setting when you create the offer in Partner Center. [Learn more about the changing publisher experience](https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/Azure-Marketplace-and-AppSource/Cloud-Marketplace-In-Partner-Center/m-p/9738#M293).

### Partner Center opt-in

The opt-in experience is located under the CSP Reseller audience module:

![CSP Reseller audience](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-audience.png)

Choose from three options:

1. Any partner in the CSP program.
2. Specific partners in the CSP program I select.
3. No partners in the CSP program.

#### Option 1: Any partner in the CSP program

![Any partner in the CSP program](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-option-one.png)

 By choosing this option, all partners in the CSP program are eligible to resell your offer to their customers.

#### Option 2: Specific partners in the CSP program I select

![Specific partners in the CSP program I select](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-option-two.png)

By choosing this option, you authorize which partners in the CSP program are eligible to resell your offer.

To authorize partners, select **Select CSP Partners** and a menu appears that lets you search by partner name or CSP Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant ID.

![Select CSP menu](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-pop-up-module.png)

You can apply search filters, such as **Country**, **Competency**, or **Skill**.

![Country/region, competency, and skill filters for partner search](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-add-resellers.png)

Once you've chosen the list of partners, select **Add**.

![Example list of authorized partners in the CSP program](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-add-resellers-details.png)

A table showing the list of partners you selected appears on the CSP Reseller audience page.

![Table with list of partners on CSP Reseller audience page](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-option-two-add-reseller.png)

Select **Save draft** to register your changes.

If this offer is unpublished, you'll need to publish your offer to make it available to your selected partners.

>[!NOTE]
>If you authorize a partner in the CSP program in a given region, they can sell the offer to any customer that belongs to that particular region. For more information on how CSP offers are classified under regions, see [Cloud Solution Provider program regional markets and currency](/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview).

If you're updating the CSP list of an already published offer, add the additional partners and select **Sync CSP audience**.

If you have an offer that already has a list of authorized partners and you'd like to use the same list for another offer, use **Import/Export**. Navigate to the offer that has the CSP list and select **Export CSPs**. The function develops a .csv file that can be imported into another offer.

#### Option 3: No partners in the CSP program

![No partners in the CSP program](media/marketplace-publishers-guide/csp-reseller-option-three.png)

By choosing this option, you're opting your offer out of the CSP program. You can change this selection at any time.

## Deauthorize Partners in the CSP program

If you've authorized a partner in the CSP program and that partner has already resold the product to their customers, you won't be allowed to deauthorize that partner.

If a partner in the CSP program has not sold your product to their customers and you'd like to remove the CSP after your offer has been published, use the following instructions:

1. Go to the [Support request page](https://aka.ms/marketplacepublishersupport). The first few dropdown menus are automatically filled in for you.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't change the pre-populated dropdown menu selections.

2. For **Select the product version**, select **Live offer management**.
3. For **Select a category that best describe the issue**, choose the category that refers to your offer.
4. For **Select a problem that best describes the issue**, select **Update existing offer**.
5. Select **Next** to be directed to the **Issue details page** to enter more details about your issue.
6. Use **Deauthorize CSP** as the issue title and fill out the rest of the required sections.

## Navigate between options

6. Use **Deauthorize CSP** as the issue title and fill out the rest of the required sections.

## Sharing sales and support materials with partners in the CSP program

To help partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program most effectively represent your offer and engage with your organization, you must submit sales and support materials that will be available to the resellers. These resources will not be exposed to customers in the online stores.

### Partner Center CSP channel

If you've opted into the CSP channel in Partner Center, publishers must enter a URL that hosts relevant marketing materials and channel contact information under the offer listing module.
