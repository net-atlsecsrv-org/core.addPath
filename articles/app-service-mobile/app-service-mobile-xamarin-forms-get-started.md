# Create a Xamarin.Forms app with Azure

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

## Overview
This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based back-end service to a Xamarin.Forms mobile app by using the Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service as the back end. You create both a new Mobile Apps back end and a simple to-do list Xamarin.Forms app that stores app data in Azure.

Completing this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Mobile Apps tutorials for Xamarin.Forms.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile apps that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For more information, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin, in Visual Studio 2017 or later, or Visual Studio for Mac. See the [Xamarin installation page][Install Xamarin] for instructions.

* (optional) To build an iOS app, a Mac with Xcode 9.0 or later is required. Visual Studio for Mac can be used to develop iOS apps, or Visual Studio 2017 or later can be used (so long as the Mac is available on the network).

## Create a new Mobile Apps back end
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Create a database connection and configure the client and server project
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-configure-new-backend.md](../../includes/app-service-mobile-configure-new-backend.md)]

## Run the Xamarin.Forms solution

The Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin are required to open the solution, see the [Xamarin installation instructions][Install Xamarin]. If the tools are already installed, follow these steps to download and open the solution:

### Visual Studio (Windows and Mac)

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the mobile app that you created. On the `Overview` blade, look for the URL which is the public endpoint for your mobile app. Example - the sitename for my app name "test123" will be https://test123.azurewebsites.net.

2. Open the file `Constants.cs` in this folder - xamarin.forms/ZUMOAPPNAME. The application name is `ZUMOAPPNAME`.

3. In `Constants.cs` class, replace `ZUMOAPPURL` variable with public endpoint above.

    `public static string ApplicationURL = @"ZUMOAPPURL";`

    becomes

    `public static string ApplicationURL = @"https://test123.azurewebsites.net";`
    
4. Follow the instructions below to run the Android or Windows projects; and if there is a networked Mac computer available, the iOS project.

## (Optional) Run the Android project

In this section, you run the Xamarin.Android project. You can skip this section if you are not working with Android devices.

### Visual Studio

1. Right-click the Android (Droid) project, and then select **Set as StartUp Project**.

2. On the **Build** menu, select **Configuration Manager**.

3. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select the **Build** and **Deploy** check boxes next to the Android project, and ensure the shared code project has the **Build** box checked.

4. To build the project and start the app in an Android emulator, press the **F5** key or click the **Start** button.

### Visual Studio for Mac

1. Right-click the Android project, and then select **Set As Startup Project**.

2. To build the project and start the app in an Android emulator, select the **Run** menu, then **Start Debugging**.

In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Learn Xamarin*, and then select the plus sign (**+**).

![Android to-do app][11]

This action sends a post request to the new Mobile Apps back end that's hosted in Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items that are stored in the table are returned by the Mobile Apps back end, and the data is displayed in the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The code that accesses your Mobile Apps back end is in the **TodoItemManager.cs** C# file of the shared code project in the solution.
>

## (Optional) Run the iOS project

In this section, you run the Xamarin.iOS project for iOS devices. You can skip this section if you are not working with iOS devices.

### Visual Studio

1. Right-click the iOS project, and then select **Set as StartUp Project**.

2. On the **Build** menu, select **Configuration Manager**.

3. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select the **Build** and **Deploy** check boxes next to the iOS project, and ensure the shared code project has the **Build** box checked.

4. To build the project and start the app in the iPhone emulator, select the **F5** key.

### Visual Studio for Mac

1. Right-click the iOS project, and then select **Set As Startup Project**.

2. On the **Run** menu, select **Start Debugging** to build the project and start the app in the iPhone emulator.

In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Learn Xamarin*, and then select the plus sign (**+**).

![iOS to-do app][10]

This action sends a post request to the new Mobile Apps back end that's hosted in Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items that are stored in the table are returned by the Mobile Apps back end, and the data is displayed in the list.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll find the code that accesses your Mobile Apps back end in the **TodoItemManager.cs** C# file of the shared code project in the solution.
>

## (Optional) Run the Windows project

In this section, you run the Xamarin.Forms Universal Windows Platform (UWP) project for Windows devices. You can skip this section if you are not working with Windows devices.

### Visual Studio

1. Right-click any the UWP project, and then select **Set as StartUp Project**.

2. On the **Build** menu, select **Configuration Manager**.

3. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select the **Build** and **Deploy** check boxes next to the Windows project that you chose, and ensure the shared code project has the **Build** box checked.

4. To build the project and start the app in a Windows emulator, press the **F5** key or click the **Start** button (which should read **Local Machine**).

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows project cannot be run on macOS.

In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Learn Xamarin*, and then select the plus sign (**+**).

This action sends a post request to the new Mobile Apps back end that's hosted in Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items that are stored in the table are returned by the Mobile Apps back end, and the data is displayed in the list.

![UWP to-do app][12]

> [!NOTE]
> You'll find the code that accesses your Mobile Apps back end in the **TodoItemManager.cs** C# file of the portable class library project of your solution.
>

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems building the solution, run the NuGet package manager and update to the latest version of `Xamarin.Forms`, and in the Android project, update the `Xamarin.Android` support packages. Quickstart projects might not always include the latest versions.

Please note that all the support packages referenced in your Android project must have the same version. The [Azure Mobile Apps NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client/) has `Xamarin.Android.Support.CustomTabs` dependency for Android platform, so if your project uses newer support packages you need to install this package with required version directly to avoid conflicts.
