# Add authentication to your Apache Cordova app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

## Summary
In this tutorial, you add authentication to the todolist quickstart project on Apache Cordova using a
supported identity provider. This tutorial is based on the [Get started with Mobile Apps] tutorial, which
you must complete first.

## <a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure the App Service
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-register-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-register-authentication.md)]

[Watch a video showing similar steps](https://channel9.msdn.com/series/Azure-connected-services-with-Cordova/Azure-connected-services-task-8-Azure-authentication)

## <a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

Now, you can verify that anonymous access to your backend has been disabled. In Visual Studio:

* Open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Apps].
* Run your application in the **Google Android Emulator**.
* Verify that an Unexpected Connection Failure is shown after the app starts.

Next, update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the Mobile App backend.

## <a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app
1. Open your project in **Visual Studio**, then open the `www/index.html` file for editing.
2. Locate the `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag in the head section.  Add the OAuth host
    to the list of allowed sources.

   | Provider | SDK Provider Name | OAuth Host |
   |:--- |:--- |:--- |
   | Azure Active Directory | aad | https://login.microsoftonline.com |
   | Facebook | facebook | https://www.facebook.com |
   | Google | google | https://accounts.google.com |
   | Microsoft | microsoftaccount | https://login.live.com |
   | Twitter | twitter | https://api.twitter.com |

    An example Content-Security-Policy (implemented for Azure Active Directory) is as follows:

        <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'
            data: gap: https://login.microsoftonline.com https://yourapp.azurewebsites.net; style-src 'self'">

    Replace `https://login.microsoftonline.com` with the OAuth host from the preceding table.  For more information
    about the content-security-policy meta tag, see the [Content-Security-Policy documentation].

    Some authentication providers do not require Content-Security-Policy changes when used on appropriate
    mobile devices.  For example, no Content-Security-Policy changes are required when using Google authentication
    on an Android device.

3. Open the `www/js/index.js` file for editing, locate the `onDeviceReady()` method, and under the client
    creation code add the following code:

        // Login to the service
        client.login('SDK_Provider_Name')
            .then(function () {

                // BEGINNING OF ORIGINAL CODE

                // Create a table reference
                todoItemTable = client.getTable('todoitem');

                // Refresh the todoItems
                refreshDisplay();

                // Wire up the UI Event Handler for the Add Item
                $('#add-item').submit(addItemHandler);
                $('#refresh').on('click', refreshDisplay);

                // END OF ORIGINAL CODE

            }, handleError);

    This code replaces the existing code that creates the table reference and refreshes the UI.

    The login() method starts authentication with the provider. The login() method is an async function that
    returns a JavaScript Promise.  The rest of the initialization is placed inside the promise response so
    that it is not executed until the login() method completes.

4. In the code that you just added, replace `SDK_Provider_Name` with the name of your login provider. For
    example, for Azure Active Directory, use `client.login('aad')`.
5. Run your project.  When the project has finished initializing, your application shows the OAuth login
    page for the chosen authentication provider.
