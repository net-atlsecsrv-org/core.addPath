> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

## Overview
This tutorial shows you how to add offline support to a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app using an Azure Mobile App
backend. Offline sync allows end users to interact with a mobile app--viewing, adding, or modifying data - even when
there is no network connection. Changes are stored in a local database. Once the device is back online, these changes
are synced with the remote backend.

In this tutorial, you update the UWP app project from the tutorial [Create a Windows app] to support the offline
features of Azure Mobile Apps. If you do not use the downloaded quick start server project, you must add the data access
extension packages to your project. For more information about server extension packages, see
[Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

To learn more about the offline sync feature, see the topic [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps].

## Requirements  
This tutorial requires the following pre-requisites:

* Visual Studio 2013 running on Windows 8.1 or later.
* Completion of [Create a Windows app][create a windows app].
* [Azure Mobile Services SQLite Store][sqlite store nuget]
* [SQLite for Universal Windows Platform development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SQLiteDevelopmentTeam.SQLiteforUniversalWindowsPlatform) 

## Update the client app to support offline features
Azure Mobile App offline features allow you to interact with a local database when you are in an offline scenario. To use these features in your app, you initialize a [SyncContext][synccontext] to a local store. Then reference your table through the [IMobileServiceSyncTable][IMobileServiceSyncTable] interface. SQLite is used as the local store on the device.

1. Install the [SQLite runtime for the Universal Windows Platform](https://sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-uwp-3120200.vsix).
2. In Visual Studio, open the NuGet package manager for the UWP app project that you completed in the [Create a Windows app] tutorial.
    Search for and install the **Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client.SQLiteStore** NuGet package.
3. In Solution Explorer, right-click **References** > **Add Reference...** > **Universal Windows** > **Extensions**, then enable
    both **SQLite for Universal Windows Platform** and **Visual C++ 2015 Runtime for Universal Windows Platform apps**.

4. Open the MainPage.xaml.cs file and uncomment the `#define OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED` definition.
5. In Visual Studio, press the **F5** key to rebuild and run the client app. The app works the same as it did before you enabled
    offline sync. However, the local database is now populated with data that can be used in an offline scenario.

## <a name="update-sync"></a>Update the app to disconnect from the backend
In this section, you break the connection to your Mobile App backend to simulate an offline situation. When you add data items, your
exception handler tells you that the app is in offline mode. In this state, new items added in the local store and will be synced to
the mobile app backend when push is next run in a connected state.

1. Edit App.xaml.cs in the shared project. Comment out the initialization of the **MobileServiceClient** and add the following line,
   which uses an invalid mobile app URL:

         public static MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient("https://your-service.azurewebsites.fail");

    You can also demonstrate offline behavior by disabling wifi and cellular networks on the device or use airplane mode.
2. Press **F5** to build and run the app. Notice your sync failed on refresh when the app launched.
3. Enter new items and notice that push fails with a [CancelledByNetworkError] status each time you click **Save**. However, the new
   todo items exist in the local store until they can be pushed to the mobile app backend.  In a production app, if you suppress these
   exceptions the client app behaves as if it's still connected to the mobile app backend.
4. Close the app and restart it to verify that the new items you created are persisted to the local store.
5. (Optional) In Visual Studio, open **Server Explorer**. Navigate to your database in **Azure**->**SQL Databases**. Right-click your
   database and select **Open in SQL Server Object Explorer**. Now you can browse to your SQL database table and its contents. Verify
   that the data in the backend database has not changed.
6. (Optional) Use a REST tool such as Fiddler or Postman to query your mobile backend, using a GET query in the
   form `https://<your-mobile-app-backend-name>.azurewebsites.net/tables/TodoItem`.

## <a name="update-online-app"></a>Update the app to reconnect your Mobile App backend
In this section, you reconnect the app to the mobile app backend. These changes simulate a network reconnection on the app.

When you first run the application, the `OnNavigatedTo` event handler calls `InitLocalStoreAsync`. This method in turn calls `SyncAsync` to sync your
local store with the backend database. The app attempts to sync on startup.

1. Open App.xaml.cs in the shared project, and uncomment your previous initialization of `MobileServiceClient` to use the correct the mobile app URL.
2. Press the **F5** key to rebuild and run the app. The app syncs your local changes with the Azure Mobile App backend using push and pull
   operations when the `OnNavigatedTo` event handler executes.
3. (Optional) View the updated data using either SQL Server Object Explorer or a REST tool like Fiddler. Notice the data has been synchronized
   between the Azure Mobile App backend database and the local store.
4. In the app, click the check box beside a few items to complete them in the local store.

   `UpdateCheckedTodoItem` calls `SyncAsync` to sync each completed item with the Mobile App backend. `SyncAsync` calls both push and pull. However,
   **whenever you execute a pull against a table that the client has made changes to, a push is always executed automatically**. This behavior ensures
   all tables in the local store along with relationships remain consistent. This behavior may result in an unexpected push.  For more information on
   this behavior, see [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps].

## API Summary
To support the offline features of mobile services, we used the [IMobileServiceSyncTable] interface and initialized
[MobileServiceClient.SyncContext][synccontext] with a local SQLite database. When offline, the normal CRUD operations for Mobile Apps
work as if the app is still connected while the operations occur against the local store. The following methods are used to synchronize
the local store with the server:

* **[PushAsync]**
  Because this method is a member of [IMobileServicesSyncContext], changes across all tables are pushed to the backend. Only records with
  local changes are sent to the server.
* **[PullAsync]**
   A pull is started from a [IMobileServiceSyncTable]. When there are tracked changes in the table, an implicit push is run to make sure
   that all tables in the local store along with relationships remain consistent. The *pushOtherTables* parameter controls whether other
   tables in the context are pushed in an implicit push. The *query* parameter takes an [IMobileServiceTableQuery\<T>][IMobileServiceTableQuery]
   or OData query string to filter the returned data. The *queryId* parameter is used to define incremental sync. For more information, see
   [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-offline-data-sync.md#how-sync-works).
* **[PurgeAsync]**
  Your app should periodically call this method to purge stale data from the local store. Use the *force* parameter when you need to purge
  any changes that have not yet been synced.

For more information about these concepts, see [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-offline-data-sync.md#how-sync-works).
