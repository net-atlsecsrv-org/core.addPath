# Enable offline sync for your Xamarin.Forms mobile app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-offline](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-offline.md)]

## Overview
This tutorial introduces the offline sync feature of Azure Mobile Apps for Xamarin.Forms. Offline sync allows end users to
interact with a mobile app--viewing, adding, or modifying data--even when there is no network connection. Changes
are stored in a local database. Once the device is back online, these changes are synced with the remote service.

This tutorial is based on the Xamarin.Forms quickstart solution for Mobile Apps that you create when you complete the
tutorial [Create a Xamarin iOS app]. The quickstart solution for Xamarin.Forms contains the code to support offline sync, which
just needs to be enabled. In this tutorial, you update the quickstart solution to turn on the offline features of Azure
Mobile Apps. We also highlight the offline-specific code in the app. If you do not use the downloaded quickstart solution,
you must add the data access extension packages to your project. For more information about server extension packages, see
[Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps][1].

To learn more about the offline sync feature, see the topic [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps][2].

## Enable offline sync functionality in the quickstart solution
The offline sync code is included in the project by using C# preprocessor directives. When the **OFFLINE\_SYNC\_ENABLED** symbol
is defined, these code paths are included in the build. For Windows apps, you must also install the SQLite platform.

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the solution > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**, then search for and install the
   **Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client.SQLiteStore** NuGet package for all projects in the solution.
2. In the Solution Explorer, open the TodoItemManager.cs file from the project with **Portable** in the name, which is Portable
   Class Library project, then uncomment the following preprocessor directive:

        #define OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED
3. (Optional) To support Windows devices, install one of the following SQLite runtime packages:

   * **Windows 8.1 Runtime:** Install [SQLite for Windows 8.1][3].
   * **Windows Phone 8.1:** Install [SQLite for Windows Phone 8.1][4].
   * **Universal Windows Platform** Install [SQLite for the Universal Windows Universal][5].

     Although the quickstart does not contain a Universal Windows project, the Universal Windows platform is supported with Xamarin Forms.
4. (Optional) In each Windows app project, right-click **References** > **Add Reference...**, expand the **Windows** folder > **Extensions**.
    Enable the appropriate **SQLite for Windows** SDK along with the **Visual C++ 2013 Runtime for Windows** SDK.
    The SQLite SDK names vary slightly with each Windows platform.

## Review the client sync code
Here is a brief overview of what is already included in the tutorial code inside the `#if OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED` directives. The
offline sync functionality is in the TodoItemManager.cs project file in the Portable Class Library project. For a conceptual overview
of the feature, see [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps][2].

* Before any table operations can be performed, the local store must be initialized. The local store database is initialized in
  the **TodoItemManager** class constructor by using the following code:

        var store = new MobileServiceSQLiteStore(OfflineDbPath);
        store.DefineTable<TodoItem>();

        //Initializes the SyncContext using the default IMobileServiceSyncHandler.
        this.client.SyncContext.InitializeAsync(store);

        this.todoTable = client.GetSyncTable<TodoItem>();

    This code creates a new local SQLite database using the **MobileServiceSQLiteStore** class.

    The **DefineTable** method creates a table in the local store that matches the fields in the provided type.  The type doesn't have to include all the columns that are in the remote database. It is possible to store a subset of columns.
* The **todoTable** field in **TodoItemManager** is an **IMobileServiceSyncTable** type instead of **IMobileServiceTable**. This
  class uses the local database for all create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) table operations. You decide when those changes
  are pushed to the Mobile App backend by calling **PushAsync** on the **IMobileServiceSyncContext**. The sync context helps preserve
  table relationships by tracking and pushing changes in all tables a client app has modified when **PushAsync** is called.

    The following **SyncAsync** method is called to sync with the Mobile App backend:

        public async Task SyncAsync()
        {
            ReadOnlyCollection<MobileServiceTableOperationError> syncErrors = null;

            try
            {
                await this.client.SyncContext.PushAsync();

                await this.todoTable.PullAsync(
                    "allTodoItems",
                    this.todoTable.CreateQuery());
            }
            catch (MobileServicePushFailedException exc)
            {
                if (exc.PushResult != null)
                {
                    syncErrors = exc.PushResult.Errors;
                }
            }

            // Simple error/conflict handling.
            if (syncErrors != null)
            {
                foreach (var error in syncErrors)
                {
                    if (error.OperationKind == MobileServiceTableOperationKind.Update && error.Result != null)
                    {
                        //Update failed, reverting to server's copy.
                        await error.CancelAndUpdateItemAsync(error.Result);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        // Discard local change.
                        await error.CancelAndDiscardItemAsync();
                    }

                    Debug.WriteLine(@"Error executing sync operation. Item: {0} ({1}). Operation discarded.",
                        error.TableName, error.Item["id"]);
                }
            }
        }

    This sample uses simple error handling with the default sync handler. A real application would handle the various errors like network conditions and server conflicts by using a custom **IMobileServiceSyncHandler** implementation.

## Offline sync considerations
In the sample, the **SyncAsync** method is only called on start-up and when a sync is requested.  To initiate a
sync in an Android or iOS app, pull down on the items list; for Windows, use the **Sync** button. In a real-world application,
you could also make the sync trigger when the network state changes.

When a pull is executed against a table that has pending local updates tracked by the context, that pull operation automatically
triggers a preceding context push. When refreshing, adding, and completing items in this sample, you can omit the explicit **PushAsync**
call.

In the provided code, all records in the remote TodoItem table are queried, but it is also possible to filter records by passing a
query id and query to **PushAsync**. For more information, see the section *Incremental Sync* in [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps][2].

## Run the client app
With offline sync now enabled, run the client application at least once on each platform to populate the local store
database. Later, simulate an offline scenario and modify the data in the local store while the app is offline.

## Update the sync behavior of the client app
In this section, modify the client project to simulate an offline scenario by using an invalid application URL for your
backend. Alternatively, you can turn off network connections by moving your device to "Airplane mode."  When you add or change data
items, these changes are held in the local store, but not synced to the backend data store until the connection is re-established.

1. In the Solution Explorer, open the Constants.cs project file from the **Portable** project and change the value
   of `ApplicationURL` to point to an invalid URL:

        public static string ApplicationURL = @"https://your-service.azurewebsites.net/";
2. Open the TodoItemManager.cs file from the **Portable** project, then add a **catch** for the base **Exception** class
   to the **try...catch** block in **SyncAsync**. This **catch** block writes the exception message to the console, as follows:

            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.Error.WriteLine(@"Exception: {0}", ex.Message);
            }
3. Build and run the client app.  Add some new items. Notice that an exception is logged in the console for each attempt to sync
   with the backend. These new items exist only in the local store until they can be pushed to the mobile backend. The client app
   behaves as if it is connected to the backend, supporting all create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations.
4. Close the app and restart it to verify that the new items you created are persisted to the local store.
5. (Optional) Use Visual Studio to view your Azure SQL Database table to see that the data in the backend database has not changed.

    In Visual Studio, open **Server Explorer**. Navigate to your database in **Azure**->**SQL Databases**. Right-click your database
    and select **Open in SQL Server Object Explorer**. Now you can browse to your SQL database table and its contents.

## Update the client app to reconnect your mobile backend
In this section, reconnect the app to the mobile backend, which simulates the app coming back to an online state. When you
perform the refresh gesture, data is synced to your mobile backend.

1. Reopen Constants.cs. Correct the `applicationURL` to point to the correct URL.
2. Rebuild and run the client app. The app attempts to sync with the mobile app backend after launching. Verify that no exceptions
   are logged in the debug console.
3. (Optional) View the updated data using either SQL Server Object Explorer or a REST tool like Fiddler or [Postman][6]. Notice the data has been
   synchronized between the backend database and the local store.

    Notice the data has been synchronized between the database and the local store and contains the items you added while your app was disconnected.
