# Add authentication to your Xamarin.iOS app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users.md)]

## Overview

This topic shows you how to authenticate users of an App Service Mobile App from your client application. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the Xamarin.iOS quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by App Service. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by your Mobile App, the user ID value is displayed and you will be able to access restricted table data.

You must first complete the tutorial [Create a Xamarin.iOS app]. If you do not use the downloaded quick start server project, you must add the authentication extension package to your project. For more information about server extension packages, see [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

## Register your app for authentication and configure App Services
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-register-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-register-authentication.md)]

## Add your app to the Allowed External Redirect URLs

Secure authentication requires that you define a new URL scheme for your app. This allows the authentication system to redirect back to your app once the authentication process is complete. In this tutorial, we use the URL scheme _appname_ throughout. However, you can use any URL scheme you choose. It should be unique to your mobile application. To enable the redirection on the server side:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select your App Service.

2. Click the **Authentication / Authorization** menu option.

3. In the **Allowed External Redirect URLs**, enter `url_scheme_of_your_app://easyauth.callback`.  The **url_scheme_of_your_app** in this string is the URL Scheme for your mobile application.  It should follow normal URL specification for a protocol (use letters and numbers only, and start with a letter).  You should make a note of the string that you choose as you will need to adjust your mobile application code with the URL Scheme in several places.

4. Click **OK**.

5. Click **Save**.

## Restrict permissions to authenticated users
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

* In Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, run the client project on a device or emulator. Verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. The failure is logged to the console of the debugger. So in Visual Studio, you should see the failure in the output window.

    This unauthorized failure happens because the app attempts to access your Mobile App backend as an unauthenticated user. The *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the client app to request resources from the Mobile App backend with an authenticated user.

## Add authentication to the app
In this section, you will modify the app to display a login screen before displaying data. When the app starts, it will not connect to your App Service and will not display any data. After the first time that the user performs the refresh gesture, the login screen will appear; after successful login the list of todo items will be displayed.

1. In the client project, open the file **QSTodoService.cs** and add the following using statement and `MobileServiceUser` with accessor to the QSTodoService class:

    ```csharp
    using UIKit;

    // Logged in user
    private MobileServiceUser user;
    public MobileServiceUser User { get { return user; } }
    ```

2. Add new method named **Authenticate** to **QSTodoService** with the following definition:

    ```csharp
    public async Task Authenticate(UIViewController view)
    {
        try
        {
            AppDelegate.ResumeWithURL = url => url.Scheme == "{url_scheme_of_your_app}" && client.ResumeWithURL(url);
            user = await client.LoginAsync(view, MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook, "{url_scheme_of_your_app}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.Error.WriteLine (@"ERROR - AUTHENTICATION FAILED {0}", ex.Message);
        }
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using an identity provider other than a Facebook, change the value passed to **LoginAsync** above to one of the following: _MicrosoftAccount_, _Twitter_, _Google_, or _WindowsAzureActiveDirectory_.

3. Open **QSTodoListViewController.cs**. Modify the method definition of **ViewDidLoad** removing the call to **RefreshAsync()** near the end:

    ```csharp
    public override async void ViewDidLoad ()
    {
        base.ViewDidLoad ();

        todoService = QSTodoService.DefaultService;
        await todoService.InitializeStoreAsync();

        RefreshControl.ValueChanged += async (sender, e) => {
            await RefreshAsync();
        }

        // Comment out the call to RefreshAsync
        // await RefreshAsync();
    }
    ```

4. Modify the method **RefreshAsync** to authenticate if the **User** property is null. Add the following code at the top of the method definition:

    ```csharp
    // start of RefreshAsync method
    if (todoService.User == null) {
        await QSTodoService.DefaultService.Authenticate(this);
        if (todoService.User == null) {
            Console.WriteLine("couldn't login!!");
            return;
        }
    }
    // rest of RefreshAsync method
    ```

5. Open **AppDelegate.cs**, add the following method:

    ```csharp
    public static Func<NSUrl, bool> ResumeWithURL;

    public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication app, NSUrl url, NSDictionary options)
    {
        return ResumeWithURL != null && ResumeWithURL(url);
    }
    ```

6. Open **Info.plist** file, navigate to **URL Types** in the **Advanced** section. Now configure the **Identifier** and the **URL Schemes** of your URL Type and click **Add URL Type**. **URL Schemes** should be the same as your {url_scheme_of_your_app}.
7. In Visual Studio, connected to your Mac Host or Visual Studio for Mac, run the client project targeting a device or emulator. Verify that the app displays no data.

    Perform the refresh gesture by pulling down the list of items, which will cause the login screen to appear. Once you have successfully entered valid credentials, the app will display the list of todo items, and you can make updates to the data.
