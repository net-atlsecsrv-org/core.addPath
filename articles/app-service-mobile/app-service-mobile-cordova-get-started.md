# Create an Apache Cordova app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

> If you are looking to integrate cloud services in your mobile application, sign up with [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/?utm_source=zumo&utm_medium=Azure&utm_campaign=zumo%20doc) today.

## Overview
This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to an Apache Cordova mobile app by using
an Azure mobile app backend.  You create both a new mobile app backend and a simple *Todo list* Apache Cordova
app that stores app data in Azure.

Completing this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Apache Cordova tutorials about using the Mobile
Apps feature in Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

* A PC with [Visual Studio Community 2017] or newer.
* [Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova].
* An [active Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

You may also bypass Visual Studio and use the Apache Cordova command line directly.  Using the command line
is useful when completing the tutorial on a Mac computer.  Compiling Apache Cordova client applications using
the command line is not covered by this tutorial.
