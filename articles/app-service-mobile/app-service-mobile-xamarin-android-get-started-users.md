# Add authentication to your Xamarin.Android app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

## Overview
This topic shows you how to authenticate users of a Mobile App from your client application. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Azure Mobile Apps. After being successfully authenticated and authorized in the Mobile App, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile App quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Create a Xamarin.Android app]. If you do not use the downloaded quick start server project, you must add the authentication extension package to your project. For more information about server extension packages, see [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

## <a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure App Services
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-register-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-register-authentication.md)]

## <a name="redirecturl"></a>Add your app to the Allowed External Redirect URLs

Secure authentication requires that you define a new URL scheme for your app. This allows the authentication system to redirect back to your app once the authentication process is complete. In this tutorial, we use the URL scheme _appname_ throughout. However, you can use any URL scheme you choose. It should be unique to your mobile application. To enable the redirection on the server side:

1. In the [Azure portal], select your App Service.

2. Click the **Authentication / Authorization** menu option.

3. In the **Allowed External Redirect URLs**, enter `url_scheme_of_your_app://easyauth.callback`.  The **url_scheme_of_your_app** in this string is the URL Scheme for your mobile application.  It should follow normal URL specification for a protocol (use letters and numbers only, and start with a letter).  You should make a note of the string that you choose as you will need to adjust your mobile application code with the URL Scheme in several places.

4. Click **OK**.

5. Click **Save**.

## <a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

In Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, run the client project on a device or emulator. Verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. This happens because the app attempts to access your Mobile App backend as an unauthenticated user. The *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the client app to request resources from the Mobile App backend with an authenticated user.

## <a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app
The app is updated to require users to tap the **Sign in** button and authenticate before data is displayed.

1. Add the following code to the **TodoActivity** class:
   
        // Define an authenticated user.
        private MobileServiceUser user;
        private async Task<bool> Authenticate()
        {
                var success = false;
                try
                {
                    // Sign in with Facebook login using a server-managed flow.
                    user = await client.LoginAsync(this,
                        MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook, "{url_scheme_of_your_app}");
                    CreateAndShowDialog(string.Format("you are now logged in - {0}",
                        user.UserId), "Logged in!");
   
                    success = true;
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    CreateAndShowDialog(ex, "Authentication failed");
                }
                return success;
        }
   
        [Java.Interop.Export()]
        public async void LoginUser(View view)
        {
            // Load data only after authentication succeeds.
            if (await Authenticate())
            {
                //Hide the button after authentication succeeds.
                FindViewById<Button>(Resource.Id.buttonLoginUser).Visibility = ViewStates.Gone;
   
                // Load the data.
                OnRefreshItemsSelected();
            }
        }
   
    This creates a new method to authenticate a user and a method handler for a new **Sign in** button. The user in the example code above is authenticated by using a Facebook login. A dialog is used to display the user ID once authenticated.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value passed to **LoginAsync** above to one of the following: *MicrosoftAccount*, *Twitter*, *Google*, or *WindowsAzureActiveDirectory*.
   > 
   > 
2. In the **OnCreate** method, delete or comment-out the following line of code:
   
        OnRefreshItemsSelected ();
3. In the Activity_To_Do.axml file, add the following *LoginUser* button definition before the existing *AddItem* button:
   
          <Button
            android:id="@+id/buttonLoginUser"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:onClick="LoginUser"
            android:text="@string/login_button_text" />
4. Add the following element to the Strings.xml resources file:
   
        <string name="login_button_text">Sign in</string>
5. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file, add the following code inside `<application>` XML element:

        <activity android:name="com.microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.authentication.RedirectUrlActivity" android:launchMode="singleTop" android:noHistory="true">
          <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
            <data android:scheme="{url_scheme_of_your_app}" android:host="easyauth.callback" />
          </intent-filter>
        </activity>

6. In Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, run the client project on a device or emulator and sign in with your chosen identity provider. When you are successfully logged-in, the app will display your login ID and the list of todo items, and you can make updates to the data.

## Troubleshooting

**The application crashed with `Java.Lang.NoSuchMethodError: No static method startActivity`**

In some cases, conflicts in the support packages displayed as just a warning in the Visual studio, but the application crashes with this exception at runtime. In this case you need to make sure that all the support packages referenced in your project have the same version. The [Azure Mobile Apps NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client/) has `Xamarin.Android.Support.CustomTabs` dependency for Android platform, so if your project uses newer support packages you need to install this package with required version directly to avoid conflicts.
