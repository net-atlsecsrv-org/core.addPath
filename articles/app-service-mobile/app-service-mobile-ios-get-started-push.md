# Add Push Notifications to your iOS App

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-push](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-push.md)]

## Overview

In this tutorial, you add push notifications to the [iOS quickstart] project so that a push notification is sent to the device every time a record is inserted.

If you do not use the downloaded quickstart server project, you will need the push notification extension package. For more information, see [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md) guide.

The [iOS simulator does not support push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/TestingontheiOSSimulator.html). You need a physical iOS device and an [Apple Developer Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).
