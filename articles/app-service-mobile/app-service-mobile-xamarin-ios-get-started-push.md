# Add push notifications to your Xamarin.iOS App

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you add push notifications to the [Xamarin.iOS quick start](app-service-mobile-xamarin-ios-get-started.md) project so that a push notification is sent to the device every time a record is inserted.

If you do not use the downloaded quick start server project, you will need the push notification extension package. See [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md) for more information.

## Prerequisites

* Complete the [Xamarin.iOS quickstart](app-service-mobile-xamarin-ios-get-started.md) tutorial.
* A physical iOS device. Push notifications are not supported by the iOS simulator.

## Register the app for push notifications on Apple's developer portal

[!INCLUDE [Enable Apple Push Notifications](../../includes/enable-apple-push-notifications.md)]

## Configure your Mobile App to send push notifications

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-apns-configure-push](../../includes/app-service-mobile-apns-configure-push.md)]

## Update the server project to send push notifications

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-update-server-project-for-push-template](../../includes/app-service-mobile-update-server-project-for-push-template.md)]

## Configure your Xamarin.iOS project

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-xamarin-ios-configure-project](../../includes/app-service-mobile-xamarin-ios-configure-project.md)]

## Add push notifications to your app

1. In **QSTodoService**, add the following property so that **AppDelegate** can acquire the mobile client:

    ```csharp
    public MobileServiceClient GetClient {
        get
        {
            return client;
        }
        private set
        {
            client = value;
        }
    }
    ```

2. Add the following `using` statement to the top of the **AppDelegate.cs** file.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
    using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
    ```

3. In **AppDelegate**, override the **FinishedLaunching** event:

   ```csharp
    public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
    {
        // registers for push for iOS8
        var settings = UIUserNotificationSettings.GetSettingsForTypes(
            UIUserNotificationType.Alert
            | UIUserNotificationType.Badge
            | UIUserNotificationType.Sound,
            new NSSet());

        UIApplication.SharedApplication.RegisterUserNotificationSettings(settings);
        UIApplication.SharedApplication.RegisterForRemoteNotifications();

        return true;
    }
    ```

4. In the same file, override the `RegisteredForRemoteNotifications` event. In this code you are registering for a simple template notification that will be sent across all supported platforms by the server.

    For more information on templates with Notification Hubs, see [Templates](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages.md).

    ```csharp
    public override void RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication application, NSData deviceToken)
    {
        MobileServiceClient client = QSTodoService.DefaultService.GetClient;

        const string templateBodyAPNS = "{\"aps\":{\"alert\":\"$(messageParam)\"}}";

        JObject templates = new JObject();
        templates["genericMessage"] = new JObject
        {
            {"body", templateBodyAPNS}
        };

        // Register for push with your mobile app
        var push = client.GetPush();
        push.RegisterAsync(deviceToken, templates);
    }
    ```

5. Then, override the **DidReceivedRemoteNotification** event:

   ```csharp
    public override void DidReceiveRemoteNotification (UIApplication application, NSDictionary userInfo, Action<UIBackgroundFetchResult> completionHandler)
    {
        NSDictionary aps = userInfo.ObjectForKey(new NSString("aps")) as NSDictionary;

        string alert = string.Empty;
        if (aps.ContainsKey(new NSString("alert")))
            alert = (aps [new NSString("alert")] as NSString).ToString();

        //show alert
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(alert))
        {
            UIAlertView avAlert = new UIAlertView("Notification", alert, null, "OK", null);
            avAlert.Show();
        }
    }
    ```

Your app is now updated to support push notifications.

## <a name="test"></a>Test push notifications in your app

1. Press the **Run** button to build the project and start the app in an iOS capable device, then click **OK** to accept push notifications.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must explicitly accept push notifications from your app. This request only occurs the first time that the app runs.

2. In the app, type a task, and then click the plus (**+**) icon.
3. Verify that a notification is received, then click **OK** to dismiss the notification.
4. Repeat step 2 and immediately close the app, then verify that a notification is shown.
