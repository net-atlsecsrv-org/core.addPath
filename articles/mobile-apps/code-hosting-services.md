# Cloud-hosted source code management services
If you have development teams with multiple team members who work on the same code base, you need to find a suitable place to host your code. Storing the data in the cloud and having a centralized repository allows everyone to upload, edit, and manage the code files. They also can interact with other developers on projects. The code can be readily accessible no matter where you are, as long as you have an internet connection.

Cloud hosting is much easier than on-premises options. It requires less hardware configuration and allows organizations to complete the implementation process in a more agile manner.

## Benefits of hosting source code in the cloud
- **Centralized cloud storage:** View and manage your data from anywhere.
- **Better collaboration and cleaner code:** Keep track of code within teams and manage projects to ensure the continuous delivery of excellent software.
- **Easier to get involved:** Easily contribute to your projects.
- **Faster release cycle:** Work faster in your teams and easily contribute to your projects.
- **Reduce the cost:** Don't worry about maintaining your own hardware, servers, VPN, and so on.

Use the following services to host your application data in the cloud.

## GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an open-source repository hosting service that hosts source code projects in a variety of different programming languages. GitHub keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration.

**Key features**
- Use code hosting to keep all your code in one place. Private, public, and open-source repositories are all equipped with tools to help you host, version, and release code.
- Review code and use the built-in review tools to make code review an essential part of any team's process:
    - Protect branches, propose changes, and request reviews.
    - Spot differences, comment in context, and get clear feedback.
- Coordinate early, stay aligned, and get more done with GitHub's project management tools:
    - See the project's big picture.
    - Use task boards that are right next to your code inside GitHub.
    - Drag cards to assign issues or pull requests to team members.
    - Set milestones to organize and track progress.
    - Write notes to capture ideas that might be useful but don't belong to a particular issue or pull request.
- Easily discover and choose the right tools for better communication and automation of work by buying applications from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).
- Manage and grow teams by using: 
    - User roles to help organize teams and access permissions.
    - Discussion thread tools to keep conversations on topic and team focused.
    - Community guidelines to quickly set up new team members with an account.
- Browse and star popular projects to follow them.
- Network and learn from others in the industry.

## Azure DevOps
[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) supports [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/) and [Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/index?view=azure-devops) as source control options. It has unlimited free private repositories with collaborative code reviews, advanced file management, code search, and branch policies to ensure high-quality code. Azure Repos is great for small projects and large organizations that need native Azure Active Directory support and advanced policies.
    
**Key features**
- Use an unlimited cloud-hosted Git source code repository for your public and private repos:
    - Get support for any Git client.
    - Use web hooks and API integration.
- Kick off your next build from a repo pull request:
    - Collaborate to build better code by using threaded discussion and continuous integration for each change.
    - Set up continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments with every completed pull request. You can use Azure Pipelines or your tools.
    - Protect your code quality with branch policies.
- Maintain centralized version control with Team Foundation Version Control, which includes code review.
- Connect to your code by using Xcode, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Android Studio, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and more.
- Use powerful semantic code search.
- Gain benefits from enterprise-ready features. Azure DevOps has native integration with Azure Active Directory, which simplifies the process of managing access to your code repositories.
- Ensure code quality with branch policies such as a minimum number of code reviews, requirements for successful builds, and enforcement of Git merge strategies.
- Connect your favorite development environment to access repos and manage work.
