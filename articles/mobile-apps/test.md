# Perform automated testing on thousands of mobile devices simultaneously
Testing can be challenging and increasingly complex due to a variety of reasons such as device fragmentation, application complexity, fast release cycles, short sessions, and high user expectations. You need to continuously make sure that you are delivering applications that are thoroughly tested to provide a great customer experience. Testing is not an easy task and it's not a good use of developer time to manually test each release.

These challenges can be efficiently tackled by testing mobile applications across a wide range of devices, which can be achieved by **automated testing**. You can leverage cloud service to speed up release of mobile apps and overcome testing challenges that add bottlenecks to the development and deployment of applications.

## Importance of automated testing
- **Increase your test coverage** by targeting different form factors, connectivity types, and OS versions.
- **Save time, money, and resources** by testing on different device and OS coverage.
- **Improve Accuracy** by avoiding repetitive manual tests and have more time to create new automated software tests and deal with complex features.
- **Test continuously**, analyze **application performance**, **find, and fix issues** before your users run into them, and **release fast**.
- **Deliver high-quality applications** by ensuring that your customers on a wide range of devices get the best experience.
