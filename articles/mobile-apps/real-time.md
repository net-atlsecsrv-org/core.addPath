# Build real-time applications with Azure SignalR

[Azure SignalR](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/) allows you to easily add real-time functionality to applications. This real-time functionality allows the service to push content updates to connected mobile applications. As a result, apps are updated without the need to poll the server, or submit new HTTP requests for updates.

## Azure SignalR features
- **Broad client support** - It works with wide range of clients such as web and mobile browsers, desktop applications, server process, IoT devices and game consoles.
- SignalR service allows **multiple instances to work together** to scale to millions of mobile applications connections. It also supports multiple global regions for sharding, high availability, or disaster recovery purposes.
- **Offer rich APIs for different messaging patterns** to send messages to a particular connection, all connections, or a subset of connections that belong to a specific user, or have been placed in an arbitrary group.
