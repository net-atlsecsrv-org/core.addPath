# Different Stages in Mobile Application Development
Building a mobile application involves multiple stages and developers can easily take advantage of Microsoft services, tools, and technologies to build high-class mobile applications.

## App development
Developers can build native single platform client applications with languages like Objective-C and Java, cross-platform apps using Xamarin, React Native, Unity, and hybrid using Cordova. They can make use of IDEs and code editors, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, or Visual Studio Code on PCs and Macs, to construct their client applications.

## Plan and design with back-end services
 Microsoft provides a variety of services for setting up a secure, scalable, and reliable back-end for your mobile application. Developers can create serverless APIs and triggers without having to maintain their own servers. They can leverage services, such as push notifications, offline data sync, authentication, and data,which together form a comprehensive and expansive mobile backend as a service that supports a variety of app construction scenarios. Building a backend service has many requirements:
   - Limit on storing data on the device.
   - Synchronize data across multiple devices.
   - Making sure the application runs without network connectivity.
   - Send notifications to users.
   - Reduce battery consumption.
   - Build scalable, reliable, and secure back-end.
   - Automatic server maintainence.

## DevOps and continuous monitoring
Developers creating mobile and cloud-focused applications can take advantage of continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous monitoring services to produce native builds for all platforms run UI automation tests on thousands of physical devices, automate their releases through beta testing channels, or deploy directly to app stores. In addition, they can gather usage analytics, crash, and exception information for their applications.

## Additional services
There are many Azure services that can be consumed depending on the type and nature of application being built.
  - Azure Cognitive Search for searching all types of internal data, with fast querying.
  - Azure Cognitive Services to use Artificial Intelligence in your application.
  - Azure SignalR to enable real-time communication in your application.
