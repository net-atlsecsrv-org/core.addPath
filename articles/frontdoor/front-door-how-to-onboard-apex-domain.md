# Onboard a root or apex domain on your Front Door
Azure Front Door uses CNAME records to validate domain ownership for onboarding of custom domains. Front Door doesn't expose the frontend IP address associated with your Front Door profile. So you can't map your apex domain to an IP address if your intent is to onboard it to Azure Front Door.

The DNS protocol prevents the assignment of CNAME records at the zone apex. For example, if your domain is `contoso.com`; you can create CNAME records for `somelabel.contoso.com`; but you can't create CNAME for `contoso.com` itself. This restriction presents a problem for application owners who have load-balanced applications behind Azure Front Door. Since using a Front Door profile requires creation of a CNAME record, it isn't possible to point at the Front Door profile from the zone apex.

This problem can be resolved by using alias records in Azure DNS. Unlike CNAME records, alias records are created at the zone apex. Application owners can use it to point their zone apex record to a Front Door profile that has public endpoints. Application owners point to the same Front Door profile that's used for any other domain within their DNS zone. For example, `contoso.com` and `www.contoso.com` can point to the same Front Door profile. 

Mapping your apex or root domain to your Front Door profile basically requires CNAME flattening or DNS chasing. A mechanism where the DNS provider recursively resolves the CNAME entry until it hits an IP address. This functionality is supported by Azure DNS for Front Door endpoints. 

> [!NOTE]
> There are other DNS providers as well that support CNAME flattening or DNS chasing, however, Azure Front Door recommends using Azure DNS for its customers for hosting their domains.

You can use the Azure portal to onboard an apex domain on your Front Door and enable HTTPS on it by associating it with a certificate for TLS termination. Apex domains are also referred as root or naked domains.

## Create an alias record for zone apex

1. Open **Azure DNS** configuration for the domain to be onboarded.

1. Create or edit the record for zone apex.

1. Select the record **type** as *A* record and then select *Yes* for **Alias record set**. **Alias type** should be set to *Azure resource*.

1. Select the Azure subscription where your Front Door profile gets hosted. Then select the Front Door resource from the **Azure resource** dropdown.

1. Select **OK** to submit your changes.

1. The above step will create a zone apex record pointing to your Front Door resource and also a CNAME record mapping 'afdverify' (example - `afdverify.contosonews.com`) to  that will be used for onboarding the domain on your Front Door profile.

## Onboard the custom domain on your Front Door

1. On the Front Door designer tab, select on '+' icon on the Frontend hosts section to add a new custom domain.

1. Enter the root or apex domain name in the custom host name field, example `contosonews.com`.

1. Once the CNAME mapping from the domain to your Front Door is validated, select on **Add** to add the custom domain.

1. Select **Save** to submit the changes.

## Enable HTTPS on your custom domain

1. Select the custom domain that was added and under the section **Custom domain HTTPS**, change the status to **Enabled**.

1. Select the  **Certificate management type** to *'Use my own certificate'*.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Front Door managed certificate management type is not currently supported for apex or root domains. The only option available for enabling HTTPS on an apex or root domain for Front Door is using your own custom TLS/SSL certificate hosted on Azure Key Vault.

1. Ensure that you have setup the right permissions for Front Door to access your key Vault as noted in the UI, before proceeding to the next step.

1. Choose a **Key Vault account** from your current subscription and then select the appropriate **Secret** and **Secret version** to map to the right certificate.

1. Select **Update** to save the selection and then Select **Save**.

1. Select **Refresh** after a couple of minutes and then select the custom domain again to see the progress of certificate provisioning. 

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that you have created appropriate routing rules for your apex domain or added the domain to existing routing rules.
