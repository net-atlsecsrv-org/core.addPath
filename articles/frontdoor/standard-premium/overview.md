# What is Azure Front Door Standard/Premium (Preview)?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation is for Azure Front Door Standard/Premium (Preview). Looking for information on Azure Front Door? View [Azure Front Door Docs](../front-door-overview.md).

Azure Front Door Standard/Premium is a fast, reliable, and secure modern cloud CDN that uses the Microsoft global edge network and integrates with intelligent threat protection. It combines the capabilities of Azure Front Door, Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) standard, and Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) into a single secure cloud CDN platform.

With Azure Front Door Standard/Premium, you can transform your global consumer and enterprise applications into secure and high-performing personalized modern applications with contents that reach a global audience at the network edge close to the user. It also enables your application to scale out without warm-up while benefitting from the global HTTP load balancing with instant failover.

Azure Front Door Standard/Premium works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS layer) using anycast protocol with split TCP and Microsoft's global network to improve global connectivity. Based on your customized routing method using rules set, you can ensure that Azure Front Door will route your client requests to the fastest and most available origin. An application origin is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Azure Front Door Standard/Premium provides a range of traffic-routing methods and origin health monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover scenarios. Similar to Traffic Manager, Front Door is resilient to failures, including failures to an entire Azure region.

Azure Front Door also protect your app at the edges with integrated Web Application Firewall protection, Bot Protection, and built-in lay 3/layer 4 distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection. It also secures your private back-ends with private link service. Azure Front Door gives you Microsoft’s best-in-practice security at global scale.  

>[!NOTE]
> Azure provides a suite of fully managed load-balancing solutions for your scenarios.
>
> * If you are looking to do DNS based global routing and do **not** have requirements for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol termination ("SSL offload"), per-HTTP/HTTPS request or application-layer processing, review [Traffic Manager](../../traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview.md).
> * If you want to load balance between your servers in a region at the application layer, review [Application Gateway](../../application-gateway/overview.md)
> * To do network layer load balancing, review [Load Balancer](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md).
>
> Your end-to-end scenarios may benefit from combining these solutions as needed.
> For an Azure load-balancing options comparison, see [Overview of load-balancing options in Azure](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview).
