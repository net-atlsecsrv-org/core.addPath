> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Front Door Standard/Premium (Preview) is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

* Before you can complete the steps in this tutorial, you must first create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile](create-front-door-portal.md).

## Configure Rule Set in Azure portal

1. Within your Front Door profile, select **Rule Set** located under **Settings**. Select **Add** and give it a rule set name.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-create-rule-set-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rule set landing page.":::
    
1. Select **Add Rule** to create your first rule. Give it a rule name. Then, select **Add condition** or **Add action** to define your rule. You can add up to 10 conditions and 5 actions for one rule. In this example, we use server variable to add a response header 8Geo-country* for requests that include *contoso* in the URL.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-create-rule-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rule set configuration page.":::
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > * To delete a condition or action from a rule, use the trash can on the right-hand side of the specific condition or action.
    > * To create a rule that applies to all incoming traffic, do not specify any conditions.
    > * To stop evaluating remaining rules if a specific rule is met, check **Stop evaluating remaining rule**. If this option is checked and all remaining rules in the Rule Set will not be executed regardless if the matching conditions were met.  

1. You can determine the priority of the rules within your Rule Set by using the arrow buttons to move the rules higher or lower in priority. The list is in ascending order, so the most important rule is listed first.

1. Once you've created one or more rules select **Save** to complete the creation of your Rule Set.

1. Now associate the Rule Set to a Route so it can take effect. You can associate the Rules Set through Rule Set page or you can go to Endpoint Manager to create the association.
 
    **Rule Set page**: 
    
    1. Select the Rule Set to be associated.
    
    1. Select the *Unassociated* link.
     

    1. Then in the **Associate a route** blade, select the endpoint and route you want to associate with the Rule Set. 
    
        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create a route page.":::    
        
    1. Click *Next* to change rule set orders if there are multiple rule sets under selected route. Rule set will be executed from top to down. You can change orders by selecting the rule set and move it up or down.Then select *Associate*.
    
        > [!Note]
        > You can only associate one rule set with a single route on this page. To associate a Rule Set with multiple routes, please use Endpoint Manager.
    
        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rule set orders.":::
    
    1. The rule set is now associated with a route. You can look at the response header and see the Geo-country is added.
    
        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rule associated with a route.":::

   **Endpoint Manager**: 
    
    1. Go to Endpoint manager, select the endpoint you want to associate with the Rule Set.
    
        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-endpoint-manager-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting endpoint in Endpoint Manager." lightbox="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-endpoint-manager-1-expanded.png":::

    1. Click *Edit endpoint*  
    
        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-endpoint-manager-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting edit endpoint in Endpoint Manager." lightbox="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-endpoint-manager-2-expanded.png":::

    1. Click on the Route. 
    
         :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-endpoint-manager-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a route.":::
    
    1. In the *Update route* blade, in *Rules*, select the Rule Sets you want to associate with the route from the dropdown. Then you can change orders by moving rule set up and down. 
    
        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-associate-rule-set-endpoint-manager-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of update a route page.":::
    
    1. Then select *Update* or *Add* to finish the association.

## Delete a Rule Set from your Azure Front Door profile

In the preceding steps, you configured and associated a Rule Set to your Route. If you no longer want the Rule Set associated to your Front Door, you can remove the Rule Set by completing the following steps:

1. Go to the **Rule Set page** under **Settings** to disassociate the Rule Set from all associated routes.

1. Expand to the Route, click on the three dots select *Edit the route*.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-disassociate-rule-set-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of route expanded in rule set.":::

1. Go to Rules section on the Route page, select the rule set, and select on the *Delete* button. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-disassociate-rule-set-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of update route page to delete a rule set." lightbox="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-disassociate-rule-set-2-expanded.png":::

1. Select *Update* and the Rule Set will disassociate from the route.

1. Repeat steps 2-5 to disassociate other routes that are associated with this rule set until you see the Routes status shows *Unassociated*.

1. For Rule Set that is *Unassociated*, you can delete the Rule Set by clicking on the three dots on the right and select *Delete*. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-configure-rule-set/front-door-disassociate-rule-set-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to delete a rule set.":::

1. The rule set is now deleted.
