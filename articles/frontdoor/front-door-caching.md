# Caching with Azure Front Door
The following document specifies behaviors for Front Door with routing rules that have enabled caching. Front Door is a modern Content Delivery Network (CDN) with dynamic site acceleration and load balancing, it also supports caching behaviors just like any other CDN.

## Delivery of large files
Azure Front Door delivers large files without a cap on file size. Front Door uses a technique called object chunking. When a large file is requested, Front Door retrieves smaller pieces of the file from the backend. After receiving a full or byte-range file request, the Front Door environment requests the file from the backend in chunks of 8 MB.

</br>After the chunk arrives at the Front Door environment, it's cached and immediately served to the user. Front Door then pre-fetches the next chunk in parallel. This pre-fetch ensures that the content stays one chunk ahead of the user, which reduces latency. This process continues until the entire file gets downloaded (if requested) or the client closes the connection.

</br>For more information on the byte-range request, read [RFC 7233](https://web.archive.org/web/20171009165003/http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-7233.html).
Front Door caches any chunks as they're received so the entire file doesn't need to be cached on the Front Door cache. Ensuing requests for the file or byte ranges are served from the cache. If the chunks aren't all cached, pre-fetching is used to request chunks from the backend. This optimization relies on the backend's ability to support byte-range requests. If the backend doesn't support byte-range requests, this optimization isn't effective.

## File compression
Front Door can dynamically compress content on the edge, resulting in a smaller and faster response time to your clients. All files are eligible for compression. However, a file must be of a MIME type to be eligible for compression. Currently, Front Door doesn't allow this list to be changed. The current list is:</br>
- "application/eot"
- "application/font"
- "application/font-sfnt"
- "application/javascript"
- "application/json"
- "application/opentype"
- "application/otf"
- "application/pkcs7-mime"
- "application/truetype"
- "application/ttf",
- "application/vnd.ms-fontobject"
- "application/xhtml+xml"
- "application/xml"
- "application/xml+rss"
- "application/x-font-opentype"
- "application/x-font-truetype"
- "application/x-font-ttf"
- "application/x-httpd-cgi"
- "application/x-mpegurl"
- "application/x-opentype"
- "application/x-otf"
- "application/x-perl"
- "application/x-ttf"
- "application/x-javascript"
- "font/eot"
- "font/ttf"
- "font/otf"
- "font/opentype"
- "image/svg+xml"
- "text/css"
- "text/csv"
- "text/html"
- "text/javascript"
- "text/js", "text/plain"
- "text/richtext"
- "text/tab-separated-values"
- "text/xml"
- "text/x-script"
- "text/x-component"
- "text/x-java-source"

Additionally, the file must also be between 1 KB and 8 MB in size, inclusive.

These profiles support the following compression encodings:
- [Gzip (GNU zip)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip)
- [Brotli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli)

If a request supports gzip and Brotli compression, Brotli compression takes precedence.</br>
When a request for an asset specifies compression and the request results in a cache miss, Front Door does compression of the asset directly on the POP server. Afterward, the compressed file is served from the cache. The resulting item is returned with a transfer-encoding: chunked.

## Query string behavior
With Front Door, you can control how files are cached for a web request that contains a query string. In a web request with a query string, the query string is that portion of the request that occurs after a question mark (?). A query string can contain one or more key-value pairs, in which the field name and its value are separated by an equals sign (=). Each key-value pair is separated by an ampersand (&). For example, `http://www.contoso.com/content.mov?field1=value1&field2=value2`. If there's more than one key-value pair in a query string of a request then their order doesn't matter.
- **Ignore query strings**: In this mode, Front Door passes the query strings from the requestor to the backend on the first request and caches the asset. All ensuing requests for the asset that are served from the Front Door environment ignore the query strings until the cached asset expires.

- **Cache every unique URL**: In this mode, each request with a unique URL, including the query string, is treated as a unique asset with its own cache. For example, the response from the backend for a request for `www.example.ashx?q=test1` is cached at the Front Door environment and returned for ensuing caches with the same query string. A request for `www.example.ashx?q=test2` is cached as a separate asset with its own time-to-live setting.

## Cache purge

Front Door caches assets until the asset's time-to-live (TTL) expires. Whenever a client requests an asset with expired TTL, the Front Door environment retrieves a new updated copy of the asset to serve the request and then stores the refreshed cache.

The best practice to make sure your users always obtain the latest copy of your assets is to version your assets for each update and publish them as new URLs. Front Door will immediately retrieve the new assets for the next client requests. Sometimes you may wish to purge cached content from all edge nodes and force them all to retrieve new updated assets. The reason could be because of updates to your web application, or to quickly update assets that contain incorrect information.

Select the assets you want to purge from the edge nodes. To clear all assets, select **Purge all**. Otherwise, in **Path**, enter the path of each asset you want to purge.

These formats are supported in the lists of paths to purge:

- **Single path purge**: Purge individual assets by specifying the full path of the asset (without the protocol and domain), with the file extension, for example, /pictures/strasbourg.png;
- **Wildcard purge**: Asterisk (\*) may be used as a wildcard. Purge all folders, subfolders, and files under an endpoint with /\* in the path or purge all subfolders and files under a specific folder by specifying the folder followed by /\*, for example, /pictures/\*.
- **Root domain purge**: Purge the root of the endpoint with "/" in the path.

> [!NOTE]
> **Purging wildcard domains**: Specifying cached paths for purging as discussed in this section doesn't apply to any wildcard domains that are associated with the Front Door. Currently, we don't support directly purging wildcard domains. You can purge paths from specific subdomains by specifying that specfic subdomain and the purge path. For example, if my Front Door has `*.contoso.com`, I can purge assets of my subdomain `foo.contoso.com` by typing `foo.contoso.com/path/*`. Currently, specifying host names in the purge content path is imited to subdomains of wildcard domains, if applicable.

Cache purges on the Front Door are case-insensitive. Additionally, they're query string agnostic, meaning purging a URL will purge all query-string variations of it. 

## Cache expiration
The following order of headers is used to determine how long an item will be stored in our cache:</br>
1. Cache-Control: s-maxage=\<seconds>
2. Cache-Control: max-age=\<seconds>
3. Expires: \<http-date>

Cache-Control response headers that indicate that the response won't be cached such as Cache-Control: private, Cache-Control: no-cache, and Cache-Control: no-store are honored.  If no Cache-Control is present, the default behavior is that Front Door will cache the resource for X amount of time where X gets randomly picked between 1 to 3 days.

## Request headers

The following request headers won't be forwarded to a backend when using caching.
- Content-Length
- Transfer-Encoding

## Cache duration

Cache duration can be configured in both the Front Door Designer and in Rules Engine. The cache duration set in the Front Door designer is the minimum cache duration. This override won't work if the cache control header from the origin has greater TTL than override value. 

The cache duration set via Rules Engine is a true cache override, meaning that it will use the override value no matter what the origin response header is.
