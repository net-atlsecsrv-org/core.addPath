# Back up Azure Files with PowerShell

This article describes how to use Azure PowerShell to back up an Azure Files file share using an [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md) Recovery Services vault.

This article explains how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Set up PowerShell and register the Azure Recovery Services Provider.
> * Create a Recovery Services vault.
> * Configure backup for an Azure file share.
> * Run a backup job.

## Before you start

* [Learn more](backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview.md) about Recovery Services vaults.
* Review the PowerShell object hierarchy for Recovery Services.

## Recovery Services object hierarchy

The object hierarchy is summarized in the following diagram.

![Recovery Services object hierarchy](./media/backup-azure-vms-arm-automation/recovery-services-object-hierarchy.png)

Review the **Az.RecoveryServices** [cmdlet reference](/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices) reference in the Azure library.

## Set up and install

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

Set up PowerShell as follows:

1. [Download the latest version of Az PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). The minimum version required is 1.0.0.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The minimum PS version required for Azure file share backup is **Az.RecoveryServices 2.6.0**. Please upgrade your version to avoid any issues with the existing scripts. Install the minimum version with the following PS command:

    ```powershell
    Install-module -Name Az.RecoveryServices -RequiredVersion 2.6.0
    ```

2. Find the Azure Backup PowerShell cmdlets with this command:

    ```powershell
    Get-Command *azrecoveryservices*
    ```

3. Review the aliases and cmdlets for Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and the Recovery Services vault appear. Here's an example of what you might see. It's not a complete list of cmdlets.

    ![List of Recovery Services cmdlets](./media/backup-azure-afs-automation/list-of-recoveryservices-ps-az.png)

4. Sign in to your Azure account with **Connect-AzAccount**.
5. On the web page that appears, you're prompted to input your account credentials.

    * Alternately, you can include your account credentials as a parameter in the **Connect-AzAccount** cmdlet with **-Credential**.
    * If you're a CSP partner working on behalf of a tenant, specify the customer as a tenant, using their tenantID or tenant primary domain name. An example is **Connect-AzAccount -Tenant** fabrikam.com.

6. Associate the subscription you want to use with the account, because an account can have several subscriptions.

    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName $SubscriptionName
    ```

7. If you're using Azure Backup for the first time, use the **Register-AzResourceProvider** cmdlet to register the Azure Recovery Services provider with your subscription.

    ```powershell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.RecoveryServices"
    ```

8. Verify that the providers registered successfully:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.RecoveryServices"
    ```

9. In the command output, verify that **RegistrationState** changes to **Registered**. If it doesn't, run the **Register-AzResourceProvider** cmdlet again.

## Create a Recovery Services vault

The Recovery Services vault is a Resource Manager resource, so you must place it within a resource group. You can use an existing resource group, or you can create a resource group with the **New-AzResourceGroup** cmdlet. When you create a resource group, specify the name and location for the resource group.

Follow these steps to create a Recovery Services vault.

1. A vault is placed in a resource group. If you don't have an existing resource group, create a new one with the [New-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup?view=azps-1.4.0). In this example, we create a new resource group in the West US region.

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name "test-rg" -Location "West US"
   ```

2. Use the [New-AzRecoveryServicesVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/New-AzRecoveryServicesVault?view=azps-1.4.0) cmdlet to create the vault. Specify the same location for the vault as was used for the resource group.

    ```powershell
    New-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name "testvault" -ResourceGroupName "test-rg" -Location "West US"
    ```

3. Specify the type of redundancy to use for the vault storage.

   * You can use [locally redundant storage](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md) or [geo-redundant storage](../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md).
   * The following example sets the **-BackupStorageRedundancy** option for the[Set-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProperties](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/set-azrecoveryservicesbackupproperty) cmd for **testvault** set to **GeoRedundant**.

     ```powershell
     $vault1 = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name "testvault"
     Set-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProperties  -Vault $vault1 -BackupStorageRedundancy GeoRedundant
     ```

### View the vaults in a subscription

To view all vaults in the subscription, use [Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/get-azrecoveryservicesvault?view=azps-1.4.0).

```powershell
Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault
```

The output is similar to the following. Note that the associated resource group and location are provided.

```powershell
Name              : Contoso-vault
ID                : /subscriptions/1234
Type              : Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults
Location          : WestUS
ResourceGroupName : Contoso-docs-rg
SubscriptionId    : 1234-567f-8910-abc
Properties        : Microsoft.Azure.Commands.RecoveryServices.ARSVaultProperties
```

### Set the vault context

Store the vault object in a variable, and set the vault context.

* Many Azure Backup cmdlets require the Recovery Services vault object as an input, so it's convenient to store the vault object in a variable.
* The vault context is the type of data protected in the vault. Set it with [Set-AzRecoveryServicesVaultContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/set-azrecoveryservicesvaultcontext?view=azps-1.4.0). After the context is set, it applies to all subsequent cmdlets.

The following example sets the vault context for **testvault**.

```powershell
Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name "testvault" | Set-AzRecoveryServicesVaultContext
```

### Fetch the vault ID

We plan on deprecating the vault context setting in accordance with Azure PowerShell guidelines. Instead, you can store or fetch the vault ID, and pass it to relevant commands. So, if you haven't set the vault context or want to specify the command to run for a certain vault, pass the vault ID as "-vaultID" to all relevant command as follows:

```powershell
$vaultID = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -ResourceGroupName "Contoso-docs-rg" -Name "testvault" | select -ExpandProperty ID
New-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy -Name "NewAFSPolicy" -WorkloadType "AzureFiles" -RetentionPolicy $retPol -SchedulePolicy $schPol -VaultID $vaultID
```

## Configure a backup policy

A backup policy specifies the schedule for backups, and how long backup recovery points should be kept:

* A backup policy is associated with at least one retention policy. A retention policy defines how long a recovery point is kept before it's deleted.
* View the default backup policy retention using [Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupRetentionPolicyObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/get-azrecoveryservicesbackupretentionpolicyobject?view=azps-1.4.0).
* View the default backup policy schedule using [Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupSchedulePolicyObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/get-azrecoveryservicesbackupschedulepolicyobject?view=azps-1.4.0).
* You use the [New-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/set-azrecoveryservicesbackupprotectionpolicy?view=azps-1.4.0) cmdlet to create a new backup policy. You input the schedule and retention policy objects.

By default, a start time is defined in the Schedule Policy Object. Use the following example to change the start time to the desired start time. The desired start time should be in UTC as well. The below example assumes the desired start time is 01:00 AM UTC for daily backups.

```powershell
$schPol = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupSchedulePolicyObject -WorkloadType "AzureFiles"
$UtcTime = Get-Date -Date "2019-03-20 01:30:00Z"
$UtcTime = $UtcTime.ToUniversalTime()
$schpol.ScheduleRunTimes[0] = $UtcTime
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to provide the start time in 30 minute multiples only. In the above example, it can be only "01:00:00" or "02:30:00". The start time cannot be "01:15:00"

The following example stores the schedule policy and the retention policy in variables. It then uses those variables as parameters for a new policy (**NewAFSPolicy**). **NewAFSPolicy** takes a daily backup and retains it for 30 days.

```powershell
$schPol = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupSchedulePolicyObject -WorkloadType "AzureFiles"
$retPol = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupRetentionPolicyObject -WorkloadType "AzureFiles"
New-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy -Name "NewAFSPolicy" -WorkloadType "AzureFiles" -RetentionPolicy $retPol -SchedulePolicy $schPol
```

The output is similar to the following.

```powershell
Name                 WorkloadType       BackupManagementType BackupTime                DaysOfWeek
----                 ------------       -------------------- ----------                ----------
NewAFSPolicy           AzureFiles            AzureStorage              10/24/2019 1:30:00 AM
```

## Enable backup

After you define the backup policy, you can enable the protection for the Azure file share using the policy.

### Retrieve a backup policy

You fetch the relevant policy object with [Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/get-azrecoveryservicesbackupprotectionpolicy?view=azps-1.4.0). Use this cmdlet to get a specific policy, or to view the policies associated with a workload type.

#### Retrieve a policy for a workload type

The following example retrieves policies for the workload type **AzureFiles**.

```powershell
Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy -WorkloadType "AzureFiles"
```

The output is similar to the following.

```powershell
Name                 WorkloadType       BackupManagementType BackupTime                DaysOfWeek
----                 ------------       -------------------- ----------                ----------
dailyafs             AzureFiles         AzureStorage         1/10/2018 12:30:00 AM
```

> [!NOTE]
> The time zone of the **BackupTime** field in PowerShell is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). When the backup time is shown in the Azure portal, the time is adjusted to your local time zone.

### Retrieve a specific policy

The following policy retrieves the backup policy named **dailyafs**.

```powershell
$afsPol =  Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy -Name "dailyafs"
```

### Enable backup and apply policy

Enable protection with [Enable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/enable-azrecoveryservicesbackupprotection?view=azps-1.4.0). After the policy is associated with the vault, backups are triggered in accordance with the policy schedule.

The following example enables protection for the Azure file share **testAzureFileShare** in storage account **testStorageAcct**, with the policy **dailyafs**.

```powershell
Enable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection -StorageAccountName "testStorageAcct" -Name "testAzureFS" -Policy $afsPol
```

The command waits until the configure protection job is finished and gives a similar output, as shown.

```cmd
WorkloadName       Operation            Status                 StartTime                                                                                                         EndTime                   JobID
------------             ---------            ------               ---------                                  -------                   -----
testAzureFS       ConfigureBackup      Completed            11/12/2018 2:15:26 PM     11/12/2018 2:16:11 PM     ec7d4f1d-40bd-46a4-9edb-3193c41f6bf6
```

## Important notice - Backup item identification for AFS backups

This section outlines an important change in AFS backup in preparation for GA.

While enabling the backup for AFS, user supplies the customer friendly File share name as the entity name and a backup item is created. The backup item's 'name' is a unique identifier created by Azure Backup service. Usually the identifier involves user friendly name. But to handle the important scenario of soft-delete, where a file share can be deleted and another file-share can be created with the same name, the unique identity of Azure file share will now be an ID instead of customer friendly name. In order to know the unique identity/name of each item, just run the ```Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem``` command with the relevant filters for backupManagementType and WorkloadType to get all the relevant items and then observe the name field in the returned PS object/response. It is always recommended to list items and then retrieve their unique name from 'name' field in response. Use this value to filter the items with the 'Name' parameter. Otherwise use the FriendlyName parameter to retrieve the item with it's customer friendly name/identifier.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure the PS version is upgraded to the minimum version for 'Az.RecoveryServices 2.6.0' for AFS backups. With this version, the 'friendlyName' filter is available for ```Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem``` command. Pass the Azure File Share name to friendlyName parameter. If you pass the Azure File Share name to the 'Name' parameter, this version throws a warning to pass this friendly name to the friendly name parameter. Not installing this minimum version might result in failure of existing scripts. Install the minimum version of PS with the following command.

```powershell
Install-module -Name Az.RecoveryServices -RequiredVersion 2.6.0
```

## Trigger an on-demand backup

Use [Backup-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/backup-azrecoveryservicesbackupitem?view=azps-1.4.0) to run an on-demand backup for a protected Azure file share.

1. Retrieve the storage account from the container in the vault that holds your backup data with [Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupContainer](/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/get-Azrecoveryservicesbackupcontainer).
2. To start a backup job, you obtain information about the Azure file share with [Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem](/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem).
3. Run an on-demand backup with[Backup-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem](/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/backup-Azrecoveryservicesbackupitem).

Run the on-demand backup as follows:

```powershell
$afsContainer = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupContainer -FriendlyName "testStorageAcct" -ContainerType AzureStorage
$afsBkpItem = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -Container $afsContainer -WorkloadType "AzureFiles" -FriendlyName "testAzureFS"
$job =  Backup-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -Item $afsBkpItem
```

The command returns a job with an ID to be tracked, as shown in the following example.

```powershell
WorkloadName     Operation            Status               StartTime                 EndTime                   JobID
------------     ---------            ------               ---------                 -------                   -----
testAzureFS       Backup               Completed            11/12/2018 2:42:07 PM     11/12/2018 2:42:11 PM     8bdfe3ab-9bf7-4be6-83d6-37ff1ca13ab6
```

Azure file share snapshots are used while the backups are taken, so usually the job completes by the time the command returns this output.

### Using a runbook to schedule backups

If you are looking for sample scripts, you can refer to the [sample script on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Use-PowerShell-for-long-term-retention-of-Azure-Files-Backup) using an Azure Automation runbook.

>[!NOTE]
> Azure File share Backup Policy now supports configuring backup with daily/weekly/monthly/yearly retention.
