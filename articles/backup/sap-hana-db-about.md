# About SAP HANA database backup in Azure VMs

SAP HANA databases are mission critical workloads that require a low recovery point objective (RPO) and a fast recovery time objective (RTO). You can now [back up SAP HANA databases running on Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db) using [Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-overview).

Azure Backup is [Backint certified](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2013_09_adpd/enEN/#/d/solutions?id=8f3fd455-a2d7-4086-aa28-51d8870acaa5) by SAP, to provide native backup support by leveraging SAP HANA's native APIs. This offering from Azure Backup aligns with Azure Backup's mantra of **zero-infrastructure** backups, eliminating the need to deploy and manage backup infrastructure. You can now seamlessly back up and restore SAP HANA databases running on Azure VMs ([M series VMs](../virtual-machines/m-series.md) also supported now!) and leverage enterprise management capabilities that Azure Backup provides.

## Added value

Using Azure Backup to back up and restore SAP HANA databases, gives the following advantages:

* **15-minute Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Recovery of critical data of up to 15 minutes is now possible.
* **One-click, point-in-time restores**: Restore of production data to alternate HANA servers is made easy. Chaining of backups and catalogs to perform restores is all managed by Azure behind the scenes.
* **Long-term retention**: For rigorous compliance and audit needs. Retain your backups for years, based on the retention duration, beyond which the recovery points will be pruned automatically by the built-in lifecycle management capability.
* **Backup Management from Azure**: Use Azure Backup's management and monitoring capabilities for improved management experience. Azure CLI is also supported.

To view the backup and restore scenarios that we support today, refer to the [SAP HANA scenario support matrix](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/sap-hana-backup-support-matrix#scenario-support).

## Backup architecture

![Backup architecture diagram](./media/sap-hana-db-about/backup-architecture.png)

* The backup process begins by [creating a Recovery services vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db#create-a-recovery-service-vault) in Azure. This vault will be used to store the backups and recovery points created over time.
* The Azure VM running SAP HANA server is registered with the vault, and the databases to be backed-up are [discovered](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db#discover-the-databases). To enable the Azure Backup service to discover databases, a [preregistration script](https://aka.ms/scriptforpermsonhana) must be run on the HANA server as a root user.
* This script creates **AZUREWLBACKUPHANAUSER** DB user and a corresponding key with the same name in **hdbuserstore**. Refer to the  [What the pre-registration script does](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#what-the-pre-registration-script-does) section to understand more about what the script does.
* Azure Backup Service now installs the **Azure Backup Plugin for HANA** on the registered SAP HANA server.
* The **AZUREWLBACKUPHANAUSER** DB user created by the preregistration script is used by the **Azure Backup Plugin for HANA** to perform all backup and restore operations. If you attempt to configure backup for SAP HANA DBs without running this script, you might receive the following error: **UserErrorHanaScriptNotRun**.
* To [configure backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db#configure-backup) on the databases that are discovered, choose the required backup policy and enable backups.

* Once the backup is configured, Azure Backup service sets up the following Backint parameters at the DATABASE level on the protected SAP HANA server:
  * [catalog_backup_using_backint:true]
  * [enable_accumulated_catalog_backup:false]
  * [parallel_data_backup_backint_channels:1]
  * [log_backup_timeout_s:900)]
  * [backint_response_timeout:7200]

>[!NOTE]
>Ensure that these parameters are *not* present at HOST level. Host-level parameters will override these parameters and might cause unexpected behavior.
>

* The **Azure Backup Plugin for HANA** maintains all the backup schedules and policy details. It triggers the scheduled backups and communicates with the **HANA Backup Engine** through the Backint APIs.
* The **HANA Backup Engine** returns a Backint stream with the data to be backed up.
* All the scheduled backups and on-demand backups (triggered from the Azure portal) that are either full or differential are initiated by the **Azure Backup Plugin for HANA**. However, log backups are managed and triggered by **HANA Backup Engine** itself.
* Azure Backup for SAP HANA, being a BackInt certified solution, doesn't depend on underlying disk or VM types. The backup is performed by streams generated by HANA.
