# Support matrix for Azure VM backup
You can use the [Azure Backup service](backup-overview.md) to back up on-premises machines and workloads, and Azure virtual machines (VMs). This article summarizes support settings and limitations when you back up Azure VMs with Azure Backup.

Other support matrices:

- [General support matrix](backup-support-matrix.md) for Azure Backup
- [Support matrix](backup-support-matrix-mabs-dpm.md) for Azure Backup server/System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) backup
- [Support matrix](backup-support-matrix-mars-agent.md) for backup with the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent

## Supported scenarios

Here's how you can back up and restore Azure VMs with the Azure Backup service.

**Scenario** | **Backup** | **Agent** |**Restore**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Direct backup of Azure VMs  | Back up the entire VM.  | No agent is needed on the Azure VM. Azure Backup installs and uses an extension to the [Azure VM agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) that is running on the VM. | Restore as follows:<br/><br/> - **Create a basic VM**. This is useful if the VM has no special configuration such as multiple IP addresses.<br/><br/> - **Restore the VM disk**. Restore the disk. Then attach it to an existing VM, or create a new VM from the disk by using PowerShell.<br/><br/> - **Replace VM disk**. If a VM exists and it uses managed disks (unencrypted), you can restore a disk and use it to replace an existing disk on the VM.<br/><br/> - **Restore specific files/folders**. You can restore files/folders from a VM instead of from the entire VM.
Direct backup of Azure VMs (Windows only)  | Back up specific files/folders/volume. | Install the [Azure Recovery Services agent](backup-azure-file-folder-backup-faq.md).<br/><br/> You can run the MARS agent alongside the backup extension for the Azure VM agent to back up the VM at file/folder level. | Restore specific folders/files.
Back up Azure VM to backup server  | Back up files/folders/volumes; system state/bare metal files; app data to System Center DPM or to Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS).<br/><br/> DPM/MABS then backs up to the backup vault. | Install the DPM/MABS protection agent on the VM. The MARS agent is installed on DPM/MABS.| Restore files/folders/volumes; system state/bare metal files; app data.

- Azure Backup doesn't support Core OS Linux.
- Azure Backup doesn't support 32-bit operating systems.
- Other bring-your-own Linux distributions might work as long as the [Azure VM agent for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux) is available on the VM, and as long as Python is supported.
- Azure Backup doesn't support a proxy-configured Linux VM if it does not have Python version 2.7 installed.


## Backup frequency and retention

**Setting** | **Limits**
--- | ---
Maximum recovery points per protected instance (machine/workload) | 9999.
Maximum expiry time for a recovery point | No limit.
Maximum backup frequency to vault (Azure VM extension) | Once a day.
Maximum backup frequency to vault (MARS agent) | Three backups per day.
Maximum backup frequency to DPM/MABS | Every 15 minutes for SQL Server.<br/><br/> Once an hour for other workloads.
Recovery point retention | Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.
Maximum retention period | Depends on backup frequency.

## Supported restore methods

**Restore method** | **Details**
--- | ---
Create a new VM | You can create a VM during the restore process. <br/><br/> This option gets a basic VM up and running. You can specify the VM name, resource group,  virtual network, subnet, and storage.  
Restore a disk | You can restore a disk and use it to create a VM.<br/><br/> When you select this option, Azure Backup copies data from the vault to a storage account that you select. The restore job generates a template. You can download this template, use it to specify custom VM settings, and create a VM.<br/><br/> This option allows you to specify more settings that the previous option to create a VM.<br/><br/>
Replace an existing disk | You can restore a disk and then use the restored disk to replace a disk that's currently on a VM.
Restore files | You can recover files from a selected recovery point. You download a script to mount the VM disk from the recovery point. You then browse through the disk volumes to find the files/folders you want to recover and unmount the disk when you're done.

## Support for file-level restore

**Restore** | **Supported**
--- | ---
Restoring files across operating systems | You can restore files on any machine that has the same (or compatible) OS as the backed-up VM. See the [Compatible OS table](backup-azure-restore-files-from-vm.md#system-requirements).
Restoring files on classic VMs | Not supported.
Restoring files from encrypted VMs | Not supported.
Restoring files from network-restricted storage accounts | Not supported.

> Resizing of disk is not recommended by Azure Backup.


## VM network support

**Component** | **Support**
--- | ---
Number of network interfaces (NICs) | Up to maximum number of NICs supported for a specific Azure VM size.<br/><br/> NICs are created when the VM is created during the restore process.<br/><br/> The number of NICs on the restored VM mirrors the number of NICs on the VM when you enabled protection. Removing NICs after you enable protection doesn't affect the count.

## VM security and encryption support

Azure Backup supports encryption for in-transit and at-rest data:

Network traffic to Azure:

- Backup traffic from servers to the Recovery Services vault is encrypted by using Advanced Encryption Standard 256.
- Backup data is sent over a secure HTTPS link.
- The backup data is stored in the Recovery Services vault in encrypted form.
- Only you have the passphrase to unlock this data. Microsoft can't decrypt the backup data at any point.

  > [!WARNING]
  > After you set up the vault, only you have access to the encryption key. Microsoft never maintains a copy and doesn't have access to the key. If the key is misplaced, Microsoft can't recover the backup data.

Data security:

- When backing up Azure VMs, you need to set up encryption *within* the virtual machine.
- Azure Backup supports Azure Disk Encryption, which uses BitLocker on Windows virtual machines and us **dm-crypt** on Linux virtual machines.
- On the back end, Azure Backup uses [Azure Storage Service encryption](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md), which protects data at rest.


**Machine** | **In transit** | **At rest**
--- | --- | ---
On-premises Windows machines without DPM/MABS | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
Azure VMs | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
On-premises/Azure VMs with DPM | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
On-premises/Azure VMs with MABS | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]



## VM compression support

Backup supports the compression of backup traffic, as summarized in the following table. Note the following:

- For Azure VMs, the VM extension reads the data directly from the Azure storage account over the storage network. It is not necessary to compress this traffic.
- If you're using DPM or MABS, you can save bandwidth by compressing the data before it's backed up to DPM/MABS.

**Machine** | **Compress to MABS/DPM (TCP)** | **Compress to vault (HTTPS)**
--- | --- | ---
On-premises Windows machines without DPM/MABS | NA | ![Yes][green]
Azure VMs | NA | NA
On-premises/Azure VMs with DPM | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
On-premises/Azure VMs with MABS | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]


## Next steps

- [Back up Azure VMs](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md).
- [Back up Windows machines directly](tutorial-backup-windows-server-to-azure.md), without a backup server.
- [Set up MABS](backup-azure-microsoft-azure-backup.md) for backup to Azure, and then back up workloads to MABS.
- [Set up DPM](backup-azure-dpm-introduction.md) for backup to Azure, and then back up workloads to DPM.
