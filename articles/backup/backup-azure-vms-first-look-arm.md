# Back up an Azure VM from the VM settings

This article explains how to back up Azure VMs with the [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md) service. You can back up Azure VMs using a couple of methods:

- Single Azure VM: The instructions in this article describe how to back up an Azure VM directly from the VM settings.
- Multiple Azure VMs: You can set up a Recovery Services vault and configure backup for multiple Azure VMs. Follow the instructions in [this article](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md) for this scenario.

## Before you start

1. [Learn](backup-architecture.md#how-does-azure-backup-work) how backup works, and [verify](backup-support-matrix.md#azure-vm-backup-support) support requirements.
2. [Get an overview](backup-azure-vms-introduction.md) of Azure VM backup.

### Azure VM agent installation

In order to back up Azure VMs, Azure Backup installs an extension on the VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure marketplace image, the agent will be running. In some cases, for example if you create a custom VM, or you migrate a machine from on-premises. you might need to install the agent manually.

- If you do need to install the VM agent manually, follow the instructions for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux) VMs.
- After the agent is installed, when you enable backup, Azure Backup installs the backup extension to the agent. It updates and patches the extension without user intervention.

## Back up from Azure VM settings

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **All services** and in the Filter, type **Virtual machines**, and then click **Virtual machines**.
3. From the list of VMs select the VM you want to back up.
4. On the VM menu, click **Backup**.
5. In **Recovery Services vault**, do the following:
   - If you already have a vault, click **Select existing**, and select a vault.
   - If you don't have a vault, click **Create new**. Specify a name for the vault. It's created in the same region and resource group as the VM. You can't modify these settings when you enable backup directly from the VM settings.

6. In **Choose backup policy**, do the following:

   - Leave the default policy. This backs up the VM once a day at the time specified, and retains backups in the vault for 30 days.
   - Select an existing backup policy if you  have one.
   - Create a new policy, and define the policy settings.

7. Click **Enable Backup**. This associates the backup policy with the VM.

8. You can track the configuration progress in the portal notifications.
9. After the job completes, in the VM menu, click **Backup**. The page shows backup status for the VM, information about recovery points, jobs running, and alerts issued.

10. After enabling backup, an initial backup runs. You can start the initial backup immediately, or wait until it starts in accordance with the backup schedule.
    - Until the initial backup completes, the **Last backup status** shows as **Warning (Initial backup pending)**.
    - To see when the next scheduled backup will run, click the backup policy name.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Backup service creates a separate resource group (other than the VM resource group) to store snapshot, with the naming format **AzureBackupRG_geography_number** (example: AzureBackupRG_northeurope_1). The data in this resource group will be retained for the duration in days as specified in “Retain instant recovery snapshot” section of the Azure Virtual Machine Backup policy. Applying a lock to this resource group can cause backup failures.<br>
This resource group should also be excluded from any name/tag restrictions as a restriction policy would block creation of Resource Point collections in it again causing backup failures.

## Run a backup immediately

1. To run a backup immediately, in the VM menu, click **Backup** > **Backup now**.

    ![Run backup](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/backup-now-update.png)

2. In **Backup Now** use the calendar control to select until when the recovery point will be retained >  and **OK**.

3. Portal notifications let you know the backup job has been triggered. To monitor backup progress, click **View all jobs**.

## Back up from the Recovery Services vault

Follow the instructions in this article to enable backup for Azure VMs by setting up an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault, and enabling backup in the vault.
