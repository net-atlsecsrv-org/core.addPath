# Troubleshoot Back up SQL Server on Azure

This article provides troubleshooting information for protecting SQL Server VMs on Azure.

## Feature consideration and limitations

To view the feature consideration, see the article, [About SQL Server backup in Azure VMs](backup-azure-sql-database.md#feature-consideration-and-limitations).

## SQL Server permissions

To configure protection for a SQL Server database on a virtual machine, the **AzureBackupWindowsWorkload** extension must be installed on that virtual machine. If you receive the error, **UserErrorSQLNoSysadminMembership**, it means your SQL Instance doesn't have the required backup permissions. To fix this error, follow the steps in [Set permissions for non-marketplace SQL VMs](backup-azure-sql-database.md#fix-sql-sysadmin-permissions).


## Backup Type Unsupported

| Severity | Description | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Warning | Current settings for this database do not support certain type of backup types present in the associated policy. | <li>**Master DB**: Only a full database backup operation can be performed on the master database; neither **differential** backup nor transaction **logs** backup is possible. </li> <li>Any database in **simple recovery model** does not allow for transaction **logs** backup to be taken.</li> | Modify the database settings such that all the backup types in the policy are supported. Alternatively, change the current policy to include only the supported backup types. Otherwise, the unsupported backup types will be skipped during scheduled backup or the backup job will fail for ad hoc backup.


## UserErrorSQLPODoesNotSupportBackupType

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| This SQL database does not support the requested backup type. | Occurs when the database recovery model doesn't allow the requested backup type. The error can happen in the following situations: <br/><ul><li>A database using a simple recovery model does not allow log backup.</li><li>Differential and log backups are not allowed for a Master database.</li></ul>For more detail, see the [SQL Recovery models](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/recovery-models-sql-server) documentation. | If the log backup fails for the DB in simple recovery model, try one of these options:<ul><li>If the database is in simple recovery mode, disable log backups.</li><li>Use the [SQL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/view-or-change-the-recovery-model-of-a-database-sql-server) to change the database recovery model to Full or Bulk Logged. </li><li> If you don't want to change the recovery model, and you have a standard policy to back up multiple databases that can't be changed, ignore the error. Your full and differential backups will work per schedule. The log backups will be skipped, which is expected in this case.</li></ul>If it's a Master database and you have configured differential or log backup, use any of the following steps:<ul><li>Use the portal to change the backup policy schedule for the Master database, to Full.</li><li>If you have a standard policy to back up multiple databases that can't be changed, ignore the error. Your full backup will work per schedule. Differential or log backups won't happen, which is expected in this case.</li></ul> |
| Operation canceled as a conflicting operation was already running on the same database. | See the [blog entry about back up and restore limitations](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arvindsh/2008/12/30/concurrency-of-full-differential-and-log-backups-on-the-same-database) that run concurrently.| [Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to monitor the backup jobs.](manage-monitor-sql-database-backup.md) Once the conflicting operation fails, restart the operation.|

## UserErrorSQLPODoesNotExist

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| SQL database does not exist. | The database was either deleted or renamed. | Check if the database was accidentally deleted or renamed.<br/><br/> If the database was accidentally deleted, to continue backups, restore the database to the original location.<br/><br/> If you deleted the database and do not need future backups, then in the Recovery Services vault, click [stop backup with "Delete/Retain data"](manage-monitor-sql-database-backup.md).

## UserErrorSQLLSNValidationFailure

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Log chain is broken. | The database or the VM is backed up using another backup solution, which truncates the log chain.|<ul><li>Check if another backup solution or script is in use. If so, stop the other backup solution. </li><li>If the backup was an ad hoc log backup, trigger a full backup to start a new log chain. For scheduled log backups, no action is needed as Azure Backup service will automatically trigger a full backup to fix this issue.</li>|

## UserErrorOpeningSQLConnection

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Backup is not able to connect to the SQL instance. | Azure Backup can't connect to the SQL Instance. | Use the additional details in the Azure portal error menu to narrow down the root causes. Refer to [SQL backup troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/troubleshoot-connecting-to-the-sql-server-database-engine) to fix the error.<br/><ul><li>If the default SQL settings do not allow remote connections, change the settings. See the following articles for information about changing the settings.<ul><li>[MSSQLSERVER_-1](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2016/bb326495(v=sql.130))</li><li>[MSSQLSERVER_2](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-2-database-engine-error)</li><li>[MSSQLSERVER_53](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-53-database-engine-error)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>If there are login issues, refer to the below links to fix it:<ul><li>[MSSQLSERVER_18456](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-18456-database-engine-error)</li><li>[MSSQLSERVER_18452](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-18452-database-engine-error)</li></ul></li></ul> |

## UserErrorParentFullBackupMissing

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| First full backup is missing for this data source. | Full backup is missing for the database. Log and differential backups parent to a full backup, so full backups must be taken before triggering differential or log backups. | Trigger an ad hoc full backup.   |

## UserErrorBackupFailedAsTransactionLogIsFull

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Cannot take backup as transaction log for the data source is full. | The database transactional log space is full. | To fix this issue, refer to the [SQL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-9002-database-engine-error). |

## UserErrorCannotRestoreExistingDBWithoutForceOverwrite

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Database with same name already exists at the target location | The target restore destination already has a database with same name.  | <ul><li>Change the target database name</li><li>Or, use the force overwrite option in the restore page</li> |

## UserErrorRestoreFailedDatabaseCannotBeOfflined

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Restore failed as the database could not be brought offline. | While doing a restore, target database needs to be brought offline. Azure Backup is not able to bring this data offline. | Use the additional details in the Azure portal error menu to narrow down the root causes. For more information, see the [SQL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-database-backup-using-ssms). |

##  UserErrorCannotFindServerCertificateWithThumbprint

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Cannot find the server certificate with thumbprint on the target. | The Master database on the destination instance doesn't have a valid encryption thumbprint. | Import the valid certificate thumbprint used on the Source instance, to the target instance. |

## UserErrorRestoreNotPossibleBecauseLogBackupContainsBulkLoggedChanges

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| The log backup used for recovery contains bulk-logged changes. It cannot be used to stop at an arbitrary point in time as per the SQL guidelines. | When a database is in bulk logged recovery mode, the data between a bulk logged transaction and next log transaction cannot be recovered. | Choose a different Point in Time for Recovery. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms186229(v=sql.105))


## FabricSvcBackupPreferenceCheckFailedUserError

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Backup preference for SQL Always On Availability Group cannot be met as some nodes of the Availability Group are not registered. | Nodes required to perform backups are not registered or are unreachable. | <ul><li>Ensure that all the nodes required to perform backups of this database are registered and healthy and then retry the operation.</li><li>Change SQL Always On Availability Group backup preference.</li></ul> |

## VMNotInRunningStateUserError

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| SQL server VM is either shutdown and not accessible to Azure Backup service. | VM is shut down | Ensure that the SQL server is running. |

## GuestAgentStatusUnavailableUserError

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Backup service uses Azure VM guest agent for doing backup but guest agent is not available on the target server. | Guest agent is not enabled or is unhealthy | [Install the VM guest agent](../virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows.md) manually. |

## AutoProtectionCancelledOrNotValid

| Error message | Possible causes | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-protection Intent was either removed or is no more valid. | When you enable auto-protection on a SQL instance, **Configure Backup** jobs run for all the databases in that instance. If you disable auto-protection while the jobs are running, then the **In-Progress** jobs are canceled with this error code. | Enable auto-protection once again to protect all the remaining databases. |

## Re-registration failures

Check for one or more of the [symptoms](#symptoms) before triggering the re-register operation.

### Symptoms

* All operations such as backup, restore, and configure backup are failing on the VM with one of the following error codes: **WorkloadExtensionNotReachable**, **UserErrorWorkloadExtensionNotInstalled**, **WorkloadExtensionNotPresent**, **WorkloadExtensionDidntDequeueMsg**
* The **Backup Status** for the Backup item is showing **Not reachable**. Although you must rule out all the other reasons that may also result in the same status:

  * Lack of permission to perform backup related operations on the VM  
  * VM has been shut down because of which backups can’t take place
  * Network issues  

    ![Re-Register VM](./media/backup-azure-sql-database/re-register-vm.png)

* In case of always on availability group, the backups started failing after you changed the backup preference or when there was a failover

### Causes
These symptoms may arise due to one or more of the following reasons:

  * Extension was deleted or uninstalled from portal 
  * Extension was uninstalled from the **Control Panel** of the VM under **Uninstall or Change a Program** UI
  * VM was restored back in time using in-place disk(s) restore
  * VM was shut down for an extended period because of which the extension configuration on it expired
  * VM was deleted and another VM was created with the same name and in the same resource group as the deleted VM
  * One of the AG nodes didn't receive the complete backup configuration, this may happen either at the time of availability group registration to the vault or when a new node gets added  <br>
   
In the above scenarios, it is recommended to trigger re-register operation on the VM. This option is only available through PowerShell and will soon be available in the Azure portal as well.

## File's size limit beyond which restore happens to default path

The total string size of files not only depends on the number of files but also on their names and paths. For each of the database files, get the logical file name and physical path.
You can use the SQL query given below:

  ```
  SELECT mf.name AS LogicalName, Physical_Name AS Location FROM sys.master_files mf
                 INNER JOIN sys.databases db ON db.database_id = mf.database_id
                 WHERE db.name = N'<Database Name>'"
 ```

Now arrange them in the format given below:

  ```[{"path":"<Location>","logicalName":"<LogicalName>","isDir":false},{"path":"<Location>","logicalName":"<LogicalName>","isDir":false}]}
  ```

Example:

  ```[{"path":"F:\\Data\\TestDB12.mdf","logicalName":"TestDB12","isDir":false},{"path":"F:\\Log\\TestDB12_log.ldf","logicalName":"TestDB12_log","isDir":false}]}
  ```

If the string size of the content given above exceeds 20,000 bytes, then the database files are stored differently, and during recovery you will not be able to set the target file path for restore. The files will be restored to the Default SQL path provided by SQL Server.

### Override the default target restore file path

You can override the target restore file path during the restore operation by placing a JSON file which contains the mapping of the database file to target restore path. For this create a file `database_name.json` and place it in the location *C:\Program Files\Azure Workload Backup\bin\plugins\SQL*.

The content of the file should be of the format given below:
  ```[
    {
      "Path": "<Restore_Path>",
      "LogicalName": "<LogicalName>",
      "IsDir": "false"
    },
    {
      "Path": "<Restore_Path>",
      "LogicalName": "LogicalName",
      "IsDir": "false"
    },  
  ]
  ```

Example:

  ```[
      {
        "Path": "F:\\Data\\testdb2_1546408741449456.mdf",
        "LogicalName": "testdb7",
       "IsDir": "false"
      },
      {
        "Path": "F:\\Log\\testdb2_log_1546408741449456.ldf",
        "LogicalName": "testdb7_log",
        "IsDir": "false"
      },  
    ]
  ```

 
In the above content you can get the Logical name of the database file using the SQL query given below:

```
SELECT mf.name AS LogicalName FROM sys.master_files mf
                INNER JOIN sys.databases db ON db.database_id = mf.database_id
                WHERE db.name = N'<Database Name>'"
  ```


This file should be placed before you trigger the restore operation.
