# Perform actions using Backup Center

Backup Center allows you to perform key backup-related actions from a central interface without needing to navigate to an individual vault. Some actions that you can perform from Backup Center are:

* Configure backup for your datasources
* Restore a backup instance
* Create a new vault
* Create a new backup policy
* Trigger an on-demand backup for a backup instance
* Stop backup for a backup instance

## Supported scenarios

* Backup Center is currently supported for Azure VM backup and Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backup.
* Refer to the [support matrix](backup-center-support-matrix.md) for a detailed list of supported and unsupported scenarios.

## Configure backup

Depending on the type of datasource you wish to back up, follow the appropriate instructions as described below.

### Configure backup for Azure virtual machines

1. Navigate to the Backup Center and select **+ Backup** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

### Configure backup for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server

1. Navigate to the Backup Center and select **+ Backup** at the top of the **Overview** tab.
2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up (Azure Database for PostgreSQL server in this case).

## Restore a backup instance

Depending on the type of datasource you wish to restore, follow the appropriate instructions as described below.

### If you're restoring an Azure virtual machine

1. Navigate to the Backup Center and select **Restore** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

### If you're restoring an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server

1. Navigate to the Backup Center and select **Restore** at the top of the **Overview** tab.
2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up (Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server in this case).

## Create a new backup policy

Depending on the type of datasource you wish to back up, follow the appropriate instructions described below.

### If you're backing up an Azure virtual machine

1. Navigate to the Backup Center and select **+ Policy** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

### If you're backing up an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server

1. Navigate to the Backup Center and select **+ Policy** at the top of the **Overview** tab.
2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up (Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server in this case).

    ![Select datasource for policy for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backup](./media/backup-center-actions/policy-select-datasource-postgresql.png)

3. Select **Proceed**. This leads you to the policy creation experience that it identical to the one reachable from a Backup vault. [Learn more about how to create a new backup policy with a Backup vault](backup-azure-database-postgresql.md#create-backup-policy).

## Execute an on-demand backup for a backup instance

Backup Center allows you to search for backup instances across your backup estate and execute backup operations on demand.

To trigger an on-demand backup, navigate to Backup Center and select the **Backup Instances** menu item. Selecting this lets you view details of all the backup instances that you have access to. You can search for the backup instance you wish to back up. Right-clicking on an item in the grid opens up a list of available actions. Select the **Backup Now** option to execute an on-demand backup.

## Stop backup for a backup instance

There are scenarios when you might want to stop backup for a backup instance, such as when the underlying resource being backed up doesnâ€™t exist anymore.

To trigger an on-demand backup, navigate to Backup Center and select the **Backup Instances** menu item. Select this lets you view details of all the backup instances that you have access to. You can search for the backup instance you wish to back up. Right-clicking on an item in the grid opens up a list of available actions. Select the **Stop Backup** option to stop backup for the backup instance.
