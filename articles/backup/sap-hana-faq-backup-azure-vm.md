# Frequently asked questions â€“ Back up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs

This article answers common questions about backing up SAP HANA databases using the Azure Backup service.

## Backup

### How many full backups are supported per day?

We support only one full backup per day. You cannot have differential backup and full backup triggered on the same day.

### Do successful backup jobs create alerts?

No. Successful backup jobs don't generate alerts. Alerts are sent only for backup jobs that fail. Detailed behavior for portal alerts is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor). However, if you are interested having alerts even for successful jobs, you can use [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-use-azuremonitor).

### Can I see scheduled backup jobs in the Backup Jobs menu?

The Backup Job menu will only show ad-hoc backup jobs. For scheduled jobs, use [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-use-azuremonitor).

### Are future databases automatically added for backup?

No, this is not currently supported.

### If I delete a database from an instance, what will happen to the backups?

If a database is dropped from an SAP HANA instance, the database backups are still attempted. This implies that the deleted database begins to show up as unhealthy under **Backup Items** and is still protected.
The correct way to stop protecting this database is to perform **Stop Backup with delete data** on this database.

### If I change the name of the database after it has been protected, what will the behavior be?

A renamed database is treated as a new database. Therefore, the service will treat this situation as if the database were not found and with fail the backups. The renamed database will appear as a new database and must be configured for protection.

### What are the prerequisites to back up SAP HANA databases on an Azure VM?

Refer to the [prerequisites](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#prerequisites) and [What the pre-registration script does](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#what-the-pre-registration-script-does) sections.

### What permissions should be set for Azure to be able to back up SAP HANA databases?

Running the pre-registration script sets the required permissions to allow Azure to back up SAP HANA databases. You can find more what the pre-registration script does [here](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#what-the-pre-registration-script-does).

### Will backups work after migrating SAP HANA from SDC to MDC?

Refer to [this section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-sap-hana-database-troubleshoot#sdc-to-mdc-upgrade-with-a-change-in-sid) of the troubleshooting guide.

### Can Azure HANA Backup be set up against a virtual IP (load balancer) and not a virtual machine?

Currently we do not have the capability to set up the solution against a virtual IP alone. We need a virtual machine to execute the solution.

### I have a SAP HANA System Replication (HSR), how should I configure backup for this setup?

The primary and secondary nodes of the HSR will be treated as two individual, un-related VMs. You need to configure backup on the primary node and when the fail-over happens, you need to configure backup on the secondary node (which now becomes the primary node). There is no automatic 'fail-over' of backup to the other node.

### How can I move an on-demand backup to the local file system instead of the Azure vault?

1. Wait for the currently running backup to complete on the desired database (check from studio for completion)
1. Disable log backups and set the catalog backup to **Filesystem** for the desired DB using the following steps:
1. Double-click **SYSTEMDB** -> **configuration** -> **Select Database** -> **Filter (log)**
    1. Set enable_auto_log_backup to **no**
    1. Set log_backup_using_backint to **false**
1. Take an on-demand backup on the desired database, and wait for the backup and catalog backup to complete.
1. Revert to the previous settings to allow backups to flow to the Azure vault:
    1. Set enable_auto_log_backup to **yes**
    1. Set log_backup_using_backint to **true**

## Restore

### Why can't I see the HANA system I want my database to be restored to?

Check if all the prerequisites for the restore to target SAP HANA instance are met. For more information, see [Prerequisites - Restore SAP HANA databases in Azure VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/sap-hana-db-restore#prerequisites).

### Why is the Overwrite DB restore failing for my database?

Ensure that the **Force Overwrite** option is selected while restoring.

### Why do I see the "Source and target systems for restore are incompatible" error?

Refer to the SAP HANA Note [1642148](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1642148) to see what restore types are currently supported.

### Can I use a backup of a database running on SLES to restore to a RHEL HANA system or vice versa?

Yes, you can use streaming backups triggered on a HANA database running on SLES to restore it to a RHEL HANA system and vice versa. That is, cross OS restore is possible using streaming backups. However, you will have to ensure that the HANA system you want to restore to, and the HANA system used for restore, are both compatible for restore according to SAP. Refer to SAP HANA Note [1642148](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1642148) to see which restore types are compatible.
