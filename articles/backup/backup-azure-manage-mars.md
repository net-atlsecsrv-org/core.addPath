# Manage Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agent backups by using the Azure Backup service

This article describes how to manage files and folders that are backed up with the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent.

## Modify a backup policy

When you modify backup policy, you can add new items, remove existing items from backup, or exclude files from being backed up using  Exclusion Settings.

- **Add Items** use this option only for adding new items to back up. To remove existing items, use **Remove Items** or **Exclusion Settings** option.  
- **Remove Items** use this option to remove items from being backed up.
  - Use **Exclusion Settings** for removing all items within a volume instead of **Remove Items**.
  - Clearing all selections in a volume causes old backups of the items, to be retained according to retention settings at the time of the last backup, without scope for modification.
  - Reselecting these items, leads to a first full-backup and new policy changes aren't applied to old backups.
  - Unselecting entire volume retains past backup without any scope for modifying retention policy.
- **Exclusion Settings** use this option to exclude specific items from being backed up.

### Add new items to existing policy

1. In **Actions**, select **Schedule Backup**.

2. In **Select policy item** tab, and select **Modify backup schedule for your files and folders** and select **Next**.

    ![Select Policy Items](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/select-policy-items.png)

3. In **Modify or stop schedule backup** tab, select **Make changes to backup items or times** and select **Next**.

    ![Modify or schedule backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/modify-schedule-backup.png)

4. In **Select items to Backup** tab, select **Add items** to add the items that you want to back up.

    ![Modify or schedule backup add items](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/modify-schedule-backup-add-items.png)

5. In **Select Items** window, select files or folders that you  want to add and select **OK**.

    ![Select the items](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/select-item.png)

6. Complete the next steps and select **Finish** to complete the operation.

### Add Exclusion rules to existing policy

You can add exclusion rules to skip files and folders that you don't want to be backed up. You can do this during when defining a new policy or modifying an existing policy.

1. From the Actions pane, select **Schedule Backup**. Go to **Select items to Backup** and select **Exclusion Settings**.

    ![Exclusion settings](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/select-exclusion-settings.png)

2. In **Exclusion Settings**, select **Add Exclusion**.

    ![Add exclusion](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/add-exclusion.png)

3. From **Select Items to Exclude**, browse the files and folders and select items that you want to exclude and select **OK**.

    ![Select the items to exclude](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/select-items-exclude.png)

4. By default all **Subfolders** within the selected folders are excluded. You can change this by selecting **Yes** or **No**. You can edit and specify the file types to exclude as shown below:

    ![Select subfolder types](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/subfolders-type.png)

5. Complete the next steps and select **Finish** to complete the operation.

### Remove items from existing policy

1. From the Actions pane, select **Schedule Backup**. Go to **Select items to Backup**. From the list, select the files and folders that you want to remove from backup schedule and select **Remove items**.

    ![Select the items to remove](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/select-items-remove.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Proceed with caution when you completely remove a volume from the policy.  If you need to add it again, then it will be treated as a new volume. The next scheduled backup will perform an Initial Backup (full backup) instead of Incremental Backup. If you need to temporarily remove and add items later, then it's recommended to use **Exclusions Settings** instead of **Remove Items** to ensure incremental backup instead of full backup.

2. Complete the next steps and select **Finish** to complete the operation.

## Stop protecting Files and Folder backup

There are two ways to stop protecting Files and Folders backup:

- **Stop protection and retain backup data**.
  - This option will stop all future backup jobs from protection.
  - Azure Backup service will continue to retain all the existing recovery points.  
  - You'll be able to restore the backed-up data for unexpired recovery points.
  - If you decide to resume protection, then you can use the *Re-enable backup schedule* option. After that, data will be retained based on the new retention policy.
- **Stop protection and delete backup data**.
  - This option will stop all future backup jobs from protecting your data and delete all the recovery points.
  - You'll receive a delete Backup data alert email with a message *Your data for this Backup item has been deleted. This data will be temporarily available for 14 days, after which it will be permanently deleted* and recommended action *Reprotect the Backup item within 14 days to recover your data.*
  - To resume protection, reprotect within 14 days from delete operation.

### Stop protection and retain backup data

1. Open the MARS management console, go to the **Actions pane**, and **select Schedule Backup**.

    ![Select schedule backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/mars-actions.png)
1. In the **Select Policy Item** page, select **Modify a backup schedule for your files and folders** and select **Next**.

    ![Select policy item](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/select-policy-item-retain-data.png)
1. From the **Modify or Stop a Scheduled Backup** page, select **Stop using this backup schedule, but keep the stored backups until a schedule is activated again**. Then, select **Next**.

    ![Stop a scheduled backup.](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/stop-schedule-backup.png)
1. In **Pause Scheduled Backup**, review the information and select **Finish**.

    ![Pause a scheduled backup.](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/pause-schedule-backup.png)
1. In **Modify backup progress**, check your schedule backup pause is in success status and select **close** to finish.

### Stop protection and delete backup data

1. Open the MARS management console, go to the **Actions** pane, and select **Schedule Backup**.
2. From the **Modify or Stop a Scheduled Backup** page, select **Stop using this backup schedule and delete all the stored backups**. Then, select **Next**.

    ![Modify or stop a scheduled backup.](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/modify-schedule-backup.png)

3. From the **Stop a Scheduled Backup** page, select **Finish**.

    ![Stop a scheduled backup and select finish](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/stop-schedule-backup.png)
4. You're prompted to enter a security PIN (personal identification number), which you must generate manually. To do this, first sign in to the Azure portal.
5. Go to **Recovery Services vault** > **Settings** > **Properties**.
6. Under **Security PIN**, select **Generate**. Copy this PIN. The PIN is valid for only five minutes.
7. In the management console, paste the PIN, and then select **OK**.

    ![Generate a security PIN.](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/security-pin.png)

8. In the **Modify Backup Progress** page, the following message appears: *Deleted backup data will be retained for 14 days. After that time, backup data will be permanently deleted.*  

    ![Modify Backup progress](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/deleted-backup-data.png)

After you delete the on-premises backup items, follow the next steps from the portal.

## Re-enable protection

If you stopped protection while retaining data and decided to resume protection, then you can re-enable the backup schedule using modify backup policy.

1. On **Actions** select **Schedule backup**.
1. Select **Re-enable backup schedule. You can also modify backup items or times** and select **Next**.<br>

    ![Re-enable backup schedule](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/re-enable-policy-next.png)
1. In **Select Items to Backup**, select **Next**.

    ![Select Items to Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/re-enable-next.png)
1. In **Specify Backup Schedule**, specify the backup schedule and select **Next**.
1. In **Select Retention Policy**, specify retention duration and select **Next**.
1. Finally in the **Confirmation** screen, review the policy details and select **Finish**.

## Re-generate passphrase

A passphrase is used to encrypt and decrypt data while backing up or restoring your on-premises or local machine using the MARS agent to or from Azure. If you lost or forgot the passphrase, then you can regenerate the passphrase (provided your machine is still registered with the Recovery Services vault and the backup is configured) by following these steps:

1. From the MARS agent console, go to **Actions Pane** > **Change properties** >. Then go to **Encryption tab**.<br>
1. Select **Change Passphrase** checkbox.<br>
1. Enter a new passphrase or select **Generate Passphrase**.
1. Select **Browse** to save the new passphrase.

    ![Generate passphrase.](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/passphrase.png)

1. Select **OK** to apply changes.  If the [Security Feature](./backup-azure-security-feature.md#enable-security-features) is enabled on the Azure portal for the Recovery Services vault, then you'll be prompted to enter the Security PIN. To receive the PIN, follow the steps listed in this [article](./backup-azure-security-feature.md#authentication-to-perform-critical-operations).<br>
1. Paste the security PIN from the portal and select **OK** to apply the changes.<br>

    ![Paste the security PIN](./media/backup-azure-manage-mars/passphrase2.png)
1. Ensure that the passphrase is securely saved in an alternate location (other than the source machine), preferably in the Azure Key Vault. Keep track of all the passphrases if you have multiple machines being backed up with the MARS agents.

## Managing backup data for unavailable machines

This section discusses a scenario where your source machine that was protected with MARS is no longer available because it was deleted, corrupted, infected with malware/ransomware, or decommissioned.

For these machines, the Azure Backup service ensures that the most recent recovery point doesn't expire (that is, doesn't get pruned) according to the retention rules specified in the backup policy. Therefore, you can safely restore the machine.  Consider the following scenarios you can perform on the backed-up data:

### Scenario 1: The source machine is unavailable, and you no longer need to retain backup data

- You can delete the backed-up data from the Azure portal using the steps listed in [this article](backup-azure-delete-vault.md#delete-protected-items-on-premises).

### Scenario 2: The source machine is unavailable, and you need to retain backup data

Managing the backup policy for MARS is done through the MARS console and not through the portal. If you need to extend retention settings for existing recovery points before they expire, then you need to restore the machine, install the MARS console, and extend the policy.

- To restore the machine, perform the following steps:
  1. [Restore the VM to an alternate target machine](backup-azure-restore-windows-server.md#use-instant-restore-to-restore-data-to-an-alternate-machine)
  1. Recreate the target machine with same host name as the source machine
  1. Install the agent and re-register to the same vault and with the same passphrase
  1. Launch the MARS client to extend the retention duration according to your requirements
- Your newly restored machine, protected with MARS, will continue to take backups.
