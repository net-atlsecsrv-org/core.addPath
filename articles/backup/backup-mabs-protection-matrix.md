# MABS (Azure Backup Server) V3 UR1 protection matrix

This article lists the various servers and workloads that you can protect with Azure Backup Server. The following matrix lists what can be protected with Azure Backup Server.

Use the following matrix for MABS v3 UR1:

* Workloads – The workload type of technology.

* Version – Supported MABS version for the workloads.

* MABS installation – The computer/location where you wish to install MABS.

* Protection and recovery – List the detailed information about the workloads such as supported storage container or supported deployment.

>[!NOTE]
>Support for the 32-bit protection agent is deprecated with MABS v3 UR1. See [32-Bit protection agent deprecation](backup-mabs-whats-new-mabs.md#32-bit-protection-agent-deprecation).

## Azure ExpressRoute support

You can back up your data over Azure ExpressRoute with public peering (available for old circuits) and Microsoft peering. Backup over private peering isn't supported.

With public peering: Ensure access to the following domains/addresses:

* `http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt`
* `microsoft.com`
* `.WindowsAzure.com`
* `.microsoftonline.com`
* `.windows.net`

With Microsoft peering, select the following services/regions and relevant community values:

* Azure Active Directory (12076:5060)
* Microsoft Azure Region (according to the location of your Recovery Services vault)
* Azure Storage (according to the location of your Recovery Services vault)

For more information, see the [ExpressRoute routing requirements](../expressroute/expressroute-routing.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Public Peering is deprecated for new circuits.

## Cluster support

Azure Backup Server can protect data in the following clustered applications:

* File servers

* SQL Server

* Hyper-V - If you protect a Hyper-V cluster using scaled-out MABS protection agent, you can't add secondary protection for the protected Hyper-V workloads.

* Exchange Server - Azure Backup Server can protect non-shared disk clusters for supported Exchange Server versions (cluster-continuous replication), and can also protect Exchange Server configured for local continuous replication.

* SQL Server - Azure Backup Server doesn't support backing up SQL Server databases hosted on cluster-shared volumes (CSVs).

Azure Backup Server can protect cluster workloads that are located in the same domain as the MABS server, and in a child or trusted domain. If you want to protect data sources in untrusted domains or workgroups, use NTLM or certificate authentication for a single server, or certificate authentication only for a cluster.
