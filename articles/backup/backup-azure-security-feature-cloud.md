# Security features to help protect cloud workloads that use Azure Backup

Concerns about security issues, like malware, ransomware, and intrusion, are increasing. These security issues can be costly, in terms of both money and data. To guard against such attacks, Azure Backup now provides security features to help protect backup data even after deletion.

One such feature is soft delete. With soft delete, even if a malicious actor deletes the backup of a VM (or backup data is accidentally deleted), the backup data is retained for 14 additional days, allowing the recovery of that backup item with no data loss. The additional 14 days retention of backup data in the "soft delete" state don't incur any cost to the customer. Azure also encrypts all the backed-up data at rest using [Storage Service Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption) to further secure your data.

Soft delete protection for Azure virtual machines is generally available.

## Soft delete

### Soft delete for VMs

Soft delete for VMs protects the backups of your VMs from unintended deletion. Even after the backups are deleted, they are preserved in soft-delete state for 14 additional days.

> [!NOTE]
> Soft delete only protects deleted backup data. If a VM is deleted without a backup, the soft-delete feature will not preserve the data. All resources should be protected with Azure Backup to ensure full resilience.
>

### Supported regions

Soft delete is currently supported in the West Central US, East Asia, Canada Central, Canada East, France Central, France South, Korea Central, Korea South, UK South, UK West, Australia East, Australia South East, North Europe, West US, West US2, Central US, South East Asia, North Central US, South Central US, Japan East, Japan West, India South, India Central, India West, East US 2, Switzerland North, Switzerland West, and all National regions.

### Soft delete for VMs using Azure portal

1. To delete the backup data of a VM, the backup must be stopped. In the Azure portal, go to your recovery services vault, right-click on the backup item and choose **Stop backup**.

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal Backup Items](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/backup-stopped.png)

2. In the following window, you'll be given a choice to delete or retain the backup data. If you choose **Delete backup data** and then **Stop backup**, the VM backup won't be permanently deleted. Rather, the backup data will be retained for 14 days in the soft deleted state. If **Delete backup data** is chosen, a delete email alert is sent to the configured email ID informing the user that 14 days remain of extended retention for backup data. Also, an email alert is sent on the 12th day informing that there are two more days left to resurrect the deleted data. The deletion is deferred until the 15th day, when permanent deletion will occur and a final email alert is sent informing about the permanent deletion of the data.

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal, Stop Backup screen](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/delete-backup-data.png)

3. During those 14 days, in the Recovery Services Vault, the soft deleted VM will appear with a red "soft-delete" icon next to it.

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal, VM in soft delete state](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/vm-soft-delete.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If any soft-deleted backup items are present in the vault, the vault cannot be deleted at that time. Please try vault deletion after the backup items are permanently deleted, and there is no item in soft deleted state left in the vault.

4. To restore the soft-deleted VM, it must first be undeleted. To undelete, choose the soft-deleted VM, and then select the option **Undelete**.

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal, Undelete VM](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/choose-undelete.png)

   A window will appear warning that if undelete is chosen, all restore points for the VM will be undeleted and available for performing a restore operation. The VM will be retained in a "stop protection with retain data" state with backups paused and backup data retained forever with no backup policy effective.

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal, Confirm undelete VM](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/undelete-vm.png)

   At this point, you can also restore the VM by selecting **Restore VM** from the chosen restore point.  

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal, Restore VM option](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/restore-vm.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Garbage collector will run and clean expired recovery points only after the user performs the **Resume backup** operation.

5. After the undelete process is completed, the status will return to "Stop backup with retain data" and then you can choose **Resume backup**. The **Resume backup** operation brings back the backup item in the active state, associated with a backup policy selected by the user defining the backup and retention schedules.

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal, Resume backup option](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/resume-backup.png)

This flow chart shows the different steps and states of a backup item when Soft Delete is enabled:

For more information, see the [Frequently Asked Questions](backup-azure-security-feature-cloud.md#frequently-asked-questions) section below.

### Soft delete for VMs using Azure PowerShell

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Az.RecoveryServices version required to use soft-delete using Azure PS is min 2.2.0. Use ```Install-Module -Name Az.RecoveryServices -Force``` to get the latest version.

As outlined above for Azure portal, the sequence of steps is same while using Azure PowerShell as well.

#### Delete the backup item using Azure PowerShell

Delete the backup item using the [Disable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/Disable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection?view=azps-1.5.0) PS cmdlet.

```powershell
Disable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection -Item $myBkpItem -RemoveRecoveryPoints -VaultId $myVaultID -Force

WorkloadName     Operation            Status               StartTime                 EndTime                   JobID
------------     ---------            ------               ---------                 -------                   -----
AppVM1           DeleteBackupData     Completed            12/5/2019 12:44:15 PM     12/5/2019 12:44:50 PM     0488c3c2-accc-4a91-a1e0-fba09a67d2fb
```

The 'DeleteState' of the backup item will change from 'NotDeleted' to 'ToBeDeleted'. The backup data will be retained for 14 days. If you wish to revert the delete operation, then undo-delete should be performed.

#### Undoing the deletion operation using Azure PowerShell

First, fetch the relevant backup item that is in soft-delete state (that is, about to be deleted).

```powershell

Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -BackupManagementType AzureVM -WorkloadType AzureVM -VaultId $myVaultID | Where-Object {$_.DeleteState -eq "ToBeDeleted"}

Name                                     ContainerType        ContainerUniqueName                      WorkloadType         ProtectionStatus     HealthStatus         DeleteState
----                                     -------------        -------------------                      ------------         ----------------     ------------         -----------
VM;iaasvmcontainerv2;selfhostrg;AppVM1    AzureVM             iaasvmcontainerv2;selfhostrg;AppVM1       AzureVM              Healthy              Passed               ToBeDeleted

$myBkpItem = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -BackupManagementType AzureVM -WorkloadType AzureVM -VaultId $myVaultID -Name AppVM1
```

Then, perform the undo-deletion operation using the [Undo-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItemDeletion](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/undo-azrecoveryservicesbackupitemdeletion?view=azps-3.1.0) PS cmdlet.

```powershell
Undo-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItemDeletion -Item $myBKpItem -VaultId $myVaultID -Force

WorkloadName     Operation            Status               StartTime                 EndTime                   JobID
------------     ---------            ------               ---------                 -------                   -----
AppVM1           Undelete             Completed            12/5/2019 12:47:28 PM     12/5/2019 12:47:40 PM     65311982-3755-46b5-8e53-c82ea4f0d2a2
```

The 'DeleteState' of the backup item will revert to 'NotDeleted'. But the protection is still stopped. [Resume the backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-automation#change-policy-for-backup-items) to re-enable the protection.

### Soft delete for VMs using REST API

- Delete the backups using REST API as mentioned [here](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-backupazurevms.md#stop-protection-and-delete-data).
- If user wishes to undo these delete operations, refer to steps mentioned [here](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-backupazurevms.md#undo-the-stop-protection-and-delete-data).

## Disabling soft delete

Soft delete is enabled by default on newly created vaults to protect backup data from accidental or malicious deletes.  Disabling this feature isn't recommended. The only circumstance where you should consider disabling soft delete is if you're planning on moving your protected items to a new vault, and can't wait the 14 days required before deleting and reprotecting (such as in a test environment.) Only the vault owner can disable this feature. If you disable this feature, all future deletions of protected items will result in immediate removal, without the ability to restore. Backup data that exists in soft deleted state before disabling this feature, will remain in soft deleted state for the period of 14 days. If you wish to permanently delete these immediately, then you need to undelete and delete them again to get permanently deleted.

### Disabling soft delete using Azure portal

To disable soft delete, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your vault, and then go to **Settings** -> **Properties**.
2. In the properties pane, select **Security Settings** -> **Update**.  
3. In the security settings pane, under **Soft Delete**, select **Disable**.

![Disable soft delete](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/disable-soft-delete.png)

### Disabling soft delete using Azure PowerShell

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Az.RecoveryServices version required to use soft-delete using Azure PS is min 2.2.0. Use ```Install-Module -Name Az.RecoveryServices -Force``` to get the latest version.

To disable, use the [Set-AzRecoveryServicesVaultBackupProperty](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/set-azrecoveryservicesbackupproperty?view=azps-3.1.0) PS cmdlet.

```powershell
Set-AzRecoveryServicesVaultProperty -VaultId $myVaultID -SoftDeleteFeatureState Disable


StorageModelType       :
StorageType            :
StorageTypeState       :
EnhancedSecurityState  : Enabled
SoftDeleteFeatureState : Disabled
```

### Disabling soft delete using REST API

To disable the soft-delete functionality using REST API, refer to the steps mentioned [here](use-restapi-update-vault-properties.md#update-soft-delete-state-using-rest-api).

## Permanently deleting soft deleted backup items

Backup data in soft deleted state prior disabling this feature, will remain in soft deleted state. If you wish to permanently delete these immediately, then undelete and delete them again to get permanently deleted.

### Using Azure portal

Follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps to [disable soft delete](#disabling-soft-delete).
2. In the Azure portal, go to your vault, go to **Backup Items**, and choose the soft deleted VM.

   ![Choose soft deleted VM](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/vm-soft-delete.png)

3. Select the option **Undelete**.

   ![Choose Undelete](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/choose-undelete.png)

4. A window will appear. Select **Undelete**.

   ![Select Undelete](./media/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud/undelete-vm.png)

5. Choose **Delete backup data** to permanently delete the backup data.

   ![Choose Delete backup data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/media/backup-azure-manage-vms/delete-backup-buttom.png)

6. Type the name of the backup item to confirm that you want to delete the recovery points.

   ![Type the name of the backup item](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/media/backup-azure-manage-vms/delete-backup-data1.png)

7. To delete the backup data for the item, select **Delete**. A notification message lets you know that the backup data has been deleted.

### Using Azure PowerShell

If items were deleted before soft-delete was disabled, then they will be in a soft-deleted state. To immediately delete them, the deletion operation needs to reversed and then performed again.

Identify the items that are in soft-deleted state.

```powershell

Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -BackupManagementType AzureVM -WorkloadType AzureVM -VaultId $myVaultID | Where-Object {$_.DeleteState -eq "ToBeDeleted"}

Name                                     ContainerType        ContainerUniqueName                      WorkloadType         ProtectionStatus     HealthStatus         DeleteState
----                                     -------------        -------------------                      ------------         ----------------     ------------         -----------
VM;iaasvmcontainerv2;selfhostrg;AppVM1    AzureVM             iaasvmcontainerv2;selfhostrg;AppVM1       AzureVM              Healthy              Passed               ToBeDeleted

$myBkpItem = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -BackupManagementType AzureVM -WorkloadType AzureVM -VaultId $myVaultID -Name AppVM1
```

Then reverse the deletion operation that was performed when soft-delete was enabled.

```powershell
Undo-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItemDeletion -Item $myBKpItem -VaultId $myVaultID -Force

WorkloadName     Operation            Status               StartTime                 EndTime                   JobID
------------     ---------            ------               ---------                 -------                   -----
AppVM1           Undelete             Completed            12/5/2019 12:47:28 PM     12/5/2019 12:47:40 PM     65311982-3755-46b5-8e53-c82ea4f0d2a2
```

Since the soft-delete is now disabled, the deletion operation will result in immediate removal of backup data.

```powershell
Disable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection -Item $myBkpItem -RemoveRecoveryPoints -VaultId $myVaultID -Force

WorkloadName     Operation            Status               StartTime                 EndTime                   JobID
------------     ---------            ------               ---------                 -------                   -----
AppVM1           DeleteBackupData     Completed            12/5/2019 12:44:15 PM     12/5/2019 12:44:50 PM     0488c3c2-accc-4a91-a1e0-fba09a67d2fb
```

### Using REST API

If items were deleted before soft-delete was disabled, then they will be in a soft-deleted state. To immediately delete them, the deletion operation needs to reversed and then performed again.

1. First, undo the delete operations with the steps mentioned [here](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-backupazurevms.md#undo-the-stop-protection-and-delete-data).
2. Then disable the soft-delete functionality using REST API using the steps mentioned [here](use-restapi-update-vault-properties.md#update-soft-delete-state-using-rest-api).
3. Then delete the backups using REST API as mentioned [here](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-backupazurevms.md#stop-protection-and-delete-data).

## Encryption

All your backed-up data is automatically encrypted when stored in the cloud using Azure Storage encryption, which helps you meet your security and compliance commitments. This data at rest is encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant.

In addition to encryption at rest, all your backup data in transit is transferred over HTTPS. It always remains on the Azure backbone network.

For more information, see [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption). Refer to the [Azure Backup FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-backup-faq#encryption) to answer any questions that you may have about encryption.

### Encryption of backup data using platform-managed keys

By default, all your data is encrypted using platform-managed keys. You don't need to take any explicit action from your end to enable this encryption and it applies to all workloads being backed up to your Recovery Services vault.

### Encryption of backup data using customer-managed keys

When backing up your Azure Virtual Machines, you can now encrypt your data using keys owned and managed by you. Azure Backup lets you use your RSA keys stored in the Azure Key Vault for encrypting your backups. The encryption key used for encrypting backups may be different from the one used for the source. The data is protected using an AES 256 based data encryption key (DEK), which is, in turn, protected using your keys. This gives you full control over the data and the keys. To allow encryption, it's required that the Recovery Services vault be granted access to the encryption key in the Azure Key Vault. You can disable the key or revoke access whenever needed. However, you must enable encryption using your keys before you attempt to protect any items to the vault.

>[!NOTE]
>This feature is currently in limited availability. Please fill out [this survey](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0H3_nezt2RNkpBCUTbWEapURE9TTDRIUEUyNFhNT1lZS1BNVDdZVllHWi4u) and email us at AskAzureBackupTeam@microsoft.com if you wish to encrypt your backup data using customer managed keys. Note that the ability to use this feature is subject to approval from the Azure Backup service.

### Backup of managed disk VMs encrypted using customer-managed keys

Azure Backup also allows you back up your Azure VMs that use your key for server-side encryption. The key used for encrypting the disks is stored in the Azure Key Vault and managed by you. Server-side encryption using customer-managed keys differs from Azure Disk Encryption, since ADE leverages BitLocker (for Windows) and DM-Crypt (for Linux) to perform in-guest encryption, SSE encrypts data in the storage service, enabling you to use any OS or images for your VMs. Refer to [Encryption of managed disks with customer managed keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disk-encryption#customer-managed-keys) for more details.

### Backup of VMs encrypted using ADE

With Azure Backup, you can also back up your Azure Virtual machines that have their OS or data disks encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption. ADE uses BitLocker for Windows VMs and DM-Crypt for Linux VMs to perform in-guest encryption. For details, see [Back up and restore encrypted virtual machines with Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-encryption).

## Private Endpoints

[!INCLUDE [Private Endpoints](../../includes/backup-private-endpoints.md)]

## Other security features

### Protection of Azure Backup recovery points

Storage accounts used by recovery services vaults are isolated and cannot be accessed by users for any malicious purposes. The access is only allowed through Azure Backup management operations, such as restore. These management operations are controlled through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

For more information, see [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage Azure Backup recovery points](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-rbac-rs-vault).

## Frequently asked questions

### For Soft delete

#### Do I need to enable the soft-delete feature on every vault?

No, it's built and enabled by default for all the recovery services vaults.

#### Can I configure the number of days for which my data will be retained in soft-deleted state after delete operation is complete?

No, it's fixed to 14 days of additional retention after the delete operation.

#### Do I need to pay the cost for this additional 14-day retention?

No, this 14-day additional retention comes for free of cost as a part of soft-delete functionality.

#### Can I perform a restore operation when my data is in soft delete state?

No, you need to undelete the soft deleted resource in order to restore. The undelete operation will bring the resource back into the **Stop protection with retain data state** where you can restore to any point in time. Garbage collector remains paused in this state.

#### Will my snapshots follow the same lifecycle as my recovery points in the vault?

Yes.

#### How can I trigger the scheduled backups again for a soft-deleted resource?

Undelete followed by resume operation will protect the resource again. Resume operation associates a backup policy to trigger the scheduled backups with the selected retention period. Also, the garbage collector runs as soon as the resume operation completes. If you wish to perform a restore from a recovery point that is past its expiry date, you're advised to do it before triggering the resume operation.

#### Can I delete my vault if there are soft deleted items in the vault?

The Recovery Services vault can't be deleted if there are backup items in soft-deleted state in the vault. The soft-deleted items are permanently deleted 14 days after the delete operation. If you can't wait for 14 days, then [disable soft delete](#disabling-soft-delete), undelete the soft deleted items, and delete them again to permanently get deleted. After ensuring there are no protected items and no soft deleted items, the vault can be deleted.  

#### Can I delete the data earlier than the 14 days soft-delete period after deletion?

No. You can't force delete the soft-deleted items, they're automatically deleted after 14 days. This security feature is enabled to safeguard the backed-up data from accidental or malicious deletes.  You should wait for 14 day before performing any other action on the VM.  Soft-deleted items won' be charged.  If you need reprotecting the VMs marked for soft-delete within 14 days to a new vault, then contact Microsoft support.

#### Can soft delete operations be performed in PowerShell or CLI?

Soft delete operations can be performed using [PowerShell](#soft-delete-for-vms-using-azure-powershell). Currently, CLI is not supported.

#### Is soft delete supported for other cloud workloads, like SQL Server in Azure VMs and SAP HANA in Azure VMs?

No. Currently soft delete is only supported for Azure virtual machines.
