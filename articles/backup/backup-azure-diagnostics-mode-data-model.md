# Log Analytics data model for Azure Backup data

Use the Log Analytics data model to create custom alerts from Log Analytics.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](../../includes/azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>
> This data model is in reference to the Azure Diagnostics Mode of sending diagnostic
> events to Log Analytics (LA). To learn the data model for the new Resource Specific Mode, you can refer to the following article: [Data Model for Azure Backup Diagnostic Events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-reports-data-model)

## Using Azure Backup data model
