# Support matrix for Azure Blobs backup (in preview)

This article summarizes the regional availability, supported scenarios, and limitations of operational backup of blobs.

## Supported regions

Operational backup for blobs is currently available in the following regions: Australia Central, Australia East, Brazil South, Canada Central, Central India, Central US, East Asia, East US, East US 2, Germany West Central, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Korea South, North Europe, South Central US, South East Asia, Switzerland North, UAE North, UK South, UK West, West Central US, West Europe, West US, West US 2

## Limitations

Operational backup of blobs uses blob point-in-time restore, blob versioning, soft delete for blobs, change feed for blobs and delete lock to provide a local backup solution. So limitations that apply to these capabilities also apply to operational backup.

**Supported scenarios:** Operational backup supports block blobs in standard general-purpose v2 storage accounts only. So ADLS Gen2 accounts aren't supported. Also, any page blobs, append blobs, and premium blobs in your storage account won't be restored and only block blobs will be restored.

**Other limitations:**

- If you've deleted a container during the retention period, that container won't be restored with the point-in-time restore operation. If you attempt to restore a range of blobs that includes blobs in a deleted container, the point-in-time restore operation will fail. For more information about protecting containers from deletion, see [Soft delete for containers (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-container-overview).
- If a blob has moved between the hot and cool tiers in the period between the present moment and the restore point, the blob is restored to its previous tier. Restoring block blobs in the archive tier isn't supported. For example, if a blob in the hot tier was moved to the archive tier two days ago, and a restore operation restores to a point three days ago, the blob isn't restored to the hot tier. To restore an archived blob, first move it out of the archive tier. For more information, see [Rehydrate blob data from the archive tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-rehydration).
- A block that has been uploaded via [Put Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/put-block) or [Put Block from URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-from-url), but not committed via [Put Block List](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list), isn't part of a blob and so isn't restored as part of a restore operation.
- A blob with an active lease can't be restored. If a blob with an active lease is included in the range of blobs to restore, the restore operation will fail automatically. Break any active leases before starting the restore operation.
- Snapshots aren't created or deleted as part of a restore operation. Only the base blob is restored to its previous state.
