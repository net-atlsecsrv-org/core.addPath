# Delete a Recovery Services vault

This article describes how to delete an [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md) Recovery Services vault. It contains instructions for removing dependencies and then deleting a vault, and deleting a vault by force.


## Before you start

Before you start, it's important to understand that you can't delete a Recovery Services vault that has servers registered in it, or that holds backup data.

- To delete a vault gracefully, you unregister servers in it, remove vault data, and then delete the vault.
- If you try to delete a vault that still has dependencies, an error message is issued. and you need to manually remove the vault dependencies, including:
    - Backed up items
    - Protected servers
    - Backup management servers (Azure Backup Server, DPM)

- If you don't want to retain any data in the Recovery Services vault, and want to delete the vault, you can delete the vault by force.
- If you try to delete a vault, but can't, the vault is still configured to receive backup data.


## Delete a vault from the Azure portal

1. Open the vault dashboard.  
2. In the dashboard, click **Delete**. Verify that you want to delete.

If you receive an error, remove [backup items](#remove-backup-items), [infrastructure servers](#remove-backup-infrastructure-servers), and [recovery points](#remove-azure-backup-agent-recovery-points), and then delete the vault.

## Delete the Recovery Services vault using Azure Resource Manager client

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

1. Install chocolatey from [here](https://chocolatey.org/) and to install ARMClient run the below command:

   ` choco install armclient --source=https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/ `
2. Login to Azure account, running the below command

    ` ARMClient.exe login [environment name] `

3. In the Azure portal, gather the subscription ID and resource group name for the vault you want to delete.

For more information on ARMClient command, refer this [document](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient/blob/master/README.md).

### Use Azure Resource Manager client to delete Recovery Services vault

1. Run the following command using your subscription ID, resource group name, and vault name. When you run the command it deletes the vault if you donâ€™t have any dependencies.

   ```
   ARMClient.exe delete /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/<recovery services vault name>?api-version=2015-03-15
   ```
2. If the vault's not empty, you receive the error "Vault cannot be deleted as there are existing resources within this vault". To remove a protected items / container within a vault, do the following:

   ```
   ARMClient.exe delete /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/<recovery services vault name>/registeredIdentities/<container name>?api-version=2016-06-01
   ```

3. In the Azure portal, verify that the vault is deleted.


## Remove vault items and delete the vault

These procedure provide some examples for removing backup data and infrastructure servers. After everything's removed from a vault, you can delete it.

### Remove backup items

This procedure provides an example that shows you how to remove backup data from Azure Files.

    ![select the backup type](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/stop-backup-item.png)


3. In **Stop Backup** > **Choose an option**, select **Delete Backup Data**.
4. Type the name of the item, and click **Stop backup**.
   - This verifies that you want to delete the item.
   - The **Stop Backup** button activates after you verify.
   - If you retain and don't delete the data, you won't be able to delete the vault.
