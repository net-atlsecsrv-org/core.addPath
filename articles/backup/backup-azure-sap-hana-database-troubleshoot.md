# Troubleshoot backup of SAP HANA databases on Azure

This article provides troubleshooting information for backing up SAP HANA databases on Azure virtual machines. For more information on the SAP HANA backup scenarios we currently support, see [Scenario support](sap-hana-backup-support-matrix.md#scenario-support).

## Prerequisites and Permissions

Refer to the [prerequisites](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#prerequisites) and [setting up permissions](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#setting-up-permissions) sections before configuring backups.

## Common user errors

### UserErrorInOpeningHanaOdbcConnection

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">Failed to connect to HANA system</span>                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | The SAP HANA instance may be down.<br/>The required permissions for Azure backup to interact with the HANA database aren't set. |
| **Recommended action** | Check if the SAP HANA database is up. If the database is up and running, check if all the required permissions are set. If any of the permissions are missing run the [preregistration script](https://aka.ms/scriptforpermsonhana) to add the missing permissions. |

### UserErrorHanaInstanceNameInvalid

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">The specified SAP HANA instance is either invalid or can't be found</span>  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | Multiple SAP HANA instances on a single Azure VM can't be backed up. |
| **Recommended action** | Run the [preregistration script](https://aka.ms/scriptforpermsonhana) on the SAP HANA instance you want to back up. If the issue still persists, contact Microsoft support. |

### UserErrorHanaUnsupportedOperation

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">The specified SAP HANA operation isn't supported</span>              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | Azure backup for SAP HANA doesn't support incremental backup and actions performed on SAP HANA native clients (Studio/ Cockpit/ DBA Cockpit) |
| **Recommended action** | For more information, refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/sap-hana-backup-support-matrix#scenario-support). |

### UserErrorHANAPODoesNotSupportBackupType

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">This SAP HANA database doesn't support the requested backup type</span>  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | Azure backup doesn't support incremental backup and backup using snapshots |
| **Recommended action** | For more information, refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/sap-hana-backup-support-matrix#scenario-support). |

### UserErrorHANALSNValidationFailure

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">Backup log chain is broken</span>                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | The log backup destination may have been updated from backint to file system or the backint executable may have been changed |
| **Recommended action** | Trigger a full backup to resolve the issue                   |

### UserErrorIncomaptibleSrcTargetSystsemsForRestore

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">The source and target systems for restore are incompatible</span>    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | The target system for restore is incompatible with the source |
| **Recommended action** | Refer to the SAP Note [1642148](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1642148) to learn about the restore types supported today |

### UserErrorSDCtoMDCUpgradeDetected

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">SDC to MDC upgrade detected</span>                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | The SAP HANA instance has been upgraded from SDC to MDC. Backups will fail after the update. |
| **Recommended action** | Follow the steps listed in the [Upgrading from SAP HANA 1.0 to 2.0 section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-sap-hana-database-troubleshoot#upgrading-from-sap-hana-10-to-20) to resolve the issue |

### UserErrorInvalidBackintConfiguration

| Error Message      | <span style="font-weight:normal">Detected invalid backint configuration</span>                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Possible causes**    | The backing parameters are incorrectly specified for Azure backup |
| **Recommended action** | Check if the following (backint) parameters are set:<br/>\* [catalog_backup_using_backint:true]<br/>\* [enable_accumulated_catalog_backup:false]<br/>\* [parallel_data_backup_backint_channels:1]<br/>\* [log_backup_timeout_s:900)]<br/>\* [backint_response_timeout:7200]<br/>If backint-based parameters are present in HOST, remove them. If parameters aren't present at HOST level but have been manually modified at a database level, revert them to the appropriate values as described earlier. Or, run [stop protection and retain backup data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/sap-hana-db-manage#stop-protection-for-an-sap-hana-database) from the Azure portal, and then select **Resume backup**. |

## Restore checks

### Single Container Database (SDC) restore

Take care of inputs while restoring a single container database (SDC) for HANA to another SDC machine. The database name should be given with lowercase and with "sdc" appended in brackets. The HANA instance will be displayed in capitals.

Assume an SDC HANA instance "H21" is backed up. The backup items page will show the backup item name as **"h21(sdc)"**. If you attempt to restore this database to another target SDC, say H11, then following inputs need to be provided.

![SDC restore inputs](media/backup-azure-sap-hana-database/hana-sdc-restore.png)

Note the following points:

- By default, the restored db name will be populated with the backup item name i.e., h21(sdc)
- Selecting the target as H11 will NOT change the restored db name automatically. **It should be edited to h11(sdc)**. Regarding SDC, the restored db name will be the target instance ID with lowercase letters and 'sdc' appended in brackets.
- Since SDC can have only single database, you also need to click the checkbox to allow override of the existing database data with the recovery point data.
- Linux is case-sensitive. Therefore, be careful to preserve the case.

### Multiple Container Database (MDC) restore

In multiple container databases for HANA, the standard configuration is SYSTEMDB + 1 or more Tenant DBs. Restoring an entire SAP HANA instance means to restore both SYSTEMDB and Tenant DBs. One restores SYSTEMDB first and then proceeds for Tenant DB. System DB essentially means to override the system information on the selected target. This restore also overrides the BackInt related information in the target instance. Therefore, after the system DB is restored to a target instance, one needs to run the pre-registration script again. Only then the subsequent tenant DB restores will succeed.

## Upgrading from SAP HANA 1.0 to 2.0

If you're protecting SAP HANA 1.0 databases and wish to upgrade to 2.0, then perform the steps outlined below:

- [Stop protection](sap-hana-db-manage.md#stop-protection-for-an-sap-hana-database) with retain data for old SDC database.
- Perform the upgrade. After completion, the HANA is now MDC with a system DB and tenant DB(s)
- Rerun [pre-registration script](https://aka.ms/scriptforpermsonhana) with correct details of (sid and mdc).
- Re-register extension for the same machine in Azure Portal (Backup -> view details -> Select the relevant Azure VM -> Re-register).
- Click Rediscover DBs for the same VM. This action should show the new DBs in step 2 with correct details (SYSTEMDB and Tenant DB, not SDC).
- Configure backup for these new databases.

## Upgrading without an SID change

Upgrades to OS or SAP HANA that don't cause a SID change can be handled as outlined below:

- [Stop protection](sap-hana-db-manage.md#stop-protection-for-an-sap-hana-database) with retain data for the database
- Perform the upgrade.
- Rerun the [pre-registration script](https://aka.ms/scriptforpermsonhana). Usually, we have seen upgrade process removes the necessary roles. Running the pre-registration script will help verify all the required roles.
- [Resume protection](sap-hana-db-manage.md#resume-protection-for-an-sap-hana-database) for the database again
