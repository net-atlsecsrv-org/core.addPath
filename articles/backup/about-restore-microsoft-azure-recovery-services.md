# About restore using the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent 

This article describes the restore options available with the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that the latest version of the [MARS agent](https://aka.ms/azurebackup_agent) is installed.
- Ensure that [network throttling](backup-windows-with-mars-agent.md#enable-network-throttling) is disabled.
- Ensure that high-speed storage with sufficient space for the [agent cache folder](/azure/backup/backup-azure-file-folder-backup-faq#manage-the-backup-cache-folder) is available.
- Monitor memory and CPU resource, and ensure that sufficient resources are available for decompressing and decrypting data.
- While using the **Instant Restore** feature to mount a recovery point as a disk, use **robocopy** with multi-threaded copy option (/MT switch) to copy files efficiently from the mounted recovery point.

## Restore options

The MARS agent offers multiple restore options. Each option provides unique benefits that makes it suitable for certain scenarios.

Using the MARS agent you can:

- **[Restore Windows Server System State Backup](backup-azure-restore-system-state.md):** This option helps restore the System State as files from a recovery point in Azure Backup, and apply those to the Windows Server using the Windows Server Backup utility.  
- **[Restore all backed up files in a volume](restore-all-files-volume-mars.md):** This option recovers all backed up data in a specified volume from the recovery point in Azure Backup. It allows a faster transfer speed (up to 40 MBPS).<br>We recommend you to use this option for recovering large amounts of data, or entire volumes.
- **[Restore a specific set of backed up files and folders in a volume using PowerShell](backup-client-automation.md#restore-data-from-azure-backup):** If the paths to the files and folders relative to the volume root are known, this option allows you to restore the specified set of files and folders from a recovery point, using the faster transfer speed of the full volume restore. However, this option doesnâ€™t provide the convenience of browsing files and folders in the recovery point using the Instant Restore option.
- **[Restore individual files and folders using Instant Restore](backup-azure-restore-windows-server.md):** This option allows quick access to the backup data by mounting volume in the recovery point as a drive. You can then browse, and copy files and folders. This option offers a copy speed of up to 6 MBPS, which is suitable for recovering individual files and folders of total size less than 80 GB. Once the required files are copied, you can unmount the recovery point.
