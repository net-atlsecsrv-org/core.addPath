# Support matrix for backup of SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs

Azure Backup supports the backup of SAP HANA databases to Azure. This article summarizes the scenarios supported and limitations present when you use Azure Backup to back up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs.

## Onboard to the public preview

Onboard to the public preview as follows:

* In the portal, register your subscription ID to the Recovery Services service provider by [following this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-register-provider-errors#solution-3---azure-portal).
* For PowerShell, run this cmdlet. It should complete as "Registered".

```PowerShell
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "HanaBackup" –ProviderNamespace Microsoft.RecoveryServices
```

> [!NOTE]
> The frequency of log backup can now be set to a minimum of 15 minutes. Log backups only begin to flow after a successful full backup for the database has completed.
