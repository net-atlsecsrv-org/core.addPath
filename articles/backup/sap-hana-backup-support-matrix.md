# Support matrix for backup of SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs

Azure Backup supports the backup of SAP HANA databases to Azure. This article summarizes the scenarios supported and limitations present when you use Azure Backup to back up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs.

> [!NOTE]
> The frequency of log backup can now be set to a minimum of 15 minutes. Log backups only begin to flow after a successful full backup for the database has completed.

## Scenario support

| **Scenario**               | **Supported  configurations**                                | **Unsupported  configurations**                              |

| **HANA versions**          | SDC on HANA 1.x, MDC on HANA 2.x <= SPS04 Rev 48, SPS05 (yet to be validated for encryption enabled scenarios)      |                                                            |
| **HANA deployments**       | SAP HANA on a single Azure VM -  Scale up only. <br><br> For high availability deployments, both the nodes on the two different machines are treated as individual nodes with separate data chains.               | Scale-out <br><br> In high availability deployments, backup doesn’t failover to the secondary node automatically. Configuring backup should be done separately for each node.                                           |
| **HANA Instances**         | A single SAP HANA instance on a  single Azure VM – scale up only | Multiple SAP HANA instances on a  single VM                  |

| **HANA database size**     | HANA databases of size <= 2 TB  (this is not the memory size of the HANA system)               |                                                              |

| **Restore types**          | Refer to the SAP HANA Note [1642148](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1642148) to learn about the supported restore types |                                                              |
| **Backup limits**          | Up to 2 TB of full backup size per SAP HANA instance         |                                                              |

>[!NOTE]
>Azure Backup doesn’t automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes when backing up a SAP HANA database running in an Azure VM.
>
>Modify the policy manually as needed.


> [!NOTE]
> You can now [monitor the backup and restore](./sap-hana-db-manage.md#monitor-manual-backup-jobs-in-the-portal) (to the same machine) jobs triggered from HANA native clients (SAP HANA Studio/ Cockpit/ DBA Cockpit) in the Azure portal.
