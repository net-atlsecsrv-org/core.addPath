# Troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agent

Here's how to resolve errors you might see during configuration, registration, backup, and restore.

## Basic troubleshooting

We recommend you perform the below validation, before you start troubleshooting Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent:

- [Ensure Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agent is up to date](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=229525&clcid=0x409)
- [Ensure there is network connectivity between MARS agent and Azure](https://aka.ms/AB-A4dp50)
- Ensure Microsoft Azure Recovery Services is running (in Service console). If required restart and retry the operation
- [Ensure 5-10% free volume space is available on scratch folder location](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwtt)
- [Check if another process or antivirus software is interfering with Azure Backup](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwtk)
- [Scheduled backup fails, but manual backup works](https://aka.ms/ScheduledBackupFailManualWorks)
- Ensure your OS has the latest updates
- [Ensure unsupported drives and files with unsupported attributes are excluded from backup](backup-support-matrix-mars-agent.md#supported-drives-or-volumes-for-backup)
- Ensure **System Clock** on the protected system is configured to correct time zone <br>
- [Ensure that the server has at least .Net Framework version 4.5.2 and higher](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653)<br>
- If you are trying to **reregister your server** to a vault, then: <br>
  - Ensure the agent is uninstalled on the server and it is deleted from portal <br>
  - Use the same passphrase that was initially used for registering the server <br>
- In case of offline backup ensure that Azure PowerShell version 3.7.0 is installed on both source and copy computer before you begin offline backup operation
- [Consideration when Backup agent is running on an Azure virtual machine](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwtr)

## Invalid vault credentials provided

## Backups don't run according to the schedule
If scheduled backups don't get triggered automatically, while manual backups work without issues, try the following actions:

- Ensure Windows Server backup schedule does not conflict with Azure files and folders backup schedule.

- Ensure the  Online Backup status is set to **Enable**. To verify the status perform the below:

  - Open **Task Scheduler** and expand **Microsoft**, and select **Online Backup**.
  - Double-click **Microsoft-OnlineBackup**, and go to the **Triggers** tab.
  - Verify if the status is set to **Enabled**. If it isn't, then select **Edit** > **Enabled** check box and click **OK**.

- Ensure the user account selected for running the task is either **SYSTEM** or **Local Administrators' group** on the server. To verify the user account, go to the **General** tab and check the **Security** options.

- Ensure PowerShell 3.0 or later is installed on the server. To check the PowerShell version, run the following command and verify that the *Major* version number is equal to or greater than 3.

  `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`

- Ensure the following path is part of the *PSMODULEPATH* environment variable

  `<MARS agent installation path>\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\Modules\MSOnlineBackup`

- If the PowerShell execution policy for *LocalMachine* is set to restricted, the PowerShell cmdlet that triggers the backup task might fail. Run the following commands in elevated mode, to check and set the execution policy to either *Unrestricted* or *RemoteSigned*

  `PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`

  `PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

- Ensure there are no missing or corrupted **PowerShell** module **MSonlineBackup**. In case there are any missing or corrupt file, to resolve this issue perform the below:

  - From any machine having MARS agent that is working properly, copy the MSOnlineBackup folder from *(C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\Modules)* path.
  - Paste this in problematic machine in the same path *(C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\Modules)*.
  - If **MSOnlineBackup** folder is already exists in the machine, paste or replace the content files inside it.


> [!TIP]
> To ensure that changes are applied consistently, reboot the server after performing the steps above.


## Troubleshoot restore issues

Azure Backup might not successfully mount the recovery volume, even after several minutes. You might also receive error messages during the process. To begin recovering normally, follow these steps:

1.  Cancel the ongoing mount process, in case it has been running for several minutes.

2.  See if you're on the latest version of the Backup Agent. To find out the version, on the **Actions** pane of the MARS console, select **About Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent**. Confirm that the **Version** number is equal to or higher than the version mentioned in [this article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=229525). You can download the latest version from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=288905).

3.  Go to **Device Manager** > **Storage Controllers**, and locate **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator**. If you can locate it, go directly to step 7.

4.  If you can't locate Microsoft iSCSI Initiator service, try to find an entry under **Device Manager** > **Storage Controllers** called **Unknown Device**, with Hardware ID **ROOT\ISCSIPRT**.

5.  Right-click on **Unknown Device**, and select **Update Driver Software**.

6.	Update the driver by selecting the option to  **Search automatically for updated driver software**. Completion of the update should change **Unknown Device** to **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator**, as shown below.

7.  Go to **Task Manager** > **Services (Local)** > **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure Backup Task Manager, with Services (Local) highlighted](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/MicrosoftInitiatorServiceRunning.png)

8.  Restart the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator service. To do this, right-click on the service, select **Stop**, right-click again, and select **Start**.

9.  Retry recovery by using [**Instant Restore**](backup-instant-restore-capability.md).

If the recovery still fails, reboot your server or client. If you don't want to reboot, or the recovery still fails even after rebooting the server, try recovering from an alternate machine. Follow the steps in [this article](backup-azure-restore-windows-server.md#use-instant-restore-to-restore-data-to-an-alternate-machine).
