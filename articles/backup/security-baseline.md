**Guidance**: Not applicable; this recommendation is intended for resources being backed up and not Azure Backup itself.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer managed keys

**Guidance**: Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times (it creates three copies of your data) in a storage scale unit in a datacenter. All copies of the data exist within the same region. LRS is a low-cost option for protecting your data from local hardware failures.Geo-redundant storage (GRS) is the default and recommended replication option. GRS replicates your data to a secondary region (hundreds of miles away from the primary location of the source data). GRS costs more than LRS, but GRS provides a higher level of durability for your data, even if there's a regional outage.

Backup customer managed keys within Azure Key Vault.
