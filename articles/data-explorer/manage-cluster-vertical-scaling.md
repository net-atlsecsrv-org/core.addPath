# Manage cluster scale-up to accommodate changing demand

There are two workflows for scaling an Azure Data Explorer cluster:
1. [Horizontal scaling](manage-cluster-horizontal-scaling.md), also called scaling out and in.
2. Vertical scaling, also called scaling up and down.

This article shows how to manage cluster vertical scaling.

Sizing a cluster appropriately is critical to the performance of Azure Data Explorer. But demand on a cluster canâ€™t be predicted with absolute accuracy. A static cluster size can lead to underutilization or overutilization, neither of which is ideal. A better approach is to *scale* a cluster, adding and removing capacity and CPU resources with changing demand. 

## Steps to configure vertical scaling

1. Go to your cluster. Under **Settings**, select **Scale up**.

    You're shown a list of available SKUs. For example, in the following figure, only four SKUs are available.

    ![Scale up](media/manage-cluster-vertical-scaling/scale-up.png)

    SKUs are disabled because either they're the current SKU, or they aren't available in the region where the cluster is located.

1. To change your SKU, select the SKU you want and choose the **Select** button.

> [!NOTE]
> The vertical scaling process can take a few minutes, and during that time your cluster will be suspended. Note that scaling down can harm your cluster performance.

You've now done a scale-up or scale-down operation for your Azure Data Explorer cluster.

## Next steps

* [Manage cluster horizontal scaling](manage-cluster-horizontal-scaling.md) to dynamically scale out the instance count based on metrics that you specify.

* Monitor your resource usage by following this article: [Monitor Azure Data Explorer performance, health, and usage with metrics](using-metrics.md).
