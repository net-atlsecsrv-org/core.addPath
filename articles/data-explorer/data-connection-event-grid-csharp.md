Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion (data loading) from Event Hubs, IoT Hubs, and blobs written to blob containers. In this article, you create an Event Grid data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using C#.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Create [a cluster and database](create-cluster-database-csharp.md)
* Create [table and column mapping](net-standard-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-test-cluster)
* Set [database and table policies](database-table-policies-csharp.md) (optional)
* Create a [storage account with an Event Grid subscription](ingest-data-event-grid.md#create-an-event-grid-subscription-in-your-storage-account).

## Add an Event Grid data connection

The following example shows you how to add an Event Grid data connection programmatically. See [create an Event Grid data connection in Azure Data Explorer](ingest-data-event-grid.md#create-an-event-grid-data-connection-in-azure-data-explorer) for adding an Event Grid data connection using the Azure portal.

```csharp
var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Directory (tenant) ID
var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Application ID
var clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//Client Secret
var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}");
var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
var result = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource: "https://management.core.windows.net/", clientCredential: credential);

var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.AccessTokenType);

var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
{
    SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
};

var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
//The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
var databaseName = "mykustodatabase";
var dataConnectionName = "myeventhubconnect";
//The event hub and storage account that are created as part of the Prerequisites
var eventHubResourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/xxxxxx/eventhubs/xxxxxx";
var storageAccountResourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxx";
var consumerGroup = "$Default";
var location = "Central US";
//The table and column mapping are created as part of the Prerequisites
var tableName = "StormEvents";
var mappingRuleName = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping";
var dataFormat = DataFormat.CSV;

await kustoManagementClient.DataConnections.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, clusterName, databaseName, dataConnectionName,
    new EventGridDataConnection(storageAccountResourceId, eventHubResourceId, consumerGroup, tableName: tableName, location: location, mappingRuleName: mappingRuleName, dataFormat: dataFormat));
```

|**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
|---|---|---|
| tenantId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | Your tenant ID. Also known as directory ID.|
| subscriptionId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The subscription ID that you use for resource creation.|
| clientId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The client ID of the application that can access resources in your tenant.|
| clientSecret | *xxxxxxxxxxxxxx* | The client secret of the application that can access resources in your tenant. |
| resourceGroupName | *testrg* | The name of the resource group containing your cluster.|
| clusterName | *mykustocluster* | The name of your cluster.|
| databaseName | *mykustodatabase* | The name of the target database in your cluster.|
| dataConnectionName | *myeventhubconnect* | The desired name of your data connection.|
| tableName | *StormEvents* | The name of the target table in the target database.|
| mappingRuleName | *StormEvents_CSV_Mapping* | The name of your column mapping related to the target table.|
| dataFormat | *csv* | The data format of the message.|
| eventHubResourceId | *Resource ID* | The resource ID of your Event Hub where the Event Grid is configured to send events. |
| storageAccountResourceId | *Resource ID* | The resource ID of your storage account that holds the data for ingestion. |
| consumerGroup | *$Default* | The consumer group of your Event Hub.|
| location | *Central US* | The location of the data connection resource.|

## Generate sample data

Now that Azure Data Explorer and the storage account are connected, you can create sample data and upload it to the blob storage.

This script creates a new container in your storage account, uploads an existing file (as a blob) to that container, and then lists the blobs in the container.

```csharp
var azureStorageAccountConnectionString=<storage_account_connection_string>;

var containerName=<container_name>;
var blobName=<blob_name>;
var localFileName=<file_to_upload>;

// Creating the container
var azureStorageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(azureStorageAccountConnectionString);
var blobClient = azureStorageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
var container = blobClient.GetContainerReference(containerName);
container.CreateIfNotExists();

// Set metadata and upload file to blob
var blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(blobName);
blob.Metadata.Add("rawSizeBytes", "4096‬"); // the uncompressed size is 4096 bytes
blob.Metadata.Add("kustoIngestionMappingReference", "mapping_v2‬");
blob.UploadFromFile(localFileName);

// List blobs
var blobs = container.ListBlobs();
```

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Data Explorer won't delete the blobs post ingestion. Retain the blobs for three to five days by using [Azure Blob storage lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal) to manage blob deletion.
