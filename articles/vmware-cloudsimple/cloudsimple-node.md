# CloudSimple nodes overview

A node is:

* A dedicated bare metal compute host where VMware ESXi hypervisor is installed  
* A unit of computing you can provision or reserve to create private clouds  
* Available to provision or reserve in a region where the CloudSimple service is available

Nodes are building blocks of a private cloud.  To create a private cloud, you need a minimum of three nodes of the same SKU.  To expand a private cloud, add additional nodes.  You can add nodes to an existing cluster. Or, you can create a new cluster by provisioning nodes in the Azure portal, and associating them with the CloudSimple service.  All nodes provisioned are visible under the CloudSimple service.  You create a private cloud from the provisioned nodes on CloudSimple Portal.

## Provisioned nodes

Provisioned nodes provide pay-as-you-go capacity. Provisioning nodes helps you quickly scale your VMware cluster on demand. You can add nodes as needed, or delete a provisioned node to scale down your VMware cluster. provisioned nodes are billed on a monthly basis, and charged to the subscription where they're provisioned:

* If you pay for your Azure subscription by credit card, the card is billed immediately.
* If you're billed by invoice, the charges appear on your next invoice.
