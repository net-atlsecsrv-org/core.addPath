# CloudSimple nodes overview

Nodes are the building blocks of a Private Cloud. A node is:

* A dedicated bare metal compute host where a VMware ESXi hypervisor is installed  
* A unit of computing you can purchase or reserve to create Private Clouds
* Available to purchase or reserve in a region where the CloudSimple service is available

You create a Private Cloud from the purchased nodes. To create a Private Cloud, you need a minimum of three nodes of the same SKU. To expand a Private Cloud, add additional nodes.  You can add nodes to an existing cluster or create a new cluster by purchasing nodes in the Azure portal and associating them with the CloudSimple service.  All purchased nodes are visible under the CloudSimple service.  

## Purchased nodes

Purchased nodes provide pay-as-you-go capacity. Purchasing nodes helps you quickly scale your VMware cluster on demand. You can add nodes as needed or delete a purchased node to scale down your VMware cluster. Purchased nodes are billed on a monthly basis and charged to the subscription where they're purchased.

* If you pay for your Azure subscription by credit card, the card is billed immediately.
* If you're billed by invoice, the charges appear on your next invoice.
