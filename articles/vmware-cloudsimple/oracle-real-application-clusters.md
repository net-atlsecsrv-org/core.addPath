# Optimize your CloudSimple Private Cloud for installing Oracle RAC

You can deploy Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) in your CloudSimple Private Cloud environment. This guide describes how to deploy a new cluster and to optimize a VM for the Oracle RAC solution. After completing the steps in this topic, you can install and configure Oracle RAC.

## Storage Policy

Successful implementation of Oracle RAC requires an adequate number of nodes in the cluster.  In vSAN storage policy, failures to tolerate (FTT) is applied to data disks used for storing the database, log, and redo disks.  The required number of nodes to effectively tolerate failures is 2N+1 where N is the value of FTT.

Example: If the desired FTT is 2, then the total number of nodes in the cluster must be 2*2+1 = 5.

## Overview of deployment

The following sections describe how to set up your CloudSimple Private Cloud environment for Oracle RAC.

1. Best practices for disk configuration
2. Deploy CloudSimple Private Cloud vSphere Cluster
3. Set up Networking for Oracle RAC
4. Setup vSAN storage policies
5. Create Oracle VMs and create shared VM disks
6. Set up VM-to-host affinity rules

## Best practices for disk configuration

Oracle RAC virtual machines have multiple disks, which are used for specific function.  Shared disks are mounted on all virtual machines, which are used by Oracle RAC Cluster.  Operating system and software installation disks are mounted only on the individual virtual machines.

## Deploy CloudSimple Private Cloud vSphere cluster

To deploy a vSphere cluster on your Private Cloud, follow this process:

1. From the CloudSimple portal, [create a Private Cloud](create-private-cloud.md). CloudSimple creates a default vCenter user named 'cloudowner' in the newly created Private Cloud. For details on the default Private Cloud user and permission model, see [Learn the Private Cloud permission model](learn-private-cloud-permissions.md).  This step creates the primary management cluster for your Private Cloud.

2. From the CloudSimple portal, [expand the Private Cloud](expand-private-cloud.md) with a new cluster.  This cluster will be used to deploy Oracle RAC.  Select the number of nodes based on the desired fault tolerance (minimum three nodes).

## Set up networking for Oracle RAC

1. In your Private Cloud, [create two VLANs](create-vlan-subnet.md), one for the Oracle public network and one for the Oracle private network and assign appropriate subnet CIDRs.
2. After the VLANs are created, create the [distributed port groups on the Private Cloud vCenter](create-vlan-subnet.md#use-vlan-information-to-set-up-a-distributed-port-group-in-vsphere).
3. Set up a [DHCP and DNS server virtual machine](dns-dhcp-setup.md) on your management cluster for the Oracle environment.
4. [Configure DNS forwarding on the DNS server](on-premises-dns-setup.md#create-a-conditional-forwarder) installed in the Private Cloud.

## Set up vSAN storage policies

vSAN policies define the failures to tolerate and disk striping for the data stored on the VM disks.  The storage policy created must be applied on the VM disks while creating the VM.

1. [Sign in to the vSphere client](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vmware-cloudsimple/vcenter-access) of your Private Cloud.
2. From the top menu, select **Policies and Profiles**.
3. From the left menu, select **VM Storage Policies** and then select **Create a VM storage Policy**.
4. Enter a meaningful name for the policy and click **NEXT**.
5. In the **Policy structure** section, select **Enable rules for vSAN storage** and click **NEXT**.
6. In the **vSAN** > **Availability** section, select **None** for Site disaster tolerance. For Failures to tolerate, select the **RAID - Mirroring** option for the desired FTT.
    ![vSAN settings](media/oracle-rac-storage-wizard-vsan.png).
7. In the **Advanced** section, select the number of disk stripes per object. For Object space reservation, select **Thick Provisioned**. Select **Disable object checksum**. Click **NEXT**.
8. Follow the on-screen instructions to view the list of compatible vSAN datastores, review the settings, and finish the setup.

## Create Oracle VMs and create shared VM disks for Oracle

To create a VM for Oracle, clone an existing VM or create a new one.  This section describes how to create a new VM and then clone it to create a second one after installing the base operating system.  After the VMs are created, you can create an add disks to them.  Oracle cluster uses shared disks for storing, data, logs, and redo logs.

### Create VMs

1. In vCenter, click the **Hosts and Clusters** icon. Select the cluster that you created for Oracle.
2. Right-click the cluster and select **New Virtual Machine**.
3. Select **Create new virtual machine** and click **Next**.
4. Name the machine, select the Oracle VM's location, and click **Next**.
5. Select the cluster resource and click **Next**.
6. Select the vSAN datastore for the cluster and click **Next**.
7. Keep the default ESXi 6.5 compatibility selection and click **Next**.
8. Select the guest OS of the ISO for the VM that you are creating and click **Next**.
9. Select the hard disk size that is required for installing the OS.
10. To install the application on a different device, click **Add new device**.
11. Select network options and assign the distributed port group created for the public network.
12. To add additional network interfaces, click **Add new device** and select the distributed port group created for the private network.
13. For New DC/DVD Drive, select the datastore ISO file that contains the ISO for the preferred operating system installation. Select the file you previously uploaded to the ISOs and Templates folder and click **OK**.
14. Review the settings and click **OK** to create the new VM.
15. Power on the VM. Install the operating system and any updates required

After the operating system is installed, you can clone a second VM. Right-click the VM entry and select the and clone option.

### Create shared disks for VMs

Oracle uses shared disk to store the data, log, and redo log files.  You can create a shared disk on vCenter and mount it on both the VMs.  For higher performance, place the data disks on different SCSI controllers  Steps below show how to create a shared disk on vCenter and then attach it to a virtual machine. vCenter Flash client is used for modifying the VM properties.

#### Create disks on the first VM

1. In vCenter, right-click one of the Oracle VMs and select **Edit settings**.
2. In the new device section, select **SCSI controller** and click **Add**.
3. In the new device section, select **New Hard disk** and click **Add**.
4. Expand the properties of New Hard disk.
5. Specify the size of the hard disk.
6. Specify the VM storage policy to be the vSAN storage policy that you defined earlier.
7. Select the location as a folder on vSAN datastore. The location helps with browsing and attaching the disks to a second VM.
8. For disk provisioning, select **Thick provision eager zeroed**.
9. For sharing, specify **Multi-writer**.
10. For the virtual device node, select the new SCSI controller that was created in step 2.

    ![Create disks on first VM](media/oracle-rac-new-hard-disk.png)

Repeat steps 2 – 10 for all the new disks required for the Oracle data, logs, and redo log files.

#### Attach disks to second VM

1. In vCenter, right-click one of the Oracle VMs and select **Edit settings**.
2. In the new device section, select **SCSI controller** and click **Add**.
3. In the new device section, select **Existing Hard disk** and click **Add**.
4. Browse to the location where the disk was created for the first VM and select the VMDK file.
5. Specify the VM storage policy to be the vSAN storage policy that you defined earlier.
6. For disk provisioning, select **Thick provision eager zeroed**.
7. For sharing, specify **Multi-writer**.
8. For the virtual device node, select the new SCSI controller that was created in step 2.

    ![Create disks on first VM](media/oracle-rac-existing-hard-disk.png)

Repeat steps 2 – 7 for all the new disks required for the Oracle data, logs, and redo log files.

## Set up VM host affinity rules

VM-to-host affinity rules ensure that the VM runs on the desired host.  You can define rules on vCenter to ensure the Oracle VM runs on the host with adequate resources and to meet any specific licensing requirements.

1. In the CloudSimple portal, [escalate the privileges](escalate-private-cloud-privileges.md) of the cloudowner user.
2. [Log in to the vSphere client](https://docs.azure.cloudsimple.com/vsphere-access) of your Private Cloud.
3. In the vSphere client, select the cluster where Oracle VMs are deployed and click **Configure**.
4. Under Configure, select **VM/Host Groups**.
5. Click **+**.
6. Add a VM group. Select **VM group** as the type. Enter the name of the group. Select the VMs and then click **OK** to create the group.
6. Add a host group. Select **Host Group** as the type. Enter the name of the group. Select the hosts where the VMs will run and then click **OK** to create the group.
7. To create a rule, click on **VM/Host rules**.
8. Click **+**.
9. Enter a name for the rule and check **Enable**.
10. For the rule type, select **Virtual Machines to Host**.
11. Select the VM group that contains the Oracle VMs.
12. Select **Must run on hosts in this group**.
13. Select the host group that you created.
14. Click **OK** to create the rule.
