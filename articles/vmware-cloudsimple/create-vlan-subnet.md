# Create and manage VLANs/subnets for your Private Clouds

2. Select **VLANs/subnets**.
3. Click **Create VLAN/Subnet**.

4. Select the Private Cloud for the new VLAN/subnet.
5. Enter a VLAN ID.
6. Enter the subnet name.
7. To enable routing on the VLAN (subnet), specify the subnet CIDR range. Make sure that the CIDR range doesn't overlap with any of your on-premises subnets, Azure subnets, or gateway subnet.
8. Click **Submit**.

## Use VLAN information to set up a distributed port group in vSphere

To create a distributed port group in vSphere, follow the instructions in the VMware topic 'Add a distributed port group' in the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-65-networking-guide.pdf" target="_blank">vSphere Networking Guide</a>. When setting up the distributed port group, provide the VLAN information from the CloudSimple configuration.

Firewall tables and associated rules are defined on the **Network > Firewall tables** page. To select the firewall table to apply to the VLAN/subnet for a Private Cloud, select the VLAN/subnet click **Firewall table attachment** on the **VLANs/Subnets** page. See [Firewall Tables](firewall.md) for instructions on setting up firewall tables and defining rules.
