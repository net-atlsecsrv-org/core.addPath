# Set up CloudSimple Private Cloud as a disaster recovery site for on-premises VMware workloads

Your CloudSimple Private Cloud can be set up as a recovery site for on-premises applications to provide business continuity in case of a disaster. The recovery solution is based on Zerto Virtual Replication as the replication and orchestration platform. Critical infrastructure and application virtual machines can be replicated continuously from your on-premises vCenter to your Private Cloud. You can use your Private Cloud for failover testing and to ensure the availability of your application during a disaster. A similar approach can be followed to set up the Private Cloud as a primary site that is protected by a recovery site at a different location.

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the Zerto document [Sizing Considerations For Zerto Virtual Replication](https://s3.amazonaws.com/zertodownload_docs/5.5U3/Zerto%20Virtual%20Replication%20Sizing.pdf) for guidelines on sizing your disaster recovery environment.

The CloudSimple solution:

* Eliminates the need to set up a datacenter specifically for disaster recovery (DR).
* Allows you to leverage the Azure locations where CloudSimple is deployed for worldwide geographic resilience.
* Gives you an option to reduce deployment costs and total cost of ownership for DR.

The solution requires you to:

* Install, configure, and manage Zerto in your Private Cloud.
* Provide your own licenses for Zerto when the Private Cloud is the protected site. You can pair Zerto running on the CloudSimple site with your on-premises site for licensing.

The following figure shows the architecture for the Zerto solution.

## How to deploy the solution

The following sections describe how to deploy a DR solution using Zerto Virtual Replication in your Private Cloud.

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
2. [Optional configuration on CloudSimple Private Cloud](#optional-configuration-on-your-private-cloud)
3. [Set up ZVM and VRA on CloudSimple Private Cloud](#set-up-zvm-and-vra-on-your-private-cloud)
4. [Set up Zerto Virtual Protection Group](#set-up-zerto-virtual-protection-group)

### Prerequisites

To enable Zerto Virtual Replication from your on-premises environment to your Private Cloud, complete the following prerequisites.

1. [Set up a Site-to-Site VPN connection between your on-premises network and your CloudSimple Private Cloud](set-up-vpn.md).
2. [Set up DNS lookup so that your Private Cloud management components are forwarded to Private Cloud DNS servers](on-premises-dns-setup.md).  To enable forwarding of DNS lookup, create a forwarding zone entry in your on-premises DNS server for `*.cloudsimple.io` to CloudSimple DNS servers.
3. Set up DNS lookup so that on-premises vCenter components are forwarded to on-premises DNS servers.  The DNS servers must be reachable from your CloudSimple Private Cloud over Site-to-Site VPN. For assistance, submit a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest), providing the following information.  

    * On-premises DNS domain name
    * On-premises DNS server IP addresses

4. Install a Windows server on your Private Cloud. The server is used to install Zerto Virtual Manager.
5. [Escalate your CloudSimple privileges](escalate-private-cloud-privileges.md).
6. Create a new user on your Private Cloud vCenter with the administrative role to use as the service account for Zerto Virtual Manager.

### Optional configuration on your Private Cloud

1. Create one or more resource pools on your Private Cloud vCenter to use as target resource pools for VMs from your on-premises environment.
2. Create one or more folders on your Private Cloud vCenter to use as target folders for VMs from your on-premises environment.
3. Create VLANs for failover network and set up firewall rules. Open a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) for assistance.
4. Create distributed port groups for failover network and test network for testing failover of VMs.
5. Install [DHCP and DNS servers](dns-dhcp-setup.md) or use an Active Directory domain controller in your Private Cloud environment.

### Set up ZVM and VRA on your Private Cloud

1. Install Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) on the Windows server in your Private Cloud.
2. Sign in to ZVM using the service account created in previous steps.
3. Set up licensing for Zerto Virtual Manager.
4. Install Zerto Virtual Replication Appliance (VRA) on the ESXi hosts of your Private Cloud.
5. Pair your Private Cloud ZVM with your on-premises ZVM.

### Set up Zerto Virtual Protection Group

1. Create a new Virtual Protection Group (VPG) and specify the priority for the VPG.
2. Select the virtual machines that require protection for business continuity and customize the boot order if needed.
3. Select the recovery site as your Private Cloud and the default recovery server as the Private Cloud cluster or the resource group you created. Select **vsanDatastore** for the recovery datastore on your Private Cloud.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can customize the host option for individual VMs under the VM Settings option.

4. Customize storage options as required.
5. Specify the recovery networks to use for failover network and failover test network as the distributed port groups created earlier and customize the recovery scripts as required.
6. Customize the network settings for individual VMs if necessary and create the VPG.
7. Test failover once the replication completes.
