# Shrink a CloudSimple Private Cloud

CloudSimple provides the flexibility to dynamically shrink a Private Cloud.  A Private Cloud consists of one or more vSphere clusters. Each cluster can have 3 to 16 nodes. When shrinking a Private Cloud, you remove a node from the existing cluster or delete an entire cluster. 

## Before you begin

Following conditions must be met for shrink of a Private Cloud.  Management cluster (first cluster) created when a Private Cloud was created cannot be deleted.

* A vSphere cluster must have three nodes.  A cluster with only three nodes cannot be shrunk.
* Total storage consumed should not exceed the total capacity after shrink of the cluster. 

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

6. Select **Remove one node** or **Delete the whole cluster**. 

7. Verify the cluster capacity

8. Click **Submit** to shrink the Private Cloud.
