# Activity management overview

CloudSimple tracks all activities that can affect the functioning of your private clouds. These activities including alerts, events, tasks, and audit activity. The [Activity pages](https://docs.azure.cloudsimple.com/activity/) summarize all the current activity and allow you to drill down for additional details.

## Events

Events track user and system activity on the CloudSimple portal.  Events show the activity associated with a specific resource and the severity of the impact.  You can view the events from the CloudSimple portal.

## Alerts

Alerts are notifications of any significant activity on your CloudSimple environment.  Events, which impact billing or user access, are shown as alerts.  You can acknowledge the raised alerts from the CloudSimple portal.

## Tasks

Tasks track any user operation, which takes more than 30 seconds to complete.  You can monitor the progress of a task from the CloudSimple portal.  Completed tasks show the total time taken for the task to complete.

## Audit

Audit logs track operations the user performed.  The logs contain the parameters that the user provided for the operation.  You can use audit logs to monitor user activity for all users.
