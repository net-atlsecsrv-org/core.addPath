# Set up DNS and DHCP applications and workloads in your CloudSimple Private Cloud

Applications and workloads running in a Private Cloud environment require name resolution and DHCP services for lookup and IP address assignment.  A proper DHCP and DNS infrastructure is required to provide these services.  You can configure a virtual machine to provide these services in your Private Cloud environment.  

## Prerequisites

* A distributed port group with VLAN configured
* Route setup to on-premises or Internet-based DNS servers
* Virtual machine template or ISO to create a virtual machine

## Linux-based DNS server setup

Linux offers various packages for setting up DNS servers.  Here is an [example setup from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-bind-as-a-private-network-dns-server-on-centos-7) with instructions for setting up an open-source BIND DNS server.

## Windows-based setup

These Microsoft topics describe how to set up a Windows server as a DNS server and as a DHCP server.
