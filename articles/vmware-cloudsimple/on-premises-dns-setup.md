# Configure DNS for name resolution for Private Cloud vCenter access from on-premises workstations

To access the vCenter server on a CloudSimple Private Cloud from on-premises workstations, you must configure DNS address resolution so the vCenter server can be addressed by hostname as well as by IP address.

## Obtain the IP address of the DNS server for your Private Cloud

1. Sign in to the [CloudSimple portal](access-cloudsimple-portal.md).

2. Navigate to **Resources** > **Private Clouds** and select the Private Cloud you want to connect to.

3. On the **Summary** page of the Private Cloud under **Basic Info**, copy the Private Cloud DNS server IP address.

Use either of these options for the DNS configuration.

* [Create a zone on the DNS server for *.cloudsimple.io](#create-a-zone-on-a-microsoft-windows-dns-server)
* [Create a conditional forwarder on your on-premises DNS server to resolve *.cloudsimple.io](#create-a-conditional-forwarder)

## Create a zone on the DNS server for *.cloudsimple.io

You can set up a zone up as a stub zone and point to the DNS servers on the Private
Cloud for name resolution. This section provides information on using a BIND DNS server or a Microsoft Windows DNS server.

### Create a zone on a BIND DNS server

The specific file and parameters to configure can vary based on your individual
DNS setup.

For example, for the default BIND server configuration, edit
/etc/named.conf file on your DNS server and add the following zone information.

```
zone “cloudsimple.io”
{
    type stub;
    masters { IP address of DNS servers; };
    file “slaves/cloudsimple.io.db”;
};
```

### Create a zone on a Microsoft Windows DNS server

1. Right-click the DNS server and select **New Zone**.

2. Select **Stub Zone** and click **Next**.

3. Select the appropriate option depending on your environment and click **Next**.

4. Select **Forward lookup zone** and click **Next**.

5. Enter the zone name and click **Next**.

6. Enter the IP addresses of the DNS servers for your Private Cloud that you obtained
from the CloudSimple portal.

7. Click **Next** as needed to complete the wizard setup.

## Create a conditional forwarder

A conditional forwarder forwards all DNS name resolution requests to the designated server. With this setup, any request to *.cloudsimple.io is forwarded to the DNS servers located on the Private Cloud. The following examples show how to set up
forwarders on different types of DNS servers.

### Create a conditional forwarded on a BIND DNS server

The specific file and parameters to configure can vary based on your individual DNS setup.

For example, for the default BIND server configuration, edit
/etc/named.conf file on your DNS server and add the following conditional forwarding
information.

```
zone “cloudsimple.io” {
    type forward;
    forwarders { IP address of DNS servers; };
};
```

### Create a conditional forwarder on a Microsoft Windows DNS server

1. Open the DNS Manager on the DNS server.
2. Right-click **Conditional Forwarders** and select the option to add a new conditional forwarder.

3. Enter the DNS domain and the IP address of the DNS servers in the Private Cloud, and click **OK**.
