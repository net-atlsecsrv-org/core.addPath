# Enable CloudSimple Private Cloud DNS servers to forward DNS lookup of on-premises resources to your DNS servers

Private Cloud DNS servers can forward DNS lookup for any on-premises resources to your DNS servers.  Enabling the lookup allows Private Cloud vSphere components to look up any services running in your on-premises environment and communicate with them using fully qualified domain names (FQDN).

## Scenarios 

Forwarding DNS lookup for your on-premises DNS server allows you to use your Private Cloud for the following scenarios:

* Use Private Cloud as a disaster recovery setup for your on-premises VMware solution
* Use on-premises Active Directory as an identity source for your Private Cloud vSphere
* Use HCX for migrating virtual machines from on-premises to Private Cloud

## Before you begin

A network connection must be present from your Private Cloud network to your on-premises network for DNS forwarding to work.  You can set up network connection using:

* [Connect from on-premises to CloudSimple using ExpressRoute](on-premises-connection.md)
* [Set up a Site-to-Site VPN gateway](./vpn-gateway.md#set-up-a-site-to-site-vpn-gateway)

Firewall ports must be opened on this connection for DNS forwarding to work.  Ports used are TCP port 53 or UDP port 53.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Site-to-Site VPN, your on-premises DNS server subnet must be added as a part of on-premises prefixes.

## Request DNS forwarding from Private Cloud to on-premises

To enable DNS forwarding from Private Cloud to on-premises, submit a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest), providing the following information.
