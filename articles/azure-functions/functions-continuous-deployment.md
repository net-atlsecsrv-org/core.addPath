# Continuous deployment for Azure Functions

You can use Azure Functions to deploy your code continuously by using [source control integration](functions-deployment-technologies.md#source-control). Source control integration enables a workflow in which a code update triggers deployment to Azure. If you're new to Azure Functions, get started by reviewing the [Azure Functions overview](functions-overview.md).

Continuous deployment is a good option for projects where you integrate multiple and frequent contributions. When you use continuous deployment, you maintain a single source of truth for your code, which allows teams to easily collaborate. You can configure continuous deployment in Azure Functions from the following source code locations:

* [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

The unit of deployment for functions in Azure is the function app. All functions in a function app are deployed at the same time. After you enable continuous deployment, access to function code in the Azure portal is configured as *read-only* because the source of truth is set to be elsewhere.

## Requirements for continuous deployment

For continuous deployment to succeed, your directory structure must be compatible with the basic folder structure that Azure Functions expects.

>[!NOTE]  
> Continuous deployment is not yet supported for Linux apps running on a Consumption plan.

To configure continuous deployment for an existing function app, complete these steps. The steps demonstrate integration with a GitHub repository, but similar steps apply for Azure Repos or other source code repositories.

1. In your function app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Deployment Center**, select **GitHub**, and then select **Authorize**. If you've already authorized GitHub, select **Continue** and skip the next step.

3. In GitHub, select **Authorize AzureAppService**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-continuous-deployment/authorize.png" alt-text="Authorize Azure App Service":::

    Enter your GitHub password and then select **Continue**.

4. Select one of the following build providers:

    * **App Service build service**: Best when you don't need a build or if you need a generic build.
    * **Azure Pipelines (Preview)**: Best when you need more control over the build. This provider currently is in preview.

    Select **Continue**.

5. Configure information specific to the source control option you specified. For GitHub, you must enter or select values for **Organization**, **Repository**, and **Branch**. The values are based on the location of your code. Then, select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-continuous-deployment/github-specifics.png" alt-text="Configure GitHub":::

6. Review all details, and then select **Finish** to complete your deployment configuration.

When the process is finished, all code from the specified source is deployed to your app. At that point, changes in the deployment source trigger a deployment of those changes to your function app in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> After you configure continuous integration, you can no longer edit your source files in the Functions portal.
