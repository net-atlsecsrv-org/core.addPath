# Azure Functions F# Developer Reference

F# for Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. Data flows into your F# function via function arguments. Argument names are specified in `function.json`, and there are predefined names for accessing things like the function logger and cancellation tokens. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>F# script (.fsx) is only supported by [version 1.x](functions-versions.md#creating-1x-apps) of the Azure Functions runtime. If you want to use F# with the version 2.x runtime, you must use a precompiled F# class library project (.fs). You create, manage, and publish an F# class library project using Visual Studio as you would a [C# class library project](functions-dotnet-class-library.md). For more information about Functions versions, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions.md).

This article assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developer reference](functions-reference.md).

## How .fsx works
An `.fsx` file is an F# script. It can be thought of as an F# project that's contained in a single file. The file contains both the code for your program (in this case, your Azure Function) and directives for managing dependencies.

When you use an `.fsx` for an Azure Function, commonly required assemblies are automatically included for you, allowing you to focus on the function rather than "boilerplate" code.

## Folder structure

The folder structure for an F# script project looks like the following:

```
FunctionsProject
 | - MyFirstFunction
 | | - run.fsx
 | | - function.json
 | | - function.proj
 | - MySecondFunction
 | | - run.fsx
 | | - function.json
 | | - function.proj
 | - host.json
 | - extensions.csproj
 | - bin
```

There's a shared [host.json](functions-host-json.md) file that can be used to configure the function app. Each function has its own code file (.fsx) and binding configuration file (function.json).

The binding extensions required in [version 2.x](functions-versions.md) of the Functions runtime are defined in the `extensions.csproj` file, with the actual library files in the `bin` folder. When developing locally, you must [register binding extensions](./functions-bindings-register.md#extension-bundles). When developing functions in the Azure portal, this registration is done for you.

## Binding to arguments
Each binding supports some set of arguments, as detailed in the [Azure Functions triggers and bindings developer reference](functions-triggers-bindings.md). For example, one of the argument bindings a blob trigger supports is a POCO, which can be expressed using an F# record. For example:

```fsharp
type Item = { Id: string }

let Run(blob: string, output: byref<Item>) =
    let item = { Id = "Some ID" }
    output <- item
```

Your F# Azure Function will take one or more arguments. When we talk about Azure Functions arguments, we refer to *input* arguments and *output* arguments. An input argument is exactly what it sounds like: input to your F# Azure Function. An *output* argument is mutable data or a `byref<>` argument that serves as a way to pass data back *out* of your function.

In the example above, `blob` is an input argument, and `output` is an output argument. Notice that we used `byref<>` for `output` (there's no need to add the `[<Out>]` annotation). Using a `byref<>` type allows your function to change which record or object the argument refers to.

When an F# record is used as an input type, the record definition must be marked with `[<CLIMutable>]` in order to allow the Azure Functions framework to set the fields appropriately before passing the record to your function. Under the hood, `[<CLIMutable>]` generates setters for the record properties. For example:

```fsharp
[<CLIMutable>]
type TestObject =
    { SenderName : string
      Greeting : string }

let Run(req: TestObject, log: ILogger) =
    { req with Greeting = sprintf "Hello, %s" req.SenderName }
```

An F# class can also be used for both in and out arguments. For a class, properties will usually need getters and setters. For example:

```fsharp
type Item() =
    member val Id = "" with get,set
    member val Text = "" with get,set

let Run(input: string, item: byref<Item>) =
    let result = Item(Id = input, Text = "Hello from F#!")
    item <- result
```

## Logging
To log output to your [streaming logs](../app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md) in F#, your function should take an argument of type [ILogger](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger). For consistency, we recommend this argument is named `log`. For example:

```fsharp
let Run(blob: string, output: byref<string>, log: ILogger) =
    log.LogInformation(sprintf "F# Azure Function processed a blob: %s" blob)
    output <- input
```

## Async
The `async` workflow can be used, but the result needs to return a `Task`. This can be done with `Async.StartAsTask`, for example:

```fsharp
let Run(req: HttpRequestMessage) =
    async {
        return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK)
    } |> Async.StartAsTask
```

## Cancellation Token
If your function needs to handle shutdown gracefully, you can give it a [`CancellationToken`](/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken) argument. This can be combined with `async`, for example:

```fsharp
let Run(req: HttpRequestMessage, token: CancellationToken)
    let f = async {
        do! Async.Sleep(10)
        return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK)
    }
    Async.StartAsTask(f, token)
```

## Importing namespaces
Namespaces can be opened in the usual way:

```fsharp
open System.Net
open System.Threading.Tasks
open Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

let Run(req: HttpRequestMessage, log: ILogger) =
    ...
```

The following namespaces are automatically opened:

* `System`
* `System.Collections.Generic`
* `System.IO`
* `System.Linq`
* `System.Net.Http`
* `System.Threading.Tasks`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host`.

## Referencing External Assemblies
Similarly, framework assembly references can be added with the `#r "AssemblyName"` directive.

```fsharp
#r "System.Web.Http"

open System.Net
open System.Net.Http
open System.Threading.Tasks
open Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

let Run(req: HttpRequestMessage, log: ILogger) =
    ...
```

The following assemblies are automatically added by the Azure Functions hosting environment:

* `mscorlib`,
* `System`
* `System.Core`
* `System.Xml`
* `System.Net.Http`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions`
* `System.Web.Http`
* `System.Net.Http.Formatting`.

In addition, the following assemblies are special cased and may be referenced by simplename (e.g. `#r "AssemblyName"`):

* `Newtonsoft.Json`
* `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage`
* `Microsoft.ServiceBus`
* `Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers`
* `Microsoft.AspNEt.WebHooks.Common`.

If you need to reference a private assembly, you can upload the assembly file into a `bin` folder relative to your function and reference it by using the file name (e.g.  `#r "MyAssembly.dll"`). For information on how to upload files to your function folder, see the following section on package management.

## Editor Prelude
An editor that supports F# Compiler Services will not be aware of the namespaces and assemblies that Azure Functions automatically includes. As such, it can be useful to include a prelude that helps the editor find the assemblies you are using, and to explicitly open namespaces. For example:

```fsharp
#if !COMPILED
#I "../../bin/Binaries/WebJobs.Script.Host"
#r "Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host.dll"
#endif

open System
open Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host
open Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

let Run(blob: string, output: byref<string>, log: ILogger) =
    ...
```

When Azure Functions executes your code, it processes the source with `COMPILED` defined, so the editor prelude will be ignored.

<a name="package"></a>

## Package management
To use NuGet packages in an F# function, add a `project.json` file to the function's folder in the function app's file system. Here is an example `project.json` file that adds a NuGet package reference to `Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Face` version 1.1.0:

```json
{
  "frameworks": {
    "net46":{
      "dependencies": {
        "Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Face": "1.1.0"
      }
    }
   }
}
```

Only the .NET Framework 4.6 is supported, so make sure that your `project.json` file specifies `net46` as shown here.

When you upload a `project.json` file, the runtime gets the packages and automatically adds references to the package assemblies. You don't need to add `#r "AssemblyName"` directives. Just add the required `open` statements to your `.fsx` file.

You may wish to put automatically references assemblies in your editor prelude, to improve your editor's interaction with F# Compile Services.

### How to add a `project.json` file to your Azure Function
1. Begin by making sure your function app is running, which you can do by opening your function in the Azure portal. This also gives access to the streaming logs where package installation output will be displayed.
2. To upload a `project.json` file, use one of the methods described in [how to update function app files](functions-reference.md#fileupdate). If you are using [Continuous Deployment for Azure Functions](functions-continuous-deployment.md), you can add a `project.json` file to your staging branch in order to experiment with it before adding it to your deployment branch.
3. After the `project.json` file is added, you will see output similar to the following example in your function's streaming log:

```

## Environment variables
To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`, for example:

```fsharp
open System.Environment
open Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

let Run(timer: TimerInfo, log: ILogger) =
    log.LogInformation("Storage = " + GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"))
    log.LogInformation("Site = " + GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"))
```

## Reusing .fsx code
You can use code from other `.fsx` files by using a `#load` directive. For example:

`run.fsx`

```fsharp
#load "logger.fsx"

let Run(timer: TimerInfo, log: ILogger) =
    mylog log (sprintf "Timer: %s" DateTime.Now.ToString())
```

`logger.fsx`

```fsharp
let mylog(log: ILogger, text: string) =
    log.LogInformation(text);
```

Paths provides to the `#load` directive are relative to the location of your `.fsx` file.

* `#load "logger.fsx"` loads a file located in the function folder.
* `#load "package\logger.fsx"` loads a file located in the `package` folder in the function folder.
* `#load "..\shared\mylogger.fsx"` loads a file located in the `shared` folder at the same level as the function folder, that is, directly under `wwwroot`.

The `#load` directive only works with `.fsx` (F# script) files, and not with `.fs` files.
