# Create a function app for serverless code execution 

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app, which is a container for your functions. The function app is created using the [Consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan), which is ideal for event-driven serverless workloads.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
