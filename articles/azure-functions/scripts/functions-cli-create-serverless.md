# Create a function app for serverless code execution

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app, which is a container for your functions. The function app is created using the [consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan), which is ideal for event-driven serverless workloads.

[!INCLUDE [upgrade runtime](../../../includes/functions-cli-version-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

This script creates an Azure Function app using the [consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan).

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/create-function-app-consumption/create-function-app-consumption.sh "Create an Azure Function on a consumption plan")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

Each command in the table links to command specific documentation. This script uses the following commands:

| Command | Notes |

| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) | Creates an Azure Storage account. |
| [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) | Creates a function app. |
