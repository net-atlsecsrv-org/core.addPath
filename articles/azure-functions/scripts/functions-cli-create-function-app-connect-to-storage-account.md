# Create a function app with a named Storage account connection 

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app and connects the function to an Azure Storage account. The created app setting that contains the connection can be used with a [storage trigger or binding](../functions-bindings-storage-blob.md). 

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you use the CLI locally, make sure that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
