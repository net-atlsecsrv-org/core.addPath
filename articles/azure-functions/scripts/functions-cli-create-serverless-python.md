# Create a serverless Python function app using Azure CLI

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app, which is a container for your functions. 

>[!NOTE]
>The function app created runs on Python version 3.6. Python version 3.7 is also supported by Azure Functions.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Sample script

This script creates an Azure Function app using the [Consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan).

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/create-function-app-consumption-python/create-function-app-consumption-python.sh "Create an Azure Function on a Consumption plan")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

| [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) | Creates an Azure Storage account. |
| [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) | Creates a function app. |
