# Create a function app in Azure that is deployed from GitHub

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app using the [consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan), along with its related resources. The script also configures your function code for  continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. 

[!INCLUDE [upgrade runtime](../../../includes/functions-cli-version-note.md)]

In this sample, you need:

* A GitHub repository with functions code, that you have administrative permissions for.
* A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) for your GitHub account.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you rather use the Azure CLI locally, you must install and use version 2.0 or a later version. To determine the Azure CLI version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

This sample creates an Azure Function app and deploys function code from GitHub.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/deploy-function-app-with-function-github-continuous/deploy-function-app-with-function-github-continuous.sh?highlight=3-4 "Azure Service")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

Each command in the table links to command specific documentation. This script uses the following commands:

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az storage account create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) | Creates the storage account required by the function app. |
| [az functionapp create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) | Creates a function app in the serverless [consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan) and associates it with a Git or Mercurial repository. |
