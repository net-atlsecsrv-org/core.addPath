# Mount a file share to a Python function app using Azure CLI

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app and creates a share in Azure Files. It them mounts the share so that the data can be accessed by your functions.  

>[!NOTE]
>The function app created runs on Python version 3.7. Azure Functions also [supports Python versions 3.6 and 3.8](../functions-reference-python.md#python-version).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Examples are written for Bash shell and must be modified to run in a Windows command prompt. 

## Sample script

This script creates an Azure Function app using the [Consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan).

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/functions-cli-mount-files-storage-linux/functions-cli-mount-files-storage-linux.sh "Create an Azure Function on a Consumption plan")]
