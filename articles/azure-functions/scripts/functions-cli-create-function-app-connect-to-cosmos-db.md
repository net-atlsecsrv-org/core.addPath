# Create an Azure Function that connects to an Azure Cosmos DB

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app and connects the function to an Azure Cosmos DB database. The created app setting that contains the connection can be used with an [Azure Cosmos DB trigger or binding](../functions-bindings-cosmosdb.md).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you use the CLI locally, make sure that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

This sample creates an Azure Function app and adds a Cosmos DB endpoint and access key to app settings.
