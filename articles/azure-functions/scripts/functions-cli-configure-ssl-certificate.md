# Bind a custom SSL certificate to a function app

This sample script creates a function app in App Service with its related resources, then binds the SSL certificate of a custom domain name to it. For this sample, you need:

* Access to your domain registrar's DNS configuration page.
* A valid .PFX file and its password for the SSL certificate you want to upload and bind.
* Have configured an A record in your custom domain that points to your web app's default domain name. For more information, see the [Map custom domain instructions for Azure App Service](https://aka.ms/appservicecustomdns).

To bind an SSL certificate, your function app must be created in a Premium plan or an App Service plan and not in a Consumption plan.
