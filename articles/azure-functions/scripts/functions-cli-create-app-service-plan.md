# Create a Function App in an App Service plan

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app, which is a container for your functions. The function app that is created uses a dedicated App Service plan, which means your server resources are always on.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]
