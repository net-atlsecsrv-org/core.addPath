# Use dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions

Azure Functions supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique to achieve [Inversion of Control (IoC)](/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion) between classes and their dependencies.

- Dependency injection in Azure Functions is built on the .NET Core Dependency Injection features. Familiarity with [.NET Core dependency injection](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) is recommended. There are differences in how you override dependencies and how configuration values are read with Azure Functions on the Consumption plan.

- Support for dependency injection begins with Azure Functions 2.x.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use dependency injection, you must install the following NuGet packages:

- [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions/)

- [Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/) package version 1.0.28 or later

## Register services

To register services, create a method to configure and add components to an `IFunctionsHostBuilder` instance.  The Azure Functions host creates an instance of `IFunctionsHostBuilder` and passes it directly into your method.

To register the method, add the `FunctionsStartup` assembly attribute that specifies the type name used during startup.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(MyNamespace.Startup))]

namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class Startup : FunctionsStartup
    {
        public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

            builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyService>((s) => {
                return new MyService();
            });

            builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILoggerProvider, MyLoggerProvider>();
        }
    }
}
```

This example uses the [Microsoft.Extensions.Http](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Http/) package required to register an `HttpClient` at startup.

### Caveats

A series of registration steps run before and after the runtime processes the startup class. Therefore, keep in mind the following items:

- *The startup class is meant for only setup and registration.* Avoid using services registered at startup during the startup process. For instance, don't try to log a message in a logger that is being registered during startup. This point of the registration process is too early for your services to be available for use. After the `Configure` method is run, the Functions runtime continues to register additional dependencies, which can affect how your services operate.

- *The dependency injection container only holds explicitly registered types*. The only services available as injectable types are what are setup in the `Configure` method. As a result, Functions-specific types like `BindingContext` and `ExecutionContext` aren't available during setup or as injectable types.

## Use injected dependencies

Constructor injection is used to make your dependencies available in a function. The use of constructor injection requires that you do not use static classes for injected services or for your function classes.

The following sample demonstrates how the `IMyService` and `HttpClient` dependencies are injected into an HTTP-triggered function.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class MyHttpTrigger
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _client;
        private readonly IMyService _service;

        public MyHttpTrigger(HttpClient httpClient, MyService service)
        {
            this._client = httpClient;
            this._service = service;
        }

        [FunctionName("MyHttpTrigger")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            var response = await _client.GetAsync("https://microsoft.com");
            var message = _service.GetMessage();

            return new OkObjectResult("Response from function with injected dependencies.");
        }
    }
}
```

This example uses the [Microsoft.Extensions.Http](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Http/) package required to register an `HttpClient` at startup.

## Service lifetimes

Azure Functions apps provide the same service lifetimes as [ASP.NET Dependency Injection](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes). For a Functions app, the different service lifetimes behave as follows:

- **Transient**: Transient services are created upon each request of the service.
- **Scoped**: The scoped service lifetime matches a function execution lifetime. Scoped services are created once per execution. Later requests for that service during the execution reuse the existing service instance.
- **Singleton**: The singleton service lifetime matches the host lifetime and is reused across function executions on that instance. Singleton lifetime services are recommended for connections and clients, for example `DocumentClient` or `HttpClient` instances.

View or download a [sample of different service lifetimes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-extensions/tree/main/src/samples/DependencyInjection/Scopes) on GitHub.

## Logging services

If you need your own logging provider, register a custom type as an instance of [`ILoggerProvider`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.iloggerfactory), which is available through the [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions/) NuGet package.

Application Insights is added by Azure Functions automatically.

> [!WARNING]
> - Do not add `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` to the services collection as it registers services that conflict with services provided by the environment.
> - Do not register your own `TelemetryConfiguration` or `TelemetryClient` if you are using the built-in Application Insights functionality. If you need to configure your own `TelemetryClient` instance, create one via the injected `TelemetryConfiguration` as shown in [Monitor Azure Functions](./functions-monitoring.md#version-2x-and-later-2).

### ILogger<T> and ILoggerFactory

The host injects `ILogger<T>` and `ILoggerFactory` services into constructors.  However, by default these new logging filters are filtered out of the function logs.  You need to modify the `host.json` file to opt-in to additional filters and categories.

The following example demonstrates how to add an `ILogger<HttpTrigger>` with logs that are exposed to the host.

```csharp
namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class HttpTrigger
    {
        private readonly ILogger<HttpTrigger> _log;

        public HttpTrigger(ILogger<HttpTrigger> log)
        {
            _log = log;
        }

        [FunctionName("HttpTrigger")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req)
        {
            _log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            // ...
    }
}
```

The following example `host.json` file adds the log filter.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "logging": {
        "applicationInsights": {
            "samplingSettings": {
                "isEnabled": true,
                "excludedTypes": "Request"
            }
        },
        "logLevel": {
            "MyNamespace.HttpTrigger": "Information"
        }
    }
}
```

## Function app provided services

The function host registers many services. The following services are safe to take as a dependency in your application:

|Service Type|Lifetime|Description|
|--|--|--|
|`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration`|Singleton|Runtime configuration|
|`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host.Executors.IHostIdProvider`|Singleton|Responsible for providing the ID of the host instance|

If there are other services you want to take a dependency on, [create an issue and propose them on GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-host).

### Overriding host services

Overriding services provided by the host is currently not supported.  If there are services you want to override, [create an issue and propose them on GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-host).

## Working with options and settings

Values defined in [app settings](./functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) are available in an `IConfiguration` instance, which allows you to read app settings values in the startup class.

You can extract values from the `IConfiguration` instance into a custom type. Copying the app settings values to a custom type makes it easy test your services by making these values injectable. Settings read into the configuration instance must be simple key/value pairs.

Consider the following class that includes a property named consistent with an app setting:

```csharp
public class MyOptions
{
    public string MyCustomSetting { get; set; }
}
```

And a `local.settings.json` file that might structure the custom setting as follows:
```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "MyOptions:MyCustomSetting": "Foobar"
  }
}
```

From inside the `Startup.Configure` method, you can extract values from the `IConfiguration` instance into your custom type using the following code:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOptions<MyOptions>()
    .Configure<IConfiguration>((settings, configuration) =>
    {
        configuration.GetSection("MyOptions").Bind(settings);
    });
```

Calling `Bind` copies values that have matching property names from the configuration into the custom instance. The options instance is now available in the IoC container to inject into a function.

The options object is injected into the function as an instance of the generic `IOptions` interface. Use the `Value` property to access the values found in your configuration.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;

public class HttpTrigger
{
    private readonly MyOptions _settings;

    public HttpTrigger(IOptions<MyOptions> options)
    {
        _settings = options.Value;
    }
}
```

Refer to [Options pattern in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options) for more details regarding working with options.

## Customizing configuration sources

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration source customization is available beginning in Azure Functions host versions 2.0.14192.0 and 3.0.14191.0.

To specify additional configuration sources, override the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method in your function app's `StartUp` class.

The following sample adds configuration values from a base and an optional environment-specific app settings files.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(MyNamespace.Startup))]

namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class Startup : FunctionsStartup
    {
        public override void ConfigureAppConfiguration(IFunctionsConfigurationBuilder builder)
        {
            FunctionsHostBuilderContext context = builder.GetContext();

            builder.ConfigurationBuilder
                .AddJsonFile(Path.Combine(context.ApplicationRootPath, "appsettings.json"), optional: true, reloadOnChange: false)
                .AddJsonFile(Path.Combine(context.ApplicationRootPath, $"appsettings.{context.EnvironmentName}.json"), optional: true, reloadOnChange: false)
                .AddEnvironmentVariables();
        }
    }
}
```

Add configuration providers to the `ConfigurationBuilder` property of `IFunctionsConfigurationBuilder`. For more information on using configuration providers, see [Configuration in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-3.1#configuration-providers).

A `FunctionsHostBuilderContext` is obtained from `IFunctionsConfigurationBuilder.GetContext()`. Use this context to retrieve the current environment name and resolve the location of configuration files in your function app folder.

By default, configuration files such as *appsettings.json* are not automatically copied to the function app's output folder. Update your *.csproj* file to match the following sample to ensure the files are copied.

```xml
<None Update="appsettings.json">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>      
</None>
<None Update="appsettings.Development.json">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    <CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
</None>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For function apps running in the Consumption or Premium plans, modifications to configuration values used in triggers can cause scaling errors. Any changes to these properties by the `FunctionsStartup` class results in a function app startup error.
