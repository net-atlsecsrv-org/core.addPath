# Azure Functions JavaScript developer guide

This guide contains information about the intricacies of writing Azure Functions with JavaScript.

A JavaScript function is an exported `function` that executes when triggered ([triggers are configured in function.json](functions-triggers-bindings.md)). The first argument passed to every function is a `context` object, which is used for receiving and sending binding data, logging, and communicating with the runtime.

This article assumes that you have already read the [Azure Functions developer reference](functions-reference.md). Complete the Functions quickstart to create your first function, using [Visual Studio Code](functions-create-first-function-vs-code.md) or [in the portal](functions-create-first-azure-function.md).

This article also supports [TypeScript app development](#typescript).

## Folder structure

The required folder structure for a JavaScript project looks like the following. This default can be changed. For more information, see the [scriptFile](#using-scriptfile) section below.

```
FunctionsProject
 | - MyFirstFunction
 | | - index.js
 | | - function.json
 | - MySecondFunction
 | | - index.js
 | | - function.json
 | - SharedCode
 | | - myFirstHelperFunction.js
 | | - mySecondHelperFunction.js
 | - node_modules
 | - host.json
 | - package.json
 | - extensions.csproj
```

At the root of the project, there's a shared [host.json](functions-host-json.md) file that can be used to configure the function app. Each function has a folder with its own code file (.js) and binding configuration file (function.json). The name of `function.json`'s parent directory is always the name of your function.

The binding extensions required in [version 2.x](functions-versions.md) of the Functions runtime are defined in the `extensions.csproj` file, with the actual library files in the `bin` folder. When developing locally, you must [register binding extensions](./functions-bindings-register.md#extension-bundles). When developing functions in the Azure portal, this registration is done for you.

## Exporting a function

JavaScript functions must be exported via [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports) (or [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_exports)). Your exported function should be a JavaScript function that executes when triggered.

By default, the Functions runtime looks for your function in `index.js`, where `index.js` shares the same parent directory as its corresponding `function.json`. In the default case, your exported function should be the only export from its file or the export named `run` or `index`. To configure the file location and export name of your function, read about [configuring your function's entry point](functions-reference-node.md#configure-function-entry-point) below.

Your exported function is passed a number of arguments on execution. The first argument it takes is always a `context` object. If your function is synchronous (doesn't return a Promise), you must pass the `context` object, as calling `context.done` is required for correct use.

```javascript
// You should include context, other arguments are optional
module.exports = function(context, myTrigger, myInput, myOtherInput) {
    // function logic goes here :)
    context.done();
};
```

### Exporting an async function
When using the [`async function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) declaration or plain JavaScript [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) in version 2.x of the Functions runtime, you do not need to explicitly call the [`context.done`](#contextdone-method) callback to signal that your function has completed. Your function completes when the exported async function/Promise completes. For functions targeting the version 1.x runtime, you must still call [`context.done`](#contextdone-method) when your code is done executing.

The following example is a simple function that logs that it was triggered and immediately completes execution.

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context) {
    context.log('JavaScript trigger function processed a request.');
};
```

When exporting an async function, you can also configure an output binding to take the `return` value. This is recommended if you only have one output binding.

To assign an output using `return`, change the `name` property to `$return` in `function.json`.

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "direction": "out",
  "name": "$return"
}
```

In this case, your function should look like the following example:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
    // You can call and await an async method here
    return {
        body: "Hello, world!"
    };
}
```

## Bindings 
In JavaScript, [bindings](functions-triggers-bindings.md) are configured and defined in a function's function.json. Functions interact with bindings a number of ways.

### Inputs
Input are divided into two categories in Azure Functions: one is the trigger input and the other is the additional input. Trigger and other input bindings (bindings of `direction === "in"`) can be read by a function in three ways:
 - **_[Recommended]_ As parameters passed to your function.** They are passed to the function in the same order that they are defined in *function.json*. The `name` property defined in *function.json* does not need to match the name of your parameter, although it should.
 
   ```javascript
   module.exports = async function(context, myTrigger, myInput, myOtherInput) { ... };
   ```
   
 - **As members of the [`context.bindings`](#contextbindings-property) object.** Each member is named by the `name` property defined in *function.json*.
 
   ```javascript
   module.exports = async function(context) { 
       context.log("This is myTrigger: " + context.bindings.myTrigger);
       context.log("This is myInput: " + context.bindings.myInput);
       context.log("This is myOtherInput: " + context.bindings.myOtherInput);
   };
   ```
   
 - **As inputs using the JavaScript [`arguments`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/87dw3w1k.aspx) object.** This is essentially the same as passing inputs as parameters, but allows you to dynamically handle inputs.
 
   ```javascript
   module.exports = async function(context) { 
       context.log("This is myTrigger: " + arguments[1]);
       context.log("This is myInput: " + arguments[2]);
       context.log("This is myOtherInput: " + arguments[3]);
   };
   ```

### Outputs
Outputs (bindings of `direction === "out"`) can be written to by a function in a number of ways. In all cases, the `name` property of the binding as defined in *function.json* corresponds to the name of the object member written to in your function. 

You can assign data to output bindings in one of the following ways (don't combine these methods):

- **_[Recommended for multiple outputs]_ Returning an object.** If you are using an async/Promise returning function, you can return an object with assigned output data. In the example below, the output bindings are named "httpResponse" and "queueOutput" in *function.json*.

  ```javascript
  module.exports = async function(context) {
      let retMsg = 'Hello, world!';
      return {
          httpResponse: {
              body: retMsg
          },
          queueOutput: retMsg
      };
  };
  ```

  If you are using a synchronous function, you can return this object using [`context.done`](#contextdone-method) (see example).
- **_[Recommended for single output]_ Returning a value directly and using the $return binding name.** This only works for async/Promise returning functions. See example in [exporting an async function](#exporting-an-async-function). 
- **Assigning values to `context.bindings`** You can assign values directly to context.bindings.

  ```javascript
  module.exports = async function(context) {
      let retMsg = 'Hello, world!';
      context.bindings.httpResponse = {
          body: retMsg
      };
      context.bindings.queueOutput = retMsg;
      return;
  };
  ```

### Bindings data type

To define the data type for an input binding, use the `dataType` property in the binding definition. For example, to read the content of an HTTP request in binary format, use the type `binary`:

```json
{
    "type": "httpTrigger",
    "name": "req",
    "direction": "in",
    "dataType": "binary"
}
```

Options for `dataType` are: `binary`, `stream`, and `string`.

## context object
The runtime uses a `context` object to pass data to and from your function and to let you communicate with the runtime. The context object can be used for reading and setting data from bindings, writing logs, and using the `context.done` callback when your exported function is synchronous.

The `context` object is always the first parameter to a function. It should be included because it has important methods such as `context.done` and `context.log`. You can name the object whatever you would like (for example, `ctx` or `c`).

```javascript
// You must include a context, but other arguments are optional
module.exports = function(ctx) {
    // function logic goes here :)
    ctx.done();
};
```

### context.bindings property

```js
context.bindings
```

Returns a named object that is used to read or assign binding data. Input and trigger binding data can be accessed by reading properties on `context.bindings`. Output binding data can be assigned by adding data to `context.bindings`

For example, the following binding definitions in your function.json let you access the contents of a queue from `context.bindings.myInput` and assign outputs to a queue using `context.bindings.myOutput`.

```json
{
    "type":"queue",
    "direction":"in",
    "name":"myInput"
    ...
},
{
    "type":"queue",
    "direction":"out",
    "name":"myOutput"
    ...
}
```

```javascript
// myInput contains the input data, which may have properties such as "name"
var author = context.bindings.myInput.name;
// Similarly, you can set your output data
context.bindings.myOutput = { 
        some_text: 'hello world', 
        a_number: 1 };
```

You can choose to define output binding data using the `context.done` method instead of the `context.binding` object (see below).

### context.bindingData property

```js
context.bindingData
```

Returns a named object that contains trigger metadata and function invocation data (`invocationId`, `sys.methodName`, `sys.utcNow`, `sys.randGuid`). For an example of trigger metadata, see this [event hubs example](functions-bindings-event-hubs.md#trigger---javascript-example).

### context.done method

```js
context.done([err],[propertyBag])
```

Lets the runtime know that your code has completed. When your function uses the [`async function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) declaration, you do not need to use `context.done()`. The `context.done` callback is implicitly called. Async functions are available in Node 8 or a later version, which requires version 2.x of the Functions runtime.

If your function is not an async function, **you must call** `context.done` to inform the runtime that your function is complete. The execution times out if it is missing.

The `context.done` method allows you to pass back both a user-defined error to the runtime and a JSON object containing output binding data. Properties passed to `context.done` overwrite anything set on the `context.bindings` object.

```javascript
// Even though we set myOutput to have:
//  -> text: 'hello world', number: 123
context.bindings.myOutput = { text: 'hello world', number: 123 };
// If we pass an object to the done function...
context.done(null, { myOutput: { text: 'hello there, world', noNumber: true }});
// the done method overwrites the myOutput binding to be: 
//  -> text: 'hello there, world', noNumber: true
```

### context.log method  

```js
context.log(message)
```

Allows you to write to the streaming function logs at the default trace level. On `context.log`, additional logging methods are available that let you write function logs at other trace levels:


| Method                 | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **error(_message_)**   | Writes to error level logging, or lower.   |
| **warn(_message_)**    | Writes to warning level logging, or lower. |
| **info(_message_)**    | Writes to info level logging, or lower.    |
| **verbose(_message_)** | Writes to verbose level logging.           |

The following example writes a log at the warning trace level:

```javascript
context.log.warn("Something has happened."); 
```

You can [configure the trace-level threshold for logging](#configure-the-trace-level-for-console-logging) in the host.json file. For more information on writing logs, see [writing trace outputs](#writing-trace-output-to-the-console) below.

Read [monitoring Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md) to learn more about viewing and querying function logs.

## Writing trace output to the console 

In Functions, you use the `context.log` methods to write trace output to the console. In Functions v2.x, trace outputs using `console.log` are captured at the Function App level. This means that outputs from `console.log` are not tied to a specific function invocation and aren't displayed in a specific function's logs. They do, however, propagate to Application Insights. In Functions v1.x, you cannot use `console.log` to write to the console.

When you call `context.log()`, your message is written to the console at the default trace level, which is the _info_ trace level. The following code writes to the console at the info trace level:

```javascript
context.log({hello: 'world'});  
```

This code is equivalent to the code above:

```javascript
context.log.info({hello: 'world'});  
```

This code writes to the console at the error level:

```javascript
context.log.error("An error has occurred.");  
```

Because _error_ is the highest trace level, this trace is written to the output at all trace levels as long as logging is enabled.

All `context.log` methods support the same parameter format that's supported by the Node.js [util.format method](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format). Consider the following code, which writes function logs by using the default trace level:

```javascript
context.log('Node.js HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri=' + req.originalUrl);
context.log('Request Headers = ' + JSON.stringify(req.headers));
```

You can also write the same code in the following format:

```javascript
context.log('Node.js HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri=%s', req.originalUrl);
context.log('Request Headers = ', JSON.stringify(req.headers));
```

### Configure the trace level for console logging

Functions 1.x lets you define the threshold trace level for writing to the console, which makes it easy to control the way traces are written to the console from your function. To set the threshold for all traces written to the console, use the `tracing.consoleLevel` property in the host.json file. This setting applies to all functions in your function app. The following example sets the trace threshold to enable verbose logging:

```json
{
    "tracing": {
        "consoleLevel": "verbose"
    }
}  
```

Values of **consoleLevel** correspond to the names of the `context.log` methods. To disable all trace logging to the console, set **consoleLevel** to _off_. For more information, see [host.json reference](functions-host-json-v1.md).

## HTTP triggers and bindings

HTTP and webhook triggers and HTTP output bindings use request and response objects to represent the HTTP messaging.  

### Request object

The `context.req` (request) object has the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _body_        | An object that contains the body of the request.               |
| _headers_     | An object that contains the request headers.                   |
| _method_      | The HTTP method of the request.                                |
| _originalUrl_ | The URL of the request.                                        |
| _params_      | An object that contains the routing parameters of the request. |
| _query_       | An object that contains the query parameters.                  |
| _rawBody_     | The body of the message as a string.                           |


### Response object

The `context.res` (response) object has the following properties:

| Property  | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| _body_    | An object that contains the body of the response.         |
| _headers_ | An object that contains the response headers.             |
| _isRaw_   | Indicates that formatting is skipped for the response.    |
| _status_  | The HTTP status code of the response.                     |

### Accessing the request and response 

When you work with HTTP triggers, you can access the HTTP request and response objects in a number of ways:

+ **From `req` and `res` properties on the `context` object.** In this way, you can use the conventional pattern to access HTTP data from the context object, instead of having to use the full `context.bindings.name` pattern. The following example shows how to access the `req` and `res` objects on the `context`:

    ```javascript
    // You can access your http request off the context ...
    if(context.req.body.emoji === ':pizza:') context.log('Yay!');
    // and also set your http response
    context.res = { status: 202, body: 'You successfully ordered more coffee!' }; 
    ```

+ **From the named input and output bindings.** In this way, the HTTP trigger and bindings work the same as any other binding. The following example sets the response object by using a named `response` binding: 

    ```json
    {
        "type": "http",
        "direction": "out",
        "name": "response"
    }
    ```
    ```javascript
    context.bindings.response = { status: 201, body: "Insert succeeded." };
    ```
+ **_[Response only]_ By calling `context.res.send(body?: any)`.** An HTTP response is created with input `body` as the response body. `context.done()` is implicitly called.

+ **_[Response only]_ By calling `context.done()`.** A special type of HTTP binding returns the response that is passed to the `context.done()` method. The following HTTP output binding defines a `$return` output parameter:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
    ``` 
    ```javascript
     // Define a valid response object.
    res = { status: 201, body: "Insert succeeded." };
    context.done(null, res);   
    ```  

## Scaling and concurrency

By default, Azure Functions automatically monitors the load on your application and creates additional host instances for Node.js as needed. Functions uses built-in (not user configurable) thresholds for different trigger types to decide when to add instances, such the age of messages and queue size for QueueTrigger. For more information, see [How the consumption and premium plans work](functions-scale.md#how-the-consumption-and-premium-plans-work).

This scaling behavior is sufficient for many Node.js applications. For CPU-bound applications, you can improve performance further by using multiple language worker processes.

By default, every Functions host instance has a single language worker process. You can increase the number of worker processes per host (up to 10) by using the [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT](functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_process_count) application setting. Azure Functions then tries to evenly distribute simultaneous function invocations across these workers. 

The FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT applies to each host that Functions creates when scaling out your application to meet demand. 

## Node version

The following table shows the Node.js version used by each major version of the Functions runtime:

| Functions version | Node.js version | 
|---|---|
| 1.x | 6.11.2 (locked by the runtime) |
| 2.x  | _Active LTS_ and _Maintenance LTS_ Node.js versions (~10 recommended). Target the version in Azure by setting the WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION [app setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) to `~10`.|

You can see the current version that the runtime is using by checking the above app setting or by printing `process.version` from any function.

## Dependency management
In order to use community libraries in your JavaScript code, as is shown in the below example, you need to ensure that all dependencies are installed on your Function App in Azure.

```javascript
// Import the underscore.js library
var _ = require('underscore');
var version = process.version; // version === 'v6.5.0'

module.exports = function(context) {
    // Using our imported underscore.js library
    var matched_names = _
        .where(context.bindings.myInput.names, {first: 'Carla'});
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should define a `package.json` file at the root of your Function App. Defining the file lets all functions in the app share the same cached packages, which gives the best performance. If a version conflict arises, you can resolve it by adding a `package.json` file in the folder of a specific function.  

When deploying Function Apps from source control, any `package.json` file present in your repo, will trigger an `npm install` in its folder during deployment. But when deploying via the Portal or CLI, you will have to manually install the packages.

There are two ways to install packages on your Function App: 

### Deploying with Dependencies
1. Install all requisite packages locally by running `npm install`.

2. Deploy your code, and ensure that the `node_modules` folder is included in the deployment. 


### Using Kudu
1. Go to `https://<function_app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net`.

2. Click **Debug Console** > **CMD**.

3. Go to `D:\home\site\wwwroot`, and then drag your package.json file to the **wwwroot** folder at the top half of the page.  
    You can upload files to your function app in other ways also. For more information, see [How to update function app files](functions-reference.md#fileupdate). 

4. After the package.json file is uploaded, run the `npm install` command in the **Kudu remote execution console**.  
    This action downloads the packages indicated in the package.json file and restarts the function app.

## Environment variables

In Functions, [app settings](functions-app-settings.md), such as service connection strings, are exposed as environment variables during execution. You can access these settings using `process.env`, as shown here in the second and third calls to `context.log()` where we log the `AzureWebJobsStorage` and `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` environment variables:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, myTimer) {
    var timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();

    context.log('Node.js timer trigger function ran!', timeStamp);
    context.log("AzureWebJobsStorage: " + process.env["AzureWebJobsStorage"]);
    context.log("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME: " + process.env["WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"]);
};
```

[!INCLUDE [Function app settings](../../includes/functions-app-settings.md)]

When running locally, app settings are read from the [local.settings.json](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file) project file.

## Configure function entry point

The `function.json` properties `scriptFile` and `entryPoint` can be used to configure the location and name of your exported function. These properties can be important when your JavaScript is transpiled.

### Using `scriptFile`

By default, a JavaScript function is executed from `index.js`, a file that shares the same parent directory as its corresponding `function.json`.

`scriptFile` can be used to get a folder structure that looks like the following example:

```
FunctionApp
 | - host.json
 | - myNodeFunction
 | | - function.json
 | - lib
 | | - sayHello.js
 | - node_modules
 | | - ... packages ...
 | - package.json
```

The `function.json` for `myNodeFunction` should include a `scriptFile` property pointing to the file with the exported function to run.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "../lib/sayHello.js",
  "bindings": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Using `entryPoint`

In `scriptFile` (or `index.js`), a function must be exported using `module.exports` in order to be found and run. By default, the function that executes when triggered is the only export from that file, the export named `run`, or the export named `index`.

This can be configured using `entryPoint` in `function.json`, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "entryPoint": "logFoo",
  "bindings": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

In Functions v2.x, which supports the `this` parameter in user functions, the function code could then be as in the following example:

```javascript
class MyObj {
    constructor() {
        this.foo = 1;
    };

    logFoo(context) { 
        context.log("Foo is " + this.foo); 
        context.done(); 
    }
}

const myObj = new MyObj();
module.exports = myObj;
```

In this example, it is important to note that although an object is being exported, there are no guarantees for preserving state between executions.

## Local Debugging

When started with the `--inspect` parameter, a Node.js process listens for a debugging client on the specified port. In Azure Functions 2.x, you can specify arguments to pass into the Node.js process that runs your code by adding the environment variable or App Setting `languageWorkers:node:arguments = <args>`. 

To debug locally, add `"languageWorkers:node:arguments": "--inspect=5858"` under `Values` in your [local.settings.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#local-settings-file) file and attach a debugger to port 5858.

When debugging using VS Code, the `--inspect` parameter is automatically added using the `port` value in the project's launch.json file.

In version 1.x, setting `languageWorkers:node:arguments` will not work. The debug port can be selected with the [`--nodeDebugPort`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#start) parameter on Azure Functions Core Tools.

## TypeScript

When you target version 2.x of the Functions runtime, both [Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code](functions-create-first-function-vs-code.md) and the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md) let you create function apps using a template that support TypeScript function app projects. The template generates `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` project files that make it easier to transpile, run, and publish JavaScript functions from TypeScript code with these tools.

A generated `.funcignore` file is used to indicate which files are excluded when a project is published to Azure.  

TypeScript files (.ts) are transpiled into JavaScript files (.js) in the `dist` output directory. TypeScript templates use the [`scriptFile` parameter](#using-scriptfile) in `function.json` to indicate the location of the corresponding .js file in the `dist` folder. The output location is set by the template by using `outDir` parameter in the `tsconfig.json` file. If you change this setting or the name of the folder, the runtime is not able to find the code to run.

> [!NOTE]
> Experimental support for TypeScript exists version 1.x of the Functions runtime. The experimental version transpiles TypeScript files into JavaScript files when the function is invoked. In version 2.x, this experimental support has been superseded by the tool-driven method that does transpilation before the host is initialized and during the deployment process.

The way that you locally develop and deploy from a TypeScript project depends on your development tool.

### Visual Studio Code

The [Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extension lets you develop your functions using TypeScript. The Core Tools is a requirement of the Azure Functions extension.

To create a TypeScript function app in Visual Studio Code, choose `TypeScript` as your language when you create a function app.

When you press **F5** to run the app locally, transpilation is done before the host (func.exe) is initialized. 

When you deploy your function app to Azure using the **Deploy to function app...** button, the Azure Functions extension first generates a production-ready build of JavaScript files from the TypeScript source files.

There are several ways in which a TypeScript project differs from a JavaScript project when using the Core Tools.

#### Create project

To create a TypeScript function app project using Core Tools, you must specify the TypeScript language option when you create your function app. You can do this in one of the following ways:

- Run the `func init` command, select `node` as your language stack, and then select `typescript`.

- Run the `func init --worker-runtime typescript` command.

#### Run local

To run your function app code locally using Core Tools, use the following commands instead of `func host start`: 

```command
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command is equivalent to the following commands:

- `npm run build`
- `func extensions install`
- `tsc`
- `func start`

#### Publish to Azure

Before you use the [`func azure functionapp publish`] command to deploy to Azure, you create a production-ready build of JavaScript files from the TypeScript source files. 

The following commands prepare and publish your TypeScript project using Core Tools: 

```command
npm run build:production 
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```

In this command, replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app.

## Considerations for JavaScript functions

When you work with JavaScript functions, be aware of the considerations in the following sections.

### Choose single-vCPU App Service plans

When you create a function app that uses the App Service plan, we recommend that you select a single-vCPU plan rather than a plan with multiple vCPUs. Today, Functions runs JavaScript functions more efficiently on single-vCPU VMs, and using larger VMs does not produce the expected performance improvements. When necessary, you can manually scale out by adding more single-vCPU VM instances, or you can enable autoscale. For more information, see [Scale instance count manually or automatically](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-how-to-scale.md?toc=%2fazure%2fapp-service%2ftoc.json).

### Cold Start

When developing Azure Functions in the serverless hosting model, cold starts are a reality. *Cold start* refers to the fact that when your function app starts for the first time after a period of inactivity, it takes longer to start up. For JavaScript functions with large dependency trees in particular, cold start can be significant. To speed up the cold start process, [run your functions as a package file](run-functions-from-deployment-package.md) when possible. Many deployment methods use the run from package model by default, but if you're experiencing large cold starts and are not running this way, this change can offer a significant improvement.

### Connection Limits

When you use a service-specific client in an Azure Functions application, don't create a new client with every function invocation. Instead, create a single, static client in the global scope. For more information, see [managing connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections.md).

### Use `async` and `await`

When writing Azure Functions in JavaScript, you should write code using the `async` and `await` keywords. Writing code using `async` and `await` instead of callbacks or `.then` and `.catch` with Promises helps avoid two common problems:
 - Throwing uncaught exceptions that [crash the Node.js process](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_warning_using_uncaughtexception_correctly), potentially affecting the execution of other functions.
 - Unexpected behavior, such as missing logs from context.log, caused by asynchronous calls that are not properly awaited.

In the example below, the asynchronous method `fs.readFile` is invoked with an error-first callback function as its second parameter. This code causes both of the issues mentioned above. An exception that is not explicitly caught in the correct scope crashed the entire process (issue #1). Calling `context.done()` outside of the scope of the callback function means that the function invocation may end before the file is read (issue #2). In this example, calling `context.done()` too early results in missing log entries starting with `Data from file:`.

```javascript
// NOT RECOMMENDED PATTERN
const fs = require('fs');

module.exports = function (context) {
    fs.readFile('./hello.txt', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            context.log.error('ERROR', err);
            // BUG #1: This will result in an uncaught exception that crashes the entire process
            throw err;
        }
        context.log(`Data from file: ${data}`);
        // context.done() should be called here
    });
    // BUG #2: Data is not guaranteed to be read before the Azure Function's invocation ends
    context.done();
}
```

Using the `async` and `await` keywords helps avoid both of these errors. You should use the Node.js utility function [`util.promisify`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original) to turn error-first callback-style functions into awaitable functions.

In the example below, any unhandled exceptions thrown during the function execution only fail the individual invocation that raised an exception. The `await` keyword means that steps following `readFileAsync` only execute after `readFile` is complete. With `async` and `await`, you also don't need to call the `context.done()` callback.

```javascript
// Recommended pattern
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');
const readFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

module.exports = async function (context) {
    let data;
    try {
        data = await readFileAsync('./hello.txt');
    } catch (err) {
        context.log.error('ERROR', err);
        // This rethrown exception will be handled by the Functions Runtime and will only fail the individual invocation
        throw err;
    }
    context.log(`Data from file: ${data}`);
}
```
