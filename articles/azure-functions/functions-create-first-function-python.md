# Create an HTTP triggered function in Azure

This article shows you how to use command-line tools to create a Python project that runs in Azure Functions. You also create a function that is triggered by an HTTP request. Finally, you publish your project to run as a [serverless function](functions-scale.md#consumption-plan) in Azure.

This article is the first of two Python quickstarts for Azure Functions. After you complete this quickstart, you can [add an Azure Storage queue output binding](functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-python.md) to your function.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must:

+ Install [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This version of Python is verified with Functions. 3.7 and later versions are not yet supported.

+ Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-run-local.md#v2) version 2.7.1575 or a later version.

+ Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.x or a later version.

+ Have an active Azure subscription.

## Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)

You should use a Python 3.6.x environment to locally develop Python functions. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`.

> [!NOTE]
> If Python didn't install venv on your Linux distribution, you can install it using the following command:
> ```command
> sudo apt-get install python3-venv

### Bash:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### PowerShell or a Windows command prompt:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate
```

Now that you activated the virtual environment, run the remaining commands in it. To get out of the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

## Create a local functions project

A functions project is the equivalent of a function app in Azure. It can have multiple functions that all share the same local and hosting configurations.

1. In the virtual environment, run the following command:

    ```console
    func init MyFunctionProj
    ```

1. Select **python** as your worker runtime.

    The command creates a _MyFunctionProj_ folder. It contains these three files:

    * *local.settings.json*: used to store app settings and connection strings when running locally. This file doesn't get published to Azure.
    * *requirements.txt*: contains the list of packages the system will install on publishing to Azure.
    * *host.json*: contains global configuration options that affect all functions in a function app. This file does get published to Azure.

1. Go to the new *MyFunctionProj* folder:

    ```console
    cd MyFunctionProj
    ```

## Create a function

Add a function to the new project.

1. To add a function to your project, run the following command:

    ```console
    func new
    ```

1. Use your down-arrow to select the **HTTP trigger** template.

1. When you're prompted for a function name, enter *HttpTrigger* and then press Enter.

These commands create a subfolder named _HttpTrigger_. It contains the following files:

* *function.json*: configuration file that defines the function, trigger, and other bindings. Notice that in this file, the value for `scriptFile` points to the file containing the function, and the `bindings` array defines the invocation trigger and bindings.

    Each binding requires a direction, type and a unique name. The HTTP trigger has an input binding of type [`httpTrigger`](functions-bindings-http-webhook.md#trigger) and output binding of type [`http`](functions-bindings-http-webhook.md#output).

* *\_\_init\_\_.py*: script file that is your HTTP triggered function. Notice that this script has a default `main()`. HTTP data from the trigger passes to the function using the `req` named `binding parameter`. The `req`, which is defined in function.json, is an instance of the [azure.functions.HttpRequest class](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.httprequest). 

    The return object, defined as `$return` in *function.json*, is an instance of [azure.functions.HttpResponse class](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.httpresponse). To learn more, see [Azure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings](functions-bindings-http-webhook.md).

## Run the function locally

The function runs locally using the Azure Functions runtime.

1. This command starts the function app:

    ```console
    func host start
    ```

    When the Azure Functions host starts, it writes something like the following output. It's truncated here so you can read it better:

    ```output
    
                      %%%%%%
                     %%%%%%
                @   %%%%%%    @
              @@   %%%%%%      @@
           @@@    %%%%%%%%%%%    @@@

             @@      %%%       @@
               @@    %%      @@
                    %%
                    %
    
    ...
    
    Content root path: C:\functions\MyFunctionProj
    Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7071
    Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    
    ...
    
    Http Functions:
    
            HttpTrigger: http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTrigger
    
    [8/27/2018 10:38:27 PM] Host started (29486ms)
    [8/27/2018 10:38:27 PM] Job host started
    ```

1. Copy the URL of your `HttpTrigger` function from the runtime output and paste it into your browser's address bar.

1. Append the query string `?name=<yourname>` to this URL and execute the request. The following screenshot shows the response to the GET request that the local function returns to the browser:

    ![Verify locally in the browser](./media/functions-create-first-function-python/function-test-local-browser.png)

1. Select Ctrl+C to shut down your function app.

Now that you have run your function locally, you can create the function app and other required resources in Azure.

[!INCLUDE [functions-create-resource-group](../../includes/functions-create-resource-group.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-create-storage-account](../../includes/functions-create-storage-account.md)]

## Create a function app in Azure

A function app provides an environment for executing your function code. It lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

Run the following command. Replace `<APP_NAME>` with a unique function app name. Replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with a storage account name. The `<APP_NAME>` is also the default DNS domain for the function app. This name needs to be unique across all apps in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't host Linux and Windows apps in the same resource group. If you have an existing resource group named `myResourceGroup` with a Windows function app or web app, you must use a different resource group.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --os-type Linux \
--consumption-plan-location westeurope  --runtime python \
--name <APP_NAME> --storage-account  <STORAGE_NAME>
```

The preceding command also provisions an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group. You can use this instance to monitor your function app and view logs.

You're now ready to publish your local functions project to the function app in Azure.

## Deploy the function app project to Azure

After you create the function app in Azure, you can use the [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#project-file-deployment) Core Tools command to deploy your project code to Azure. In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your app.

```console
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME> --build remote
```

The `--build remote` option builds your Python project remotely in Azure from the files in the deployment package. 

You'll see output similar to the following message. It's truncated here so you can read it better:

```output
Getting site publishing info...
...

Preparing archive...
Uploading content...
Upload completed successfully.
Deployment completed successfully.
Syncing triggers...
Functions in myfunctionapp:
    HttpTrigger - [httpTrigger]
        Invoke url: https://myfunctionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger?code=cCr8sAxfBiow548FBDLS1....
```

You can copy the `Invoke url` value for your `HttpTrigger` and use it to verify your function in Azure. The URL contains a `code` query string value that is your function key, which makes it difficult for others to call your HTTP trigger endpoint in Azure.
