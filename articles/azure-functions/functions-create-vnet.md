# Tutorial: Integrate Azure Functions with an Azure virtual network by using private endpoints

This tutorial shows you how to use Azure Functions to connect to resources in an Azure virtual network by using private endpoints. You'll create a function by using a storage account that's locked behind a virtual network. The virtual network uses a service bus queue trigger.

In this tutorial, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a function app in the Premium plan.
> * Create Azure resources, such as the service bus, storage account, and virtual network.
> * Lock down your storage account behind a private endpoint.
> * Lock down your service bus behind a private endpoint.
> * Deploy a function app that uses both the service bus and HTTP triggers.
> * Lock down your function app behind a private endpoint.
> * Test to see that your function app is secure inside the virtual network.
> * Clean up resources.

## Create a function app in a Premium plan

You'll create a .NET function app in the Premium plan because this tutorial uses C#. Other languages are also supported in Windows. The Premium plan provides serverless scale while supporting virtual network integration.

1. On the Azure portal menu or the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.

1. On the **New** page, select **Compute** > **Function App**.

1. Your initial deployment might take a few minutes. When your app is successfully deployed, on the **Logs** tab, you see a **Success (Active)** status message. If necessary, refresh the page.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your sample function app.

## Lock down your function app

Now create the private endpoint to lock down your function app. This private endpoint will connect your function app privately and securely to your virtual network by using a private IP address. 

For more information, see the [private endpoint documentation](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md).

1. In your function app, in the menu on the left, select **Networking**.

1. Under **Private Endpoint Connections**, select **Configure your private endpoint connections**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-create-vnet/14-navigate-app-private-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to navigate to a function app private endpoint.":::

1. Select **Add**.

1. On the pane that opens, use the following private endpoint settings:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-create-vnet/15-create-app-private-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to create a function app private endpoint. The name is functionapp-endpoint. The subscription is 'Private Test Sub CACHHAI'. The virtual network is MyVirtualNet-tutorial. The subnet is default.":::

1. Select **OK** to add the private endpoint. 
 
Congratulations! You've successfully secured your function app, service bus, and storage account by adding private endpoints!

### Test your locked-down function app

1. In your function app, in the menu on the left, select **Functions**.

1. Select **ServiceBusQueueTrigger**.

1. In the menu on the left, select **Monitor**. 
 
You'll see that you can't monitor your app. Your browser doesn't have access to the virtual network, so it can't directly access resources within the virtual network. 
 
Here's an alternative way to monitor your function by using Application Insights:

1. In your function app, in the menu on the left, select **Application Insights**. Then select **View Application Insights data**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-create-vnet/16-app-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to view application insights for a function app.":::

1. In the menu on the left, select **Live metrics**.

1. Open a new tab. In your service bus, in the menu on the left, select **Queues**.

1. Select your queue.

1. In the menu on the left, select **Service Bus Explorer**. Under **Send**, for **Content Type**, choose **Text/Plain**. Then enter a message. 

1. Select **Send** to send the message.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-create-vnet/17-send-service-bus-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to send service bus messages by using the portal.":::

1. On the **Live metrics** tab, you should see that your service bus queue trigger has fired. If it hasn't, resend the message from **Service Bus Explorer**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-create-vnet/18-hello-world.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to view messages by using live metrics for function apps.":::

Congratulations! You've successfully tested your function app setup with private endpoints.

## Understand private DNS zones
You've used a private endpoint to connect to Azure resources. You're connecting to a private IP address instead of the public endpoint. Existing Azure services are configured to use an existing DNS to connect to the public endpoint. You must override the DNS configuration to connect to the private endpoint.

A private DNS zone is created for each Azure resource that was configured with a private endpoint. A DNS record is created for each private IP address associated with the private endpoint.

The following DNS zones were created in this tutorial:

- privatelink.file.core.windows.net
- privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
- privatelink.servicebus.windows.net
- privatelink.azurewebsites.net
