# Create your first function using Visual Studio Code

Azure Functions lets you execute your code in a [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/) environment without having to first create a VM or publish a web application.

In this article, you learn how to use the [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code] to create and test a "hello world" function on your local computer using Microsoft Visual Studio Code. You then publish the function code to Azure from Visual Studio Code.

The extension currently supports C#, JavaScript, Java, and Python functions. The steps in this article and the article that follows support only JavaScript and C# functions. To learn how to use Visual Studio Code to create and publish Python functions, see [Create and deploy serverless Azure Functions in Python with Visual Studio Code](/azure/python/tutorial-vs-code-serverless-python-01). To learn how to use Visual Studio Code to create and publish PowerShell functions, see [Create your first PowerShell function in Azure](functions-create-first-function-powershell.md). 

The extension is currently in preview. To learn more, see the [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code] extension page.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart:

* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).

* Install version 2.x of the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#v2).

* Install the specific requirements for your chosen language:

    | Language | Requirement |
    | -------- | --------- |
    | **C#** | [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)  |
    | **JavaScript** | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)<sup>*</sup> | 
 
    <sup>*</sup>Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (8.11.1 and 10.14.1 recommended).

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Run the function in Azure

1. Copy the URL of the HTTP trigger from the **Output** panel. This URL includes the function key, which is passed to the `code` query parameter. As before, make sure to add the query string `?name=<yourname>` to the end of this URL and execute the request.

    The URL that calls your HTTP-triggered function should be in the following format:

        http://<functionappname>.azurewebsites.net/api/<functionname>?code=<function_key>&name=<yourname> 

1. Paste this new URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar. The following shows the response in the browser to the remote GET request returned by the function:

## Next steps

You have used Visual Studio Code to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next article, you expand that function by adding an output binding. This binding writes the string from the HTTP request to a message in an Azure Queue Storage queue. The next article also shows you how to clean up these new Azure resources by removing the resource group you created.
