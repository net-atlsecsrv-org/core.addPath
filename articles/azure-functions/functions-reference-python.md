# Azure Functions Python developer guide

This article is an introduction to developing Azure Functions using Python. The content below assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developers guide](functions-reference.md). 

For standalone Function sample projects in Python, see the [Python Functions samples](/samples/browse/?products=azure-functions&languages=python). 

## Programming model

Azure Functions expects a function to be a stateless method in your Python script that processes input and produces output. By default, the runtime expects the method to be implemented as a global method called `main()` in the `__init__.py` file. You can also [specify an alternate entry point](#alternate-entry-point).

Data from triggers and bindings is bound to the function via method attributes using the `name` property defined in the *function.json* file. For example, the  _function.json_ below describes a simple function triggered by an HTTP request named `req`:

:::code language="son" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-Python/function.json":::

Based on this definition, the `__init__.py` file that contains the function code might look like the following example:

```python
def main(req):
    user = req.params.get('user')
    return f'Hello, {user}!'
```

You can also explicitly declare the attribute types and return type in the function using Python type annotations. This helps you use the intellisense and autocomplete features provided by many Python code editors.

```python
import azure.functions


def main(req: azure.functions.HttpRequest) -> str:
    user = req.params.get('user')
    return f'Hello, {user}!'
```

Use the Python annotations included in the [azure.functions.*](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions?view=azure-python) package to bind input and outputs to your methods.

## Alternate entry point

You can change the default behavior of a function by optionally specifying the `scriptFile` and `entryPoint` properties in the *function.json* file. For example, the _function.json_ below tells the runtime to use the `customentry()` method in the _main.py_ file, as the entry point for your Azure Function.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "main.py",
  "entryPoint": "customentry",
  "bindings": [
      ...
  ]
}
```

## Folder structure

The recommended folder structure for a Python Functions project looks like the following example:

```
 __app__
 | - my_first_function
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | | - example.py
 | - my_second_function
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | - shared_code
 | | - my_first_helper_function.py
 | | - my_second_helper_function.py
 | - host.json
 | - requirements.txt
 tests
```
The main project folder (\_\_app\_\_) can contain the following files:

* *local.settings.json*: Used to store app settings and connection strings when running locally. This file doesn't get published to Azure. To learn more, see [local.settings.file](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file).
* *requirements.txt*: Contains the list of packages the system installs when publishing to Azure.
* *host.json*: Contains global configuration options that affect all functions in a function app. This file does get published to Azure. Not all options are supported when running locally. To learn more, see [host.json](functions-host-json.md).
* *.funcignore*: (Optional) declares files that shouldn't get published to Azure.
* *.gitignore*: (Optional) declares files that are excluded from a git repo, such as local.settings.json.

Each function has its own code file and binding configuration file (function.json). 

When deploying your project to a function app in Azure, the entire contents of the main project (*\_\_app\_\_*) folder should be included in the package, but not the folder itself. We recommend that you maintain your tests in a folder separate from the project folder, in this example `tests`. This keeps you from deploying test code with your app. For more information, see [Unit Testing](#unit-testing).

## Import behavior

You can import modules in your function code using both explicit relative and absolute references. Based on the folder structure shown above, the following imports work from within the function file *\_\_app\_\_\my\_first\_function\\_\_init\_\_.py*:

```python
from . import example #(explicit relative)
```

```python
from ..shared_code import my_first_helper_function #(explicit relative)
```

```python
from __app__ import shared_code #(absolute)
```

```python
import __app__.shared_code #(absolute)
```

The following imports *don't work* from within the same file:

```python
import example
```

```python
from example import some_helper_code
```

```python
import shared_code
```

Shared code should be kept in a separate folder in *\_\_app\_\_*. To reference modules in the *shared\_code* folder, you can use the following syntax:

```python
from __app__.shared_code import my_first_helper_function
```

## Triggers and Inputs

Inputs are divided into two categories in Azure Functions: trigger input and additional input. Although they are different in the `function.json` file, usage is identical in Python code.  Connection strings or secrets for trigger and input sources map to values in the `local.settings.json` file when running locally, and the application settings when running in Azure. 

For example, the following code demonstrates the difference between the two:

```json
// function.json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "route": "items/{id}"
    },
    {
      "name": "obj",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "blob",
      "path": "samples/{id}",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// local.settings.json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<azure-storage-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

```python
# __init__.py
import azure.functions as func
import logging


def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         obj: func.InputStream):

    logging.info(f'Python HTTP triggered function processed: {obj.read()}')
```

When the function is invoked, the HTTP request is passed to the function as `req`. An entry will be retrieved from the Azure Blob Storage based on the _ID_ in the route URL and made available as `obj` in the function body.  Here, the storage account specified is the connection string found in the AzureWebJobsStorage app setting, which is the same storage account used by the function app.


## Outputs

Output can be expressed both in return value and output parameters. If there's only one output, we recommend using the return value. For multiple outputs, you'll have to use output parameters.

To use the return value of a function as the value of an output binding, the `name` property of the binding should be set to `$return` in `function.json`.

To produce multiple outputs, use the `set()` method provided by the [`azure.functions.Out`](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out?view=azure-python) interface to assign a value to the binding. For example, the following function can push a message to a queue and also return an HTTP response.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous"
    },
    {
      "name": "msg",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "queue",
      "queueName": "outqueue",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

```python
import azure.functions as func


def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         msg: func.Out[func.QueueMessage]) -> str:

    message = req.params.get('body')
    msg.set(message)
    return message
```

## Logging

Access to the Azure Functions runtime logger is available via a root [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) handler in your function app. This logger is tied to Application Insights and allows you to flag warnings and errors encountered during the function execution.

The following example logs an info message when the function is invoked via an HTTP trigger.

```python
import logging


def main(req):
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
```

Additional logging methods are available that let you write to the console at different trace levels:

| Method                 | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **`critical(_message_)`**   | Writes a message with level CRITICAL on the root logger.  |
| **`error(_message_)`**   | Writes a message with level ERROR on the root logger.    |
| **`warning(_message_)`**    | Writes a message with level WARNING on the root logger.  |
| **`info(_message_)`**    | Writes a message with level INFO on the root logger.  |
| **`debug(_message_)`** | Writes a message with level DEBUG on the root logger.  |

To learn more about logging, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md).

## HTTP Trigger and bindings

The HTTP trigger is defined in the function.jon file. The `name` of the binding must match the named parameter in the function. 
In the previous examples, a binding name `req` is used. This parameter is an [HttpRequest] object, and an [HttpResponse] object is returned.

From the [HttpRequest] object, you can get request headers, query parameters, route parameters, and the message body. 

The following example is from the [HTTP trigger template for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-templates/tree/dev/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-Python). 

```python
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    headers = {"my-http-header": "some-value"}

    name = req.params.get('name')
    if not name:
        try:
            req_body = req.get_json()
        except ValueError:
            pass
        else:
            name = req_body.get('name')
            
    if name:
        return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello {name}!", headers=headers)
    else:
        return func.HttpResponse(
             "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body",
             headers=headers, status_code=400
        )
```

In this function, the value of the `name` query parameter is obtained from the `params` parameter of the [HttpRequest] object. The JSON-encoded message body is read using the `get_json` method. 

Likewise, you can set the `status_code` and `headers` for the response message in the returned [HttpResponse] object.

## Scaling and concurrency

By default, Azure Functions automatically monitors the load on your application and creates additional host instances for Python as needed. Functions uses built-in (not user configurable) thresholds for different trigger types to decide when to add instances, such as the age of messages and queue size for QueueTrigger. For more information, see [How the Consumption and Premium plans work](functions-scale.md#how-the-consumption-and-premium-plans-work).

This scaling behavior is sufficient for many applications. Applications with any of the following characteristics, however, may not scale as effectively:

- The application needs to handle many concurrent invocations.
- The application processes a large number of I/O events.
- The application is I/O bound.

In such cases, you can improve performance further by employing async patterns and by using multiple language worker processes.

### Async

Because Python is a single-threaded runtime, a host instance for Python can process only one function invocation at a time. For applications that process a large number of I/O events and/or is I/O bound, you can improve performance by running functions asynchronously.

To run a function asynchronously, use the `async def` statement, which runs the function with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) directly:

```python
async def main():
    await some_nonblocking_socket_io_op()
```

A function without the `async` keyword is run automatically in an asyncio thread-pool:

```python
# Runs in an asyncio thread-pool

def main():
    some_blocking_socket_io()
```

### Use multiple language worker processes

By default, every Functions host instance has a single language worker process. You can increase the number of worker processes per host (up to 10) by using the [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT](functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_process_count) application setting. Azure Functions then tries to evenly distribute simultaneous function invocations across these workers. 

The FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT applies to each host that Functions creates when scaling out your application to meet demand. 

## Context

To get the invocation context of a function during execution, include the [`context`](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.context?view=azure-python) argument in its signature. 

For example:

```python
import azure.functions


def main(req: azure.functions.HttpRequest,
         context: azure.functions.Context) -> str:
    return f'{context.invocation_id}'
```

The [**Context**](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.context?view=azure-python) class has the following string attributes:

`function_directory`  
The directory in which the function is running.

`function_name`  
Name of the function.

`invocation_id`  
ID of the current function invocation.

## Global variables

It is not guaranteed that the state of your app will be preserved for future executions. However, the Azure Functions runtime often reuses the same process for multiple executions of the same app. In order to cache the results of an expensive computation, declare it as a global variable. 

```python
CACHED_DATA = None


def main(req):
    global CACHED_DATA
    if CACHED_DATA is None:
        CACHED_DATA = load_json()

    # ... use CACHED_DATA in code
```

## Environment variables

In Functions, [application settings](functions-app-settings.md), such as service connection strings, are exposed as environment variables during execution. You can access these settings by declaring `import os` and then using, `setting = os.environ["setting-name"]`.

The following example gets the [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings), with the key named `myAppSetting`:

```python
import logging
import os
import azure.functions as func

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:

    # Get the setting named 'myAppSetting'
    my_app_setting_value = os.environ["myAppSetting"]
    logging.info(f'My app setting value:{my_app_setting_value}')
```

For local development, application settings are [maintained in the local.settings.json file](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file).  

## Python version 

Azure Functions supports the following Python versions:

| Functions version | Python<sup>*</sup> versions |
| ----- | ----- |
| 3.x | 3.8<br/>3.7<br/>3.6 |
| 2.x | 3.7<br/>3.6 |

<sup>*</sup>Official CPython distributions

To request a specific Python version when you create your function app in Azure, use the `--runtime-version` option of the [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. The Functions runtime version is set by the `--functions-version` option. The Python version is set when the function app is created and can't be changed.  

When running locally, the runtime uses the available Python version. 

## Package management

When developing locally using the Azure Functions Core Tools or Visual Studio Code, add the names and versions of the required packages to the `requirements.txt` file and install them using `pip`. 

For example, the following requirements file and pip command can be used to install the `requests` package from PyPI.

```txt
requests==2.19.1
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Publishing to Azure

When you're ready to publish, make sure that all your publicly available dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file, which is located at the root of your project directory. 

Project files and folders that are excluded from publishing, including the virtual environment folder, are listed in the .funcignore file.

There are three build actions supported for publishing your Python project to Azure:

+ Remote build: Dependencies are obtained remotely based on the contents of the requirements.txt file. [Remote build](functions-deployment-technologies.md#remote-build) is the recommended build method. Remote is also the default build option of Azure tooling. 
+ Local build: Dependencies are obtained locally based on the contents of the requirements.txt file. 
+ Custom dependencies: Your project uses packages not publicly available to our tools. (Requires Docker.)

To build your dependencies and publish using a continuous delivery (CD) system, [use Azure Pipelines](functions-how-to-azure-devops.md).

### Remote build

By default, the Azure Functions Core Tools requests a remote build when you use the following [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#publish) command to publish your Python project to Azure. 

```bash
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```

Remember to replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app in Azure.

The [Azure Functions Extension for Visual Studio Code](functions-create-first-function-vs-code.md#publish-the-project-to-azure) also requests a remote build by default. 

### Local build

You can prevent doing a remote build by using the following [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#publish) command to publish with a local build. 

```command
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME> --build local
```

Remember to replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app in Azure. 

Using the `--build local` option, project dependencies are read from the requirements.txt file and those dependent packages are downloaded and installed locally. Project files and dependencies are deployed from your local computer to Azure. This results in a larger deployment package being uploaded to Azure. If for some reason, dependencies in your requirements.txt file can't be acquired by Core Tools, you must use the custom dependencies option for publishing. 

### Custom dependencies

If your project uses packages not publicly available to our tools, you can make them available to your app by putting them in the \_\_app\_\_/.python_packages directory. Before publishing, run the following command to install the dependencies locally:

```command
pip install  --target="<PROJECT_DIR>/.python_packages/lib/site-packages"  -r requirements.txt
```

When using custom dependencies, you should use the `--no-build` publishing option, since you have already installed the dependencies.  

```command
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME> --no-build
```

Remember to replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app in Azure.

## Unit Testing

Functions written in Python can be tested like other Python code using standard testing frameworks. For most bindings, it's possible to create a mock input object by creating an instance of an appropriate class from the `azure.functions` package. Since the [`azure.functions`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-functions/) package is not immediately available, be sure to install it via your `requirements.txt` file as described in the [package management](#package-management) section above. 

For example, following is a mock test of an HTTP triggered function:

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "entryPoint": "my_function",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}
```

```python
# __app__/HttpTrigger/__init__.py
import azure.functions as func
import logging

def my_function(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')

    name = req.params.get('name')
    if not name:
        try:
            req_body = req.get_json()
        except ValueError:
            pass
        else:
            name = req_body.get('name')

    if name:
        return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello {name}")
    else:
        return func.HttpResponse(
             "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body",
             status_code=400
        )
```

```python
# tests/test_httptrigger.py
import unittest

import azure.functions as func
from __app__.HttpTrigger import my_function

class TestFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_my_function(self):
        # Construct a mock HTTP request.
        req = func.HttpRequest(
            method='GET',
            body=None,
            url='/api/HttpTrigger',
            params={'name': 'Test'})

        # Call the function.
        resp = my_function(req)

        # Check the output.
        self.assertEqual(
            resp.get_body(),
            b'Hello Test',
        )
```

Here is another example, with a queue triggered function:

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "entryPoint": "my_function",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "msg",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "queueName": "python-queue-items",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    }
  ]
}
```

```python
# __app__/QueueTrigger/__init__.py
import azure.functions as func

def my_function(msg: func.QueueMessage) -> str:
    return f'msg body: {msg.get_body().decode()}'
```

```python
# tests/test_queuetrigger.py
import unittest

import azure.functions as func
from __app__.QueueTrigger import my_function

class TestFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_my_function(self):
        # Construct a mock Queue message.
        req = func.QueueMessage(
            body=b'test')

        # Call the function.
        resp = my_function(req)

        # Check the output.
        self.assertEqual(
            resp,
            'msg body: test',
        )
```
## Temporary files

The `tempfile.gettempdir()` method returns a temporary folder, which on Linux is `/tmp`. Your application can use this directory to store temporary files generated and used by your functions during execution. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Files written to the temporary directory aren't guaranteed to persist across invocations. During scale out, temporary files aren't shared between instances. 

The following example creates a named temporary file in the temporary directory (`/tmp`):

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import tempfile
from os import listdir

#---
   tempFilePath = tempfile.gettempdir()   
   fp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()     
   fp.write(b'Hello world!')              
   filesDirListInTemp = listdir(tempFilePath)     
```   

We recommend that you maintain your tests in a folder separate from the project folder. This keeps you from deploying test code with your app. 

## Known issues and FAQ

All known issues and feature requests are tracked using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/issues) list. If you run into a problem and can't find the issue in GitHub, open a new issue and include a detailed description of the problem.

### Cross-origin resource sharing

Azure Functions supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). CORS is configured [in the portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#cors) and through the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/functionapp/cors). The CORS allowed origins list applies at the function app level. With CORS enabled, responses include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. For more information, see [Cross-origin resource sharing](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#cors).

The allowed origins list [isn't currently supported](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/issues/444) for Python function apps. Because of this limitation, you must expressly set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in your HTTP functions, as shown in the following example:

```python
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:

    # Define the allow origin headers.
    headers = {"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://contoso.com"}

    # Set the headers in the response.
    return func.HttpResponse(
            f"Allowed origin '{headers}'.",
            headers=headers, status_code=200
    )
``` 

Make sure that you also update your function.json to support the OPTIONS HTTP method:

```json
    ...
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post",
        "options"
      ]
    ...
```

This HTTP method is used by web browsers to negotiate the allowed origins list.
