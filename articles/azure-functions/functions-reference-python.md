# Azure Functions Python developer guide

This article is an introduction to developing Azure Functions using Python. The content below assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developers guide](functions-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [functions-python-preview-note](../../includes/functions-python-preview-note.md)]

## Programming model

An Azure Function should be a stateless method in your Python script that processes input and produces output. By default, the runtime expects the method to be implemented as a global method called `main()` in the `__init__.py` file.

You can change the default  configuration by specifying the `scriptFile` and `entryPoint` properties in the `function.json` file. For example, the _function.json_ below tells the runtime to use the _customentry()_ method in the _main.py_ file, as the entry point for your Azure Function.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "main.py",
  "entryPoint": "customentry",
  ...
}
```

Data from triggers and bindings is bound to the function via method attributes using the `name` property defined in the `function.json` configuration file. For example, the  _function.json_ below describes a simple function triggered by an HTTP request named `req`:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous"
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `__init__.py` file contains the following function code:

```python
def main(req):
    user = req.params.get('user')
    return f'Hello, {user}!'
```

Optionally, you can also declare the parameter types and return type in the function using Python type annotations. For example, the same function can be written using annotations, as follows:

```python
import azure.functions

def main(req: azure.functions.HttpRequest) -> str:
    user = req.params.get('user')
    return f'Hello, {user}!'
```  

Use the Python annotations included in the [azure.functions.*](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions?view=azure-python) package to bind input and outputs to your methods. 

## Folder structure

The folder structure for a Python Functions project looks like the following:

```
 FunctionApp
 | - MyFirstFunction
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | - MySecondFunction
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | - SharedCode
 | | - myFirstHelperFunction.py
 | | - mySecondHelperFunction.py
 | - host.json
 | - requirements.txt
 | - extensions.csproj
 | - bin
```

There's a shared [host.json](functions-host-json.md) file that can be used to configure the function app. Each function has its own code file and binding configuration file (function.json). 

Shared code should be kept in a separate folder. To reference modules in the SharedCode folder, you can use the following syntax:

```
from ..SharedCode import myFirstHelperFunction
```

Binding extensions used by the Functions runtime are defined in the `extensions.csproj` file, with the actual library files in the `bin` folder. When developing locally, you must [register binding extensions](./functions-bindings-register.md#local-development-with-azure-functions-core-tools-and-extension-bundles) using Azure Functions Core Tools. 

When deploying a Functions project to your function app in Azure, the entire content of the FunctionApp folder should be included in the package, but not the folder itself.

## Triggers and Inputs

Inputs are divided into two categories in Azure Functions: trigger input and additional input. Although they are different in `function.json`, the usage is identical in Python code.  Connection strings for trigger and input sources should map to values in the `local.settings.json` file locally, and the application settings when running in Azure. Let's take the following code snippet as an example:

```json
// function.json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "route": "items/{id}"
    },
    {
      "name": "obj",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "blob",
      "path": "samples/{id}",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// local.settings.json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<azure-storage-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

```python
# __init__.py
import azure.functions as func
import logging

def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         obj: func.InputStream):

    logging.info(f'Python HTTP triggered function processed: {obj.read()}')
```

When the function is invoked, the HTTP request is passed to the function as `req`. An entry will be retrieved from the Azure Blob Storage based on the _ID_ in the route URL and made available as `obj` in the function body.  Here the storage account specified is the connection string found in `AzureWebJobsStorage` which is the same storage account used by the function app.


## Outputs

Output can be expressed both in return value and output parameters. If there's only one output, we recommend using the return value. For multiple outputs, you'll have to use output parameters.

To use the return value of a function as the value of an output binding, the `name` property of the binding should be set to `$return` in `function.json`.

To produce multiple outputs, use the `set()` method provided by the `azure.functions.Out` interface to assign a value to the binding. For example, the following function can push a message to a queue and also return an HTTP response.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous"
    },
    {
      "name": "msg",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "queue",
      "queueName": "outqueue",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

```python
import azure.functions as func

def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         msg: func.Out[func.QueueMessage]) -> str:

    message = req.params.get('body')
    msg.set(message)
    return message
```

## Logging

Access to the Azure Functions runtime logger is available via a root [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) handler in your function app. This logger is tied to Application Insights and allows you to flag warnings and errors encountered during the function execution.

The following example logs an info message when the function is invoked via an HTTP trigger.

```python
import logging

def main(req):
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
```

Additional logging methods are available that let you write to the console at different trace levels:

| Method                 | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| logging.**critical(_message_)**   | Writes a message with level CRITICAL on the root logger.  |
| logging.**error(_message_)**   | Writes a message with level ERROR on the root logger.    |
| logging.**warning(_message_)**    | Writes a message with level WARNING on the root logger.  |
| logging.**info(_message_)**    | Writes a message with level INFO on the root logger.  |
| logging.**debug(_message_)** | Writes a message with level DEBUG on the root logger.  |

## Importing shared code into a function module

Python modules published alongside function modules must be imported using the relative import syntax:

```python
from . import helpers  # Use more dots to navigate up the folder structure.
def main(req: func.HttpRequest):
    helpers.process_http_request(req)
```

Alternatively, put shared code into a standalone package, publish it to a public or a private
PyPI instance, and specify it as a regular dependency.

## Async

Since only a single Python process can exist per function app, it is recommended to implement your Azure Function as an asynchronous coroutine using the `async def` statement.

```python
# Will be run with asyncio directly
async def main():
    await some_nonblocking_socket_io_op()
```

If the main() function is synchronous (no `async` qualifier) we automatically run it in an `asyncio` thread-pool.

```python
# Would be run in an asyncio thread-pool
def main():
    some_blocking_socket_io()
```

## Context

To get the invocation context of a function during execution, include the `context` argument in its signature. 

For example:

```python
import azure.functions

def main(req: azure.functions.HttpRequest,
            context: azure.functions.Context) -> str:
    return f'{context.invocation_id}'
```

The **Context** class has the following methods:

`function_directory`  
The directory in which the function is running.

`function_name`  
Name of the function.

`invocation_id`  
ID of the current function invocation.

## Python version and package management

Currently, Azure Functions only supports Python 3.6.x (official CPython distribution).

When developing locally using the Azure Functions Core Tools or Visual Studio Code, add the names and versions of the required packages to the `requirements.txt` file and install them using `pip`.

For example, the following requirements file and pip command can be used to install the `requests` package from PyPI.

```bash
pip install requests
```

```txt
requests==2.19.1
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you're ready for publishing, make sure that all your dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, located at the root of your project directory. To successfully execute your Azure Functions, the requirements file should contain a minimum of the following packages:

```txt
azure-functions
azure-functions-worker
grpcio==1.14.1
grpcio-tools==1.14.1
protobuf==3.6.1
six==1.11.0
```

## Publishing to Azure

If you're using a package that requires a compiler and does not support the installation of manylinux-compatible wheels from PyPI, publishing to Azure will fail with the following error: 

```
There was an error restoring dependencies.ERROR: cannot install <package name - version> dependency: binary dependencies without wheels are not supported.  
The terminal process terminated with exit code: 1
```

To automatically build and configure the required binaries, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your local machine and run the following command to publish using the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#v2) (func). Remember to replace `<app name>` with the name of your function app in Azure. 

```bash
func azure functionapp publish <app name> --build-native-deps
```

Underneath the covers, Core Tools will use docker to run the [mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/python](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/azure-functions/) image as a container on your local machine. Using this environment, it'll then build and install the required modules from source distribution, before packaging them up for final deployment to Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> Core Tools (func) uses the PyInstaller program to freeze the user's code and dependencies into a single stand-alone executable to run in Azure. This functionality is currently in preview and may not extend to all types of Python packages. If you're unable to import your modules, try publishing again using the `--no-bundler` option. 
> ```
> func azure functionapp publish <app_name> --build-native-deps --no-bundler
> ```
> If you continue to experience issues, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/new) and including a description of the problem. 


To build your dependencies and publish using a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) system, you can use an [Azure Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started-yaml?view=vsts) or [Travis CI custom script](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/script/). 

Following is an example `azure-pipelines.yml` script for the build and publishing process.
```yml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '8.x'

- script: |
    set -e
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ wheezy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
    curl -L https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
    echo "install Azure CLI..."
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y azure-cli
    npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools --unsafe-perm true
    echo "installing dotnet core"
    curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash /dev/stdin --channel 2.0
- script: |
    set -e
    az login --service-principal --username "$(APP_ID)" --password "$(PASSWORD)" --tenant "$(TENANT_ID)" 
    func settings add FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME python
    func extensions install
    func azure functionapp publish $(APP_NAME) --build-native-deps
```

Following is an example `.travis.yaml` script for the build and publishing process.

```yml
sudo: required

language: node_js

node_js:
  - "8"

services:
  - docker

before_install:
  - echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ wheezy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
  - curl -L https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  - sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
  - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y azure-cli
  - npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools --unsafe-perm true


script:
  - az login --service-principal --username "$APP_ID" --password "$PASSWORD" --tenant "$TENANT_ID"
  - az account get-access-token --query "accessToken" | func azure functionapp publish $APP_NAME --build-native-deps

```
