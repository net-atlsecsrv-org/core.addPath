# Azure security baseline for Azure Functions

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Functions. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Functions. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Functions have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Functions completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Functions security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Integrate your Azure Functions apps with an Azure virtual network. Function apps running in the Premium plan have the same hosting capabilities as web apps in Azure App Service, which includes the "VNet Integration" feature.  Azure virtual networks allow you to place many of your Azure resources, such as Azure Functions, in a non-internet routable network.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: The [Azure Security Benchmark](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark.md) is the default policy initiative for Security Center and is the foundation for [Security Center's recommendations](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/security-center-recommendations.md). The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/azure-defender.md) plan for the related services.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources and network configurations related to your Azure Functions apps.

If using network security groups with your Azure Functions implementation, enable network security groups flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audits. You may also send network security groups flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: To fully secure your Azure Functions endpoints in production, you should consider implementing one of the following function app-level security options:

- Turn on App Service Authentication or Authorization for your function app

- Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests

- Deploy your function app to an Azure App Service Environment.

In addition, ensure remote debugging has been disabled for your production Azure Functions. Furthermore, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) should not allow all domains to access your function app in Azure. Allow only required domains to interact with your function app.

Consider deploying Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) as part of the networking configuration for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Enable Diagnostic Setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics Workspace.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the Virtual Networks associated with your function apps to guard against DDoS attacks. Use Threat Intelligence features in Azure Security Center Integrated to deny communications with known malicious or unused public IP addresses.

In addition, configure a front-end gateway, such as Azure Web Application Firewall, to authenticate all incoming requests and filter out malicious traffic. Azure Web Application Firewall can help secure your function app by inspecting inbound web traffic to block SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, malware uploads, and DDoS attacks. Introduction of a Web Application Firewall requires either an App Service Environment or use of Private Endpoints. You can use Private Endpoints for your functions hosted in the Premium and App Service plans.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on network security group or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., AzureAppService) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

- [For more information about using service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure Functions. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Web" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Functions. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions for Azure Functions, such as:

- CORS should not allow every resource to access your function apps

- Function app should only be accessible over HTTPS

- Latest TLS version should be used in your function app

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: If using network security group with your Azure Functions implementation, use tags for the NSGs and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual network security group rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration and so on, for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure resources.

Azure Functions also offers built-in integration with Azure Application Insights to monitor functions. Application Insights collects log, performance, and error data. It automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand how your functions are used.

If you have built-in custom security/audit logging within your function app, enable the diagnostics setting "FunctionAppLogs" and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. 

Optionally, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party system information and event management solution.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Control plane access to Azure Functions is controlled through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD does not have the concept of default passwords.

Data plane access can be controlled through several means, including authorization keys, network restrictions, and validating an Azure AD identity. Authorization keys are used by the clients connecting to your Azure Functions HTTP endpoints and can be regenerated at any time. These keys are generated for new HTTP endpoints by default.

Multiple deployment methods are available to function apps, some of which may leverage a set of generated credentials. Review the deployment methods that will be used for your application.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. Function apps should be separated by virtual network (VNet)/subnet and tagged appropriately.

You may also use Private Endpoints to perform network isolation. An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service (for example: function app HTTPs endpoint) powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. You can use Private Endpoints for your functions hosted in the Premium and App Service plans.

The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/azure-defender.md) plan for the related services.

**Azure Policy built-in definitions - Microsoft.Web**:

[!INCLUDE [Resource Policy for Microsoft.Web 4.4](../../includes/policy/standards/asb/rp-controls/microsoft.web-4-4.md)]

### 4.5: Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data

**Guidance**: Not currently available; data identification, classification, and loss prevention features are not currently available for Azure Functions. Tag Function apps that may be processing sensitive information as such and implement third-party solution if required for compliance purposes.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage access to the function app control plane (the Azure portal).

- [How to configure Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.7: Use host-based data loss prevention to enforce access control

**Guidance**: Not applicable; this recommendation is intended for IaaS compute resources.

Microsoft manages the underlying infrastructure for Azure Functions and has implemented strict controls to prevent the loss or exposure of customer data.

- [Understand customer data protection in Azure](../security/fundamentals/protection-customer-data.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: When creating a function app, you must create or link to a general-purpose Azure Storage account that supports Blob, Queue, and Table storage. This is because Functions relies on Azure Storage for operations such as managing triggers and logging function executions. Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest.
