# Azure security baseline for Azure Functions

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Functions contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: Integrate your Azure Functions apps with an Azure virtual network. Function apps running in the Premium plan have the same hosting capabilities as web apps in Azure App Service, which includes the "VNet Integration" feature.  Azure virtual networks allow you to place many of your Azure resources, such as Azure Functions, in a non-internet routable network.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources and network configurations related to your Azure Functions apps.

If using Network Security groups (NSGs) with your Azure Functions implementation, enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audits. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

- [How to Enable NSG Flow Logs](../network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal.md)

- [How to Enable and use Traffic Analytics](../network-watcher/traffic-analytics.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: To fully secure your Azure Function endpoints in production, you should consider implementing one of the following function app-level security options:
- Turn on App Service Authentication / Authorization for your function app,
- Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests, or
- Deploy your function app to an Azure App Service Environment.

In addition, ensure remote debugging has been disabled for your production Azure Functions. Furthermore, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) should not allow all domains to access your Azure Function app. Allow only required domains to interact with your Azure Function app.

Consider deploying Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) as part of the networking configuration for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Enable Diagnostic Setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics Workspace.

- [How to deploy Azure WAF](../web-application-firewall/ag/create-waf-policy-ag.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the Virtual Networks associated with your functions apps to guard against DDoS attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused public IP addresses.
In addition, configure a front-end gateway, such as Azure Web Application Firewall, to authenticate all incoming requests and filter out malicious traffic. Azure Web Application Firewall can help secure your Azure Function apps by inspecting inbound web traffic to block SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, malware uploads, and DDoS attacks. Introduction of a WAF requires either an App Service Environment or use of Private Endpoints (Preview). Ensure that Private Endpoints are no longer in (Preview) before using them with production workloads.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., AzureAppService) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

- [For more information about using service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure Functions. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Web" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Functions. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions for Azure Functions, such as:
- CORS should not allow every resource to access your Function Apps
- Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS
- Latest TLS version should be used in your Function App

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: If using Network Security groups (NSGs) with your Azure Functions implementation, use tags for the NSGs and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: When creating a function app, you must create or link to a general-purpose Azure Storage account that supports Blob, Queue, and Table storage. This is because Functions relies on Azure Storage for operations such as managing triggers and logging function executions. Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For additional control over encryption keys, you can supply customer-managed keys for encryption of blob and file data. These keys must be present in Azure Key Vault for the function app to be able to access the storage account.
