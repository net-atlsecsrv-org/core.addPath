# Monitor scenario in Durable Functions - Weather watcher sample

The monitor pattern refers to a flexible *recurring* process in a workflow - for example, polling until certain conditions are met. This article explains a sample that uses [Durable Functions](durable-functions-overview.md) to implement monitoring.

[!INCLUDE [durable-functions-prerequisites](../../../includes/durable-functions-prerequisites.md)]

## Scenario overview

This sample monitors a location's current weather conditions and alerts a user by SMS when the skies are clear. You could use a regular timer-triggered function to check the weather and send alerts. However, one problem with this approach is **lifetime management**. If only one alert should be sent, the monitor needs to disable itself after clear weather is detected. The monitoring pattern can end its own execution, among other benefits:

* Monitors run on intervals, not schedules: a timer trigger *runs* every hour; a monitor *waits* one hour between actions. A monitor's actions will not overlap unless specified, which can be important for long-running tasks.
* Monitors can have dynamic intervals: the wait time can change based on some condition.
* Monitors can terminate when some condition is met or be terminated by another process.
* Monitors can take parameters. The sample shows how the same weather-monitoring process can be applied to any requested location and phone number.
* Monitors are scalable. Because each monitor is an orchestration instance, multiple monitors can be created without having to create new functions or define more code.
* Monitors integrate easily into larger workflows. A monitor can be one section of a more complex orchestration function, or a [sub-orchestration](durable-functions-sub-orchestrations.md).

## Configuring Twilio integration

[!INCLUDE [functions-twilio-integration](../../../includes/functions-twilio-integration.md)]

## Configuring Weather Underground integration

This sample involves using the Weather Underground API to check current weather conditions for a location.

The first thing you need is a Weather Underground account. You can create one for free at [https://www.wunderground.com/signup](https://www.wunderground.com/signup). Once you have an account, you will need to acquire an API key. You can do so by visiting [https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/?MR=1), then selecting Key Settings. The Stratus Developer plan is free and sufficient to run this sample.

Once you have an API key, add the following **app setting** to your function app.

| App setting name | Value description |
| - | - |
| **WeatherUndergroundApiKey**  | Your Weather Underground API key. |

## The functions

This article explains the following functions in the sample app:

* `E3_Monitor`: An orchestrator function that calls `E3_GetIsClear` periodically. It calls `E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert` if `E3_GetIsClear` returns true.
* `E3_GetIsClear`: An activity function that checks the current weather conditions for a location.
* `E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert`: An activity function that sends an SMS message via Twilio.

The following sections explain the configuration and code that are used for C# scripting and JavaScript. The code for Visual Studio development is shown at the end of the article.

## The weather monitoring orchestration (Visual Studio Code and Azure portal sample code)

The **E3_Monitor** function uses the standard *function.json* for orchestrator functions.

[!code-json[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E3_Monitor/function.json)]

Here is the code that implements the function:

### C# Script

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E3_Monitor/run.csx)]

### JavaScript (Functions 2.x only)

[!code-javascript[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/javascript/E3_Monitor/index.js)]

This orchestrator function performs the following actions:

1. Gets the **MonitorRequest** consisting of the *location* to monitor and the *phone number* to which it will send an SMS notification.
2. Determines the expiration time of the monitor. The sample uses a hard-coded value for brevity.
3. Calls **E3_GetIsClear** to determine whether there are clear skies at the requested location.
4. If the weather is clear, calls **E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert** to send an SMS notification to the requested phone number.
5. Creates a durable timer to resume the orchestration at the next polling interval. The sample uses a hard-coded value for brevity.
6. Continues running until the [CurrentUtcDateTime](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableOrchestrationContext.html#Microsoft_Azure_WebJobs_DurableOrchestrationContext_CurrentUtcDateTime) (C#) or `currentUtcDateTime` (JavaScript) passes the monitor's expiration time, or an SMS alert is sent.

Multiple orchestrator instances can run simultaneously by sending multiple **MonitorRequests**. The location to monitor and the phone number to send an SMS alert to can be specified.

## Strongly-typed data transfer (.NET only)

The orchestrator requires multiple pieces of data, so [shared POCO objects](../functions-reference-csharp.md#reusing-csx-code) are used for strongly-typed data transfer in C# and C# script:  
[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/shared/MonitorRequest.csx)]

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/shared/Location.csx)]

The JavaScript sample uses regular JSON objects as parameters.

## Helper activity functions

As with other samples, the helper activity functions are regular functions that use the `activityTrigger` trigger binding. The **E3_GetIsClear** function gets the current weather conditions using the Weather Underground API and determines whether the sky is clear. The *function.json* is defined as follows:

[!code-json[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E3_GetIsClear/function.json)]

And here is the implementation. Like the POCOs used for data transfer, logic to handle the API call and parse the response JSON is abstracted into a shared class in C#. You can find it as part of the [Visual Studio sample code](#run-the-sample).

### C# Script

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E3_GetIsClear/run.csx)]

### JavaScript (Functions 2.x only)

[!code-javascript[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/javascript/E3_GetIsClear/index.js)]

The **E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert** function uses the Twilio binding to send an SMS message notifying the end user that it's a good time for a walk. Its *function.json* is simple:

[!code-json[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert/function.json)]

And here is the code that sends the SMS message:

### C# Script

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert/run.csx)]

### JavaScript (Functions 2.x only)

[!code-javascript[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/javascript/E3_SendGoodWeatherAlert/index.js)]

## Run the sample

Using the HTTP-triggered functions included in the sample, you can start the orchestration by sending the following HTTP POST request:

```
POST https://{host}/orchestrators/E3_Monitor
Content-Length: 77
Content-Type: application/json

{ "location": { "city": "Redmond", "state": "WA" }, "phone": "+1425XXXXXXX" }
```

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Location: https://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/f6893f25acf64df2ab53a35c09d52635?taskHub=SampleHubVS&connection=Storage&code={SystemKey}
RetryAfter: 10

{"id": "f6893f25acf64df2ab53a35c09d52635", "statusQueryGetUri": "https://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/f6893f25acf64df2ab53a35c09d52635?taskHub=SampleHubVS&connection=Storage&code={systemKey}", "sendEventPostUri": "https://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/f6893f25acf64df2ab53a35c09d52635/raiseEvent/{eventName}?taskHub=SampleHubVS&connection=Storage&code={systemKey}", "terminatePostUri": "https://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/f6893f25acf64df2ab53a35c09d52635/terminate?reason={text}&taskHub=SampleHubVS&connection=Storage&code={systemKey}"}
```

The **E3_Monitor** instance starts and queries the current weather conditions for the requested location. If the weather is clear, it calls an activity function to send an alert; otherwise, it sets a timer. When the timer expires, the orchestration will resume.

You can see the orchestration's activity by looking at the function logs in the Azure Functions portal.

```

The orchestration will [terminate](durable-functions-instance-management.md) once its timeout is reached or clear skies are detected. You can also use `TerminateAsync` (.NET) or `terminate` (JavaScript) inside another function or invoke the **terminatePostUri** HTTP POST webhook referenced in the 202 response above, replacing `{text}` with the reason for termination:

```
POST https://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/f6893f25acf64df2ab53a35c09d52635/terminate?reason=Because&taskHub=SampleHubVS&connection=Storage&code={systemKey}
```

## Visual Studio sample code

Here is the orchestration as a single C# file in a Visual Studio project:

## Next steps

This sample has demonstrated how to use Durable Functions to monitor an external source's status using [durable timers](durable-functions-timers.md) and conditional logic. The next sample shows how to use external events and [durable timers](durable-functions-timers.md) to handle human interaction.
