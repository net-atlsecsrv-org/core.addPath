# HTTP APIs in Durable Functions (Azure Functions)

The Durable Task extension exposes a set of HTTP APIs that can be used to perform the following tasks:

* Fetch the status of an orchestration instance.
* Send an event to a waiting orchestration instance.
* Terminate a running orchestration instance.

Each of these HTTP APIs is a webhook operation that is handled directly by the Durable Task extension. They are not specific to any function in the function app.

> [!NOTE]
> These operations can also be invoked directly using the instance management APIs on the [DurableOrchestrationClient](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableOrchestrationClient.html) class. For more information, see [Instance Management](durable-functions-instance-management.md).

## HTTP API URL discovery

The [DurableOrchestrationClient](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableOrchestrationClient.html)  class exposes a [CreateCheckStatusResponse](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableOrchestrationClient.html#Microsoft_Azure_WebJobs_DurableOrchestrationClient_CreateCheckStatusResponse_) API that can be used to generate an HTTP response payload containing links to all the supported operations. Here is an example HTTP-trigger function that demonstrates how to use this API:

### C#

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/HttpStart/run.csx)]

### JavaScript (Functions 2.x only)

[!code-javascript[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/javascript/HttpStart/index.js)]

These example functions produce the following JSON response data. The data type of all fields is `string`.

| Field                   |Description                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **`id`**                |The ID of the orchestration instance. |
| **`statusQueryGetUri`** |The status URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`sendEventPostUri`**  |The "raise event" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`terminatePostUri`**  |The "terminate" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`rewindPostUri`**     |The "rewind" URL of the orchestration instance. |

Here is an example response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Length: 923
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Location: https://{host}/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/34ce9a28a6834d8492ce6a295f1a80e2?taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code=XXX

{
    "id":"34ce9a28a6834d8492ce6a295f1a80e2",
    "statusQueryGetUri":"https://{host}/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/34ce9a28a6834d8492ce6a295f1a80e2?taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code=XXX",
    "sendEventPostUri":"https://{host}/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/34ce9a28a6834d8492ce6a295f1a80e2/raiseEvent/{eventName}?taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code=XXX",
    "terminatePostUri":"https://{host}/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/34ce9a28a6834d8492ce6a295f1a80e2/terminate?reason={text}&taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code=XXX",
    "rewindPostUri":"https://{host}/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/34ce9a28a6834d8492ce6a295f1a80e2/rewind?reason={text}&taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code=XXX"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The format of the webhook URLs may differ depending on which version of the Azure Functions host you are running. The above example is for the Azure Functions 2.x host.

## Async operation tracking

The HTTP response mentioned previously is designed to help implement long-running HTTP async APIs with Durable Functions. This is sometimes referred to as the *Polling Consumer Pattern*. The client/server flow works as follows:

1. The client issues an HTTP request to start a long running process, such as an orchestrator function.
2. The target HTTP trigger returns an HTTP 202 response with a `Location` header with the `statusQueryGetUri` value.
3. The client polls the URL in the `Location` header. It continues to see HTTP 202 responses with a `Location` header.
4. When the instance completes (or fails), the endpoint in the `Location` header returns HTTP 200.

This protocol allows coordinating long-running processes with external clients or services that support polling an HTTP endpoint and following the `Location` header. The fundamental pieces are already built into the Durable Functions HTTP APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all HTTP-based actions provided by [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/) support the standard asynchronous operation pattern. This capability makes it possible to embed a long-running durable function as part of a Logic Apps workflow. More details on Logic Apps support for asynchronous HTTP patterns can be found in the [Azure Logic Apps workflow actions and triggers documentation](../../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#asynchronous-patterns).

## HTTP API reference

All HTTP APIs implemented by the extension take the following parameters. The data type of all parameters is `string`.

| Parameter        | Parameter Type  | Description |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`taskHub`**    | Query string    | The name of the [task hub](durable-functions-task-hubs.md). If not specified, the current function app's task hub name is assumed. |
| **`connection`** | Query string    | The **name** of the connection string for the storage account. If not specified, the default connection string for the function app is assumed. |
| **`systemKey`**  | Query string    | The authorization key required to invoke the API. |

`systemKey` is an authorization key auto-generated by the Azure Functions host. It specifically grants access to the Durable Task extension APIs and can be managed the same way as [other authorization keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki/Key-management-API). The simplest way to discover the `systemKey` value is by using the `CreateCheckStatusResponse` API mentioned previously.

The next few sections cover the specific HTTP APIs supported by the extension and provide examples of how they can be used.

### Get instance status

Gets the status of a specified orchestration instance.

#### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
GET /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &showHistory=[true|false]
    &showHistoryOutput=[true|false]
    &showInput=[true|false]
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &showHistory=[true|false]
    &showHistoryOutput=[true|false]
    &showInput=[true|false]
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field                   | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`instanceId`**        | URL             | The ID of the orchestration instance. |
| **`showInput`**         | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `false`, the function input will not be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistory`**       | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the orchestration execution history will be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistoryOutput`** | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the function outputs will be included in the orchestration execution history.|
| **`createdTimeFrom`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or after the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`createdTimeTo`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or before the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`runtimeStatus`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances based on their runtime status. To see the list of possible runtime status values, see the [Querying instances](durable-functions-instance-management.md) topic. |

#### Response

Several possible status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 200 (OK)**: The specified instance is in a completed state.
* **HTTP 202 (Accepted)**: The specified instance is in progress.
* **HTTP 400 (Bad Request)**: The specified instance failed or was terminated.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified instance doesn't exist or has not started running.
* **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)**: The specified instance failed with an unhandled exception.

The response payload for the **HTTP 200** and **HTTP 202** cases is a JSON object with the following fields:

| Field                 | Data type | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **`runtimeStatus`**   | string    | The runtime status of the instance. Values include *Running*, *Pending*, *Failed*, *Canceled*, *Terminated*, *Completed*. |
| **`input`**           | JSON      | The JSON data used to initialize the instance. This field is `null` if the `showInput` query string parameter is set to `false`.|
| **`customStatus`**    | JSON      | The JSON data used for custom orchestration status. This field is `null` if not set. |
| **`output`**          | JSON      | The JSON output of the instance. This field is `null` if the instance is not in a completed state. |
| **`createdTime`**     | string    | The time at which the instance was created. Uses ISO 8601 extended notation. |
| **`lastUpdatedTime`** | string    | The time at which the instance last persisted. Uses ISO 8601 extended notation. |
| **`historyEvents`**   | JSON      | A JSON array containing the orchestration execution history. This field is `null` unless the `showHistory` query string parameter is set to `true`. |

Here is an example response payload including the orchestration execution history and activity outputs (formatted for readability):

```json
{
  "createdTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:49Z",
  "historyEvents": [
      {
          "EventType": "ExecutionStarted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_HelloSequence",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:49.3452372Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "TaskCompleted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_SayHello",
          "Result": "Hello Tokyo!",
          "ScheduledTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:51.3939873Z",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:52.2895622Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "TaskCompleted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_SayHello",
          "Result": "Hello Seattle!",
          "ScheduledTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:52.8755705Z",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:53.1765771Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "TaskCompleted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_SayHello",
          "Result": "Hello London!",
          "ScheduledTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:53.5170791Z",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:53.891081Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "ExecutionCompleted",
          "OrchestrationStatus": "Completed",
          "Result": [
              "Hello Tokyo!",
              "Hello Seattle!",
              "Hello London!"
          ],
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:54.3660895Z"
      }
  ],
  "input": null,
  "customStatus": { "nextActions": ["A", "B", "C"], "foo": 2 },
  "lastUpdatedTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:54Z",
  "output": [
      "Hello Tokyo!",
      "Hello Seattle!",
      "Hello London!"
  ],
  "runtimeStatus": "Completed"
}
```

The **HTTP 202** response also includes a **Location** response header that references the same URL as the `statusQueryGetUri` field mentioned previously.

### Get all instances status

You can also query the status of all instances by removing the `instanceId` from the 'Get instance status' request. In this case, the basic parameters are the same as the 'Get instance status'. Query string parameters for filtering are also supported.

One thing to remember is that `connection` and `code` are optional. If you have anonymous auth on the function then code isn't required.
If you don't want to use a different storage connection string other than defined in the AzureWebJobsStorage app setting, then you can safely ignore the connection query string parameter.

#### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
GET /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &createdTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &createdTimeTo={timestamp}
    &runtimeStatus={runtimeStatus1,runtimeStatus2,...}
    &showInput=[true|false]
    &top={integer}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durableTask/instances?
    taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &createdTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &createdTimeTo={timestamp}
    &runtimeStatus={runtimeStatus1,runtimeStatus2,...}
    &showInput=[true|false]
    &top={integer}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field                   | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------|

| **`showInput`**         | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `false`, the function input will not be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistory`**       | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the orchestration execution history will be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistoryOutput`** | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the function outputs will be included in the orchestration execution history.|
| **`createdTimeFrom`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or after the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`createdTimeTo`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or before the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`runtimeStatus`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances based on their runtime status. To see the list of possible runtime status values, see the [Querying instances](durable-functions-instance-management.md) topic. |
| **`top`**               | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, limits the number of instances returned by the query. |

#### Response

Here is an example of response payloads including the orchestration status (formatted for readability):

```json
[
    {
        "instanceId": "7af46ff000564c65aafbfe99d07c32a5",
        "runtimeStatus": "Completed",
        "input": null,

    }
]
```

> [!NOTE]
> This operation can be very expensive in terms of Azure Storage I/O if there are a lot of rows in the Instances table. More details on Instance table can be found in the [Performance and scale in Durable Functions (Azure Functions)](durable-functions-perf-and-scale.md#instances-table) documentation.
>

If more results exist, a continuation token is returned in the response header.  The name of the header is `x-ms-continuation-token`.

If you set continuation token value in the next request header, you can get the next page of results. This name of the request header is also `x-ms-continuation-token`.

### Purge single instance history

Deletes the history and related artifacts for a specified orchestration instance.

#### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

    &code={systemKey}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
DELETE /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}

The response payload for the **HTTP 200** case is a JSON object with the following field:

| Field                  | Data type | Description |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **`instancesDeleted`** | integer   | The number of instances deleted. For the single instance case, this value should always be `1`. |

Here is an example response payload (formatted for readability):

```json
{
    "instancesDeleted": 1
}
```

### Purge multiple instance history

You can also delete the history and related artifacts for multiple instances within a task hub by removing the `{instanceId}` from the 'Purge single instance history' request. To selectively purge instance history, use the same filters described in the 'Get all instances status' request.

| **`runtimeStatus`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of purged instances based on their runtime status. To see the list of possible runtime status values, see the [Querying instances](durable-functions-instance-management.md) topic. |

> [!NOTE]
> This operation can be very expensive in terms of Azure Storage I/O if there are a lot of rows in the Instances and/or History tables. More details on these tables can be found in the [Performance and scale in Durable Functions (Azure Functions)](durable-functions-perf-and-scale.md#instances-table) documentation.

#### Response

The following HTTP status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 200 (OK)**: The instance history has been purged successfully.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: No instances were found that match the filter expression.

The response payload for the **HTTP 200** case is a JSON object with the following field:

| **`{content}`**   | Request content | The JSON-formatted event payload. |

#### Response

Several possible status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 202 (Accepted)**: The raised event was accepted for processing.
* **HTTP 400 (Bad request)**: The request content was not of type `application/json` or was not valid JSON.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified instance was not found.
* **HTTP 410 (Gone)**: The specified instance has completed or failed and cannot process any raised events.

Here is an example request that sends the JSON string `"incr"` to an instance waiting for an event named **operation**:
