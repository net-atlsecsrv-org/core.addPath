# Function chaining in Durable Functions - Hello sequence sample

Function chaining refers to the pattern of executing a sequence of functions in a particular order. Often the output of one function needs to be applied to the input of another function. This article describes the chaining sequence that you create when you complete the Durable Functions quickstart ([C#](durable-functions-create-first-csharp.md) or [JavaScript](quickstart-js-vscode.md)). For more information about Durable Functions, see [Durable Functions overview](durable-functions-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [durable-functions-prerequisites](../../../includes/durable-functions-prerequisites.md)]

## The functions

This article explains the following functions in the sample app:

* `E1_HelloSequence`: An orchestrator function that calls `E1_SayHello` multiple times in a sequence. It stores the outputs from the `E1_SayHello` calls and records the results.
* `E1_SayHello`: An activity function that prepends a string with "Hello".

The following sections explain the configuration and code that are used for C# scripting and JavaScript. The code for Visual Studio development is shown at the end of the article.

> [!NOTE]
> JavaScript Durable Functions are available for the Functions 2.x runtime only.

## E1_HelloSequence

### function.json file

If you use Visual Studio Code or the Azure portal for development, here's the content of the *function.json* file for the orchestrator function. Most orchestrator *function.json* files look almost exactly like this.

[!code-json[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E1_HelloSequence/function.json)]

The important thing is the `orchestrationTrigger` binding type. All orchestrator functions must use this trigger type.

> [!WARNING]
> To abide by the "no I/O" rule of orchestrator functions, don't use any input or output bindings when using the `orchestrationTrigger` trigger binding.  If other input or output bindings are needed, they should instead be used in the context of `activityTrigger` functions, which are called by the orchestrator.

### C# script (Visual Studio Code and Azure portal sample code)

Here is the source code:

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E1_HelloSequence/run.csx)]

All C# orchestration functions must have a parameter of type `DurableOrchestrationContext`, which exists in the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask` assembly. If you're using C# script, the assembly can be referenced using the `#r` notation. This context object lets you call other *activity* functions and pass input parameters using its [CallActivityAsync](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableOrchestrationContext.html#Microsoft_Azure_WebJobs_DurableOrchestrationContext_CallActivityAsync_) method.

The code calls `E1_SayHello` three times in sequence with different parameter values. The return value of each call is added to the `outputs` list, which is returned at the end of the function.

### Javascript

Here is the source code:

[!code-javascript[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/javascript/E1_HelloSequence/index.js)]

All JavaScript orchestration functions must include the [`durable-functions` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/durable-functions). This is a library that enables you to write Durable Functions in JavaScript. There are three significant differences between an orchestration function and other JavaScript functions:

1. The function is a [generator function.](https://docs.microsoft.com/scripting/javascript/advanced/iterators-and-generators-javascript)
2. The function is wrapped in a call to the `durable-functions` module's `orchestrator` method (here `df`).
3. The function must be synchronous. Because the 'orchestrator' method handles calling 'context.done', the function should simply 'return'.

The `context` object contains a `df` object lets you call other *activity* functions and pass input parameters using its `callActivity` method. The code calls `E1_SayHello` three times in sequence with different parameter values, using `yield` to indicate the execution should wait on the async activity function calls to be returned. The return value of each call is added to the `outputs` list, which is returned at the end of the function.

## E1_SayHello

### function.json file

The *function.json* file for the activity function `E1_SayHello` is similar to that of `E1_HelloSequence` except that it uses an `activityTrigger` binding type instead of an `orchestrationTrigger` binding type.

[!code-json[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E1_SayHello/function.json)]

> [!NOTE]
> Any function called by an orchestration function must use the `activityTrigger` binding.

The implementation of `E1_SayHello` is a relatively trivial string formatting operation.

### C#

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/csx/E1_SayHello/run.csx)]

This function has a parameter of type [DurableActivityContext](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableActivityContext.html), which it uses to get the input that was passed to it by the orchestrator function's call to [`CallActivityAsync<T>`](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/api/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.DurableOrchestrationContext.html#Microsoft_Azure_WebJobs_DurableOrchestrationContext_CallActivityAsync_).

### JavaScript

[!code-javascript[Main](~/samples-durable-functions/samples/javascript/E1_SayHello/index.js)]

Unlike a JavaScript orchestration function, an activity function needs no special setup. The input passed to it by the orchestrator function is located on the `context.bindings` object under the name of the `activityTrigger` binding - in this case, `context.bindings.name`. The binding name can be set as a parameter of the exported function and accessed directly, which is what the sample code does.

## Run the sample

To execute the `E1_HelloSequence` orchestration, send the following HTTP POST request.

```
POST http://{host}/orchestrators/E1_HelloSequence
```

> [!NOTE]
> The previous HTTP snippet assumes there is an entry in the `host.json` file which removes the default `api/` prefix from all HTTP trigger functions URLs. You can find the markup for this configuration in the `host.json` file in the samples.

For example, if you're running the sample in a function app named "myfunctionapp", replace "{host}" with "myfunctionapp.azurewebsites.net".

The result is an HTTP 202 response, like this (trimmed for brevity):

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Length: 719
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Location: http://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/96924899c16d43b08a536de376ac786b?taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code={systemKey}

(...trimmed...)
```

At this point, the orchestration is queued up and begins to run immediately. The URL in the `Location` header can be used to check the status of the execution.

```
GET http://{host}/admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/96924899c16d43b08a536de376ac786b?taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code={systemKey}
```

The result is the status of the orchestration. It runs and completes quickly, so you see it in the *Completed* state with a response that looks like this (trimmed for brevity):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 179
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"runtimeStatus":"Completed","input":null,"output":["Hello Tokyo!","Hello Seattle!","Hello London!"],"createdTime":"2017-06-29T05:24:57Z","lastUpdatedTime":"2017-06-29T05:24:59Z"}
```

As you can see, the `runtimeStatus` of the instance is *Completed* and the `output` contains the JSON-serialized result of the orchestrator function execution.

> [!NOTE]
> The HTTP POST endpoint that started the orchestrator function is implemented in the sample app as an HTTP trigger function named "HttpStart". You can implement similar starter logic for other trigger types, like `queueTrigger`, `eventHubTrigger`, or `timerTrigger`.

Look at the function execution logs. The `E1_HelloSequence` function started and completed multiple times due to the replay behavior described in the [orchestration reliability](durable-functions-orchestrations.md#reliability) topic. On the other hand, there were only three executions of `E1_SayHello` since those function executions do not get replayed.

## Visual Studio sample code

Here is the orchestration as a single C# file in a Visual Studio project:

## Next steps

This sample has demonstrated a simple function-chaining orchestration. The next sample shows how to implement the fan-out/fan-in pattern.
