# Run your Azure Functions from a package file

In Azure, you can run your functions directly from a deployment package file in your function app. The other option is to deploy your files in the `d:\home\site\wwwroot` directory of your function app.

This article describes the benefits of running your functions from a package. It also shows how to enable this functionality in your function app.

## Benefits of running from a package file
  
There are several benefits to running from a package file:

+ Reduces the risk of file copy locking issues.
+ Can be deployed to a production app (with restart).
+ You can be certain of the files that are running in your app.
+ Improves the performance of [Azure Resource Manager deployments](functions-infrastructure-as-code.md).
+ May reduce cold-start times, particularly for JavaScript functions with large npm package trees.

For more information, see [this announcement](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues/84).

## Enabling functions to run from a package

To enable your function app to run from a package, you just add a `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` setting to your function app settings. The `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` setting can have one of the following values:

| Value  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **`1`**  | Recommended for function apps running on Windows. Run from a package file in the `d:\home\data\SitePackages` folder of your function app. If not [deploying with zip deploy](#integration-with-zip-deployment), this option requires the folder to also have a file named `packagename.txt`. This file contains only the name of the package file in folder, without any whitespace. |
|**`<URL>`**  | Location of a specific package file you want to run. When using Blob storage, you should use a private container with a [Shared Access Signature (SAS)](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md#generate-a-sas-in-storage-explorer) to enable the Functions runtime to access to the package. You can use the [Azure Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md) to upload package files to your Blob storage account. When you specify a URL, you must also [sync triggers](functions-deployment-technologies.md#trigger-syncing) after you publish an updated package. |

> [!CAUTION]
> When running a function app on Windows, the external URL option yields worse cold-start performance. When deploying your function app to Windows, you should set `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` to `1` and publish with zip deployment.

The following shows a function app configured to run from a .zip file hosted in Azure Blob storage:

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only .zip package files are supported.

## Integration with zip deployment

[Zip deployment][Zip deployment for Azure Functions] is a feature of Azure App Service that lets you deploy your function app project to the `wwwroot` directory. The project is packaged as a .zip deployment file. The same APIs can be used to deploy your package to the `d:\home\data\SitePackages` folder. With the `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting value of `1`, the zip deployment APIs copy your package to the `d:\home\data\SitePackages` folder instead of extracting the files to `d:\home\site\wwwroot`. It also creates the `packagename.txt` file. After a restart, the package is mounted to `wwwroot` as a read-only filesystem. For more information about zip deployment, see [Zip deployment for Azure Functions](deployment-zip-push.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When a deployment occurs, a restart of the function app is triggered. Before a restart, all existing function executions are allowed to complete or time out. To learn more, see [Deployment behaviors](functions-deployment-technologies.md#deployment-behaviors).

## Adding the WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting

[!INCLUDE [Function app settings](../../includes/functions-app-settings.md)]


## Troubleshooting

- Run From Package makes `wwwroot` read-only, so you will receive an error when writing files to this directory.
- Tar and gzip formats are not supported.
- This feature does not compose with local cache.
- For improved cold-start performance, use the local Zip option (`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`=1).
- Run From Package is incompatible with deployment customization option (`SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true`), the build step will be ignored during deployment.
