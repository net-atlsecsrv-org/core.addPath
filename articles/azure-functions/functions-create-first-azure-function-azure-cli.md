# Create your first function from the command line

This quickstart topic walks you through how to create your first function from the command line or terminal. You use the Azure CLI to create a function app, which is the [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/) infrastructure that hosts your function. The function code project is generated from a template by using the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md), which is also used to deploy the function app project to Azure.

You can follow the steps below using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you must have the following:

+ Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-run-local.md#v2) version 2.6.666 or later.

+ Install the [Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version you have. You can also use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash).

+ An active Azure subscription.

## Create the local function app project

Run the following command from the command line to create a function app project in the `MyFunctionProj` folder of the current local directory. A GitHub repo is also created in `MyFunctionProj`.

```bash
func init MyFunctionProj
```

When prompted, select a worker runtime from the following language choices:

+ `dotnet`: creates a .NET class library project (.csproj).
+ `node`: creates a JavaScript project.

When the command executes, you see something like the following output:

```output
Writing .gitignore
Writing host.json
Writing local.settings.json
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/functions/MyFunctionProj/.git/
```

Use the following command to navigate to the new `MyFunctionProj` project folder.

```bash
cd MyFunctionProj
```

## Create a function app

You must have a function app to host the execution of your functions. The function app provides an environment for serverless execution of your function code. It lets you group functions as a logic unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources. Create a function app by using the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. 

In the following command, substitute a unique function app name where you see the `<APP_NAME>` placeholder and the storage account name for  `<STORAGE_NAME>`. The `<APP_NAME>` is used as the default DNS domain for the function app, and so the name needs to be unique across all apps in Azure. You should also set the `<language>` runtime for your function app, from `dotnet` (C#) or `node` (JavaScript).

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --consumption-plan-location westeurope \
--name <APP_NAME> --storage-account  <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime <language>
```

Setting the _consumption-plan-location_ parameter means that the function app is hosted in a Consumption hosting plan. In this serverless plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions and you only pay when functions are running. For more information, see [Choose the correct hosting plan](functions-scale.md).

After the function app has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "availabilityState": "Normal",
  "clientAffinityEnabled": true,
  "clientCertEnabled": false,
  "containerSize": 1536,
  "dailyMemoryTimeQuota": 0,
  "defaultHostName": "quickstart.azurewebsites.net",
  "enabled": true,
  "enabledHostNames": [
    "quickstart.azurewebsites.net",
    "quickstart.scm.azurewebsites.net"
  ],
   ....
    // Remaining output has been truncated for readability.
}
```
