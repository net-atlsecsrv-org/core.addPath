# Quickstart: Create a function in Azure that responds to HTTP requests

In this article, you use command-line tools to create a function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions. Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

There is also a [Visual Studio Code-based version](functions-create-first-function-vs-code.md) of this article.

## Configure your local environment

Before you begin, you must have the following:

+ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp,programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript,programming-language-powershell"  
+ The [Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-run-local.md#v2) version 2.7.1846 or a later 2.x version.
::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
+ Python 3.6 and 3.7 require [Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-run-local.md#v2) version 2.7.1846 or a later 2.x version. Python 3.8 requires [version 3.x](./functions-run-local.md#v2) of the Core Tools.
::: zone-end

+ The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.0.76 or later. 
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (8.11.1 and 10.14.1 recommended).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
+ [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/), [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/), [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/), which are supported by Azure Functions. 
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"
+ [PowerShell Core](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows)

+ The [.NET Core SDK 2.2+](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
::: zone-end

### Check your environment

+ In a terminal or command window, run `func --version` to check that the Azure Functions Core Tools are version 2.7.1846 or a later 2.x version.

+ Run `az --version` to check that the Azure CLI version is 2.0.76 or later.

+ Run `az login` to sign in to Azure and verify an active subscription.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"
+ Run `node --version` to check your Node.js version reports 8.x or 10.x.
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
+ Run `python --version` (Linux/MacOS) or `py --version` (Windows) to check your Python version reports 3.8.x, 3.7.x or 3.6.x.

## <a name="create-venv"></a>Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`. Be sure to use Python 3.8, 3.7 or 3.6, which are supported by Azure Functions.


# [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
```

```powershell
.venv\scripts\activate
```

# [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
py -m venv .venv
```

```cmd
.venv\scripts\activate
```

---

You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment. (To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.)

::: zone-end

## Create a local function project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single function.

1. In the virtual environment, run the `func init` command to create a functions project in a folder named *LocalFunctionProj* with the specified runtime:

    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
    ```
    func init LocalFunctionProj --python
    ```
    ::: zone-end
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
    ```
    func init LocalFunctionProj --dotnet
    ```
    ::: zone-end
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"
    ```
    func init LocalFunctionProj --javascript
    ```
    ::: zone-end
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"
    ```
    func init LocalFunctionProj --typescript
    ```
    ::: zone-end
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"
    ```
    func init LocalFunctionProj --powershell
    ```
    ::: zone-end


    This folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named [local.settings.json](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file) and [host.json](functions-host-json.md). Because *local.settings.json* can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the *.gitignore* file.

1. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```
    cd LocalFunctionProj
    ```
    
1. Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the `--name` argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template` argument specifies the function's trigger. 

    ```
    func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
    ```

    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
    `func new` creates a HttpExample.cs code file.
    ::: zone-end
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript,programming-language-python,programming-language-powershell"
    `func new` creates a subfolder matching the function name that contains a code file appropriate to the project's chosen language and a configuration file named *function.json*.
    ::: zone-end

### (Optional) Examine the file contents

If desired, you can skip to [Run the function locally](#run-the-function-locally) and examine the file contents later.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
#### HttpExample.cs

*HttpExample.cs* contains a `Run` method that receives request data in the `req` variable is an [HttpRequest](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest) that's decorated with the **HttpTriggerAttribute**, which defines the trigger behavior. 

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-docs-csharp/http-trigger-template/HttpExample.cs":::

The return object is an [ActionResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.actionresult) that returns an response message as either an [OkObjectResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.okobjectresult) (200) or a [BadRequestObjectResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.badrequestobjectresult) (400). To learn more, see [Azure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook?tabs=csharp).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
#### \_\_init\_\_.py

*\_\_init\_\_.py* contains a `main()` Python function that's triggered according to the configuration in *function.json*.

:::code language="python" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-Python/__init__.py":::

For an HTTP trigger, the function receives request data in the variable `req` as defined in *function.json*. `req` is an instance of the [azure.functions.HttpRequest class](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.httprequest). The return object, defined as `$return` in *function.json*, is an instance of [azure.functions.HttpResponse class](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.httpresponse). To learn more, see [Azure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook?tabs=python).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"
#### index.js

*index.js* exports a function that's triggered according to the configuration in *function.json*.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-JavaScript/index.js":::

For an HTTP trigger, the function receives request data in the variable `req` as defined in *function.json*. The return object, defined as `$return` in *function.json*, is the response. To learn more, see [Azure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook?tabs=javascript).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"
#### index.ts

*index.ts* exports a function that's triggered according to the configuration in *function.json*.

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-TypeScript/index.ts":::

For an HTTP trigger, the function receives request data in the variable `req` of type **HttpRequest** as defined in *function.json*. The return object, defined as `$return` in *function.json*, is the response. 
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"
#### run.ps1

*run.ps1* defines a function script that's triggered according to the configuration in *function.json*.

:::code language="powershell" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-PowerShell/run.ps1":::

For an HTTP trigger, the function receives request data passed to the `$Request` param defined in *function.json*. The return object, defined as `Response` in *function.json*, is passed to the `Push-OutputBinding` cmdlet as the response. 
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript,programming-language-python,programming-language-powershell"
#### function.json

*function.json* is a configuration file that defines the input and output `bindings` for the function, including the trigger type. 
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
You can change `scriptFile` to invoke a different Python file if desired.

:::code language="json" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-Python/function.json":::
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"
:::code language="json" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-JavaScript/function.json":::
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"
:::code language="json" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-PowerShell/function.json":::
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript,programming-language-python,programming-language-powershell"  
Each binding requires a direction, a type, and a unique name. The HTTP trigger has an input binding of type [`httpTrigger`](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md) and output binding of type [`http`](functions-bindings-http-webhook-output.md).

## Create supporting Azure resources for your function

Before you can deploy your function code to Azure, you need to create three resources:

- A resource group, which is a logical container for related resources.
- A Storage account, which maintains state and other information about your projects.
- A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app maps to your local function project and lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

Use the following Azure CLI commands to create these items. Each command provides JSON output upon completion.

1. If you haven't done so already, sign in to Azure with the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```
    
1. Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. The following example creates a resource group named `AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg` in the `westeurope` region. (You generally create your resource group and resources in a region near you, using an available region from the `az account list-locations` command.)

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --location westeurope
    ```
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't host Linux and Windows apps in the same resource group. If you have an existing resource group named `AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg` with a Windows function app or web app, you must use a different resource group.
    ::: zone-end  
    
1. Create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region by using the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) command. In the following example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with a globally unique name appropriate to you. Names must contain three to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only. `Standard_LRS` specifies a general-purpose account, which is [supported by Functions](storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements).

    ```azurecli
    az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location westeurope --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --sku Standard_LRS
    ```
    
    The storage account incurs only a few cents (USD) for this quickstart.
    
1. Create the function app using the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. In the following example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with the name of the account you used in the previous step, and replace `<APP_NAME>` with a globally unique name appropriate to you. The `<APP_NAME>` is also the default DNS domain for the function app. 

    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  
    If you are using Python 3.8, change `--runtime-version` to `3.8` and `--functions_version` to `3`.
    
    If you are using Python 3.6, change `--runtime-version` to `3.6`.

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --os-type Linux --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime python --runtime-version 3.7 --functions-version 2 --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```
    ::: zone-end  

    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"  
    If you are using Node.js 8, also change `--runtime-version` to `8`.

    
    ```azurecli
    az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime node --runtime-version 10 --functions-version 2 --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```
    ::: zone-end  

    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
    ```azurecli
    az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime dotnet --functions-version 2 --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```
    ::: zone-end  
    
    ::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"  
    ```azurecli
    az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime powershell --functions-version 2 --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```
    ::: zone-end  

    This command creates a function app running in your specified language runtime under the [Azure Functions Consumption Plan](functions-scale.md#consumption-plan), which is free for the amount of usage you incur here. The command also provisions an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group, with which you can monitor your function app and view logs. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md). The instance incurs no costs until you activate it.
    
## Deploy the function project to Azure

::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"  
Before you use Core Tools to deploy your project to Azure, you create a production-ready build of JavaScript files from the TypeScript source files.

The following command prepares your TypeScript project for deployment:

```
npm run build:production 
```
::: zone-end  

With the necessary resources in place, you're now ready to deploy your local functions project to the function app in Azure by using the [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#project-file-deployment) command. In the following example, replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your app.

```
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```

If you see the error, "Can't find app with name ...", wait a few seconds and try again, as Azure may not have fully initialized the app after the previous `az functionapp create` command.

The publish command shows results similar to the following output (truncated for simplicity):

<pre>
...

Getting site publishing info...
Creating archive for current directory...
Performing remote build for functions project.

...

Deployment successful.
Remote build succeeded!
Syncing triggers...
Functions in msdocs-azurefunctions-qs:
    HttpExample - [httpTrigger]
        Invoke url: https://msdocs-azurefunctions-qs.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample?code=KYHrydo4GFe9y0000000qRgRJ8NdLFKpkakGJQfC3izYVidzzDN4gQ==
</pre>

## Invoke the function on Azure

Because your function uses an HTTP trigger, you invoke it by making an HTTP request to its URL in the browser or with a tool like curl. In both instances, the `code` URL parameter is your unique [function key](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys) that authorizes the invocation of your function endpoint.

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

Copy the complete **Invoke URL** shown in the output of the publish command into a browser address bar, appending the query parameter `&name=Functions`. The browser should display similar output as when you ran the function locally.

![The output of the function run on Azure in a browser](./media/functions-create-first-azure-function-azure-cli/function-test-cloud-browser.png)


# [curl](#tab/curl)

Run [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) with the **Invoke URL**, appending the parameter `&name=Functions`. The output of the command should be the text, "Hello Functions."

> [!TIP]
> To view near real-time logs for a published function app, use the [Application Insights Live Metrics Stream](functions-monitoring.md#streaming-logs).

## Clean up resources

If you continue to the next step, [Add an Azure Storage queue output binding](functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-cli.md), keep all your resources in place as you'll build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```azurecli
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```
