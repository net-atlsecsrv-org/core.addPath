# Quickstart: Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub (Node.js)

**Applies to**: [Device application development](about-iot-develop.md#device-application-development)

In this quickstart, you learn a basic IoT device application development workflow. You use the Azure CLI to create an Azure IoT hub and a simulated device, then you use the Azure IoT Node.js SDK to access the device and send telemetry to the hub.

## Prerequisites
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Azure CLI. You can run all commands in this quickstart using the Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive CLI shell that runs in your browser. If you use the Cloud Shell, you don't need to install anything. If you prefer to use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires Azure CLI version 2.0.76 or later. Run az --version to find the version. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- [Node.js 10+](https://nodejs.org). If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell, do not update the installed version of Node.js. The Azure Cloud Shell already has the latest Node.js version.

    Verify the current version of Node.js on your development machine by using the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
        node --version
    ```

## Use the Node.js SDK to send messages
In this section, you will use the Node.js SDK to send messages from your simulated device to your IoT hub. 

1. Open a new terminal window. You will use this terminal to install the Node.js SDK and work with Node.js sample code. You should now have two terminals open: the one you just opened to work with Node.js, and the CLI shell that you used in previous sections to enter Azure CLI commands.

1. Copy the [Azure IoT Node.js SDK device samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/tree/master/device/samples) to your local machine:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node
    ```

1. Navigate to the *azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/pnp* directory:

    ```console
    cd azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/pnp
    ```

1. Install the Azure IoT Node.js SDK and necessary dependencies:

    ```console
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs the proper dependencies as specified in the *package.json* file in the device samples directory.

1. Set both of the following environment variables, to enable your simulated device to connect to Azure IoT.
    * Set an environment variable called `IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING`. For the variable value, use the device connection string that you saved in the previous section.
    * Set an environment variable called `IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE`. For the variable, use the literal string value `connectionString`.

    **Windows (cmd)**

    ```console
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING=<your connection string here>
    ```
    ```console
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE=connectionString
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For Windows CMD there are no quotation marks surrounding the string values for each variable.

    **PowerShell**

    ```azurepowershell
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING='<your connection string here>'
    ```
    ```azurepowershell
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE='connectionString'
    ```

    **Bash (Linux or Windows)**

    ```bash
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING="<your connection string here>"
    ```
    ```bash
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE="connectionString"
    ```
1. In your open CLI shell, run the [az iot hub monitor-events](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/hub#ext-azure-iot-az-iot-hub-monitor-events) command to begin monitoring for events on your simulated IoT device.  Event messages will be printed in the terminal as they arrive.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub monitor-events --output table --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. In your Node.js terminal, run the code for the installed sample file *simple_thermostat.js* . This code accesses the simulated IoT device and sends a message to the IoT hub.

    To run the Node.js sample from the terminal:
    ```console
    node ./simple_thermostat.js
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > This code sample uses Azure IoT Plug and Play, which lets you integrate smart devices into your solutions without any manual configuration.  By default, most samples in this documentation use IoT Plug and Play. To learn more about the advantages of IoT PnP, and cases for using or not using it, see [What is IoT Plug and Play?](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md)

As the Node.js code sends a simulated telemetry message from your device to the IoT hub, the message appears in your CLI shell that is monitoring events:

```output
Starting event monitor, use ctrl-c to stop...
event:
  component: ''
  interface: dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1
  module: ''
  origin: <your device ID>
  payload:
    temperature: 36.87027777131555
```

Your device is now securely connected and sending telemetry to Azure IoT Hub.

## Clean up resources
If you no longer need the Azure resources created in this quickstart, you can use the Azure CLI to delete them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. 

To delete a resource group by name:
1. Run the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. This command removes the resource group, the IoT Hub, and the device registration you created.

    ```azurecli
    az group delete --name MyResourceGroup
    ```
1. Run the [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list) command to confirm the resource group is deleted.  

    ```azurecli
    az group list
    ```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned a basic Azure IoT application workflow for securely connecting a device to the cloud and sending device-to-cloud telemetry. You used the Azure CLI to create an IoT hub and a simulated device, then you used the Azure IoT Node.js SDK to access the device and send telemetry to the hub. 

As a next step, explore the Azure IoT Node.js SDK through application samples.
