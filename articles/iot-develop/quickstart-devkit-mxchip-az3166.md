For debugging the application, see [Debugging with Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/debugging.md).

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the Azure resources created in this tutorial, you can delete them from the IoT Central portal. Optionally, if you continue to another tutorial in this Getting Started guide, you can keep the resources you've already created and reuse them.

To remove the entire Azure IoT Central sample application and all its devices and resources:
1. Select **Administration** > **Your application**.
1. Select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial you built a custom image that contains Azure RTOS sample code, and then flashed the image to the MXCHIP DevKit device. You also used the IoT Central portal to create Azure resources, connect the MXCHIP DevKit securely to Azure, view telemetry, and send messages.

* For device developers, the suggested next step is to see the other tutorials in the series [Getting started with Azure IoT embedded device development](quickstart-device-development.md).
* If you have issues getting your device to initialize or connect after following the steps in this guide, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md).
* To learn more about how Azure RTOS components are used in the sample code for this tutorial, see [Using Azure RTOS in the Getting Started guide](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/using-azure-rtos.md).
