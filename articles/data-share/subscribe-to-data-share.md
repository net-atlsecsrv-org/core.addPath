# Tutorial: Accept and receive data using Azure Data Share  

In this tutorial, you will learn how to accept a data share invitation using Azure Data Share. You will learn how to receive data being shared with you, as well as how to enable a regular refresh interval to ensure that you always have the most recent snapshot of the data being shared with you.

## Prerequisites
Before you can accept a data share invitation, you must provision a number of Azure resources, which are listed below. 

Ensure that all pre-requisites are complete before accepting a data share invitation. 

* Azure Subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* A Data Share invitation: An invitation from Microsoft Azure with a subject titled "Azure Data Share invitation from **<yourdataprovider@domain.com>**".

### Receive data into a storage account: 

* An Azure Storage account: If you don't already have one, you can create an [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account). 
* Permission to add role assignment to the storage account, which is present in the *Microsoft.Authorization/role assignments/write* permission. This permission exists in the owner role. 
* Resource Provider registration for Microsoft.DataShare. See the [Azure Resource Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services) documentation for information on how to do this. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To accept and receive an Azure Data Share, you must first register the Microsoft.DataShare resource provider and you must be an owner of the storage account that you accept data into. Follow the instructions documented in [Troubleshoot Azure Data Share](data-share-troubleshoot.md) to register the data share resource provider as well as add yourself as an owner of the storage account. 

### Receive data into a SQL-based source:

* Permission for the data share MSI to access the Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Data Warehouse. This can be done through the following steps: 
    1. Set yourself as the Azure Active Directory Admin for the server.
    1. Connect to the Azure SQL Database/Data Warehouse using Azure Active Directory.
    1. Use Query Editor (preview) to execute the following script to add the Data Share MSI as a db_owner. You must connect using Active Directory and not SQL Server authentication. 

```sql
    create user <share_acct_name> from external provider;     
    exec sp_addrolemember db_owner, <share_acct_name>; 
```      
Note that the *<share_acc_name>* is the name of your Data Share Account. If you have not created a Data Share account as yet, you can come back to this pre-requisite later.         

* Client IP SQL Server Firewall access: This can be done through the following steps: 
        1. Navigate to *Firewalls and Virtual Networks*
        1. Click the **on** toggle to allow access to Azure Services. 

Once these pre-requisites are complete, you are ready to receive data into your SQL Server.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Open invitation

Check your inbox for an invitation from your data provider. The invitation is from Microsoft Azure, titled **Azure Data Share invitation from <yourdataprovider@domain.com>**. Take note of the share name to ensure you're accepting the correct share if there are multiple invitations. 

Select on **View invitation** to see your invitation in Azure. This takes you to your Received Shares view.

![Invitations](./media/invitations.png "List of invitations") 

Select the share you would like to view. 

## Accept invitation
Make sure all fields are reviewed, including the **Terms of Use**. If you agree to the terms of use, you'll be required to check the box to indicate you agree. 

![Terms of use](./media/terms-of-use.png "Terms of use") 

Under *Target Data Share Account*, select the Subscription and Resource Group that you'll be deploying your Data Share into. 

For the **Data Share Account** field, select **Create new** if you don't have an existing Data Share account. Otherwise, select an existing Data Share account that you'd like to accept your data share into. 

For the *Received Share Name* field, you may leave the default specified by the Data Provide, or specify a new name for the received share. 

![Target data share account](./media/target-data-share.png "Target data share account") 

Once you've agreed to the terms of use and specified a location for your share, Select on *Accept and Configure*. If you chose this option, a share subscription will be created and the next screen will ask you to select a target storage account for your data to be copied into. 

![Accept options](./media/accept-options.png "Accept options") 

If you prefer to accept the invitation now but configure your storage at a later time, Select *Accept and Configure later*. This option allows you to configure your target storage account later. To continue configuring your storage later, see [how to configure your storage account](how-to-configure-mapping.md) page for detailed steps on how to resume your data share configuration. 

If you don't want to accept the invitation, Select *Reject*. 

## Configure storage
Under *Target Storage Settings*, select the Subscription, Resource group, and storage account that you'd like to receive your data into. 

![Target storage settings](./media/target-storage-settings.png "Target storage") 

To receive regular refreshes of your data, make sure you enable the snapshot settings. Note that you will only see a snapshot setting schedule if your data provider has included it in the data share. 

![Snapshot settings](./media/snapshot-settings.png "Snapshot settings") 

Select *Save*. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are receiving SQL-based data and would like to receive that data into a SQL-based source, visit our [configure a dataset mapping](how-to-configure-mapping.md) how-to guide to learn how to configure a SQL Server as the destination for your dataset. 

## Trigger a snapshot

You can trigger a snapshot in the Received Shares -> Details tab by selecting **Trigger snapshot**. Here, you can trigger a full or  incremental snapshot of your data. If it is your first time receiving data from your data provider, select full copy. 

![Trigger snapshot](./media/trigger-snapshot.png "Trigger snapshot") 

When the last run status is *successful*, open the storage account to view the received data. 

To check which storage account you used, Select on **Datasets**. 

![Consumer datasets](./media/consumer-datasets.png "Consumer dataset mapping") 

## View history
To view a history of your snapshots, navigate to Received Shares -> History. Here you'll find a history of all snapshots that were generated for the past 60 days.
