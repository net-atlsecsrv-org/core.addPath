# Troubleshoot common issues in Azure Data Share 

This article shows how to troubleshoot common issues for Azure Data Share. 

## Azure Data Share invitations 

In some cases, when a new user clicks **Accept Invitation** from the e-mail invitation that was sent, they may be presented with an empty list of invitations.

This could be due to the following reasons:

* **Azure Data Share service is not registered as a resource provider of any Azure subscription in the Azure tenant.** You will experience this issue if there is no Data Share resource in your Azure tenant. When you create an Azure Data Share resource, it automatically registers the resource provider in your Azure subscription. You can also manually register the Data Share service following these steps. You'll need to have the Azure Contributor role to complete these steps.

    1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Subscriptions**
    1. Select the subscription you want to use to create Azure Data Share resource
    1. Click on **Resource Providers**
    1. Search for **Microsoft.DataShare**
    1. Click **Register** 

    You'll need to have the [Azure Contributor role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) to the Azure subscription to complete these steps. 

* **Invitation is sent to your email alias instead of your Azure login email.** If you have registered the Azure Data Share service or have already created a Data Share resource in the Azure tenant, but still cannot see the invitation, it maybe because the provider has entered your email alias as recipient instead of your Azure login email address. Contact your data provider and ensure that they have sent the invitation to your Azure login e-mail address and not your e-mail alias.

* **Invitation has already been accepted.** The link in the email takes you to the Data Share Invitation page in Azure portal, which only lists pending invitations. If you have already accepted the invitation, it will no longer show up in the Data Share Invitation page. Proceed to your Data Share resource which you used to accept the invitation into to view received shares and configure your target Azure Data Explorer cluster setting.

## Error when creating or receiving a new share

"Failed to add datasets"

"Failed to map datasets"

"Unable to grant Data Share resource x access to y"

"You do not have proper permissions to x"

"We could not add write permissions for Azure Data Share account to one or more of your selected resources"

If you receive any of the above errors when creating a new share or mapping datasets, it could be due to insufficient permissions to the Azure data store. See [Roles and requirements](concepts-roles-permissions.md) for required permissions. 

You need write permission to share or receive data from an Azure data store, which typically exists in the Contributor role. 

If this is the first time you are sharing or receiving data from the Azure data store, you also need *Microsoft.Authorization/role assignments/write* permission, which typically exists in the Owner role. Even if you created the Azure data store resource, it does NOT automatically make you the owner of the resource. With proper permission, Azure Data Share service automatically grants the data share resource's managed identity access to the data store. This process could take a few minutes to take effect. If you experience failure due to this delay, try again in a few minutes.

SQL-based sharing requires additional permissions. See [Share from SQL sources](how-to-share-from-sql.md) for detailed list of prerequisites.

## Snapshot failed
Snapshot could fail due to a variety of reasons. You can find detailed error message by clicking on the start time of the snapshot and then the status of each dataset. The following are common reasons why snapshot fails:

* Data Share does not have permission to read from the source data store or write to the target data store. See [Roles and requirements](concepts-roles-permissions.md) for detailed permission requirements. If this is the first time you are taking a snapshot, it could take a few minutes for Data Share resource to be granted access to the Azure data store. Wait for a few minutes and try again.
* Data Share connection to source or target data store is blocked by firewall.
* Shared dataset, or source or target data store is deleted.

For SQL sources, the following are additional causes of snapshot failures. 

* The source or target SQL script to grant Data Share permission is not run, or is run using SQL authentication rather than Azure Active Directory authentication.  
* The source or target SQL data store is paused.
* SQL data types are not supported by the snapshot process or target data store. Refer to [Share from SQL sources](how-to-share-from-sql.md#supported-data-types) for details.
* Source or target SQL data store are locked by other processes. Azure Data Share does not apply locks to source and target SQL data store. However, existing locks on the source and target SQL data store will cause snapshot failure.
* The target SQL table is referenced by a foreign key constraint. During snapshot, if a target table with the same name exists, Azure Data Share drops table and creates a new table. If the target SQL table is referenced by a foreign key constraint, the table cannot be dropped.
* Target CSV file is generated, but data cannot be read in Excel. This could happen when the source SQL table contains data with non-English characters. In Excel, select 'Get Data' tab and choose the CSV file, select file origin as 65001: Unicode (UTF-8) and load data.
