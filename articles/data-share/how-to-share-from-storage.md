# Share and receive data from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-storage](includes/appliesto-storage.md)]

Azure Data Share supports snapshot-based sharing from storage account. This article explains how to share and receive data from the following sources: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

Azure Data Share supports sharing of files, folders and file systems from Azure Data Lake Gen1 and Azure Data Lake Gen2. It also supports sharing of blobs, folders and containers from Azure Blob Storage. Only block blob is currently supported. Data shared from these sources can be received into Azure Data Lake Gen2 or Azure Blob Storage.

When file systems, containers or folders are shared in snapshot-based sharing, data consumer can choose to make a full copy of the share data, or leverage incremental snapshot capability to copy only new or updated files. Incremental snapshot is based on the last modified time of the files. Existing files with the same name will be overwritten during snapshot. File deleted from the source is not deleted on the target. Empty sub-folders at the source are not copied over to the target. 

## Share data

### Prerequisites to share data

* Azure Subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Your recipient's Azure login e-mail address (using their e-mail alias won't work).
* If the source Azure data store is in a different Azure subscription than the one you will use to create Data Share resource, register the [Microsoft.DataShare resource provider](concepts-roles-permissions.md#resource-provider-registration) in the subscription where the Azure data store is located. 

### Prerequisites for source storage account

* An Azure Storage account: If you don't already have one, you can create an [Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md)
* Permission to write to the storage account, which is present in *Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write*. This permission exists in the Contributor role.
* Permission to add role assignment to the storage account, which is present in *Microsoft.Authorization/role assignments/write*. This permission exists in the Owner role. 

### Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

### Create a Data Share Account

Create an Azure Data Share resource in an Azure resource group.

1. Select the menu button in the upper-left corner of the portal, then select **Create a resource** (+).

## Receive data

### Prerequisites to receive data
Before you can accept a data share invitation, you must provision a number of Azure resources, which are listed below. 

Ensure that all pre-requisites are complete before accepting a data share invitation. 

* Azure Subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* A Data Share invitation: An invitation from Microsoft Azure with a subject titled "Azure Data Share invitation from **<yourdataprovider@domain.com>**".
* Register the [Microsoft.DataShare resource provider](concepts-roles-permissions.md#resource-provider-registration) in the Azure subscription where you will create a Data Share resource and the Azure subscription where your target Azure data stores are located.

### Prerequisites for target storage account

* An Azure Storage account: If you don't already have one, you can create an [Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md). 
* Permission to write to the storage account, which is present in *Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write*. This permission exists in the Contributor role. 
* Permission to add role assignment to the storage account, which is present in *Microsoft.Authorization/role assignments/write*. This permission exists in the Owner role.  

### Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

### Open invitation

1. You can open invitation from email or directly from Azure portal. 

   To open invitation from email, check your inbox for an invitation from your data provider. The invitation is from Microsoft Azure, titled **Azure Data Share invitation from <yourdataprovider@domain.com>**. Click on **View invitation** to see your invitation in Azure. 

   To open invitation from Azure portal directly, search for **Data Share Invitations** in Azure portal. This takes you to the list of Data Share invitations.
