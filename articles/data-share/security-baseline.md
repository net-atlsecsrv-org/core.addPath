# Azure security baseline for Azure Data Share

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Microsoft Azure Data Share. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Data Share. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Data Share have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Data Share completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Data Share security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: 
Ingest logs related to Azure Data Share via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

Alternatively, you can enable and on-board this data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) 

- [How to get started with Azure Monitor and third-party SIEM integration](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/use-azure-monitor-to-integrate-with-siem-tools/) 

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Activity logs, which are automatically available, contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your Azure Data Share resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

Enable diagnostic logs for Azure Data Share, specifically the diagnostic logs for MicrosoftDataShareSentShareSnapshotsLog &amp; MicrosoftDataShareReceivedShareSnapshotsLog. These logs will enable you to capture key information like synchronization start time, end time, status and other details. These logs can be critical for later investigating security incidents and performing forensic exercises.
