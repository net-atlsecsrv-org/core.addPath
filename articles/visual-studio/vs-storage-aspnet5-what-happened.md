# What happened to my ASP.NET 5 project (Visual Studio Azure Storage connected services)?
## References added
The Azure Storage NuGet package was added to your Visual Studio project.  
This package adds the following .NET references:

* **Microsoft.Data.Edm**

* **Microsoft.Data.Services.Client**
* **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Configuration**
* **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage**

Also, the NuGet package **Microsoft.Framework.Configuration.Json** was added.

## Connection string for Azure Storage added
In the config.json file of your project, an element was created with the selected storage account's connection string and key.
