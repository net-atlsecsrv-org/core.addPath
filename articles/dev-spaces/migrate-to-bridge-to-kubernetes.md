# Migrating to Bridge to Kubernetes

Bridge to Kubernetes provides a lighter weight alternative to many of the development scenarios that work with Azure Dev Spaces. Bridge to Kubernetes is a client-side only experience using extensions in [Visual Studio][vs] and [Visual Studio Code][vsc].  

Bridge to Kubernetes helps your development experience by allowing an established Kubernetes application to include a service running on your local development workstation. Unlike Dev Spaces, Bridge to Kubernetes reduces inner loop complexities by side-stepping the need to create Docker and Kubernetes configurations, allowing developers to focus purely on the business logic of their microservice code.

Bridge to Kubernetes helps you to iterate on code running on your development computer while consuming dependencies and existing configuration from your Kubernetes environment. In contrast, Azure Dev Spaces deploys your microservice into the Kubernetes environment before you can remotely debug your service and iterate on your code.

This article provides a comparison between Azure Dev Spaces and Bridge to Kubernetes as well as instructions for migrating from Azure Dev Spaces to Bridge to Kubernetes.

## Development Approaches

![Development approaches](media/migrate-to-btk/development-approaches.svg)

Azure Dev Spaces helped Kubernetes developers work with code running directly in their AKS cluster, avoiding the need for a local environment that did not resemble the deployed environment. This approach improved certain aspects of development, but it also introduced a prerequisite of learning and maintaining additional concepts such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm before you could start using Azure Dev Spaces.

Bridge to Kubernetes allows developers to work directly on their development computers while interacting with the rest of their cluster. This approach takes advantage of the familiarity and speed of running code directly on their development computers while sharing the dependencies and environment provided by their cluster. This approach also takes advantage of the fidelity and scaling that comes from running in Kubernetes.

## Feature Comparison

Azure Dev Spaces and Bridge to Kubernetes have similar features, they also differ in several areas:

| Requirement  | Azure Dev Spaces  | Bridge to Kubernetes  |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Azure Kubernetes Service | In 15 Azure regions | Any AKS service region    |
| **Security** |
| Security access needed on your cluster  | AKS Cluster contributor  | Kubernetes RBAC -Deployment update   |
| Security access needed on your development computer  | N/A  | Local admin / sudo   |
| **Usability** |
| Independent from Kubernetes and Docker artifacts  | No  | Yes   |
| Automatic rollback of changes, post-debug  | No  | Yes   |
| **Environments** |
| Works with Visual Studio 2019  | Yes  | Yes   |
| Works with Visual Studio Code  | Yes  | Yes   |
| Works with the CLI  | Yes  | No   |
| **Operating System Compatibility** |
| Works on Windows 10  | Yes  | Yes  |
| Works on Linux  | Yes  | Yes  |
| Works on macOS  | Yes  | Yes  |
| **Capabilities** |
| Developer Isolation or Team Development  | Yes  | Yes  |
| Selectively overwrite environment variables  | No  | Yes  |
| Creation of Dockerfile and Helm chart  | Yes  | No  |
| Persistent deployment of code to Kubernetes  | Yes  | No  |
| Remote debugging in a Kubernetes pod  | Yes  | No  |
| Local debugging, connected to Kubernetes  | No  | Yes  |
| Debugging multiple services at the same time, on the same workstation  | Yes  | Yes  |

## Kubernetes inner loop development

The biggest difference between Azure Dev Spaces and Bridge to Kubernetes is where your code runs. Azure Dev Spaces helps develop and debug your microservice code, but requires that you run that code in your cluster. Bridge to Kubernetes allows you to develop and debug your microservice code directly on your development computer while still in the context of the larger application running in Kubernetes. Bridge to Kubernetes extends the perimeter of the Kubernetes cluster and allows local processes to inherit configuration from Kubernetes.

When using Bridge to Kubernetes, a network connection between your development computer and your cluster is established. For the lifetime of this connection, a proxy is added to your cluster in place of your Kubernetes deployment that redirects requests to the service to your development computer. When you disconnect, the application deployment will revert to using the original version of the deployment running on the cluster. This approach differs from how Azure Dev Spaces works in which code is synchronized to the cluster, built, then run. Azure Dev Spaces also doesn’t roll back your code.

Bridge to Kubernetes has the flexibility to work with applications running in Kubernetes regardless of their deployment method. If you use CI/CD to build and run your application, regardless of whether you use established tools or custom scripts, you can still use Bridge to Kubernetes to develop and debug your code.

> The [Microsoft Kubernetes extension][kubernetes-extension] lets you quickly develop Kubernetes manifests with Intellisense and helps scaffold Helm charts.  

### Use Visual Studio to transition to Bridge to Kubernetes from Azure Dev Spaces

1. Update your Visual Studio IDE to version 16.7 or greater and install the Bridge to Kubernetes extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][vs-marketplace].
1. Disable the Azure Dev Spaces controller using the Azure portal or the [Azure Dev Spaces CLI][azds-delete].
1. Remove the `azds.yaml` file from your project.
1. Redeploy your application.
1. Configure Bridge to Kubernetes on your deployed application. For more information on using Bridge to Kubernetes in Visual Studio, see [Use Bridge to Kubernetes][use-btk-vs].
1. Start debugging in Visual Studio using the newly created Bridge to Kubernetes debug profile.

### Use Visual Studio Code to transition to Bridge to Kubernetes from Azure Dev Spaces

1. Install the [Bridge to Kubernetes extension][vsc-marketplace].
1. Disable the Azure Dev Spaces controller using the Azure portal or the [Azure Dev Spaces CLI][azds-delete].
1. Remove the `azds.yaml` file from your project.
1. Redeploy your application.
1. Configure Bridge to Kubernetes on your deployed application. For more information on using Bridge to Kubernetes in Visual Studio Code, see [Use Bridge to Kubernetes][use-btk-vsc].
1. Start debugging in Visual Studio Code using the newly created Bridge to Kubernetes launch profile.

## Team development in a shared cluster

You can also use developer-specific routing with Bridge to Kubernetes. The Azure Dev Spaces team development scenario uses multiple Kubernetes namespaces to isolate a service from the rest of the application using the concept of parent and child namespaces. Bridge to Kubernetes offers the same capability, but with improved performance characteristics and within the same application namespace.

Both Bridge to Kubernetes and Azure Dev Spaces require HTTP headers to be present and propagated throughout the application. If you have already configured your application to handle header propagation for Azure Dev Spaces, then the header needs to be updated. To transition to Bridge to Kubernetes from Azure Dev Spaces, update configured header from *azds-route-as* to *kubernetes-route-as*.

## Evaluate Bridge to Kubernetes

If you’d like to experiment with Bridge to Kubernetes before you disable Azure Dev Spaces in your cluster, the easiest way is to use a new cluster. If you try to use Azure Dev Spaces and Bridge to Kubernetes at the same time on the same cluster, you will run into issues when using the routing features on both.

### Use Visual Studio to evaluate Bridge to Kubernetes

1. Update your Visual Studio IDE to version 16.7 or greater and install the Bridge to Kubernetes extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][vs-marketplace].
1. Create a new AKS cluster and deploy your application. You can also use a [sample application][btk-sample-app].
1. Configure Bridge to Kubernetes on your deployed application. For more information on using Bridge to Kubernetes in Visual Studio, see [Use Bridge to Kubernetes][use-btk-vs].
1. Start debugging in Visual Studio using the newly created Bridge to Kubernetes debug profile.

### Use Visual Studio Code to evaluate Bridge to Kubernetes

1. Install the [Bridge to Kubernetes extension][vsc-marketplace].
1. Create a new AKS cluster and deploy your application. You can also use a [sample application][btk-sample-app].
1. Configure Bridge to Kubernetes on your deployed application. For more information on using Bridge to Kubernetes in Visual Studio Code, see [Use Bridge to Kubernetes][use-btk-vsc].
1. Start debugging in Visual Studio using the newly created Bridge to Kubernetes launch profile.
