# Quickstart: Debug and iterate on Kubernetes with Visual Studio Code and Node.js - Azure Dev Spaces

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Set up Azure Dev Spaces with a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure.
- Iteratively develop code in containers using Visual Studio Code.
- Debug the code in your dev space from Visual Studio Code.

Azure Dev Spaces also allows you debug and iterate using:
- [Java and Visual Studio Code](quickstart-java.md)
- [.NET Core and Visual Studio Code](quickstart-netcore.md)
- [.NET Core and Visual Studio](quickstart-netcore-visualstudio.md)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- [Visual Studio Code installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- The [Azure Dev Spaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azuredevspaces.azds) extension for Visual Studio Code installed.
- [Azure CLI installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

You need to create an AKS cluster in a [supported region][supported-regions]. The below commands create a resource group called *MyResourceGroup* and an AKS cluster called *MyAKS*.

```cmd
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
az aks create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAKS --location eastus --disable-rbac --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Enable Azure Dev Spaces on your AKS cluster

Use the `use-dev-spaces` command to enable Dev Spaces on your AKS cluster and follow the prompts. The below command enables Dev Spaces on the *MyAKS* cluster in the *MyResourceGroup* group and creates a *default* dev space.

> [!NOTE]
> The `use-dev-spaces` command will also install the Azure Dev Spaces CLI if its not already installed. You cannot install the Azure Dev Spaces CLI in the Azure Cloud Shell.

```cmd
$ az aks use-dev-spaces -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAKS

'An Azure Dev Spaces Controller' will be created that targets resource 'MyAKS' in resource group 'MyResourceGroup'. Continue? (y/N): y

Creating and selecting Azure Dev Spaces Controller 'MyAKS' in resource group 'MyResourceGroup' that targets resource 'MyAKS' in resource group 'MyResourceGroup'...2m 24s

Select a dev space or Kubernetes namespace to use as a dev space.
 [1] default
Type a number or a new name: 1

Kubernetes namespace 'default' will be configured as a dev space. This will enable Azure Dev Spaces instrumentation for new workloads in the namespace. Continue? (Y/n): Y

Configuring and selecting dev space 'default'...3s

Managed Kubernetes cluster 'MyAKS' in resource group 'MyResourceGroup' is ready for development in dev space 'default'. Type `azds prep` to prepare a source directory for use with Azure Dev Spaces and `azds up` to run.
```

## Get sample application code

In this article, you use the [Azure Dev Spaces sample application](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces) to demonstrate using Azure Dev Spaces.

Clone the application from GitHub.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces
```

## Prepare the sample application in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code, click *File* then *Open...*, navigate to the *dev-spaces/samples/nodejs/getting-started/webfrontend* directory, and click *Open*.

You now have the *webfrontend* project open in Visual Studio Code. To run the application in your dev space, generate the Docker and Helm chart assets using the Azure Dev Spaces extension in the Command Palette.

To open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code, click *View* then *Command Palette*. Begin typing `Azure Dev Spaces` and click on `Azure Dev Spaces: Prepare configuration files for Azure Dev Spaces`.

When Visual Studio Code also prompts you to configure your public endpoint, choose `Yes` to enable a public endpoint.

![Select public endpoint](media/common/select-public-endpoint.png)

This command prepares your project to run in Azure Dev Spaces by generating a Dockerfile and Helm chart. It also generates a *.vscode* directory with debugging configuration at the root of your project.

## Build and run code in Kubernetes from Visual Studio Code

Click on the *Debug* icon on the left and click *Launch Server (AZDS)* at the top.

![Launch Server](media/get-started-node/debug-configuration-nodejs.png)

This command builds and runs your service in Azure Dev Spaces. The *Terminal* window at the bottom shows the build output and URLs for your service running Azure Dev Spaces. The *Debug Console* shows the log output.

> [!Note]
> If you don't see any Azure Dev Spaces commands in the *Command Palette*, make sure you have installed the [Visual Studio Code extension for Azure Dev Spaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azuredevspaces.azds). Also verify you opened the *dev-spaces/samples/nodejs/getting-started/webfrontend* directory in Visual Studio Code.

You can see the service running by opening the public URL.

Click *Debug* then *Stop Debugging* to stop the debugger.

## Update code

To deploy an updated version of your service, you can update any file in your project and rerun *Launch Server*. For example:

1. If your application is still running, click *Debug* then *Stop Debugging* to stop it.
1. Update [line 13 in `server.js`](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces/blob/master/samples/nodejs/getting-started/webfrontend/server.js#L13) to:
    
    ```javascript
        res.send('Hello from webfrontend in Azure');
    ```

1. Save your changes.
1. Rerun *Launch Server*.
1. Navigate to your running service and observe your changes.
1. Click *Debug* then *Stop Debugging* to stop your application.

## Setting and using breakpoints for debugging

Start your service using *Launch Server (AZDS)*.

Navigate back to the *Explorer* view by clicking *View* then *Explorer*. Open `server.js` and click somewhere on line 13 to put your cursor there. To set a breakpoint hit *F9* or click *Debug* then *Toggle Breakpoint*.

Open your service in a browser and notice no message is displayed. Return to Visual Studio Code and observe line 13 is highlighted. The breakpoint you set has paused the service at line 13. To resume the service, hit *F5* or click *Debug* then *Continue*. Return to your browser and notice the message is now displayed.

While running your service in Kubernetes with a debugger attached, you have full access to debug information such as the call stack, local variables, and exception information.

Remove the breakpoint by putting your cursor on line 13 in `server.js` and hitting *F9*.

Click *Debug* then *Stop Debugging* to stop the debugger.

## Update code from Visual Studio Code

Change the debug mode to *Attach to a Server (AZDS)* and start the service:

![](media/get-started-node/attach-nodejs.png)

This command builds and runs your service in Azure Dev Spaces. It also starts a [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) process in your service's container and attaches VS Code to it. The *nodemon* process allows for automatic restarts when source code changes are made, enabling faster inner loop development similar to developing on your local machine.

After the service starts, navigate to it using your browser and interact with it.

While the service is running, return to VS Code and update line 13 in `server.js`. For example:
```javascript
    res.send('Hello from webfrontend in Azure while debugging!');
```

Save the file and return to your service in a browser. Interact with the service and notice your updated message is displayed.

While running *nodemon*, the Node process is automatically restarted as soon as any code changes are detected. This automatic restart process is similar to the experience of editing and restarting your service on your local machine, providing an inner loop development experience.

## Clean up your Azure resources

```cmd
az group delete --name MyResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```

## Next steps

Learn how Azure Dev Spaces helps you develop more complex applications across multiple containers, and how you can simplify collaborative development by working with different versions or branches of your code in different spaces.
