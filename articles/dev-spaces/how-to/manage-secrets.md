# How to manage secrets when working with an Azure Dev Space

Your services might require certain passwords, connection strings, and other secrets, such as for databases or other secure Azure services. By setting the values of these secrets in configuration files, you can make them available in your code as environment variables.  These must be handled with care to avoid compromising the security of the secrets.

Azure Dev Spaces provides two recommended, streamlined options for storing secrets in Helm charts generated by the Azure Dev Spaces client tooling: in the values.dev.yaml file, and inline directly in azds.yaml. It's not recommended to store secrets in values.yaml. Outside of the two approaches for Helm charts generated by the client tooling defined in this article, if you create your own Helm chart, you can use the Helm chart directly to manage and store secrets.

## Method 1: values.dev.yaml
1. Open VS Code with your project that is enabled for Azure Dev Spaces.
2. Add a file named _values.dev.yaml_ in the same folder as existing _azds.yaml_ and define your secret key and values, as in the following example:

    ```yaml
    secrets:
      redis:
        port: "6380"
        host: "contosodevredis.redis.cache.windows.net"
        key: "secretkeyhere"
    ```
     
3. _azds.yaml_ already references the _values.dev.yaml_ file if it exists. If you prefer a different file name, update the install.values section:

    ```yaml
    install:
      values:
      - values.dev.yaml?
      - secrets.dev.yaml?
    ```
 
4. Modify your service code to refer to these secrets as environment variables, as in the following example:

    ```
    var redisPort = process.env.REDIS_PORT
    var host = process.env.REDIS_HOST
    var theKey = process.env.REDIS_KEY
    ```
    
5. Update the services running in your cluster with these changes. On the command line, run the command:

    ```
    azds up
    ```
 
6. (Optional) From the command line, check that these secrets have been created:

      ```
      kubectl get secret --namespace default -o yaml 
      ```

7. Make sure that you add _values.dev.yaml_ to the _.gitignore_ file to avoid committing secrets in source control.
 
 
## Method 2: Inline directly in azds.yaml
1.	In _azds.yaml_, set secrets under the yaml section configurations/develop/install. Although you can enter secret values directly there, it's not recommended because _azds.yaml_ is checked into source control. Instead, add placeholders using the "$PLACEHOLDER" syntax.

    ```yaml
    configurations:
      develop:
        ...
        install:
          set:
            secrets:
              redis:
                port: "$REDIS_PORT"
                host: "$REDIS_HOST"
                key: "$REDIS_KEY"
    ```
     
2.	Create a _.env_ file in the same folder as _azds.yaml_. Enter secrets using standard key=value notation. Donâ€™t commit the _.env_ file to source control. (To omit from source control in git-based version control systems, add it to the _.gitignore_ file.) The following example shows an _.env_ file:

    ```
    REDIS_PORT=3333
    REDIS_HOST=myredishost
    REDIS_KEY=myrediskey
    ```
2.	Modify your service source code to reference these secrets in code, as in the following example:

    ```
    var redisPort = process.env.REDIS_PORT
    var host = process.env.REDIS_HOST
    var theKey = process.env.REDIS_KEY
    ```
 
3.	Update the services running in your cluster with these changes. On the command line, run the command:

    ```
    azds up
    ```

4.	(optional) View secrets from kubectl:

    ```
    kubectl get secret --namespace default -o yaml
    ```

## Next steps

With these methods, you can now securely connect to a database, an Azure Cache for Redis, or access secure Azure services.
