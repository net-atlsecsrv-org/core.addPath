# How to manage secrets when working with an Azure Dev Space

[!INCLUDE [Azure Dev Spaces deprecation](../../../includes/dev-spaces-deprecation.md)]

Your services might require certain passwords, connection strings, and other secrets, such as for databases or other secure Azure services. By setting the values of these secrets in configuration files, you can make them available in your code as environment variables.  These configuration files must be handled with care to avoid compromising the security of the secrets.

## Storing and using runtime secrets

Azure Dev Spaces provides two recommended, streamlined options for storing secrets in Helm charts generated by the Azure Dev Spaces client tooling: in the `values.dev.yaml` file, and inline directly in `azds.yaml`. It's not recommended to store secrets in `values.yaml`.

> [!NOTE]
> The following approaches show you how to store and use secrets for Helm charts generated by the client tooling. If you create your own Helm chart, you can use the Helm chart directly to manage and store secrets.

### Using values.dev.yaml

In a project that you have already prepared with Azure Dev Spaces, create a `values.dev.yaml` file in the same folder as `azds.yaml` to define your secret keys and values. For example:

```yaml
secrets:
  redis:
    port: "6380"
    host: "contosodevredis.redis.cache.windows.net"
    key: "secretkeyhere"
```

Verify the `azds.yaml` file references `values.dev.yaml` as optional using a `?`. For example:

```yaml
install:
  values:
  - values.dev.yaml?
  - secrets.dev.yaml?
```

If you have additional secret files, you can add them here as well.

Update or verify your service references your secrets as environment variables. For example:

```javascript
var redisPort = process.env.REDIS_PORT
var host = process.env.REDIS_HOST
var theKey = process.env.REDIS_KEY
```
    
Run your updated services using `azds up`.

```console
azds up
```
 
Use `kubectl` to verify your secrets have been created.

```console
kubectl get secret --namespace default -o yaml 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not recommended to store secrets in source control. If using Git, add `values.dev.yaml` to the `.gitignore` file to avoid committing secrets in source control.

### Using azds.yaml

In a project that you have already prepared with Azure Dev Spaces, add secret keys and value using *$PLACEHOLDER* syntax under *configurations.develop.install.set* in `azds.yaml`. For example:

```yaml
configurations:
  develop:
    ...
    install:
      set:
        secrets:
          redis:
            port: "$REDIS_PORT"
            host: "$REDIS_HOST"
            key: "$REDIS_KEY"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can enter secret values directly without using *$PLACEHOLDER* syntax in `azds.yaml`. However, this approach is not recommended since `azds.yaml` is stored in source control.
     
Create a `.env` file in the same folder as `azds.yaml` to define your *$PLACEHOLDER* values. For example:

```
REDIS_PORT=3333
REDIS_HOST=myredishost
REDIS_KEY=myrediskey
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not recommended to store secrets in source control. If using Git, add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file to avoid committing secrets in source control.

Update or verify your service references your secrets as environment variables. For example:

```javascript
var redisPort = process.env.REDIS_PORT
var host = process.env.REDIS_HOST
var theKey = process.env.REDIS_KEY
```
    
Run your updated services using `azds up`.

```console
azds up
```
 
Use `kubectl` to verify your secrets have been created.

```console
kubectl get secret --namespace default -o yaml 
```

## Using secrets as build arguments

The previous section showed how to store and use secrets to use at container run time. You can also use any secret at container build time, such as a password for a private NuGet, using `azds.yaml`.

In `azds.yaml`, set the build time secrets in *configurations.develop.build.args* using the `<variable name>: ${secret.<secret name>.<secret key>}` syntax. For example:

```yaml
configurations:
  develop:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.develop
      useGitIgnore: true
      args:
        BUILD_CONFIGURATION: ${BUILD_CONFIGURATION:-Debug}
        MYTOKEN: ${secret.mynugetsecret.pattoken}
```

In the above example, *mynugetsecret* is an existing secret and *pattoken* is an existing key.

>[!NOTE]
> Secret names and keys may contain the `.` character. Use `\` to escape `.` when passing secrets as build arguments. For example, to pass a secret named *foo.bar* with the key of *token*: `MYTOKEN: ${secret.foo\.bar.token}`. In addition, secrets can be evaluated with prefix and postfix text. For example, `MYURL: eus-${secret.foo\.bar.token}-version1`. Also, secrets available in parent and grandparent spaces can be passed as build arguments.

In your Dockerfile, use the *ARG* directive to consume the secret, then use that same variable later in the Dockerfile. For example:

```dockerfile
...
ARG MYTOKEN
...
ARG NUGET_EXTERNAL_FEED_ENDPOINTS="{'endpointCredentials': [{'endpoint':'PRIVATE_NUGET_ENDPOINT', 'password':'${MYTOKEN}'}]}"
...
```

Update the services running in your cluster with these changes. On the command line, run the command:

```
azds up
```

## Next steps

With these methods, you can now securely connect to a database, an Azure Cache for Redis, or access secure Azure services.
