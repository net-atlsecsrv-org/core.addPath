Microsoft Azure Government delivers a dedicated cloud with world-class security and compliance, enabling US government agencies and their partners to transform their workloads to the cloud. To manage your Azure Government cloud workloads and applications you can connect to the Azure Government using different tools, as described in the following video.  

This quickstart shows how to connect to your Azure Government accounts and subscriptions with Visual Studio.
