Static authenticators, such as passwords and smartcard PINs for access to Azure platform components. Private keys of certificates used to manage Azure platform components. SQL connection strings.  Other security information/secrets, such as certificates, encryption keys, master keys, and storage keys stored in Azure services. |Metadata is not permitted to contain export-controlled data.
