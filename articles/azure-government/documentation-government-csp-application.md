# Azure Government CSP application process

Azure Government is available for purchase via different channels, one of them is the Cloud Solution Provider channel or CSP. The following resources provide an overview of what you need to become a CSP for US Government and be able to resell Azure Government.
An overview of the CSP program can be found in the [Cloud Solution Provider Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/csp-overview) page.

## Basics

Before being able to apply for CSP or any other programs that run under the Microsoft Partner Network, you need to obtain a Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID). To get an overview, visit the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider/get-started) page.
To become a Partner and obtain and ID, the [Enrollment and Membership](https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram/simplifiedenrollment.aspx) page has all the details. 

## Becoming a government CSP

Now that you have obtained an overview on what the CSP program is and met the basic requirement of becoming a Microsoft Partner, focus on becoming a Government CSP. Designed for the US government from the ground up, Microsoft Cloud for Government enables public sector customers in the United States—from large federal agencies to small town governments—to select from a range of cloud computing services. 
To best address its customers’ specific needs, Microsoft has made significant investment in datacenters and is dedicated to meeting compliance with US federal and state policies, mandates, and requirements. 

To initiate your application, visit the [CSP Program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/partner/csp/cloud-for-government) page.

## Obtaining your government tenant

The process kicks-off with the request for an Azure Government Tenant. The form to request this tenant and begin the validation can be found at the [Microsoft Government Validation CSP Request](https://azuregov.microsoft.com/csp) page.
Once complete, you receive a Government Azure Tenant. The validation includes the following items: 
 * Be a Microsoft Partner (have an MPN ID)
 * Verification of legitimacy of the Company, Systems Integrator, Distributor, or Independent Software Vendor (ISV) applying for the tenant
 * Verification of business engagements with government customers (for example, proof of services rendered to government agencies, statements of works, evidence of being part of GSA Schedule)
 * If you already have an Azure Government tenant, you can use your existing credentials to complete the CSP Application. 
 * Ensure that emails coming from [US Government Cloud Eligibility](mailto:usgcce@microsoft.com) are reaching your inbox.
 * Check SPAM / JUNK as credentials and asks for further info come from this alias. 

## Applying for government CSP

Use these credentials and navigate to the [CSP Partner Center for Gov application](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/register/joinnow/enrollmentwelcome/ResellerNationalCloud/migrate?cloudInstance=UnitedStatesGovernment) page and “Sign In” to apply to join for the CSP Government seller program.  It takes 5-6 days to process the application and once approved you receive an email to log on to [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com) to accept the Terms and Conditions.
