# Azure Government compliance

## Azure Blueprints

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Data Subject Requests (DSRs) on Azure Government

Azure tenant administrators can use the [User Privacy blade](https://portal.azure.us/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/UserPrivacyMenuBlade/Overview) in the Azure portal to export and/or delete personal data generated during a customer's use of Azure Government services.
