# Azure Government Marketplace
The Azure Government Marketplace helps connect government agencies and partners with independent software vendors (ISVs) and start-ups that are offering their solutions in Azure Government.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on making your images available in Azure Government, see the [partner onboarding guidelines](documentation-government-manage-marketplace-partners.md).

## Variations
The Azure Government Marketplace differs from the Azure Marketplace in the following ways:
* Only Bring Your Own License (BYOL) and Pay-as-you-Go (PayGo) images are available.
* A different set of images is available. You can find the list of available images [here](../azure-government-image-gallery.md) 

> [!NOTE]
> Red Hat Enterprise Linux is available in Azure Government with Azure Marketplace billing. This is a special case exception to the above statement about license options in Azure Government.
