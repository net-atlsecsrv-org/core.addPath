# Justice and Public Safety (JPS) in Azure Government
## Overview
Justice and Public Safety (JPS) agencies are under mounting pressure to keep communities safe, reduce crime, and improve responsiveness. From intelligent policing awareness systems, to body camera systems across the country/region, to day-to-day mobile police collaboration, cloud computing is transforming the way law enforcement agencies approach their work.

When they are properly planned and secured, cloud services can deliver powerful new capabilities for JPS. These capabilities include digital evidence management, data analysis, and real-time decision support--with solutions delivered on the latest mobile devices. However, not all cloud providers are equal. As law enforcement agencies embrace the cloud, they need a cloud service provider they can trust. The core of the law enforcement mission demands partners who are committed to meeting a full range of security, compliance, and operational needs.

From devices to the cloud, Microsoft puts privacy and information security first, while increasing productivity for officers in the field and throughout the department. By combining highly secure mobile devices with "anytime-anywhere" access to the cloud, JPS agencies can contribute to ongoing investigations, analyze data, manage evidence, and help protect citizens from threats.

Other cloud providers treat Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) compliance as a check box, rather than a commitment. At Microsoft, we're committed to providing solutions that meet the applicable CJIS controls, today and in the future. In addition, we extend our commitment to justice and public safety through our <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/presskits/dcu/#sm.0000eqdq0pxj4ex3u272bevclb0uc#KwSv0iLdMkJerFly.97">Digital Crimes Unit</a>, <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Taste-of-Premier/Satya-Nadella-on-Cybersecurity">Cyber Defense Operations Center</a>, and <a href="https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/government/public-safety/">Worldwide Justice and Public Safety organization</a>.
