# Azure Government Marketplace images

Microsoft Azure Government Marketplace provides a similar experience as Azure Marketplace. You can choose to deploy prebuilt images from Microsoft and our partners, or upload your own VHDs. This approach gives you the flexibility to deploy your own standardized images if needed.

## Images
To obtain a list of virtual machine images available in Azure Government, [connect to Azure Government via PowerShell](documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-ps.md) and run the following commands:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount -Environment AzureUSGovernment

Get-AzVMImagePublisher -Location USGovVirginia | `
Get-AzVMImageOffer | `
Get-AzVMImageSku
```
<!-- 
Get-AzVMImagePublisher -Location USGovVirginia | `
Get-AzVMImageOffer | `

Select-Object @{Name="Entry";Expression={"| " + $_.PublisherName + " | " + $_.Offer +  " | " + $_.Skus + " |" }} | `
