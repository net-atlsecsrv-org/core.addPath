# Isolation guidelines for Impact Level 5 workloads

Azure Government supports applications that use Impact Level 5 (IL5) data in all available regions. IL5 requirements are defined in the [US Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG)](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cloud/SRG/index.html#3INFORMATIONSECURITYOBJECTIVES/IMPACTLEVELS). IL5 workloads have a higher degree of impact to the DoD and must be secured to a higher standard. When you deploy these workloads on Azure Government, you can meet their isolation requirements in various ways. The guidance in this document addresses configurations and settings needed to meet the IL5 isolation requirements. We'll update this document as we enable new isolation options and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) authorizes new services for IL5 data.

## Background

In January 2017, DISA awarded the IL5 Provisional Authorization (PA) to [Azure Government for DoD](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/dod/), making it the first IL5 PA awarded to a hyperscale cloud provider. The PA covered two Azure Government for DoD regions (US DoD Central and US DoD East) that are dedicated to the DoD. Based on DoD mission owner feedback and evolving security capabilities, Microsoft has partnered with DISA to expand the IL5 PA boundary in December 2018 to cover [Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/get-started/). Azure Government is available from three regions (US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, and US Gov Virginia) to US federal, state, local, and tribal governments and their partners. The IL5 expansion to Azure Government honors the isolation requirements mandated by the DoD.

Azure Government continues to provide more PaaS services suitable for DoD IL5 workloads than any other cloud services environment.

## Principles and approach

You need to address two key areas for Azure services in IL5 scope: storage isolation and compute isolation. We'll focus on how these services can help isolate the compute and storage of IL5 data. The SRG allows for a shared management and network infrastructure. **This article is focused on Azure Government compute and storage isolation approaches.** If an Azure service is available in Azure Government for DoD and authorized at IL5, then it is by default suitable for IL5 workloads with no extra isolation configuration required. Azure Government for DoD is reserved for DoD agencies and their partners, enabling physical separation from non-DoD tenants by design.

For Azure service availability in Azure Government and Azure Government for DoD, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?regions=non-regional,usgov-non-regional,us-dod-central,us-dod-east,usgov-arizona,usgov-texas,usgov-virginia&products=all). For IL5 authorization status, see [Azure Government services by audit scope](./compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope.md#azure-government-services-by-audit-scope).

### Compute isolation

IL5 separation requirements are stated in the SRG [Section 5.2.2.3](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cloud/SRG/index.html#5.2LegalConsiderations). The SRG focuses on compute separation during "processing" of IL5 data. This separation ensures that a virtual machine that could potentially compromise the physical host can't affect a DoD workload. To remove the risk of runtime attacks and ensure long running workloads aren't compromised from other workloads on the same host, all IL5 virtual machines should be isolated via [Azure Dedicated Host](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/). Doing so provides a dedicated physical server to host your Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) for Windows and Linux.

For services where the compute processes are obfuscated from access by the owner and stateless in their processing of data, you should accomplish isolation by focusing on the data being processed and how it's stored and retained. This approach ensures the data is stored in protected mediums. It also ensures the data isn't present on these services for extended periods unless it's encrypted as needed.

### Storage isolation

In the most recent PA for Azure Government, DISA approved logical separation of IL5 from other data via cryptographic means. In Azure, this approach involves data encryption via keys that are maintained in Azure Key Vault and stored in FIPS 140-2 validated Hardware Security Modules (HSM). The keys are owned and managed by the IL5 system owner.

Here's how this approach applies to services:

- If a service hosts only IL5 data, the service can control the key for end users. But it must use a dedicated key to protect IL5 data from all other data in the cloud.
- If a service will host IL5 and non-DoD data, the service must expose the option for end users to use their own encryption keys that are maintained in Azure Key Vault. This implementation gives consumers of the service the ability to implement cryptographic separation as needed.

This approach ensures all key material for decrypting data is stored separately from the data itself using a hardware-based key management solution.

The DoD requirements for encrypting data at rest are provided in the SRG [Section 5.11](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cloud/SRG/index.html#5.11EncryptionofData-at-RestinCommercialCloudStorage). DoD emphasizes encrypting all data at rest stored in virtual machine virtual hard drives, mass storage facilities at the block or file level, and database records where the mission owner does not have sole control over the database service. For cloud applications where encrypting data at rest with DoD key control is not possible, mission owners must perform a risk analysis with relevant data owners before transmitting data into a cloud service offering.

## Applying this guidance

IL5 guidelines require workloads to be deployed with a high degree of security, isolation, and control. The following configurations are required *in addition* to any other configurations or controls needed to meet IL5 requirements. Network isolation, access controls, and other necessary security measures aren't necessarily addressed in this article.

Be sure to review the entry for each service you're using and ensure that all isolation requirements are implemented.

You can use Azure virtual machines with multiple deployment mediums. You can do so for single virtual machines and for virtual machines deployed via the Azure virtual machine scale sets feature.

All virtual machines should use Disk Encryption for virtual machines or Disk Encryption for virtual machine scale sets, or place virtual machine disks in a storage account that can hold Impact Level 5 data as described in the [Azure Storage section](#storage-encryption-with-key-vault-managed-keys).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you deploy VMs in Azure Government regions US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, and US Gov Virginia, you must use Azure Dedicated Host, as described in the next section.

#### [Azure Dedicated Host](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/)

Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers that can host one or more virtual machines and that are dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our datacenters, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, Availability Zone, and fault domain. You can then place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration meets your needs.

These VMs provide the necessary level of isolation required to support IL5 workloads when deployed outside of the dedicated DoD regions. When you use Dedicated Host, your Azure VMs are placed on an isolated and dedicated physical server that runs only your organization’s workloads to meet compliance guidelines and standards.

Current Dedicated Host SKUs (VM series and Host Type) that offer the required compute isolation include SKUs in the VM families listed on the [Dedicated Host pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/).

#### Isolated virtual machines

Virtual machine scale sets aren't currently supported on Azure Dedicated Host. But specific VM types, when deployed, consume the entire physical host for the VM. Each of the following VM types can be deployed via virtual machine scale sets to provide proper compute isolation with all the benefits of virtual machine scale sets in place. When you configure your scale set, select the appropriate SKU. To encrypt the data at rest, see the next section for supportable encryption options.

Current VM SKUs that offer the required compute isolation include SKUs in these VM families:

| **VM family** | **VM SKU** |
| --- | --- |
| D-Series (general purpose) | Standard\_DS15\_v2Standard\_D15\_v2 |
| Memory optimized | Standard\_E64is\_v3Standard\_E64i\_v3 |
| Compute optimized | Standard\_F72s\_v2 |
| Large memory optimized | Standard\_M128ms |
| GPU-enabled | Standard\_NV24 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As new hardware generations become available, some VM types might require reconfiguration (scale up or migration to a new VM SKU) to ensure they remain on properly dedicated hardware. This document will be updated to reflect any changes.

#### Disk Encryption for virtual machines

You can encrypt the storage that supports these virtual machines in one of two ways to support necessary encryption standards.

- Use Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the drives by using dm-crypt (Linux) or BitLocker (Windows):
  - [Enable Azure Disk Encryption for Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview.md)
  - [Enable Azure Disk Encryption for Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/disk-encryption-overview.md)
- Use Azure Storage service encryption for storage accounts with your own key to encrypt the storage account that holds the disks:
  - [Storage service encryption with customer-managed keys](../storage/common/customer-managed-keys-configure-key-vault.md)

- Use the [Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md) feature of Azure Automation to run runbooks directly on the VM that's hosting the role and against resources in your environment. Runbooks are stored and managed in Azure Automation. They are then delivered to one or more assigned computers known as "Hybrid Runbook Workers." Use Azure Dedicated Host or isolated virtual machine types for the Hybrid Worker role. When deployed, [isolated VM types](#isolated-virtual-machines) consume the entire physical host for the VM, providing the level of isolation required to support IL5 workloads.

  [Azure Dedicated Host](#azure-dedicated-host) provides physical servers that can host one or more virtual machines and that are dedicated to one Azure subscription.
- By default, your Azure Automation account uses Microsoft-managed keys. You can manage the encryption of secure assets for your Automation account by using your own keys. When you specify a customer-managed key at the level of the Automation account, that key is used to protect and control access to the account encryption key for the Automation account. For more information, see [Encryption of secure assets in Azure Automation](../automation/automation-secure-asset-encryption.md).

Azure Storage consists of multiple data features: Blob Storage, File Storage, Table Storage, and Queue Storage. Blob Storage supports both standard and premium storage. Premium storage uses only SSDs, to provide the fastest performance possible. Storage also includes configurations that modify these storage types, like hot and cool to provide appropriate speed-of-availability for data scenarios.

When you use an Azure Storage account, you must follow the steps for [storage encryption with Key Vault managed keys](#storage-encryption-with-key-vault-managed-keys) to ensure the data is protected with customer-managed keys. Azure Storage supports Impact Level 5 workloads in all Azure Government and Azure Government for DoD regions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use Tables and Queues outside the US DoD regions, you must encrypt the data before you insert it into the table or queue. For more information, see the instructions for using [client-side encryption](../storage/common/storage-client-side-encryption-java.md).

#### Storage encryption with Key Vault managed keys

To implement Impact Level 5 compliant controls on an Azure Storage account that runs in Azure Government outside of the dedicated DoD regions, you must use encryption at rest with the customer-managed key option enabled. The customer-managed key option is also known as "bring your own key."

For more information about how to enable this Azure Storage encryption feature, see the documentation for [Azure Storage](../storage/common/customer-managed-keys-configure-key-vault.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you use this encryption method, you need to enable it before you add content to the storage account. Any content that's added earlier won't be encrypted with the selected key. It will be encrypted only via the standard encryption at rest provided by Azure Storage.
