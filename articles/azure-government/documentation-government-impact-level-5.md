# Isolation guidelines for Impact Level 5 Workloads

Azure Government supports applications in all regions that require Impact Level 5 (IL5) data, as defined in the [US Department of Defense Cloud Security Requirements Guide (SRG)](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cloud/SRG/index.html). IL5 workloads have a higher degree of impact to the US Department of Defense and must be secured to a higher standard.  When supporting these workloads on Azure Government, their isolation requirements can be met in different ways. The guidance below will address configurations and settings for the isolation required to support IL5 data.  This document will be updated as new implementations are enabled and as new services are accredited for IL5 data by DISA.

## Background

In January 2017, the Impact Level 5 Provisional Authorization (PA) for Azure Government was the first provided to a Hyper Scale cloud provider.  This covered two regions of Azure Government (USDoD Central and USDoD East) that were dedicated to the DoD.  Based on mission owner feedback and evolving security capabilities, Microsoft has partnered with DISA to expand the IL5 PA in December 2018 to cover all six Azure Government regions while still honoring the isolation requirements needed by the Department of Defense.

Azure Government continues to provide more PaaS features and services to the DoD at Impact Level 5 than any other cloud provider.

## Principles and approach

To include a service in Impact Level 5 scope, there are two key areas that will be addressed – Storage Isolation and Compute Isolation.  We are focusing on how these services can isolate the compute and storage of Impact Level 5 data.  The SRG allows for a shared management and network infrastructure.

### Compute isolation

The SRG focuses on segmentation of compute when 'processing' data for Impact Level 5. This means ensuring that a virtual machine that compromises the physical host cannot impact a DoD workload.  To remove the risk of runtime attacks and ensure long running workloads are not compromised from other workloads on the same host, all Impact Level 5 virtual machines should be isolated using Azure Dedicated Hosts which provides a dedicated physical server to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux. 

For services where the compute processes are obfuscated from access by the owner and stateless in their processing of data; isolation will be accomplished by focusing on the data being processed and how it is stored and retained. This approach ensures that the data in question is stored in protected mediums and not present on these services for extended periods unless also encrypted as necessary.

### Storage isolation

In the most recent PA for Azure Government, DISA has approved logical separation of IL5 from other data using cryptographic means.  In Azure this means encryption using keys that are maintained in Azure Key Vault.  The keys are owned and managed by the L5 system owner.

When applying this to services, the following evaluation is applied:

- If a service only hosts IL5 data, then the service can control the key on behalf of the end users but must use a dedicated key to protect IL5 data from all other data in the cloud.
- If a service will host IL5 and non-DoD data, then the service must expose the option to use their own key for encryption. That key will be stored in Azure Key Vault.  This implementation gives consumers of the service the ability to implement cryptographic separation as needed.

This will ensure all key material for decrypting data is stored separately of the data itself and done so with a hardware key management solution.

## Applying this guidance

Impact Level 5 guidelines require workloads to be deployed with a high degree of security, isolation, and control. The below configurations are required in **addition** to any other configurations or controls needed to meet Impact Level 5. Network isolation, access controls, and other necessary security measures are not necessarily addressed in the guidance below.

Make sure to review the entry for each service you are utilizing and ensure that all isolation requirements have been implemented.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <sup>1</sup> When deploying VMs in these regions you must use **Azure Dedicated Host** as described below.

#### [Azure Dedicated Hosts](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/)

Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers - able to host one or more virtual machines - dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our data centers, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. Then, you can place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration best meets your needs.These VMs provide the necessary level of isolation required to support IL5 workloads when deployed outside of the dedicated DoD regions. Using dedicated host, your Azure VMs are placed on an isolated and dedicated physical server that runs only your organization’s workloads to meet compliance guidelines and standards.

Current Dedicated Host SKUs (VM series and Host Type) that offer necessary compute isolation include specific offerings from our VM families are listed here: (https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/)

#### Isolated Virtual Machines

Virtual machine scale sets are not currently supported on Azure Dedicated Hosts. However, specific VM types when deployed consume the entire physical host for that VM.  Each of the above VM types can be deployed leveraging virtual machine scale sets to provide proper compute isolation with all the benefits of virtual machine scale sets in place. When configuring your scale set, select the appropriate SKU. To encrypt the data at rest, see the next section for supportable encryption options.

Current VM SKUs that offer necessary compute isolation include specific offerings from our VM families:

| **VM Family** | **VM SKU** |
| --- | --- |
| D-Series - General Purpose | Standard\_DS15\_v2Standard\_D15\_v2 |
| Memory Optimized | Standard\_E64is\_v3Standard\_E64i\_v3 |
| Compute Optimized | Standard\_F72s\_v2 |
| Large Memory Optimized | Standard\_M128ms |
| GPU Enabled VMs | Standard\_NV24 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As new hardware generations become available, some VM types may require reconfiguration (scale up or migration to a new VM SKU) to ensure they remain on properly dedicated hardware. This document will be updated to reflect any changes.

#### Disk Encryption for Virtual Machines

The storage supporting these Virtual Machines can be encrypted in one of two ways to support necessary encryption standards.

- Leverage Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the drives using DM-Crypt (Linux) or BitLocker (Windows):

| **Automation** | X | X | X | | |

Automation can be used in Azure Government supporting Impact Level 5 workloads in the following configurations:

- Use the [Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md) feature of Azure Automation to run runbooks directly on the VM that's hosting the role and against resources in your environment. Runbooks are stored and managed in Azure Automation and then delivered to these one or more assigned computers known as Hybrid Runbook Workers. Use Azure Dedicated Host or Isolated Virtual Machine types for Hybrid worker role. [Isolated VM types](#isolated-virtual-machines) when deployed, consume the entire physical host for that VM providing the necessary level of isolation required to support IL5 workloads.

- [Azure Dedicated Host](#azure-dedicated-hosts) provides physical servers, able to host one or more virtual machines, dedicated to one Azure subscription.
- By default, your Azure Automation account uses Microsoft-managed keys.You can manage encryption of secure assets for your Automation account with your own keys. When you specify a customer-managed key at the level of the Automation account, that key is used to protect and control access to the account encryption key for the Automation account.

| **Queues** | X<sup>1</sup> | X<sup>1</sup> | X<sup>1</sup> | X | X |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <sup>1</sup>Tables and Queues when used outside the **USDoD Regions** must encrypt the data before inserting into the Table and Queue. For more information refer to the instructions for using [client side encryption](../storage/common/storage-client-side-encryption-java.md).

#### Storage Encryption with Key Vault Managed Keys

To implement Impact Level 5 compliant controls on an Azure Storage account running in Azure Government outside of the dedicated DoD regions, Encryption at Rest must be implemented with the customer-managed key option enabled (also known as bring-your-own-key).

For more information on how to enable this Azure Storage Encryption feature, please review the supporting documentation for [Azure Storage](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When using this encryption method, it is important that it is enabled BEFORE content is added to the storage account. Any content added prior will not be encrypted with the selected key, and only encrypted using standard encryption at rest provided by Azure Storage.`
