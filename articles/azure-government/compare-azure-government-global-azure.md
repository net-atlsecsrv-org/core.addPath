# Compare Azure Government and global Azure

Microsoft Azure Government uses same underlying technologies as global Azure, which includes the core components of [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/), [Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/), and [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-saas/). Both Azure and Azure Government have the same comprehensive security controls in place, as well as the same Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data.  Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an additional layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of Customer Data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing Customer Data to screened US persons.  These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations such as the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810.

### Export control implications
Customers are responsible for designing and deploying their applications to meet export control requirements such as those prescribed in the EAR and ITAR.  In doing so, customers should not include sensitive or restricted information in Azure resource names, as explained in [Considerations for Naming Azure Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-concept-naming-resources).  Data stored or processed in customer VMs, storage accounts, databases, Azure Import/Export, Azure Cache for Redis, ExpressRoute, Azure Cognitive Search, App Service, API Management, and other Azure services suitable for holding, processing, or transmitting Customer Data can contain export-controlled data.  However, metadata for these Azure services is not permitted to contain export-controlled data.  This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating and maintaining an Azure service, including subscription names, service names, server names, database names, tenant role names, resource groups, deployment names, resource names, resource tags, circuit name, etc.  It also includes all shipping information that is used to transport media for Azure Import/Export, such as carrier name, tracking number, description, return information, drive list, package list, storage account name, container name, etc.  Sensitive data should not be included in HTTP headers sent to the REST API in search/query strings as part of the API.

### Guidance for developers
Azure Government services operate the same way as the corresponding services in global Azure, which is why most of the existing online Azure documentation applies equally well to Azure Government.  However, there are some key differences that developers working on applications hosted in Azure Government must be aware of.  For detailed information, see [Guidance for developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-developer-guide).  As a developer, you must know how to connect to Azure Government and once you connect you will mostly have the same experience as in global Azure.  Table below lists URLs in Azure vs. Azure Government for accessing and managing various services.

> [!NOTE]
>This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see [**Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-3.3.0&preserve-view=true). For Az module installation instructions, see [**Install Azure PowerShell**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.3.0&preserve-view=true).

### [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview)
This section describes the supplemental configuration that is required to use Application Insights (part of Azure Monitor) in Azure Government.

**Enable Application Insights for [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-services-monitoringandmanagement#net-with-applicationinsightsconfig) & [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-services-monitoringandmanagement#aspnet-core) with Visual Studio**

Azure Government customers can enable Application Insights with a [codeless agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps) for their Azure App Services hosted applications or via the traditional **Add Applications Insights Telemetry** button in Visual Studio, which requires a small manual workaround. Customers experiencing the associated issue may see error messages like "There is no Azure subscription associated with this account or "The selected subscription does not support Application Insights even though the microsoft.insights resource provider has a status of registered for the subscription. To mitigate this issue, you must perform the following steps:

1. Switch Visual Studio to [target the Azure Government cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-vs).
1. Create (or if already existing set) the User Environment variable for AzureGraphApiVersion as follows: (To create a User Environment variable go to **Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environment Variables**.)

    Variable name: AzureGraphApiVersion Variable value: 2014-04-01

1. Make the appropriate Application Insights SDK endpoint modifications for either [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-services-monitoringandmanagement#net-with-applicationinsightsconfig) or [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-services-monitoringandmanagement#aspnet-core) depending on your project type.

**Snapshot Debugger** is now available for Azure Government customers. To use Snapshot Debugger the only additional prerequisite is to ensure that you are using [Snapshot Collector version 1.3.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.SnapshotCollector/1.3.5-pre-1906.403) or later. Then simply follow the standard [Snapshot Debugger documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/snapshot-debugger).

**SDK endpoint modifications** - In order to send data from Application Insights to the Azure Government region, you will need to modify the default endpoint addresses that are used by the Application Insights SDKs. Each SDK requires slightly different modifications, as described in [Application Insights overriding default endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/custom-endpoints?tabs=net). 

>[!NOTE]
>[**Connection strings**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net) are the new preferred method of setting custom endpoints within Application Insights.

**Firewall exceptions** - Application Insights uses a number of IP addresses. You might need to know these addresses if the app that you are monitoring is hosted behind a firewall.

>[!NOTE]
>Although these addresses are static, it's possible that we will need to change them from time to time. All Application Insights traffic represents outbound traffic except for availability monitoring and webhooks, which require inbound firewall rules.

You need to open some **outgoing ports** in your server's firewall to allow the Application insights SDK and/or Status Monitor to send data to the portal:

|Purpose|URL|IP address|Ports|
|-------|---|----------|-----|
|Telemetry|dc.applicationinsights.us|23.97.4.113|443|

    - Reduce DNS time to live on your Traffic Manager profile to fail over to healthy endpoints faster
    - Improve Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) performance
    - Use Premium Storage
    - Migrate your Storage Account to Azure Resource Manager
- Cost
    - Buy reserved virtual machines instances to save money over pay-as-you-go costs
    - Eliminate unprovisioned ExpressRoute circuits
    - Delete or reconfigure idle virtual network gateways

The calculation used to recommend that you should right-size or shut down underutilized virtual machines is as follows in Azure Government:

Advisor monitors your virtual machine usage for 7 days and identifies low-utilization virtual machines. Virtual machines are considered low utilization if their CPU utilization is 5% or less and their network utilization is less than 2% or if the current workload can be accommodated by a smaller virtual machine size. If you want to be more aggressive at identifying underutilized virtual machines, you can adjust the CPU utilization rule on a per subscription basis.

### [Azure ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/)
Azure ExpressRoute is used to create private connections between Azure Government datacenters and customer's on-premises infrastructure or a colocation facility.  ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet—they offer optimized pathways (shortest hops, lowest latency, highest performance, etc.) for customers and Azure Government geo-redundant regions.

- By default, all Azure Government ExpressRoute connectivity is configured active-active redundant with support for bursting, and it delivers up to 10 G circuit capacity (smallest is 50 MB).
- Microsoft owns and operates all fiber infrastructure between Azure Government regions and Azure Government ExpressRoute Meet-Me locations.
- Azure Government ExpressRoute provides connectivity to Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 cloud services.

Aside from ExpressRoute, customers can also use an [IPSec protected VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) (site-to-site for a typical organization) to connect securely from their on-premises infrastructure to Azure Government.  For network services to support Azure Government customer applications and solutions, it is strongly recommended that ExpressRoute (private connectivity) is implemented to connect to Azure Government. If VPN connections are used, the following should be considered:

- Customers should contact their authorizing official/agency to determine whether private connectivity or other secure connection mechanism is required and to identify any additional restrictions to consider.
- Customers should decide whether to mandate that the site-to-site VPN is routed through a private connectivity zone.
- Customers should obtain either a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) circuit or VPN with a licensed private connectivity access provider.

All customers who utilize a private connectivity architecture should validate that an appropriate implementation is established and maintained for the customer connection to the Gateway Network/Internet (GN/I) edge router demarcation point for Azure Government. Similarly, your organization must establish network connectivity between your on-premises environment and Gateway Network/Customer (GN/C) edge router demarcation point for Azure Government.

### BGP communities
This section provides an overview of how BGP communities are used with ExpressRoute in Azure Government. Microsoft advertises routes in the public and Microsoft peering paths with routes tagged with appropriate community values. The rationale for doing so and the details on community values are described below.

If you are connecting to Microsoft through ExpressRoute at any one peering location within the Azure Government region, you will have access to all Microsoft cloud services across all regions within the government boundary. For example, if you connected to Microsoft in Washington D.C. through ExpressRoute, you would have access to all Microsoft cloud services hosted in Azure Government.  [ExpressRoute overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) provides details on locations and partners, as well as a list of peering locations for Azure Government.

You can purchase more than one ExpressRoute circuit. Having multiple connections offers you significant benefits on high availability due to geo-redundancy. In cases where you have multiple ExpressRoute circuits, you will receive the same set of prefixes advertised from Microsoft on the public peering and Microsoft peering paths. This means you will have multiple paths from your network into Microsoft. This can potentially cause sub-optimal routing decisions to be made within your network. As a result, you may experience sub-optimal connectivity experiences to different services.

Microsoft tags prefixes advertised through public peering and Microsoft peering with appropriate BGP community values indicating the region the prefixes are hosted in. You can rely on the community values to make appropriate routing decisions to offer optimal routing to customers. For additional details, see [Optimize ExpressRoute Routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).

|Azure Government region|BGP community value|
|-----------------------|-------------------|
|US Gov Arizona|12076:51106|
|US Gov Virginia|12076:51105|
|US Gov Texas|12076:51108|
|US DoD Central|12076:51209|
|US DoD East|12076:51205|

All routes advertised from Microsoft are tagged with the appropriate community value.

In addition to the above, Microsoft also tags prefixes based on the service they belong to. This applies only to the Microsoft peering. The table below provides a mapping of service to BGP community value.

|Service in national clouds|BGP community value|
|--------------------------|-------------------|
|Exchange Online|12076:5110|
|SharePoint Online|12076:5120|
|Skype for Business Online|12076:5130|
|Dynamics 365|12076:5140|
|Other Office 365 Online services|12076:5200|

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft does not honor any BGP community values that you set on the routes advertised to Microsoft.

### [Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)
Traffic Manager health checks can originate from certain IP addresses for Azure Government.  Review the [IP addresses in the JSON file](https://azuretrafficmanagerdata.blob.core.windows.net/probes/azure-gov/probe-ip-ranges.json) to ensure that incoming connections from these IP addresses are allowed at the endpoints to check its health status.


## Security

### [Azure Active Directory Premium P1 and P2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/)
The following features have known limitations in Azure Government:

- Limitations with B2B Collaboration in supported Azure US Government tenants:
    - B2B Collaboration is available in most Azure US Government tenants created after June, 2019. Over time, more tenants will get access to this functionality. See [How can I tell if B2B collaboration is available in my Azure US Government tenant?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/current-limitations#how-can-i-tell-if-b2b-collaboration-is-available-in-my-azure-us-government-tenant)
    - B2B collaboration is currently only supported between tenants that are both within Azure US Government cloud and that both support B2B collaboration. If you invite a user in a tenant that isn't part of the Azure US Government cloud or that doesn't yet support B2B collaboration, the invitation will fail or the user will be unable to redeem the invitation.
    - B2B collaboration via Power BI is not supported. When you invite a guest user from within Power BI, the B2B flow is not used and the guest user won't appear in the tenant's user list. If a guest user is invited through other means, they'll appear in the Power BI user list, but any sharing request to the user will fail and display a 403 Forbidden error.
    - Microsoft 365 Groups are not supported for B2B users and can't be enabled.
    - Some SQL tools such as SSMS require you to set the appropriate cloud parameter. In the tool's Azure Service setup options, set the cloud parameter to Azure US Government.

- Limitations with Multi-factor Authentication:
    - Hardware OATH tokens are not available in Azure Government.
    - Trusted IPs are not supported in Azure Government. Instead, use Conditional Access policies with named locations to establish when Multi-Factor Authentication should and should not be required based off the user's current IP address.
