# Explore the Synapse Knowledge Center

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the Synapse Studio Knowledge Center.

## Getting to the Knowledge Center

There are two ways of finding the Knowledge Center in Synapse Studio:

  1. In the Home hub, under Useful links, click on the first link called **Knowledge Center**.
  2. In the menu bar at the top, click **?** and then  **Knowledge Center**.

Pick either method and open the **Knowledge Center**.

## Overview

The **Knowledge Center** allows you to do three things:
* **Use samples immediately**. This option is optimized for you seeing analytics in action as fast as possible. If you want a quick example of how Synapse works, choose this option.
* **Browser available sample**. This option lets you link sample data sets and add sample code in the form of SQL scripts, notebooks, and pipelines.
* **Tour Synapse studio**. This option takes you on a brief tour of the basic parts of Synapse Studio. This is useful if you have never used Synapse Studio before.
