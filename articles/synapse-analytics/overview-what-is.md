# What is Azure Synapse Analytics?

**Azure Synapse** is an enterprise analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. Azure Synapse brings together the best of **SQL** technologies used in enterprise data warehousing, **Spark** technologies used for big data, **Pipelines** for data integration and ETL/ELT, and deep integration with other Azure services such as **Power BI**, **CosmosDB**, and **AzureML**.


## Industry-leading SQL

**Synapse SQL** is a distributed query system for T-SQL that enables data warehousing and data virtualization scenarios and extends T-SQL to address streaming and machine learning scenarios.

* Synapse SQL offers both **serverless** and **dedicated** resource models. For predictable performance and cost, create dedicated SQL pools to reserve processing power for data stored in SQL tables. For unplanned or bursty workloads, use the always-available, serverless SQL endpoint.
* Use built-in **streaming** capabilities to land data from cloud data sources into SQL tables
* Integrate AI with SQL by using **machine learning** models to score data using the [T-SQL PREDICT function](/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true)

## Industry-standard Apache Spark

**Apache Spark for Azure Synapse** deeply and seamlessly integrates Apache Spark--the most popular open source big data engine used for data preparation, data engineering, ETL, and machine learning.

* ML models with SparkML algorithms and AzureML integration for Apache Spark 2.4 with built-in support for Linux Foundation Delta Lake.
* Simplified resource model that frees you from having to worry about managing clusters.
* Fast Spark start-up and aggressive autoscaling.
* Built-in support for .NET for Spark allowing you to reuse your C# expertise and existing .NET code within a Spark application.

## Working with your Data Lake

Azure Synapse removes the traditional technology barriers between using SQL and Spark together. You can seamlessly mix and match based on your needs and expertise.

* A shared Hive-compatible metadata system allows tables defined on files in the data lake to be seamlessly consumed by either Spark or Hive.
* SQL and Spark can directly explore and analyze Parquet, CSV, TSV, and JSON files stored in the data lake.
* Fast scalable load and unload for data going between SQL and Spark databases

## Built-in data integration via pipelines

Azure Synapse contains the same Data Integration engine and experiences as Azure Data Factory, allowing you to create rich at-scale ETL pipelines without leaving Azure Synapse Analytics.

* Ingest data from 90+ data sources
* Code-Free ETL with Data flow activities
* Orchestrate Notebooks, Spark jobs, Stored procedures, SQL scripts, and more

## Unified management, monitoring, and security

Azure Synapse provides a single way for enterprises to manage analytics resources, monitor usage and activity, and enforce security.

* Assign users to Role to simplify access to analytics resources
* Fine-grained access control on data and code
* A single dashboard to monitor resources, usage, and users across SQL and Spark

## Unified experience

**Synapse Studio** is the user experience that ties everything together for data engineers. It allows them to do every task they need to build a complete analytics solution.

* Key data engingeer tasks in one place: ingest, explore, prepare, orchestrate, visualize
* Industry-leading productivity for writing SQL or Spark code: authoring, debugging, and performance optimization
* Integrate with enterprise CI/CD process
