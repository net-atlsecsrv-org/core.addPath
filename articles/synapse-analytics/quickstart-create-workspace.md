# Quickstart: Create a Synapse workspace
This quickstart describes the steps to create an Azure Synapse workspace by using the Azure portal.

## Create a Synapse workspace

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and at the top search for **Synapse**.
1. In the search results, under **Services**, select **Azure Synapse Analytics (workspaces preview)**.
1. Select **Add** to create a workspace.
1. In the **Basics** tab, give the workspace a unique name. We'll use **mysworkspace** in this document
1. You need an ADLSGEN2 account to create a workspace. The simplest choice is to create a new one. If you want to re-use an existing one you'll need to perform some additional configuration. 
1. OPTION 1 Creating a new ADLSGEN2 account 
    1. Under **Select Data Lake Storage Gen 2**, click **Create New** and name it **contosolake**.
    1. Under **Select Data Lake Storage Gen 2**, click **File System** and  name it **users**.
1. OPTION 2 See the **Prepare a Storage Account** instructions at the bottom of this document.
1. Your Azure Synapse workspace will use this storage account as the "primary" storage account and the container to store workspace data. The workspace stores data in Apache Spark tables. It stores Spark application logs under a folder called **/synapse/workspacename**.
1. Select **Review + create** > **Create**. Your workspace is ready in a few minutes.

## Open Synapse Studio

After your Azure Synapse workspace is created, you have two ways to open Synapse Studio:

* Open your Synapse workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). On the top of the **Overview** section, select **Launch Synapse Studio**.
* Go to the `https://web.azuresynapse.net` and sign in to your workspace.

## Prepare an existing storage account for use with Synapse Analytics

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to an existing ADLSGEN2 storage account
1. Select **Access control (IAM)** on the left pane. Then assign the following roles or make sure they're already assigned:
    * Assign yourself to the **Owner** role.
    * Assign yourself to the **Storage Blob Data Owner** role.
1. On the left pane, select **Containers** and create a container.
1. You can give the container any name. In this document, we'll name the container **users**.
1. Accept the default setting **Public access level**, and then select **Create**.

### Configure access to the storage account from your workspace

Managed identities for your Azure Synapse workspace might already have access to the storage account. Follow these steps to make sure:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and the primary storage account chosen for your workspace.
1. Select **Access control (IAM)** from the left pane.
1. Assign the following roles or make sure they're already assigned. We use the same name for the workspace identity and the workspace name.
    * For the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role on the storage account, assign **myworkspace** as the workspace identity.
    * Assign **myworkspace** as the workspace name.

1. Select **Save**.
