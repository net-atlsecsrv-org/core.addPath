# Quickstart: Using Synapse Studio (preview)

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to query files using Synapse Studio.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Prerequisites

[Create an Azure Synapse workspace and associated storage account](quickstart-create-workspace.md).

## Launch Synapse Studio

In your Azure Synapse workspace in the Azure portal, click **Launch Synapse Studio**.

Alternatively, you can launch Synapse Studio by clicking [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://web.azuresynapse.net) and providing the appropriate tenant, subscription, and workspace values.

## Browse storage accounts

Once you open Synapse Studio, browse to **Data** and then expand **Storage accounts** to view the storage account in the workspace.

You can create new folders and upload files using the links in toolbar to organize your files.

## Query files on storage account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to be a member of the `Storage Blob Reader` role on the underlying storage in order to be able to query the files. Learn how to [assign **Storage Blob Data Reader** or **Storage Blob Data Contributor** RBAC permissions on Azure Storage](../storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal.md?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json#assign-a-built-in-rbac-role).

1. Upload some `PARQUET` files.
2. Select one or more files and then create a new SQL script or a Spark notebook to see the content of the files. If you want to create a notebook, you would need to create [Apache Spark pool in the workspace](quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool.md).

3. Run the generated query or notebook to see the content of the file:

4. You can change the query to filter and sort results. Find language features that are available in SQL on-demand in [SQL features overview](sql/overview-features.md).

## Next steps
