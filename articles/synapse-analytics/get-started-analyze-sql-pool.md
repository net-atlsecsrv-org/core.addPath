# Analyze data with dedicated SQL pools

Azure Synapse Analytics provides you with the capability to analyze data with a dedicated SQL pool. In this tutorial, you'll use the NYC Taxi data to explore a dedicted SQL pool's capabilities.

## Load the NYC Taxi Data into SQLDB1

1. In Synapse Studio, navigate to the **Develop** hub and then create new SQL script
1. Select the pool 'SQLDB1'(pool created in [STEP 1](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace#create-a-sql-pool) of this tutorial) in 'Connect to' section of the script.
1. Enter the following code:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Trip]
    (
        [DateID] int NOT NULL,
        [MedallionID] int NOT NULL,
        [HackneyLicenseID] int NOT NULL,
        [PickupTimeID] int NOT NULL,
        [DropoffTimeID] int NOT NULL,
        [PickupGeographyID] int NULL,
        [DropoffGeographyID] int NULL,
        [PickupLatitude] float NULL,
        [PickupLongitude] float NULL,
        [PickupLatLong] varchar(50) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL,
        [DropoffLatitude] float NULL,
        [DropoffLongitude] float NULL,
        [DropoffLatLong] varchar(50) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL,
        [PassengerCount] int NULL,
        [TripDurationSeconds] int NULL,
        [TripDistanceMiles] float NULL,
        [PaymentType] varchar(50) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL,
        [FareAmount] money NULL,
        [SurchargeAmount] money NULL,
        [TaxAmount] money NULL,
        [TipAmount] money NULL,
        [TollsAmount] money NULL,
        [TotalAmount] money NULL
    )
    WITH
    (
        DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN,
        CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
    );

    COPY INTO [dbo].[Trip]
    FROM 'https://nytaxiblob.blob.core.windows.net/2013/Trip2013/QID6392_20171107_05910_0.txt.gz'
    WITH
    (
        FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR = '|',
        FIELDQUOTE = '',
        ROWTERMINATOR='0X0A',
        COMPRESSION = 'GZIP'
    )
    OPTION (LABEL = 'COPY : Load [dbo].[Trip] - Taxi dataset');
    ```
1. This script will take about 1 minute to run. It loads 2 million rows of NYC Taxi data into a table called **dbo.Trip**

## Explore the NYC Taxi data in the dedicated SQL pool

1. In Synapse Studio, go to the **Data** hub.
1. Go to **SQLDB1** > **Tables**. You'll see several tables loaded.
1. Right-click the **dbo.Trip** table and select **New SQL Script** > **Select TOP 100 Rows**.
1. Wait while a new SQL script is created and runs.
1. Notice that at the top of the SQL script **Connect to** is automatically set to the SQL pool called **SQLDB1**.
1. Replace the text of the SQL script with this code and run it.

    ```sql
    SELECT PassengerCount,
          SUM(TripDistanceMiles) as SumTripDistance,
          AVG(TripDistanceMiles) as AvgTripDistance
    FROM  dbo.Trip
    WHERE TripDistanceMiles > 0 AND PassengerCount > 0
    GROUP BY PassengerCount
    ORDER BY PassengerCount
    ```

    This query shows how the total trip distances and average trip distance relate to the number of passengers.
1. In the SQL script result window, change the **View** to **Chart** to see a visualization of the results as a line chart.
