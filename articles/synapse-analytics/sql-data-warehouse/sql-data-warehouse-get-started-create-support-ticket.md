## Create a support ticket

Use the following steps to create a new support request from the Azure portal for Azure Synapse Analytics.

1. On  the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, select **Help + support**.

1. Review your [Azure support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/?WT.mc_id=Support_Plan_510979/).

   * **Billing, quota, and subscription management** support are available at all support levels.
   * **Break-fix** support is provided through [Developer](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/developer/), [Standard](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/standard/), [Professional Direct](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/prodirect/), or [Premier](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/premier/) support. Break-fix issues are problems experienced by customers while using Azure where there is a reasonable expectation that Microsoft caused the problem.
   * **Developer mentoring** and **advisory services** are available at the [Professional Direct](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/prodirect/) and [Premier](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/premier/) support levels.

   If you have a Premier support plan, you can also report Azure Synapse Analytics issues on the [Microsoft Premier online portal](https://premier.microsoft.com/). See [Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/?WT.mc_id=Support_Plan_510979/) to learn more about the various support plans, including scope, response times, pricing, etc.  For frequently asked questions about Azure support, see [Azure support FAQs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

1. For **Issue type**, select the appropriate issue type. For break-fix problems, select **Technical**. For quota increase requests, select **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**.

If you select **Technical**, you are asked to provide a summary and then identify a problem type by selecting **Select problem type**. You may see solutions to help resolve your issue. If the solutions presented do not resolve your issue, select **Next:Details** and complete the form to submit the support ticket.

### Enable subscription access to a region

Some offer types are not available in every region. You may see an error such as the following:

`This location is not available for subscription`

If your subscription needs access in a particular region, please use the **Other quota request** option to request access. In your request, specify the offering and SKU details that you want to enable for the region. To explore the offering and SKU options, see [Azure Synapse Analytics pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/synapse-analytics/).

## Monitor a support ticket

After you've submitted the support request, the Azure support team will contact you. To check your request status and details, click **All support requests** on the dashboard.
