# Troubleshooting Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics

This article lists common troubleshooting issues in Synapse SQL.

## Connecting

| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18456) | This error occurs when an Azure AD user tries to connect to the master database, but does not have a user in master.  To correct this issue, either specify the SQL pool you wish to connect to at connection time or add the user to the master database.  See [Security overview](sql-data-warehouse-overview-manage-security.md) article for more details. |
| The server principal "MyUserName" is not able to access the database "master" under the current security context. Cannot open user default database. Login failed. Login failed for user 'MyUserName'. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 916) | This error occurs when an Azure AD user tries to connect to the master database, but does not have a user in master.  To correct this issue, either specify the SQL pool you wish to connect to at connection time or add the user to the master database.  See [Security overview](sql-data-warehouse-overview-manage-security.md) article for more details. |
| CTAIP error                                                  | This error can occur when a login has been created on the SQL Database master database, but not in the specific SQL database.  If you encounter this error, take a look at the [Security overview](sql-data-warehouse-overview-manage-security.md) article.  This article explains how to create a login and user in the master database, and then how to create a user in a SQL database. |
| Blocked by Firewall                                          | SQL pools are protected by firewalls to ensure only known IP addresses have access to a database. The firewalls are secure by default, which means that you must explicitly enable and IP address or range of addresses before you can connect.  To configure your firewall for access, follow the steps in [Configure server firewall access for your client IP](create-data-warehouse-portal.md) in the [Provisioning instructions](create-data-warehouse-portal.md). |
| Cannot connect with tool or driver                           | Synapse SQL pool recommends using [SSMS](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest), [SSDT for Visual Studio](sql-data-warehouse-install-visual-studio.md), or [sqlcmd](sql-data-warehouse-get-started-connect-sqlcmd.md) to query your data. For more information on drivers and connecting to Azure Synapse, see [Drivers for Azure Synapse](sql-data-warehouse-connection-strings.md) and [Connect to Azure Synapse](sql-data-warehouse-connect-overview.md) articles. |

## Tools

| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual Studio object explorer is missing Azure AD users           | This is a known issue.  As a workaround, view the users in [sys.database_principals](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-database-principals-transact-sql?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest).  See [Authentication to Azure Synapse](sql-data-warehouse-authentication.md) to learn more about using Azure Active Directory with Synapse SQL pool. |
| Manual scripting, using the scripting wizard, or connecting via SSMS is slow, not responding, or producing errors | Ensure that users have been created in the master database. In scripting options, also make sure that the engine edition is set as "Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics Edition" and engine type is "Microsoft Azure SQL Database". |
| Generate scripts fails in SSMS                               | Generating a script for Synapse SQL pool fails if the option "Generate script for dependent objects" option is set to "True." As a workaround, users must manually go to **Tools -> Options ->SQL Server Object Explorer -> Generate script for dependent options and set to false** |

## Performance

| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query performance troubleshooting                            | If you are trying to troubleshoot a particular query, start with [Learning how to monitor your queries](sql-data-warehouse-manage-monitor.md#monitor-query-execution). |
| TempDB space issues | [Monitor TempDB](sql-data-warehouse-manage-monitor.md#monitor-tempdb) space usage.  Common causes for running out of TempDB space are:<br>- Not enough resources allocated to the query causing data to spill to TempDB.  See [Workload management](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md) <br>- Statistics are missing or out of date causing excessive data movement.  See [Maintaining table statistics](sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md) for details on how to create statistics<br>- TempDB space is allocated per service level.  [Scaling your SQL pool](sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview.md#scaling-compute) to a higher DWU setting allocates more TempDB space.|
| Poor query performance and plans often is a result of missing statistics | The most common cause of poor performance is lack of statistics on your tables.  See [Maintaining table statistics](sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md) for details on how to create statistics and why they are critical to your performance. |
| Low concurrency / queries queued                             | Understanding [Workload management](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md) is important in order to understand how to balance memory allocation with concurrency. |
| How to implement best practices                              | The best place to start to learn ways to improve query performance is [Synapse SQL pool best practices](sql-data-warehouse-best-practices.md) article. |
| How to improve performance with scaling                      | Sometimes the solution to improving performance is to simply add more compute power to your queries by [Scaling your SQL pool](sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview.md). |
| Poor query performance as a result of poor index quality     | Some times queries can slow down because of [Poor columnstore index quality](sql-data-warehouse-tables-index.md#causes-of-poor-columnstore-index-quality).  See this article for more information and how to [Rebuild indexes to improve segment quality](sql-data-warehouse-tables-index.md#rebuilding-indexes-to-improve-segment-quality). |

## System management

| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Msg 40847: Could not perform the operation because server would exceed the allowed Database Transaction Unit quota of 45000. | Either reduce the [DWU](what-is-a-data-warehouse-unit-dwu-cdwu.md) of the database you are trying to create or [request a quota increase](sql-data-warehouse-get-started-create-support-ticket.md). |
| Investigating space utilization                              | See [Table sizes](sql-data-warehouse-tables-overview.md#table-size-queries) to understand the space utilization of your system. |
| Help with managing tables                                    | See the [Table overview](sql-data-warehouse-tables-overview.md) article for help with managing your tables.  This article also includes links into more detailed topics like [Table data types](sql-data-warehouse-tables-data-types.md), [Distributing a table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-distribute.md), [Indexing a table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-index.md),  [Partitioning a table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-partition.md), [Maintaining table statistics](sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md) and [Temporary tables](sql-data-warehouse-tables-temporary.md). |
| Transparent data encryption (TDE) progress bar is not updating in the Azure portal | You can view the state of TDE via [PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.sql/get-azsqldatabasetransparentdataencryption?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json). |
