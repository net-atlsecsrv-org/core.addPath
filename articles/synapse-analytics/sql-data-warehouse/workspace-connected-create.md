# Enabling Synapse workspace features for a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)

All SQL data warehouse users can now access and use an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instance via the Synapse Studio and Workspace. Users can use the Synapse Studio and Workspace without impacting automation, connections, or tooling. This article explains how an existing Azure Synapse Analytics user can enable the Synapse workspace features for an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW). The user can expand their existing Analytics solution by taking advantage of the new feature-rich capabilities now available via the Synapse workspace and Studio.   

## Prerequisites
Before you enable the Synapse workspace features on your data warehouse, you must ensure that you've the following
- Rights to create and manage the SQL resources that are hosted on the SQL logical server.
- Rights to create Azure Synapse resources.
- An Azure Active Directory admin identified on the logical server

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Enabling Synapse workspace features for an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)

The Synapse workspace features can be enabled on any existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in a supported region. This capability is only available via the Azure portal.

Follow these steps to create a Synapse workspace for your existing data warehouse.
1. Select an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) and open the overview page.
2. Select **New Synapse workspace** in the top menu bar or the message immediately below.
3. After reviewing the list of data warehouses that are made available via the new Synapse workspace on the **Create new Azure Synapse workspace** page. Select **Continue** to proceed.
4. On the Basics page, the existing dedicated SQL pool (the **Project** details section should be pre-populated with the same **Subscription** and **Resource group** that is deployed under the logical server. And under **Workspace details**, the **Workspace** name is pre-populated with the same name and region of the SQL logical server to ensure the connection between your new Synapse workspace and the logical server can be created during the provisioning process. Post provisioning this connection must be retained to ensure continued access to the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances via the workspace and Studio.
5. Navigate to Select Data Lake Storage Gen 2.
6. Select **Create new** or select an existing **Data Lake Storage Gen2** before selecting **Next: Networking**.
7. Choose a **SQL administrator password** for your **Serverless instance**. Changing this password doesn't update or change the logical server SQL credentials. If you prefer a system defined password, leave these fields empty. This password can be change at any time within the new workspace. The admin name must be the same used on the SQL Server.
8. Select your preferred **Networking settings** and select **Review + Create** to start workspace provisioning.
9. Select **Goto resource** to open your new workspace.

    > [!NOTE]
    > All dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances hosted on the logical server are available via the new workspace.

## Post provisioning steps
The following steps must be completed to ensure that your existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances can be accessed via the Synapse Studio.
1. In the Synapse workspace overview page, select **Connected server**. The **Connected server** takes you to the connected SQL Logical server that hosts your data warehouses. In the essential menu, select **Connected server**.
2. Open **Firewalls and virtual networks** and ensure that your client IP or a predetermined IP range has access to the logical server.
3. Open **Active Directory admin** and ensure that an AAD admin has been set on the logical server.
4. Select one of the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances hosted on the logical server. In the overview page, select **Launch Synapse Studio** or Go to the [Sign in to the Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net) and sign in to your workspace.

5. Open the **Data hub** and expand the dedicated SQL pool in the Object explorer to ensure that you've access and can query your data warehouse.
