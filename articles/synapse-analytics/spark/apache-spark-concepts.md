# Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics Core Concepts

Apache Spark is a parallel processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analytic applications. Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics is one of Microsoft's implementations of Apache Spark in the cloud. 

Azure Synapse makes it easy to create and configure Spark capabilities in Azure. Azure Synapse provides a different implementation of these Spark capabilities that are documented here.

## Spark pools (preview)

A Spark pool (preview) is created in the Azure portal. It's the definition of a Spark pool that, when instantiated, is used to create a Spark instance that processes data. When a Spark pool is created, it exists only as metadata, and no resources are consumed, running, or charged for. A Spark pool has a series of properties that control the characteristics of a Spark instance. These characteristics include but aren't limited to name, size, scaling behavior, time to live.

As there's no dollar or resource cost associated with creating Spark pools, any number can be created with any number of different configurations. Permissions can also be applied to Spark pools allowing users only to have access to some and not others.

A best practice is to create smaller Spark pools that may be used for development and debugging and then larger ones for running production workloads.

You can read how to create a Spark pool and see all their properties here [Get started with Spark pools in Synapse Analytics](../quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool-portal.md)

## Spark instances

Spark instances are created when you connect to a Spark pool, create a session, and run a job. As multiple users may have access to a single Spark pool, a new Spark instance is created for each user that connects. 

When you submit a second job, if there is capacity in the pool, the existing Spark instance also has capacity. Then, the existing instance will process the job. Otherwise, if capacity is available at the pool level, then a new Spark instance will be created.

## Examples

### Example 1

- You create a Spark pool called SP1; it has a fixed cluster size of 20 nodes.
- You submit a notebook job, J1 that uses 10 nodes, a Spark instance, SI1 is created to process the job.
- You now submit another job, J2, that uses 10 nodes because there is still capacity in the pool and the instance, the J2, is processed by SI1.
- If J2 had asked for 11 nodes, there would not have been capacity in SP1 or SI1. In this case, if J2 comes from a notebook, then the job will be rejected; if J2 comes from a batch job, then it will be queued.

### Example 2

- You create a Spark pool call SP2; it has an autoscale enabled 10 â€“ 20 nodes
- You submit a notebook job, J1 that uses 10 nodes, a Spark instance, SI1, is created to process the job.
- You now submit another job, J2, that uses 10 nodes, because there is still capacity in the pool the instance auto grows to 20 nodes and processes J2.

### Example 3

- You create a Spark pool called SP1; it has a fixed cluster size of 20 nodes.
- You submit a notebook job, J1 that uses 10 nodes, a Spark instance, SI1 is created to process the job.
- Another user, U2, submits a Job, J3, that uses 10 nodes, a new Spark instance, SI2, is created to process the job.
- You now submit another job, J2, that uses 10 nodes because there's still capacity in the pool and the instance, J2, is processed by SI1.

## Quotas and resource constraints in Apache Spark for Azure Synapse

### Workspace level

Every Azure Synapse workspace comes with a default quota of vCores that can be used for Spark. The quota is split between the user quota and the dataflow quota so that neither usage pattern uses up all the vCores in the workspace. The quota is different depending on the type of your subscription but is symmetrical between user and dataflow. However if you request more vCores than are remaining in the workspace, then you will get the following error:

```console
Failed to start session: [User] MAXIMUM_WORKSPACE_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED
Your Spark job requested 480 vcores.
However, the workspace only has xxx vcores available out of quota of yyy vcores.
Try reducing the numbers of vcores requested or increasing your vcore quota. Click here for more information - https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=213499
```

The link in the message points to this article.

The following article describes how to request an increase in workspace vCore quota.

- Select "Azure Synapse Analytics" as the service type.
- In the Quota details window, select Apache Spark (vCore) per workspace

[Request a capacity increase via the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests#request-a-standard-quota-increase-from-help--support)

### Spark pool level

When you define a Spark pool you are effectively defining a quota per user for that pool, if you run multiple notebooks or jobs or a mix of the 2 it is possible to exhaust the pool quota. If you do, then an error message like the following will be generated

```console
Failed to start session: Your Spark job requested xx vcores.
However, the pool is consuming yy vcores out of available zz vcores.Try ending the running job(s) in the pool, reducing the numbers of vcores requested, increasing the pool maximum size or using another pool
```

To solve this problem you have to reduce your usage of the pool resources before submitting a new resource request by running a notebook or a job.
