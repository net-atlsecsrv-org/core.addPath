# Tutorial: Create Apache Spark job definition in Synapse Studio

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Azure Synapse Studio to create Apache Spark job definitions, and then submit them to an Apache Spark pool.

This tutorial covers the following tasks:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create an Apache Spark job definition for PySpark (Python)
> - Create an Apache Spark job definition for Spark(Scala)
> - Create an Apache Spark job definition for .NET Spark(C#/F#)
> - Submit an Apache Spark job definition as a batch job
> - Add an Apache Spark job definition into pipeline

## Prerequisites

Before you start with this tutorial, make sure to meet the following requirements:

* An Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. For instructions, see [Create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace](../../machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace.md?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json#create-a-workspace).
* An Apache Spark pool.
* An ADLS Gen2 storage account. You need to be the **Storage Blob Data Owner** of the ADLS Gen2 filesystem you want to work with. If you aren't, you need to add the permission manually.
* If you don’t want to use the workspace default storage, link the required ADLS Gen2 storage account in Synapse Studio. 

## Create an Apache Spark job definition for PySpark (Python)

In this section, you create an Apache Spark job definition for PySpark (Python).

1. Open [Azure Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net/).

2. You can go to [Sample files for creating Apache Spark job definitions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Synapse/tree/master/Spark/Python) to download **sample files for python.zip**, then unzip the compressed package, and extract the **wordcount.py** and **shakespeare.txt** files. 

     ![sample files](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/sample-files.png)

3. Select **Data** -> **Linked** -> **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**, and upload **wordcount.py** and **shakespeare.txt** into your ADLS Gen2 filesystem. 

     ![upload python file](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/upload-python-file.png)

4. Select **Develop** hub, select the '+' icon and select **Spark job definition** to create a new Spark job definition.

## Submit an Apache Spark job definition as a batch job

After creating an Apache Spark job definition, you can submit it to an Apache Spark pool. Make sure you are the **Storage Blob Data Owner** of the ADLS Gen2 filesystem you want to work with. If you aren't, you need to add the permission manually.

### Scenario 1: Submit Apache Spark job definition
 1. Open an Apache spark job definition window by selecting it.

      ![Open spark job definition to submit ](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/open-spark-definition.png)

 2. Select **Submit** button to submit your project to the selected Apache Spark Pool. You can select **Spark monitoring URL** tab to see the LogQuery of the Apache Spark application.

    ![Select submit button to submit spark job definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/submit-spark-definition.png)

    ![The Spark Submission dialog box](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/submit-definition-result.png)

### Scenario 2: View Apache Spark job running progress

 1. Select **Monitor**, then select the **Apache Spark applications** option. You can find the submitted Apache Spark application.

     ![View Spark application](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/view-spark-application.png)

 2. Then select an Apache Spark application, the **SparkJobDefinition** job window displays. You can view the job execution progress from here.
     
     ![View spark application LogQuery](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/view-job-log-query.png)

### Scenario 3: Check output file

 1. Select **Data** -> **Linked** -> **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (hozhaobdbj), open the **result** folder created earlier, you can go to the result folder and check if the output is generated.

     ![View output file](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/view-output-file.png)

## Add an Apache Spark job definition into pipeline

In this section, you add an Apache Spark job definition into pipeline.

 1. Open an existing Apache Spark job definition.

 2. Select the icon on the top right of Apache Spark job definition, choose **Existing Pipeline**, or **New pipeline**. You can refer to Pipeline page for more information.
