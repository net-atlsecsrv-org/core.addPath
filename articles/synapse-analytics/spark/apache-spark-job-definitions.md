# Tutorial: Use Azure Synapse Analytics to create Apache Spark job definitions for Synapse Spark pools

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Azure Synapse Analytics to create Spark job definitions, and then submit them to a Synapse Spark pool. You can use the plug-in in a few ways:

* Develop and submit a Spark job definition on a Synapse Spark pool.
* View job details after submission.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

* An Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. For instructions, see [Create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace](../../machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace.md?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json#create-a-workspace).

## Get started

Before submitting a Spark job definition, you need to be the Storage Blob Data Owner of the ADLS Gen2 filesystem you want to work with. If you aren't, you need to add the permission manually.

### Scenario 1: Add permission

1. Open [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com), then open Storage account.

2. Click **Containers**, then create a **File system**. This tutorial uses `sparkjob`.

3. Open `sparkjob`, click **Access Control(IAM)**, then click **Add** and select **Add role assignment**.

    ![Click submit button to submit spark job definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/add-role-assignment-02.png)

4. Click **Role assignments**, input user name, then verify user role.

    ![Click submit button to submit spark job definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/verify-user-role.png)

### Scenario 2: Prepare folder structure

Before submitting a Spark job definition, one job you need to do is uploading files to ADLS Gen2 and preparing folder structure there. We use Storage node in Synapse Studio to store files.

1. Open [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://web.azuresynapse.net/).

2. Click **Data**, select **Storage accounts**, and Upload the relevant files to your ADLS Gen2 filesystem. We support Scala, Java, .NET, and Python. This tutorial uses the example in the figure as a demonstration, you can change project structure as you wish.

## Create a Spark job definition

1. Open [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://web.azuresynapse.net/), and select **Develop**.

2. Select **Spark job definitions** from the left pane.

3. Click **Actions** node on the right of the "Spark job definitions".

     ![Create new spark job definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/create-new-definition-01.png)

4. From the **Actions** drop-down list, select **New Spark job definition**

     ![Create new spark job definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/create-new-definition-02.png)

5. In the New Spark job definition window, select language, then provide the following information:  

   * Select **Language** as **Spark(Scala)**.

## Submit a Spark job definition

After creating a Spark job definition, you can submit it to a Synapse Spark pool. Make sure you've gone through steps in **Get-started** before trying samples in this part.

### Scenario 1: Submit Spark job definition

1. Open a spark job definition window by clicking it.

      ![Open spark job definition to submit ](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/open-spark-definition.png)

2. Click **submit** icon to submit your project to the selected Spark Pool. You can click **Spark monitoring URL** tab to see the LogQuery of the Spark application.

    ![The Spark Submission dialog box](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/submit-definition-result.png)

### Scenario 2: View Spark job running progress

1. Click **Monitor**, then select the **Spark applications** option. You can find the submitted Spark application.

    ![View Spark application](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/view-spark-application.png)

2. Then click the Spark application, **LogQuery** window displays. You can view the job execution progress from **LogQuery**.
