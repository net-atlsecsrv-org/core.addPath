# Introduction to Microsoft Spark Utilities

Microsoft Spark Utilities (MSSparkUtils) is a builtin package to help you easily perform common tasks. You can use MSSparkUtils to work with file systems, to get environment variables, to chain notebooks together, and to work with secrets. MSSparkUtils are available in `PySpark (Python)`, `Scala`, and `.NET Spark (C#)` notebooks and Synapse pipelines.

## Pre-requisites

### Configure access to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 

Synapse notebooks use Azure Active Airectory (AAD) pass-through to access the ADLS Gen2 accounts. You need to be a **Storage Blob Data Contributor** to access the ADLS Gen2 account (or folder). 

Synapse pipelines use workspace's Managed Service Identity (MSI) to access the storage accounts. To use MSSparkUtils in your pipeline activities, your workspace identity needs to be **Storage Blob Data Contributor** to access the ADLS Gen2 account (or folder).

Follow these steps to make sure your Azure AD and workspace MSI have access to the ADLS Gen2 account:
1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and the storage account you want to access. You can navigate to the specific container you want to access.
2. Select the **Access control (IAM)** from the left panel.
3. Assign **your Azure AD account** and **your workspace identity** (same as your workspace name) to the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role on the storage account if it is not already assigned. 
4. Select **Save**.

You can access data on ADLS Gen2 with Synapse Spark via the following URL:

<code>abfss://<container_name>@<storage_account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path></code>

### Configure access to Azure Blob Storage  

Synapse use [**Shared access signature (SAS)**](../../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md) to access Azure Blob Storage. To avoid exposing SAS keys in the code, we recommend creating a new linked service in Synapse workspace to the Azure Blob Storage account you want to access.

Follow these steps to add a new linked service for an Azure Blob Storage account:

1. Open the [Azure Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net/).
2. Select **Manage** from the left panel and select **Linked services** under the **External connections**.
3. Search **Azure Blob Storage** in the **New linked Service** panel on the right.
4. Select **Continue**.
5. Select the Azure Blob Storage Account to access and configure the linked service name. Suggest using **Account key** for the **Authentication method**.
6. Select **Test connection** to validate the settings are correct.
7. Select **Create** first and click **Publish all** to save your changes. 

You can access data on Azure Blob Storage with Synapse Spark via following URL:

<code>wasb[s]://<container_name>@<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<path></code>

Here is a code example:

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Azure storage access info
blob_account_name = 'Your account name' # replace with your blob name
blob_container_name = 'Your container name' # replace with your container name
blob_relative_path = 'Your path' # replace with your relative folder path
linked_service_name = 'Your linked service name' # replace with your linked service name

blob_sas_token = mssparkutils.credentials.getConnectionStringOrCreds(linked_service_name)

# Allow SPARK to access from Blob remotely

wasb_path = 'wasbs://%s@%s.blob.core.windows.net/%s' % (blob_container_name, blob_account_name, blob_relative_path)

spark.conf.set('fs.azure.sas.%s.%s.blob.core.windows.net' % (blob_container_name, blob_account_name), blob_sas_token)
print('Remote blob path: ' + wasb_path)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
val blob_account_name = "" // replace with your blob name
val blob_container_name = "" //replace with your container name
val blob_relative_path = "/" //replace with your relative folder path
val linked_service_name = "" //replace with your linked service name


val blob_sas_token = mssparkutils.credentials.getConnectionStringOrCreds(linked_service_name)

val wasbs_path = f"wasbs://$blob_container_name@$blob_account_name.blob.core.windows.net/$blob_relative_path"
spark.conf.set(f"fs.azure.sas.$blob_container_name.$blob_account_name.blob.core.windows.net",blob_sas_token)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
var blob_account_name = "";  // replace with your blob name
var blob_container_name = "";     // replace with your container name
var blob_relative_path = "";  // replace with your relative folder path
var linked_service_name = "";    // replace with your linked service name
var blob_sas_token = Credentials.GetConnectionStringOrCreds(linked_service_name);

spark.SparkContext.GetConf().Set($"fs.azure.sas.{blob_container_name}.{blob_account_name}.blob.core.windows.net", blob_sas_token);

var wasbs_path = $"wasbs://{blob_container_name}@{blob_account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/{blob_relative_path}";

Console.WriteLine(wasbs_path);

```

::: zone-end 
 
###  Configure access to Azure Key Vault

You can add an Azure Key Vault as a linked service to manage your credentials in Synapse. 
Follow these steps to add an Azure Key Vault as a Synapse linked service:
1. Open the [Azure Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net/).
2. Select **Manage** from the left panel and select **Linked services** under the **External connections**.
3. Search **Azure Key Vault** in the **New linked Service** panel on the right.
4. Select the Azure Key Vault Account to access and configure the linked service name.
5. Select **Test connection** to validate the settings are correct.
6. Select **Create** first and click **Publish all** to save your change. 

Synapse notebooks use Azure active directory(Azure AD) pass-through to access Azure Key Vault. Synapse pipelines use workspace identity(MSI) to access Azure Key Vault. To make sure your code work both in notebook and in Synapse pipeline, we recommend granting secret access permission for both your Azure AD account and workspace identity.

Follow these steps to grant secret access to your workspace identity:
1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and the Azure Key Vault you want to access. 
2. Select the **Access policies** from the left panel.
3. Select **Add Access Policy**: 
    - Choose **Key, Secret, & Certificate Management** as config template.
    - Select **your Azure AD account** and **your workspace identity** (same as your workspace name) in the select principal or make sure it is already assigned. 
4. Select **Select** and **Add**.
5. Select the **Save** button to commit changes.  

## File system utilities

`mssparkutils.fs` provides utilities for working with various file systems, including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) and Azure Blob Storage. Make sure you configure access to [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](#configure-access-to-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2) and [Azure Blob Storage](#configure-access-to-azure-blob-storage) appropriately.

## Notebook utilities 

You can use the MSSparkUtils Notebook Utilities to run a notebook or exit a notebook with a value. 
Run the following command to get an overview of the available methods:

```python
mssparkutils.notebook.help()
```

Get results:
```
The notebook module.

exit(value: String): void -> This method lets you exit a notebook with a value.
run(path: String, timeoutSeconds: int, arguments: Map): String -> This method runs a notebook and returns its exit value.

```

### Run a notebook
Runs a notebook and returns its exit value. You can run nesting function calls in a notebook interactively or in a pipeline. The notebook being referenced will run on the Spark pool of which notebook calls this function.  

```python

mssparkutils.notebook.run("notebook path", <timeoutSeconds>, <parameterMap>)

```

For example:

```python
mssparkutils.notebook.run("folder/Sample1", 90, {"input": 20 })
```

### Exit a notebook
Exits a notebook with a value. You can run nesting function calls in a notebook interactively or in a pipeline. 

- When you call an `exit()` function a notebook interactively, Azure Synapse will throw an exception, skip running subsequence cells, and keep Spark session alive.

- When you orchestrate a notebook that calls an `exit()` function in a Synapse pipeline, Azure Synapse will return an exit value, complete the pipeline run, and stop the Spark session.  

- When you call an `exit()` function in a notebook being referenced, Azure Synapse will stop the further execution in the notebook being referenced, and continue to run next cells in the notebook that call the `run()` function. For example: Notebook1 has three cells and calls an `exit()` function in the second cell. Notebook2 has five cells and calls `run(notebook1)` in the third cell. When you run Notebook2, Notebook1 will be stopped at the second cell when hitting the `exit()` function. Notebook2 will continue to run its fourth cell and fifth cell. 


```python
mssparkutils.notebook.exit("value string")
```

For example:

**Sample1** notebook locates under **folder/** with following two cells: 
- cell 1 defines an **input** parameter with default value set to 10.
- cell 2 exits the notebook with **input** as exit value. 

![Screenshot of a sample notebook](./media/microsoft-spark-utilities/spark-utilities-run-notebook-sample.png)

You can run the **Sample1** in another notebook with default values:

```python

exitVal = mssparkutils.notebook.run("folder/Sample1")
print (exitVal)

```
Results in:

```
Sample1 run success with input is 10
```

You can run the **Sample1** in another notebook and set the **input** value as 20:

```python
exitVal = mssparkutils.notebook.run("mssparkutils/folder/Sample1", 90, {"input": 20 })
print (exitVal)
```

Results in:

```
Sample1 run success with input is 20
```

Sample1 run success with input is 10
```


You can run the **Sample1** in another notebook and set the **input** value as 20:

```scala
val exitVal = mssparkutils.notebook.run("mssparkutils/folder/Sample1", 90, {"input": 20 })
print(exitVal)
```

Results in:

```
exitVal: String = Sample1 run success with input is 20
Sample1 run success with input is 20
```
