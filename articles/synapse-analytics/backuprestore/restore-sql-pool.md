2. Navigate to your Synapse workspace. 
3. Under Getting Started -> Open Synapse Studio, select **Open**.

4. On the left hand navigation pane, select **Data**.
5. Select **Manage pools**. 
6. Select **+ New** to create a new dedicated SQL pool. 
7. In the Additional Settings tab, select a Restore Point to restore from. 

    If you want to perform a geo-restore, select the workspace and dedicated SQL pool that you want to recover. 

8. Select either **Automatic Restore Points** or **User-Defined Restore Points**.

    If the dedicated SQL pool doesn't have any automatic restore points, wait a few hours or create a user defined restore point before restoring. For User-Defined Restore Points, select an existing one or create a new one.

    If you are restoring a geo-backup, simply select the workspace located in the source region and the dedicated SQL pool you want to restore. 

9. Select **Review + Create**.
