# Synapse RBAC Roles

The article describes the built-in Synapse RBAC roles, the permissions they grant, and the scopes at which they can be used.  

## What's changed since the preview?
For users familiar with the Synapse RBAC roles provided during the preview, the following changes apply:
- Workspace Admin is renamed **Synapse Administrator**
- Apache Spark Admin is renamed **Synapse Apache Spark Administrator** and has permission to see all published code artifacts, including SQL scripts.  This role no longer gives permission to use the workspace MSI, which requires the Synapse Credential User role.  This permission is required to run pipelines. 
- SQL Admin is renamed **Synapse SQL Administrator** and has permission to see all published code artifacts, including Spark notebooks and jobs.  This role no longer gives permission to use the workspace MSI, which requires the Synapse Credential User role. This permission is required to run pipelines.
- **New finer-grained Synapse RBAC roles** are introduced that focus on supporting development and operations personas rather than specific analytics runtimes.  
- **New lower-level scopes** are introduced for several roles.  These scopes allow roles to be restricted to specific resources or objects.

>[!Note]
>The **new Synapse RBAC roles and lower-level scopes are currently in preview**.  You are encouraged to use these new roles and scopes, which are fully supported, and to provide feedback on their use.

## Built-in Synapse RBAC roles and scopes

The following table describes the built-in roles and the scopes at which they can be used.

>[!Note]
> Users with any Synapse RBAC role at any scope automatically have the Synapse User role at workspace scope.

## Synapse RBAC roles and the actions they permit

>[!Note]
>- All actions listed in the tables below are prefixed, "Microsoft.Synapse/..."</br>
>- All artifact read, write, and delete actions are with respect to published artifacts in the live service.  These permissions do not affect access to artifacts in a connected Git repo.  

The following table lists the built-in roles and the actions/permissions that each supports.
