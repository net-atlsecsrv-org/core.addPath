# Understand the roles required to perform common tasks in Synapse

This article will help you understand which Synapse RBAC (role-based access control) or Azure RBAC roles you need to get work done in Synapse Studio.  

## Synapse Studio access control and workflow summary 

### Accessing Synapse Studio and viewing its content

- You can open Synapse Studio and view details of the workspace and list any of its Azure resources (SQL pools, Spark pools, or Integration runtimes) if you've been assigned any Synapse RBAC role or have the Azure Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the workspace.

### Resource management

- You can create SQL pools, Apache Spark pools, and Integration runtimes if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace.
- You can pause or scale a dedicated SQL pool, configure a Spark pool or an integration runtime if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace or that resource.

### Viewing and editing code artifacts

- With access to Synapse Studio, you can create new code artifacts, such as SQL scripts, notebooks, spark jobs, linked services, pipelines, dataflows, triggers, and credentials.  (These artifacts can be published or saved with additional permissions.)  
- If you're a Synapse Artifact User, Synapse Artifact Publisher, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator you can list, open, and edit already published code artifacts.

### Executing your code

- You can execute SQL scripts on SQL pools if you have the necessary SQL permissions defined in the SQL pools.  
- You can run notebooks and Spark jobs if you have Synapse Compute Operator permissions on the workspace or specific Apache Spark pools.  
- With Compute Operator permissions on the workspace or specific integration runtimes, and appropriate credential permissions you can execute pipelines.

### Monitoring and managing execution
- You can review the status of running notebooks and jobs in Apache Spark pools if you're a Synapse User.
- You can review logs and cancel running jobs and pipelines if you're a Synapse Compute Operator at the workspace or for a specific Spark pool or pipeline.  

### Publishing and saving your code

- You can publish new or updated code artifacts to the service if you're a Synapse Artifact Publisher, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator. 
- You can commit code artifacts to a working branch of a Git repository if the workspace is Git-enabled and you have Git permissions. With Git enabled, publishing is only allowed from the collaboration branch.
- If you close Synapse Studio without publishing or committing changes to code artifacts, then those changes will be lost.


## Tasks and required roles

The table below lists common tasks and for each task, the Synapse RBAC, or Azure RBAC roles required.  

>[!Note]
>- Synapse Administrator is not listed for each task unless it is the only role that provides the necessary permission.  A Synapse Administrator can perform all tasks enabled by other Synapse RBAC roles.</br>
>- The minimum Synapse RBAC role required is shown.
>- All Synapse RBAC roles at any scope provide you Synapse User permissions at the workspace
>- All Synapse RBAC permissions/actions shown in the table are prefixed Microsoft/Synapse/workspaces/... </br>
