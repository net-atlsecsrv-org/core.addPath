# Analyze data with a serverless SQL pool

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to analyze data with serverless SQL pool. 

## The Built-in serverless SQL pool

Serverless SQL pools let you use SQL without having to reserve capacity. Billing for a serverless SQL pool is based on the amount of data processed to run the query and not the number of nodes used to run the query.

Every workspace comes with a pre-configured serverless SQL pool called **Built-in**.
