# Azure security baseline for Synapse Analytics

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Synapse Analytics. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Synapse Analytics. **Controls** not applicable to Synapse Analytics have been excluded.

 
To see how Synapse Analytics completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Synapse Analytics security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure SQL Server to a virtual network via Private Link. Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network.

Alternatively, when connecting to your Synapse SQL pool, narrow down the scope of the outgoing connection to the SQL database by using a network security group. Disable all Azure service traffic to the SQL database via the public endpoint by setting Allow Azure Services to OFF. Ensure no public IP addresses are allowed in the firewall rules.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: When connecting to your dedicated SQL pool, and you have enabled network security group (NSG) flow logs, logs are sent into an Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Use Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for Azure Synapse SQL. ATP detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases and it can trigger various alerts, such as, "Potential SQL injection," and, "Access from unusual location." ATP is part of the Advanced data security (ADS) offering and can be accessed and managed via the central SQL ADS portal.

Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the Virtual Networks associated with Azure Synapse SQL for protection from distributed denial-of-service attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

When using a service endpoint for your dedicated SQL pool, outbound to Azure SQL database Public IP addresses is required: Network Security Groups (NSGs) must be opened to Azure SQL Database IPs to allow connectivity. You can do this by using NSG service tags for Azure SQL Database.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement network security configurations for resources related to your dedicated SQL pool with Azure Policy. You may use the "Microsoft.Sql" namespace to define custom policy definitions or use any of the built-in policy definitions designed for Azure SQL database/server network protection. An example of an applicable built-in network security policy for Azure SQL Database server would be: "SQL Server should use a virtual network service endpoint".

Use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Management templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for network security groups (NSG) and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: An auditing policy can be defined for a specific database or as a default server policy in Azure (which hosts Azure Synapse). A server policy applies to all existing and newly created databases on the server.

If server auditing is enabled, it always applies to the database. The database will be audited, regardless of the database auditing settings.

When you enable auditing, you can write them to an audit log in your Azure Storage Account, Log Analytics workspace, or Event Hubs.

Alternatively, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Users are authenticated with either Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or SQL Authentication.

When you first deploy Azure SQL, you specify an admin login and an associated password for that login. This administrative account is called Server admin. You can identify the administrator accounts for a database by opening the Azure portal and navigating to the properties tab of your server or managed instance. You can also configure an Azure AD admin account with full administrative permissions, this is required if you want to enable Azure AD authentication.

For management operations, use the Azure built-in roles which must be explicitly assigned. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad-hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups.

### 4.3: Monitor and block unauthorized transfer of sensitive information

**Guidance**: For any Azure SQL Database in your dedicated SQL pool storing or processing sensitive information, mark the database and related resources as sensitive using tags. Configure Private Link in conjunction with network security group (NSG) service tags on your Azure SQL Database instances to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive information.

Additionally, Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure Synapse detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure Synapse SQL against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. In Azure, the default setting for TDE is that the DEK is protected by a built-in server certificate. Alternatively, you can use customer-managed TDE, also referred to as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) support for TDE. In this scenario, the TDE Protector that encrypts the DEK is a customer-managed asymmetric key, which is stored in a customer-owned and managed Azure Key Vault (Azure's cloud-based external key management system) and never leaves the key vault.
