# Azure security baseline for Synapse Analytics

The Azure Security Baseline for Synapse Analytics contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure SQL Server to a virtual network via Private Link. Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network.

Alternatively, when connecting to your Synapse SQL pool, narrow down the scope of the outgoing connection to the SQL database by using a network security group. Disable all Azure service traffic to the SQL database via the public endpoint by setting Allow Azure Services to OFF. Ensure no public IP addresses are allowed in the firewall rules.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: When connecting to your Azure Synapse SQL pool, and you have enabled network security group (NSG) flow logs, send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Guidance**: Not applicable; this recommendation is intended for Azure Apps Service or compute resources hosting web applications.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

When using a service endpoint for your Azure Synapse SQL pool, outbound to Azure SQL database Public IP addresses is required: Network Security Groups (NSGs) must be opened to Azure SQL Database IPs to allow connectivity. You can do this by using NSG service tags for Azure SQL Database.

* [Understand service tags with service endpoints for Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-vnet-service-endpoint-rule-overview#limitations)

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure Synapse SQL against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. In Azure, the default setting for TDE is that the DEK is protected by a built-in server certificate. Alternatively, you can use customer-managed TDE, also referred to as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) support for TDE. In this scenario, the TDE Protector that encrypts the DEK is a customer-managed asymmetric key, which is stored in a customer-owned and managed Azure Key Vault (Azure's cloud-based external key management system) and never leaves the key vault.
