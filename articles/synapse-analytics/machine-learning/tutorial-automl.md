# Tutorial: Train a machine learning model without code

You can enrich your data in Spark tables with new machine learning models that you train by using [automated machine learning](../../machine-learning/concept-automated-ml.md). In Azure Synapse Analytics, you can select a Spark table in the workspace to use as a training dataset for building machine learning models, and you can do this in a code-free experience.

In this tutorial, you learn how to train machine learning models by using a code-free experience in Azure Synapse Analytics studio. You use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning, instead of coding the experience manually. The type of model you train depends on the problem you are trying to solve.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account before you begin](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure Synapse Analytics workspace](../get-started-create-workspace.md). Ensure that it has the following storage account, configured as the default storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. For the Data Lake Storage Gen2 file system that you work with, ensure that you're the **Storage Blob Data Contributor**.
- An Apache Spark pool in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. For details, see [Quickstart: Create a dedicated SQL pool by using Azure Synapse Analytics studio](../quickstart-create-sql-pool-studio.md).
- An Azure Machine Learning linked service in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. For details, see [Quickstart: Create a new Azure Machine Learning linked service in Azure Synapse Analytics](quickstart-integrate-azure-machine-learning.md).

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a Spark table for training dataset

For this tutorial, you need a Spark table. The following notebook creates one.

1. Download the notebook [Create-Spark-Table-NYCTaxi- Data.ipynb](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149229).

1. Import the notebook to Azure Synapse Analytics studio.

1. Select the Spark pool you want to use, and select **Run all**. This gets New York taxi data from the open dataset, and saves it to your default Spark database.

1. After the notebook run has completed, you see a new Spark table under the default Spark database. From **Data**, find the table named **nyc_taxi**.

## Launch automated machine learning wizard

Here's how:

1. Right-click the Spark table that you created in the previous step. To open the wizard, select **Machine Learning** > **Enrich with new model**.
![Screenshot of the Spark table, with Machine Learning and Enrich with new model highlighted.](media/tutorial-automl-wizard/tutorial-automl-wizard-00d.png)

1. You can then provide your configuration details for creating an automated machine learning experiment run in Azure Machine Learning. This run trains multiple models, and the best model from a successful run is registered in the Azure Machine Learning model registry.

   ![Screenshot of Enrich with new model configuration specifications.](media/tutorial-automl-wizard/tutorial-automl-wizard-configure-run-00a.png)

    - **Azure Machine Learning workspace**: An Azure Machine Learning workspace is required for creating an automated machine learning experiment run. You also need to link your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace with the Azure Machine Learning workspace by using a [linked service](quickstart-integrate-azure-machine-learning.md). After you have fulfilled all the prerequisites, you can specify the Azure Machine Learning workspace you want to use for this automated run.

    - **Experiment name**: Specify the experiment name. When you submit an automated machine learning run, you provide an experiment name. Information for the run is stored under that experiment in the Azure Machine Learning workspace. This experience creates a new experiment by default and generates a proposed name, but you can also provide a name of an existing experiment.

    - **Best model**: Specify the name of the best model from the automated run. TheÂ best model is given this name and saved in the Azure Machine Learning model registry automatically after this run. An automated machine learning run creates many machine learning models. Based on the primary metric that you select in a later step, those models can be compared and the best model can be selected.

    - **Target column**: This is what the model is trained to predict. Choose the column that you want to predict. (In this tutorial, we select the numeric column `fareAmount` as the target column.)

    - **Spark pool**: The Spark pool you want to use for the automated experiment run. The computations are run on the pool you specify.

    - **Spark configuration details**: In addition to the Spark pool, you also have the option to provide session configuration details.

1. Select **Continue**.

## Choose task type

Select the machine learning model type for the experiment, based on the question you're trying to answer. Because `fareAmount` is the target column, and it's a numeric value, select **Regression** here. Then select **Continue**.

## Additional configurations

If you select **Regression** or **Classification** as your model type in the previous section, the following configurations are available:

- **Primary metric**: The metric used to measure how well the model is doing. This is the metric used to compare different models created in the automated run, and determine which model performed best.

- **Training job time (hours)**: The maximum amount of time, in hours, for an experiment to run and train models. Note that you can also provide values less than 1 (for example `0.5`).

- **Max concurrent iterations**: Represents the maximum number of iterations run in parallel.

- **ONNX model compatibility**: If you enable this option, the models trained by automated machine learning are converted to the ONNX format. This is particularly relevant if you want to use the model for scoring in Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pools.

These settings all have a default value that you can customize.
![Screenshot of Enrich with new model additional configurations.](media/tutorial-automl-wizard/tutorial-automl-wizard-configure-run-00c.png)

After all the required configurations are done, you can start your automated run. You can choose **Create run**, which starts your run directly, without code. Alternatively, if you prefer code, you can select **Open in notebook**. This option allows you to see the code that creates the run and run the notebook.

>[!NOTE]
>If you select **Time series forecasting** as your model type in the previous section, you must make additional configurations. Forecasting also doesn't support ONNX model compatibility.

### Create run directly

To start your automated machine learning run directly, select **Start Run**. You see a notification that indicates the run is starting. Then you see another notification indicating success. You can also check the status in Azure Machine Learning by selecting the link in the notification.
![Screenshot of successful notification.](media/tutorial-automl-wizard/tutorial-automl-wizard-configure-run-00d.png)

### Create run with notebook

To generate a notebook, select **Open In Notebook**. Then select **Run all**. This also gives you an opportunity to add additional settings to your automated machine learning run.

![Screenshot of Notebook, with Run all highlighted.](media/tutorial-automl-wizard/tutorial-automl-wizard-configure-run-00e.png)

After you have successfully submitted the run, you see a link to the experiment run in the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the notebook output. Select the link to monitor your automated run in Azure Machine Learning.
