# Store query results to storage using serverless SQL pool (preview) in Azure Synapse Analytics

In this article, you'll learn how to store query results to storage using serverless SQL pool (preview).

## Prerequisites

Your first step is to **create a database** where you will execute the queries. Then initialize the objects by executing [setup script](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Synapse/blob/master/SQL/Samples/LdwSample/SampleDB.sql) on that database. This setup script will create the data sources, database scoped credentials, and external file formats that are used to read data in these samples.

Follow the instructions in this article to create data sources, database scoped credentials, and external file formats that are used to write data into the output storage.

## Create external table as select

You can use the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT (CETAS) statement to store the query results to  storage.

> [!NOTE]
> Change the first line in the query, i.e., [mydbname], so you're using the database you created.

```sql
USE [mydbname];
GO

CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL [SasTokenWrite]
WITH IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE',
     SECRET = 'sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-04-18T20:42:12Z&st=2019-04-18T12:42:12Z&spr=https&sig=lQHczNvrk1KoYLCpFdSsMANd0ef9BrIPBNJ3VYEIq78%3D';
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [MyDataSource] WITH (
    LOCATION = 'https://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/csv', CREDENTIAL = [SasTokenWrite]
);
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [ParquetFF] WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = PARQUET,
    DATA_COMPRESSION = 'org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec'
);
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[PopulationCETAS] WITH (
        LOCATION = 'populationParquet/',
        DATA_SOURCE = [MyDataSource],
        FILE_FORMAT = [ParquetFF]
) AS
SELECT
    *
FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'csv/population-unix/population.csv',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'sqlondemanddemo',
        FORMAT = 'CSV', PARSER_VERSION = '2.0'
    ) WITH (
        CountryCode varchar(4),
        CountryName varchar(64),
        Year int,
        PopulationCount int
    ) AS r;

```

## Use the external table

You can use the external table created through CETAS like a regular external table.

> [!NOTE]
> Change the first line in the query, i.e., [mydbname], so you're using the database you created.

```sql
USE [mydbname];
GO

SELECT
    country_name, population
FROM PopulationCETAS
WHERE
    [year] = 2019
ORDER BY
    [population] DESC;
```
