# Query CSV files

In this article, you'll learn how to query a single CSV file using SQL on-demand (preview) in Azure Synapse Analytics. CSV files may have different formats: 

- With and without a header row
- Comma and tab-delimited values
- Windows and Unix style line endings
- Non-quoted and quoted values, and escaping characters

All of the above variations will be covered below.

## Prerequisites

Before reading the rest of this article, review the following articles:

- [First-time setup](query-data-storage.md#first-time-setup)
- [Prerequisites](query-data-storage.md#prerequisites)

## Windows style new line

The following query shows how to read a CSV file without a header row, with a Windows-style new line, and comma-delimited columns.

File preview:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file without header, Windows style new line.](./media/query-single-csv-file/population.png)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population/population.csv',
         FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'
    )
WITH (
    [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [year] smallint,
    [population] bigint
) AS [r]
WHERE
    country_name = 'Luxembourg'
    AND year = 2017;
```

## Unix-style new line

The following query shows how to read a file without a header row, with a Unix-style new line, and comma-delimited columns. Note the different location of the file as compared to the other examples.

File preview:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file without header row and with Unix-Style new line.](./media/query-single-csv-file/population-unix.png)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population-unix/population.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0a'
    )
WITH (
    [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [year] smallint,
    [population] bigint
) AS [r]
WHERE
    country_name = 'Luxembourg'
    AND year = 2017;
```

## Header row

The following query shows how to a read file with a header row, with a Unix-style new line, and comma-delimited columns. Note the different location of the file as compared to the other examples.

File preview:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file with header row and with Unix-Style new line.](./media/query-single-csv-file/population-unix-hdr.png)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population-unix-hdr/population.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',',
        FIRSTROW = 2
    )
    WITH (
        [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [year] smallint,
        [population] bigint
    ) AS [r]
WHERE
    country_name = 'Luxembourg'
    AND year = 2017;
```

## Custom quote character

The following query shows how to read a file with a header row, with a Unix-style new line, comma-delimited columns, and quoted values. Note the different location of the file as compared to the other examples.

File preview:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file with header row and with Unix-Style new line and quoted values.](./media/query-single-csv-file/population-unix-hdr-quoted.png)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population-unix-hdr-quoted/population.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0a',
        FIRSTROW = 2,
        FIELDQUOTE = '"'
    )
    WITH (
        [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [year] smallint,
        [population] bigint
    ) AS [r]
WHERE
    country_name = 'Luxembourg'
    AND year = 2017;
```

> [!NOTE]
> This query would return the same results if you omitted the FIELDQUOTE parameter since the default value for FIELDQUOTE is a double-quote.

## Escaping characters

The following query shows how to read a file with a header row, with a Unix-style new line, comma-delimited columns, and an escape char used for the field delimiter (comma) within values. Note the different location of the file as compared to the other examples.

File preview:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file with header row and with Unix-Style new line and escape char used for field delimiter.](./media/query-single-csv-file/population-unix-hdr-escape.png)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population-unix-hdr-escape/population.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0a',
        FIRSTROW = 2,
        ESCAPECHAR = '\\'
    )
    WITH (
        [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [year] smallint,
        [population] bigint
    ) AS [r]
WHERE
    country_name = 'Slov,enia';
```

> [!NOTE]
> This query would fail if ESCAPECHAR is not specified since the comma in "Slov,enia" would be treated as field delimiter instead of part of the country name. "Slov,enia" would be treated as two columns. Therefore, the particular row would have one column more than the other rows, and one column more than you defined in the WITH clause.

## Tab-delimited files

The following query shows how to read a file with a header row, with a Unix-style new line, and tab-delimited columns. Note the different location of the file as compared to the other examples.

File preview:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file with header row and with Unix-Style new line and tab delimiter.](./media/query-single-csv-file/population-unix-hdr-tsv.png)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population-unix-hdr-tsv/population.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR ='\t',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0a',
        FIRSTROW = 2
    )
    WITH (
        [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
        [year] smallint,
        [population] bigint
    ) AS [r]
WHERE
    country_name = 'Luxembourg'
    AND year = 2017
```

## Returning subset of columns

So far, you've specified the CSV file schema using WITH and listing all columns. You can only specify columns you actually need in your query by using an ordinal number for each column needed. You'll also omit columns of no interest.

The following query returns the number of distinct country names in a file, specifying only the columns that are needed:

> [!NOTE]
> Take a look at the WITH clause in the query below and note that there is "2" (without quotes) at the end of row where you define the *[country_name]* column. It means that the *[country_name]* column is the second column in the file. The query will ignore all columns in the file except the second one.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS countries
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/population/population.csv',
         FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'
    )
WITH (
    --[country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 2
    --[year] smallint,
    --[population] bigint
) AS [r]
```
