# Using file metadata in queries

The SQL on-demand Query service can address multiple files and folders as described in the [Query folders and multiple files](query-folders-multiple-csv-files.md) article. In this article, you learn how to use metadata information about file and folder names in the queries.

Sometimes, you may need to know which file or folder source correlates to a specific row in the result set.

You can use function `filepath` and `filename` to return file names and/or the path in the result set. Or you can use them to filter data based on the file name and/or folder path. These functions are described in the syntax section [filename function](develop-storage-files-overview.md#filename-function) and [filepath function](develop-storage-files-overview.md#filepath-function). Below you will find short descriptions along samples.

## Prerequisites

Before reading the rest of this article, review the following prerequisites:

- [First-time setup](query-data-storage.md#first-time-setup)
- [Prerequisites](query-data-storage.md#prerequisites)

## Functions

### Filename

This function returns the file name that row originates from.

The following sample reads the NYC Yellow Taxi data files for the last three months of 2017 and returns the number of rides per file. The OPENROWSET part of the query specifies which files will be read.

```sql
SELECT
    r.filename() AS [filename]
    ,COUNT_BIG(*) AS [rows]
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/parquet/taxi/year=2017/month=9/*.parquet',
        FORMAT='PARQUET') AS [r]
GROUP BY
    r.filename()
ORDER BY
    [filename];
```

The following example shows how *filename()* can be used in the WHERE clause to filter the files to be read. It accesses the entire folder in the OPENROWSET part of the query and filters files in the WHERE clause.

Your results will be the same as the prior example.

```sql
SELECT
    r.filename() AS [filename]
    ,COUNT_BIG(*) AS [rows]
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/parquet/taxi/year=2017/month=9/*.parquet',
    FORMAT='PARQUET') AS [r]
WHERE
    r.filename() IN ('yellow_tripdata_2017-10.parquet', 'yellow_tripdata_2017-11.parquet', 'yellow_tripdata_2017-12.parquet')
GROUP BY
    r.filename()
ORDER BY
    [filename];
```

### Filepath

The filepath function returns a full or partial path:

- When called without a parameter, it returns the full file path that the row originates from.
- When called with a parameter, it returns part of the path that matches the wildcard on the position specified in the parameter. For example, parameter value 1 would return part of the path that matches the first wildcard.

The following sample reads NYC Yellow Taxi data files for the last three months of 2017. It returns the number of rides per file path. The OPENROWSET part of the query specifies which files will be read.

```sql
SELECT
    r.filepath() AS filepath
    ,COUNT_BIG(*) AS [rows]
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/taxi/yellow_tripdata_2017-1*.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIRSTROW = 2
    )
    WITH (
        vendor_id INT,
        pickup_datetime DATETIME2,
        dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
        passenger_count SMALLINT,
        trip_distance FLOAT,
        rate_code SMALLINT,
        store_and_fwd_flag SMALLINT,
        pickup_location_id INT,
        dropoff_location_id INT,
        payment_type SMALLINT,
        fare_amount FLOAT,
        extra FLOAT,
        mta_tax FLOAT,
        tip_amount FLOAT,
        tolls_amount FLOAT,
        improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
        total_amount FLOAT
    ) AS [r]
GROUP BY
    r.filepath()
ORDER BY
    filepath;
```

The following example shows how *filepath()* can be used in the WHERE clause to filter the files to be read.

You can use the wildcards in the OPENROWSET part of the query and filter the files in the WHERE clause. Your results will be the same as the prior example.

```sql
SELECT
    r.filepath() AS filepath
    ,r.filepath(1) AS [year]
    ,r.filepath(2) AS [month]
    ,COUNT_BIG(*) AS [rows]
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/taxi/yellow_tripdata_*-*.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIRSTROW = 2
    )
WITH (
    vendor_id INT,
    pickup_datetime DATETIME2,
    dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
    passenger_count SMALLINT,
    trip_distance FLOAT,
    rate_code SMALLINT,
    store_and_fwd_flag SMALLINT,
    pickup_location_id INT,
    dropoff_location_id INT,
    payment_type SMALLINT,
    fare_amount FLOAT,
    extra FLOAT,
    mta_tax FLOAT,
    tip_amount FLOAT,
    tolls_amount FLOAT,
    improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
    total_amount FLOAT
) AS [r]
WHERE
    r.filepath(1) IN ('2017')
    AND r.filepath(2) IN ('10', '11', '12')
GROUP BY
    r.filepath()
    ,r.filepath(1)
    ,r.filepath(2)
ORDER BY
    filepath;
```
