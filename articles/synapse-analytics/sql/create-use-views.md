# Create and use views using serverless SQL pool (preview) in Azure Synapse Analytics

In this section, you'll learn how to create and use views to wrap serverless SQL pool (preview) queries. Views will allow you to reuse those queries. Views are also needed if you want to use tools, such as Power BI, in conjunction with serverless SQL pool.

## Prerequisites

Your first step is to create a database where the view will be created and initialize the objects needed to authenticate on Azure storage by executing [setup script](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Synapse/blob/master/SQL/Samples/LdwSample/SampleDB.sql) on that database. All queries in this article will be executed on your sample database.

## Create a view

You can create views the same way you create regular SQL Server views. The following query creates view that reads *population.csv* file.

> [!NOTE]
> Change the first line in the query, i.e., [mydbname], so you're using the database you created.

```sql
USE [mydbname];
GO

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS populationView;
GO

CREATE VIEW populationView AS
SELECT * 
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'csv/population/population.csv',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'SqlOnDemandDemo',
        FORMAT = 'CSV', 
        FIELDTERMINATOR =',', 
        ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'
    )
WITH (
    [country_code] VARCHAR (5) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [country_name] VARCHAR (100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
    [year] smallint,
    [population] bigint
) AS [r];
```

The view in this example uses `OPENROWSET` function that uses absolute path to the underlying files. If you have `EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE` with a root URL of your storage, you can use `OPENROWSET` with `DATA_SOURCE` and relative file path:

```sql
CREATE VIEW TaxiView
AS SELECT *, nyc.filepath(1) AS [year], nyc.filepath(2) AS [month]
FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'parquet/taxi/year=*/month=*/*.parquet',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'sqlondemanddemo',
        FORMAT='PARQUET'
    ) AS nyc
```

## Use a view

You can use views in your queries the same way you use views in SQL Server queries.

The following query demonstrates using the *population_csv* view we created in [Create a view](#create-a-view). It returns country/region names with their population in 2019 in descending order.

> [!NOTE]
> Change the first line in the query, i.e., [mydbname], so you're using the database you created.

```sql
USE [mydbname];
GO

SELECT
    country_name, population
FROM populationView
WHERE
    [year] = 2019
ORDER BY
    [population] DESC;
```
