# Synapse Studio SQL scripts in Azure Synapse Analytics 

Synapse Studio provides a SQL script web interface for you to author SQL queries. 

## Begin authoring in SQL script 

There are several ways to start the authoring experience in SQL script. You can create a new SQL script through one of the following methods.

1. From the Develop menu, select the **"+"** icon and choose **SQL script**.

2. From the **Actions** menu, choose **New SQL script**.

3. Choose **Import** from the **Actions** menu under Develop SQL scripts. Select an existing SQL script from your local storage.

## Create your SQL script

1. Choose a name for your SQL script by selecting the **Property** button and replacing the default name assigned to the SQL script.

3. Start authoring your SQL script using the intellisense feature.

## Run your SQL script

Select the **Run** button to execute your SQL script. The results are displayed by default in a table.

You can also visualize the SQL script results in a chart by selecting the **Chart** button. Select the "Chart type" and **Category column**. You can export the chart into a picture by selecting **Save as image**.
