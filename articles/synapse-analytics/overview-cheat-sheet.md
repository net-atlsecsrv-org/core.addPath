# Azure Synapse Analytics cheat sheet

[!INCLUDE [preview](includes/note-preview.md)]

The Azure Synapse Analytics cheat sheet will guide you through the basic concepts of the service and important commands. This article is helpful for both new learners and those who want highlights of the essential Azure Synapse topics.

## Basics

A **Synapse workspace** is a securable collaboration boundary for doing cloud-based enterprise analytics in Azure. A workspace is deployed in a specific region and has an associated ADLS Gen2 account and file system (for storing temporary data). A workspace is under a resource group.

A workspace allows you to perform analytics with SQL and Apache spark. Resources available for SQL and Spark analytics are organized into SQL and Spark **pools**. 

## Synapse SQL

**Synapse SQL** is the ability to do T-SQL based analytics in Synapse workspace. Synapse SQL has two consumption models: dedicated and serverless.  For the dedicated model, use **dedicated SQL pools**. A workspace can have any number of these pools. To use the serverless model, use the **serverless SQL pools**. Every workspace has one of these pools.

## Apache Spark for Synapse

To use Spark analytics, create and use **serverless Apache Spark pools** in your Synapse workspace.

## SQL Terminology
| Term                         | Definition      |
|:---                                 |:---                 |
| **SQL Request**  |   Operation such as a query run through dedicated SQL pool or serverless SQL pool. |
|**SQL script**| Set of SQL commands saved in a file. A SQL script can contain one or more SQL statements. It can be used to run SQL requests through dedicated SQL pool or serverless SQL pool.|

## Spark Terminology
| Term                         | Definition      |
|:---                                 |:---                 |
|**Apache Spark for Synapse** | Spark run-time used in a serverless Spark pool. The current version supported is Spark 2.4 with Python 3.6.1, Scala 2.11.12, .NET support for Apache Spark 0.5 and Delta Lake 0.3.  | 
| **Apache Spark pool**  | 0-to-N Spark provisioned resources with their corresponding databases can be deployed in a workspace. A Spark pool can be auto-paused, resumed, and scaled.  |
| **Spark application**  |   It consists of a driver process and a set of executor processes. A Spark application runs on a serverless Spark pool.            |
| **Spark session**  |   Unified entry point of a spark application. It provides a way to interact with Spark's various functionalities and with a lesser number of constructs. To run a notebook, a session needs to be created. A session can be configured to run on a specific number of executors of a specific size. The default configuration for a notebook session is to run on 2 medium-sized executors. |
|**Notebook**| Interactive and reactive Data Science and Engineering interface supporting Scala, PySpark, C#, and SparkSQL. |
|**Spark job definition**|Interface to submit a Spark job by with assembly jar containing the code and its dependencies.|

## Pipelines Terminology
| Term                         | Definition      |
|:---                                 |:---                 |
|**Data Integration**| Gives the capability to ingest data between various sources and orchestrate activities running within a workspace or outside a workspace.| 
|**Data Flow**|  Provides a fully visual experience with no coding required to do big data transformation. All optimization and execution are handled in a serverless fashion. |
|**Pipeline**| Logical grouping of activities that perform a task together.|
|**Activity**| Defines actions to perform on data such as copying data, running a Notebook or a SQL script.|
|**Trigger**| Executes a pipeline. It can be run manually or automatically (schedule, tumbling window or event-based).|
|**Integration dataset**|  Named view of data that simply points or references the data to be used in an activity as input and output. It belongs to a Linked Service.|

## General Terminology
| Term                         | Definition      |
|:---                                 |:---                 |
|**Artifacts**| Concept that encapsulates all objects necessary for a user to manage data sources, develop, orchestrate, and visualize.|
|**Linked service**| Connection strings that define the connection information needed for the workspace to connect to external resources.|
