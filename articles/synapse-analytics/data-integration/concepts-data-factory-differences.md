# Data integration in Azure Synapse Analytics versus Azure Data Factory

In Azure Synapse Analytics, the data integration capabilities such as Synapse pipelines and data flows are based upon those of Azure Data Factory. For more information, see [what is Azure Data Factory](../../data-factory/introduction.md).


## Available features in ADF & Azure Synapse Analytics

Check below table for features availability:

| Category                 | Feature    |  Azure Data Factory  | Azure Synapse Analytics |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | :------------------: | :---------------------: |
| **Integration Runtime**  | Using SSIS and SSIS Integration Runtime | ✓ | ✗ |
|                          | Support for Cross-region Integration Runtime (Data Flows) | ✓ | ✗ |
|                          | Integration Runtime Sharing | ✓<br><small>*Can be shared across different data factories* | ✗ |
|                          | Time to Live | ✓ | ✗ |
| **Pipelines Activities** | SSIS Package Activity | ✓ | ✗ |
|                          | Support for Power Query Activity | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Template Gallery and Knowledge Center** | Solution Templates | ✓<br><small>*Azure Data Factory Template Gallery* | ✓<br><small>*Synapse Workspace Knowledge Center* |
| **GIT Repository Integration** | GIT Integration | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Monitoring**           | Monitoring of Spark Jobs for Data Flow | ✗ | ✓<br><small>*Leverage the Synapse Spark pools* |
|                          | Integration with Azure Monitor | ✓ | ✗ |

> [!Note]
> **Time to Live** is an Azure Integration Runtime setting that enables the Spark cluster to *stay warm* for a period of time after an execution of data flow.
