# Quickstart: Create a Synapse SQL pool (preview) using Synapse Studio

Azure Synapse Analytics offers various analytics engines to help you ingest, transform, model, and analyze your data. A SQL pool offers T-SQL based compute and storage capabilities. After creating a SQL pool in your Synapse workspace, data can be loaded, modeled, processed, and delivered for faster analytic insight.

This quickstart describes the steps to create a SQL pool in a Synapse workspace using Synapse Studio.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account before you begin](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).


## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Synapse workspace](quickstart-create-workspace.md)

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

## Navigate to the Synapse workspace

1. Navigate to the Synapse workspace where the SQL pool will be created by typing the service name (or resource name directly) into the search bar.

1. From the list of workspaces, type the name (or part of the name) of the workspace to open. For this example, we'll use a workspace named **contosoanalytics**.

## Launch Synapse Studio

1. From the workspace overview, select **Launch Synapse Studio** to open the location where the SQL pool will be created. Type the service name or resource name directly into the search bar.

## Create a SQL pool in Synapse Studio

1. On the Synapse Studio home page, navigate to the **Management Hub** in the left navigation by selecting the **Manage** icon.
![Synapse Studio home page with Management Hub section highlighted.](media/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool/create-spark-pool-studio-21.png)

1. Once in the Management Hub, navigate to the **SQL pools** section to see the current list of SQL pools that are available in the workspace.
![Synapse Studio management hub with SQL pools navigation selected](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-22.png)

1. Select **+ New** command and the new SQL pool create wizard will appear.

1. Enter the following details in the **Basics** tab:

    | Setting | Suggested value | Descriptionâ€¯|
    | :------ | :-------------- | :---------- |
    | **SQL pool name** | contosoedw | This is the name that the SQL pool will have. |
    | **Performance level** | DW100c | Set this to the smallest size to reduce costs for this quickstart |

    ![SQL pools create flow - basics tab.](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-24.png)
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Note that there are specific limitations for the names that SQL pools can use. Names can't contain special characters, must be 15 or less characters, not contain reserved words, and be unique in the workspace.

4. In the next tab, **Additional settings**, select **none** to provision the SQL pool without data. Leave the default collation as selected.
![SQL pool create flow - additional settings tab.](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-25.png)

1. We won't add any tags for now, so select **Next: Review + create**.

1. In the **Review + create** tab, make sure that the details look correct based on what was previously entered, and press **create**. 
![SQL pool create flow - review settings tab.](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-26.png)

1. At this point, the resource provisioning flow will start.

1. After the provisioning completes, navigating back to the workspace will show a new entry for the newly created SQL pool.
 ![SQL pool create flow - resource provisioning.](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-27.png)

1. Once the SQL pool is created, it will be available in the workspace for loading data, processing streams, reading from the lake, etc.

## Clean up SQL pools using Synapse Studio    

Follow the steps below to delete the SQL pool from the workspace using Synapse Studio.
> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a SQL pool will remove the analytics engine from the workspace. It will no longer be possible to connect to the pool, and all queries, pipelines, scripts that use this SQL pool will no longer work.

If you want to delete the SQL pool, do the following:

1. Navigate to the SQL pools in the Management Hub in Synapse Studio.
1. Select the ellipsis in the SQL pool to be deleted (in this case, **contosoedw**) to show the commands for the SQL pool:
![Listing of SQL pools, with the recently created pool selected.](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-28.png)
1. Press **delete**.
1. Confirm the deletion, and press **Delete** button.
 ![Confirmation dialog to delete the selected SQL pool.](media/quickstart-create-sql-pool/create-sql-pool-studio-29.png)
1. When the process completes successfully, the SQL pool will no longer be listed in the workspace resources.
