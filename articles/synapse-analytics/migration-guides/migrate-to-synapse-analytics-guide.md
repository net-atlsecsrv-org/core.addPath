# Migrate a data warehouse to a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics

The following sections provide an overview of what's involved with migrating an existing data warehouse solution to an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool.

## Overview

Before you begin your migration, you should verify that Azure Synapse Analytics is the best solution for your workload. Azure Synapse Analytics is a distributed system designed to perform analytics on large data. Migrating to Azure Synapse Analytics requires some design changes that aren't difficult to understand but that might take some time to implement. If your business requires an enterprise-class data warehouse, the benefits are worth the effort. However, if you don't need the power of Azure Synapse Analytics, it's more cost-effective to use [SQL Server](/sql/sql-server/) or [Azure SQL Database](../../azure-sql/index.yml).

Consider using Azure Synapse Analytics when you:

- Have one or more terabytes of data.
- Plan to run analytics on substantial amounts of data.
- Need the ability to scale compute and storage.
- Want to save on costs by pausing compute resources when you don't need them.

Rather than Azure Synapse Analytics, consider other options for operational (OLTP) workloads that have:

- High frequency reads and writes.
- Large numbers of singleton selects.
- High volumes of single row inserts.
- Row-by-row processing needs.
- Incompatible formats (for example, JSON and XML).

## Azure Synapse Pathway

One of the critical blockers customers face is translating their database objects when they migrate from one system to another. [Azure Synapse Pathway](/sql/tools/synapse-pathway/azure-synapse-pathway-overview) helps you upgrade to a modern data warehouse platform by automating the object translation of your existing data warehouse. It's a free, intuitive, and easy-to-use tool that automates the code translation to enable a quicker migration to Azure Synapse Analytics.

- Have a [dedicated SQL pool](../get-started-create-workspace.md) in an Azure Synapse workspace.

# [Migrate from Oracle](#tab/migratefromOracle)

To migrate your Oracle data warehouse to Azure Synapse Analytics, make sure you've met the following prerequisites:

- Have a data warehouse or analytics workload.
- Download SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle to convert Oracle objects to SQL Server. For more information, see [Migrating Oracle Databases to SQL Server (OracleToSQL)](/sql/ssma/oracle/migrating-oracle-databases-to-sql-server-oracletosql).
- Download the latest version of [Azure Synapse Pathway](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=102787) to migrate SQL Server objects to Azure Synapse objects.
- Have a [dedicated SQL pool](../get-started-create-workspace.md) in an Azure Synapse workspace.

## Pre-migration

After you decide to migrate an existing solution to Azure Synapse Analytics, you need to plan your migration before you get started. A primary goal of planning is to ensure that your data, table schemas, and code are compatible with Azure Synapse Analytics. There are some compatibility differences between your current system and Azure Synapse Analytics that you'll need to work around. In addition, migrating large amounts of data to Azure takes time. Careful planning will speed up the process of getting your data to Azure.

Another key goal of planning is to adjust your design to ensure that your solution takes full advantage of the high query performance that Azure Synapse Analytics is designed to provide. Designing data warehouses for scale introduces unique design patterns, so traditional approaches aren't always the best. While some design adjustments can be made after migration, making changes earlier in the process will save you time later.

## Migrate

Performing a successful migration requires you to migrate your table schemas, code, and data. For more detailed guidance on these topics, see the following articles:

- [Consider table design](../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-overview.md)
- [Consider code change](../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-develop.md#development-recommendations-and-coding-techniques)
- [Migrate your data](../sql-data-warehouse/design-elt-data-loading.md)
- [Consider workload management](../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-workload-management.md)

## More resources

The Customer Advisory Team has some great Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse) guidance published as blog posts.

It offers simple, one-click calculation and report generation that helps to accelerate large estate assessments by providing an automated and uniform target platform decision process. |
| [Handling data encoding issues while loading data to Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/handling-data-encoding-issues-while-loading-data-to-sql-data-warehouse/) | This blog post provides insight on some of the data encoding issues you might encounter while using PolyBase to load data to SQL Data Warehouse. This article also provides some options that you can use to overcome such issues and load the data successfully. |
| [Getting table sizes in Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool](https://github.com/Microsoft/DataMigrationTeam/blob/master/Whitepapers/Getting%20table%20sizes%20in%20SQL%20DW.pdf) | One of the key tasks that an architect must perform is to get metrics about a new environment post-migration. Examples include collecting load times from on-premises to the cloud and collecting PolyBase load times. One of the most important tasks is to determine the storage size in SQL Data Warehouse compared to the customer's current platform. |
| [Utility to move on-premises SQL Server logins to Azure Synapse Analytics](https://github.com/Microsoft/DataMigrationTeam/tree/master/IP%20and%20Scripts/MoveLogins) | A PowerShell script creates a T-SQL command script to re-create logins and select database users from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to an Azure SQL platform as a service (PaaS) service. The tool allows the automatic mapping of Windows Server Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory accounts, or it can do UPN lookups for each login against on-premises Windows Server Active Directory. The tool optionally moves SQL Server native logins too. Custom server and database roles are scripted, along with role membership, database role, and user permissions. Contained databases aren't supported, and only a subset of possible SQL Server permissions are scripted. More information is available in the support document, and the script has comments for ease of understanding. |
