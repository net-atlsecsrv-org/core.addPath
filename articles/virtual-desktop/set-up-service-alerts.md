# Tutorial: Set up service alerts

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/set-up-service-alerts-2019.md).

You can use Azure Service Health to monitor service issues and health advisories for Windows Virtual Desktop. Azure Service Health can notify you with different types of alerts (for example, email or SMS), help you understand the effect of an issue, and keep you updated as the issue resolves. Azure Service Health can also help you mitigate downtime and prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.

To learn more about Azure Service Health, see the [Azure Health Documentation](../service-health/index.yml).

## Create service alerts

This section shows you how to configure Azure Service Health and how to set up notifications, which you can access on the Azure portal. You can set up different types of alerts and schedule them to notify you in a timely manner.

### Recommended service alerts

We recommend you create service alerts for the following health event types:

- **Service issue:** Receive notifications on major issues that impact connectivity of your users with the service or with the ability to manage your Windows Virtual Desktop tenant.
- **Health advisory:** Receive notifications that require your attention. The following are some examples of this type of notification:
    - Virtual Machines (VMs) not securely configured as open port 3389
    - Deprecation of functionality

### Configure service alerts

To configure service alerts:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Service Health.**
3. Follow the instructions in [Create activity log alerts on service notifications](../service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fservice-health%2ftoc.json) to set up your alerts and notifications.
