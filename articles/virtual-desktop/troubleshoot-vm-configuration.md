## VMs are not joined to the domain

Follow these instructions if you're having issues joining virtual machines (VMs) to the domain.

- Join the VM manually using the process in [Join a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domain](../active-directory-domain-services/join-windows-vm.md) or using the [domain join template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/201-vm-domain-join-existing/).
- Try pinging the domain name from a command line on the VM.
- Review the list of domain join error messages in [Troubleshooting Domain Join Error Messages](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1935.troubleshooting-domain-join-error-messages.aspx).

### Error: Incorrect credentials

**Cause:** There was a typo made when the credentials were entered in the Azure Resource Manager template interface fixes.

**Fix:** Take one of the following actions to resolve.

- Manually add the VMs to a domain.
- Redeploy the template once credentials have been confirmed. See [Create a host pool with PowerShell](create-host-pools-powershell.md).
- Join VMs to a domain using a template with [Joins an existing Windows VM to AD Domain](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/201-vm-domain-join-existing/).

### Error: Timeout waiting for user input

**Cause:** The account used to complete the domain join may have multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**Fix:** Take one of the following actions to resolve.

- Temporarily remove MFA for the account.
- Use a service account.

### Error: The account used during provisioning doesn't have permissions to complete the operation

**Cause:** The account being used doesn't have permissions to join VMs to the domain due to compliance and regulations.

**Fix:** Take one of the following actions to resolve.

- Use an account that is a member of the Administrator group.
- Grant the necessary permissions to the account being used.

### Error: Domain name doesn't resolve

**Cause 1:** VMs are on a virtual network that's not associated with the virtual network (VNET) where the domain is located.

**Fix 1:** Create VNET peering between the VNET where VMs were provisioned and the VNET where the domain controller (DC) is running. See [Create a virtual network peering - Resource Manager, different subscriptions](../virtual-network/create-peering-different-subscriptions.md).

**Cause 2:** When using Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS), the virtual network doesn't have its DNS server settings updated to point to the managed domain controllers.

**Fix 2:** To update the DNS settings for the virtual network containing Azure AD DS, see [Update DNS settings for the Azure virtual network](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance.md#update-dns-settings-for-the-azure-virtual-network).

**Cause 3:** The network interface's DNS server settings do not point to the appropriate DNS server on the virtual network.

**Fix 3:** Take one of the following actions to resolve, following the steps in [Change DNS servers].
- Change the network interface's DNS server settings to **Custom** with the steps from [Change DNS servers](../virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface.md#change-dns-servers) and specify the private IP addresses of the DNS servers on the virtual network.
- Change the network interface's DNS server settings to **Inherit from virtual network** with the steps from [Change DNS servers](../virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface.md#change-dns-servers), then change the virtual network's DNS server settings with the steps from [Change DNS servers](../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md#change-dns-servers).

## Windows Virtual Desktop Agent and Windows Virtual Desktop Boot Loader are not installed

The recommended way to provision VMs is using the Azure portal creation template. The template automatically installs the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent and Windows Virtual Desktop Agent Boot Loader.

Follow these instructions to confirm the components are installed and to check for error messages.

1. Confirm that the two components are installed by checking in **Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Programs and Features**. If **Windows Virtual Desktop Agent** and **Windows Virtual Desktop Agent Boot Loader** are not visible, they aren't installed on the VM.
2. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to **C:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log**. If the file is missing, it indicates that the PowerShell DSC that installed the two components was not able to run in the security context provided.
3. If the file **C:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log** is present, open it and check for error messages.

### Error: Windows Virtual Desktop Agent and Windows Virtual Desktop Agent Boot Loader are missing. C:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log is also missing

**Cause 1:** Credentials provided during input for the Azure Resource Manager template were incorrect or permissions were insufficient.

**Fix 1:** Manually add the missing components to the VMs using [Create a host pool with PowerShell](create-host-pools-powershell.md).

**Cause 2:** PowerShell DSC was able to start and execute but failed to complete as it can't sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop and obtain needed information.

**Fix 2:** Confirm the items in the following list.

- Make sure the account doesn't have MFA.
- Confirm the host pool's name is accurate and the host pool exists in Windows Virtual Desktop.
- Confirm the account has at least Contributor permissions on the Azure subscription or resource group.

### Error: Authentication failed, error in C:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log

**Cause:** PowerShell DSC was able to execute but couldn't connect to Windows Virtual Desktop.

**Fix:** Confirm the items in the following list.

- Manually register the VMs with the Windows Virtual Desktop service.
- Confirm account used for connecting to Windows Virtual Desktop has permissions on the Azure subscription or resource group to create host pools.
- Confirm account doesn't have MFA.

## Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is not registering with the Windows Virtual Desktop service

When the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is first installed on session host VMs (either manually or through the Azure Resource Manager template and PowerShell DSC), it provides a registration token. The following section covers troubleshooting issues that apply to the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent and the token.

### Error: The status filed in Get-AzWvdSessionHost cmdlet shows status as Unavailable

![Get-AzWvdSessionHost cmdlet shows status as Unavailable.](media/23b8e5f525bb4e24494ab7f159fa6b62.png)

**Cause:** The agent isn't able to update itself to a new version.

**Fix:** Follow these instructions to manually update the agent.

1. Download a new version of the agent on the session host VM.
2. Launch Task Manager and, in the Service Tab, stop the RDAgentBootLoader service.
3. Run the installer for the new version of the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent.
4. When prompted for the registration token, remove the entry INVALID_TOKEN and press next (a new token isn't required).
5. Complete the installation Wizard.
6. Open Task Manager and start the RDAgentBootLoader service.

## Error: Windows Virtual Desktop Agent registry entry IsRegistered shows a value of 0

**Cause:** Registration token has expired or has been generated with expiration value of 999999.

**Fix:** Follow these instructions to fix the agent registry error.

1. If there's already a registration token, remove it with Remove-AzWvdRegistrationInfo. 
2. Run the **New-AzWvdRegistrationInfo** cmdlet to generate a new token. 
3. Confirm that the *-ExpriationTime* parameter is set to 3 days.

### Error: Windows Virtual Desktop agent isn't reporting a heartbeat when running Get-AzWvdSessionHost

**Cause 1:** RDAgentBootLoader service has been stopped.

**Fix 1:** Launch Task Manager and, if the Service Tab reports a stopped status for RDAgentBootLoader service, start the service.

**Cause 2:** Port 443 may be closed.

**Fix 2:** Follow these instructions to open port 443.

1. Confirm port 443 is open by downloading the PSPing tool from [Sysinternal tools](/sysinternals/downloads/psping/).
2. Install PSPing on the session host VM where the agent is running.
3. Open the command prompt as an administrator and issue the command below:

    ```cmd
    psping rdbroker.wvdselfhost.microsoft.com:443
    ```

4. Confirm that PSPing received information back from the RDBroker:

## Troubleshooting issues with the Windows Virtual Desktop side-by-side stack

The Windows Virtual Desktop side-by-side stack is automatically installed with Windows Server 2019. Use Microsoft Installer (MSI) to install the side-by-side stack on Microsoft Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2. For Microsoft Windows 10, the Windows Virtual Desktop side-by-side stack is enabled with **enablesxstackrs.ps1**.

There are three main ways the side-by-side stack gets installed or enabled on session host pool VMs:

- With the Azure portal creation template
- By being included and enabled on the master image
- Installed or enabled manually on each VM (or with extensions/PowerShell)

If you're having issues with the Windows Virtual Desktop side-by-side stack, type the **qwinsta** command from the command prompt to confirm that the side-by-side stack is installed or enabled.

The output of **qwinsta** will list **rdp-sxs** in the output if the side-by-side stack is installed and enabled.

![Side-by-side stack installed or enabled with qwinsta listed as rdp-sxs in the output.](media/23b8e5f525bb4e24494ab7f159fa6b62.png)

Examine the registry entries listed below and confirm that their values match. If registry keys are missing or values are mismatched, follow the instructions in [Create a host pool with PowerShell](create-host-pools-powershell.md) on how to reinstall the side-by-side stack.

```registry
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal
    Server\WinStations\rds-sxs\"fEnableWinstation":DWORD=1

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal
    Server\ClusterSettings\"SessionDirectoryListener":rdp-sxs
```

### Error: O_REVERSE_CONNECT_STACK_FAILURE

![O_REVERSE_CONNECT_STACK_FAILURE error code.](media/23b8e5f525bb4e24494ab7f159fa6b62.png)

**Cause:** The side-by-side stack isn't installed on the session host VM.

**Fix:** Follow these instructions to install the side-by-side stack on the session host VM.

1. Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to get directly into the session host VM as local administrator.
2. Install the side-by-side stack using [Create a host pool with PowerShell](create-host-pools-powershell.md).

## How to fix a Windows Virtual Desktop side-by-side stack that malfunctions

There are known circumstances that can cause the side-by-side stack to malfunction:

- Not following the correct order of the steps to enable the side-by-side stack
- Auto update to Windows 10 Enhanced Versatile Disc (EVD)
- Missing the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) role
- Running enablesxsstackrc.ps1 multiple times
- Running enablesxsstackrc.ps1 in an account that doesn't have local admin privileges

The instructions in this section can help you uninstall the Windows Virtual Desktop side-by-side stack. Once you uninstall the side-by-side stack, go to "Register the VM with the Windows Virtual Desktop host pool" in [Create a host pool with PowerShell](create-host-pools-powershell.md) to reinstall the side-by-side stack.

The VM used to run remediation must be on the same subnet and domain as the VM with the malfunctioning side-by-side stack.

Follow these instructions to run remediation from the same subnet and domain:

1. Connect with standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to the VM from where fix will be applied.
2. Download PsExec from https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/psexec.
3. Unzip the downloaded file.
4. Start command prompt as local administrator.
5. Navigate to folder where PsExec was unzipped.
6. From command prompt, use the following command:

    ```cmd
            psexec.exe \\<VMname> cmd
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >VMname is the machine name of the VM with the malfunctioning side-by-side stack.

7. Accept the PsExec License Agreement by clicking Agree.

    ![Software license agreement screenshot.](media/SoftwareLicenseTerms.png)

    >[!Note]
    >This dialog will show up only the first time PsExec is run.

8. After the command prompt session opens on the VM with the malfunctioning side-by-side stack, run qwinsta and confirm that an entry named rdp-sxs is available. If not, a side-by-side stack isn't present on the VM so the issue isn't tied to the side-by-side stack.

    ![Administrator command prompt](media/AdministratorCommandPrompt.png)

9. Run the following command, which will list Microsoft components installed on the VM with the malfunctioning side-by-side stack.

    ```cmd
        wmic product get name
    ```

10. Run the command below with product names from step above.

    ```cmd
        wmic product where name="<Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Agent>" call uninstall
    ```

11. Uninstall all products that start with "Remote Desktop."

12. After all Windows Virtual Desktop components have been uninstalled, follow the instructions for your operating system:

13. If your operating system is Windows Server, restart the VM that had the malfunctioning side-by-side stack (either with Azure portal or from the PsExec tool).

If your operating system is Microsoft Windows 10, continue with the instructions below:

14. From the VM running PsExec, open File Explorer and copy disablesxsstackrc.ps1 to the system drive of the VM with the malfunctioned side-by-side stack.

    ```cmd
        \\<VMname>\c$\
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >VMname is the machine name of the VM with the malfunctioning side-by-side stack.

15. The recommended process: from the PsExec tool, start PowerShell and navigate to the folder from the previous step and run disablesxsstackrc.ps1. Alternatively, you can run the following cmdlets:

    ```PowerShell
    Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\ClusterSettings" -Name "SessionDirectoryListener" -Force
    Remove-Item -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\rdp-sxs" -Recurse -Force
    Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations" -Name "ReverseConnectionListener" -Force
    ```

16. When the cmdlets are done running, restart the VM with the malfunctioning side-by-side stack.

## Remote Desktop licensing mode isn't configured

If you sign in to Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session using an administrative account, you might receive a notification that says, "Remote Desktop licensing mode is not configured, Remote Desktop Services will stop working in X days. On the Connection Broker server, use Server Manager to specify the Remote Desktop licensing mode."

If the time limit expires, an error message will appear that says, "The remote session was disconnected because there are no Remote Desktop client access licenses available for this computer."

If you see either of these messages, this means the image doesn't have the latest Windows updates installed or that you are setting the Remote Desktop licensing mode through group policy. Follow the steps in the next sections to check the group policy setting, identify the version of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, and install the corresponding update.  

>[!NOTE]
>Windows Virtual Desktop only requires an RDS client access license (CAL) when your host pool contains Windows Server session hosts. To learn how to configure an RDS CAL, see [License your RDS deployment with client access licenses](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-client-access-license/).

### Disable the Remote Desktop licensing mode group policy setting

Check the group policy setting by opening the Group Policy Editor in the VM and navigating to **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Licensing** > **Set the Remote Desktop licensing mode**. If the group policy setting is **Enabled**, change it to **Disabled**. If it's already disabled, then leave it as-is.

>[!NOTE]
>If you set group policy through your domain, disable this setting on policies that target these Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session VMs.

### Identify which version of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session you're using

To check which version of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session you have:

1. Sign in with your admin account.
2. Enter "About" into the search bar next to the Start menu.
3. Select **About your PC**.
4. Check the number next to "Version." The number should be either "1809" or "1903," as shown in the following image.

    ![A screenshot of the Windows specifications window. The version number is highlighted in blue.](media/windows-specifications.png)

Now that you know your version number, skip ahead to the relevant section.

### Version 1809

If your version number says "1809," install [the KB4516077 update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4516077).

### Version 1903

Redeploy the host operating system with the latest version of the Windows 10, version 1903 image from the Azure Gallery.
