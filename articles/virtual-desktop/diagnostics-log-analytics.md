# Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to the Spring 2020 update with Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using the Windows Virtual Desktop Fall 2019 release without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/diagnostics-log-analytics-2019.md).
>
> The Windows Virtual Desktop Spring 2020 update is currently in public preview. This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and we don't recommend using it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Windows Virtual Desktop uses [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md) for monitoring and alerts like many other Azure services. This lets admins identify issues through a single interface. The service creates activity logs for both user and administrative actions. Each activity log falls under the following categories:  

- Management Activities:
    - Track whether attempts to change Windows Virtual Desktop objects using APIs or PowerShell are successful. For example, can someone successfully create a host pool using PowerShell?
- Feed: 
    - Can users successfully subscribe to workspaces? 
    - Do users see all resources published in the Remote Desktop client?
- Connections: 
    - When users initiate and complete connections to the service. 
- Host registration: 
    - Was the session host successfully registered with the service upon connecting?
- Errors: 
    - Are users encountering any issues with specific activities? This feature can generate a table that tracks activity data for you as long as the information is joined with the activities.
- Checkpoints:  
    - Specific steps in the lifetime of an activity that were reached. For example, during a session, a user was load balanced to a particular host, then the user was signed on during a connection, and so on.

Connections that don't reach Windows Virtual Desktop won't show up in diagnostics results because the diagnostics role service itself is part of Windows Virtual Desktop. Windows Virtual Desktop connection issues can happen when the user is experiencing network connectivity issues.

Azure Monitor lets you analyze Windows Virtual Desktop data and review virtual machine (VM) performance counters, all within the same tool. This article will tell you more about how to enable diagnostics for your Windows Virtual Desktop environment. 

>[!NOTE] 
>To learn how to monitor your VMs in Azure, see [Monitoring Azure virtual machines with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/insights/monitor-vm-azure.md). Also, make sure to [review the performance counter thresholds](../virtual-desktop/virtual-desktop-fall-2019/deploy-diagnostics.md#windows-performance-counter-thresholds) for a better understanding of your user experience on the session host.

## Before you get started

Before you can use Log Analytics, you'll need to create a workspace. To do that, follow the instructions in one of the following two articles:

- If you prefer using Azure portal, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace in Azure portal](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md).
- If you prefer PowerShell, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace with PowerShell](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace-posh.md).

After you've created your workspace, follow the instructions in [Connect Windows computers to Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md#obtain-workspace-id-and-key) to get the following information:

- The workspace ID
- The primary key of your workspace

You'll need this information later in the setup process.

Make sure to review permission management for Azure Monitor to enable data access for those who monitor and maintain your Windows Virtual Desktop environment. For more information, see [Get started with roles, permissions, and security with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/roles-permissions-security.md). 

## Push diagnostics data to your workspace

You can push diagnostics data from your Windows Virtual Desktop objects into the Log Analytics for your workspace. You can set up this feature right away when you first create your objects.

To set up Log Analytics for a new object:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Windows Virtual Desktop**. 

2. Navigate to the object (such as a host pool, app group, or workspace) that you want to capture logs and events for. 

3. Select **Diagnostic settings** in the menu on the left side of the screen. 

4. Select **Add diagnostic setting** in the menu that appears on the right side of the screen. 
   
    The options shown in the Diagnostic Settings page will vary depending on what kind of object you're editing.

    For example, when you're enabling diagnostics for an app group, you'll see options to configure checkpoints, errors, and management. For workspaces, these categories configure a feed to track when users subscribe to the list of apps. To learn more about diagnostic settings see [Create diagnostic setting to collect resource logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md). 

     >[!IMPORTANT] 
     >Remember to enable diagnostics for each Azure Resource Manager object that you want to monitor. Data will be available for activities after diagnostics has been enabled. It might take a few hours after first set-up.  

5. Enter a name for your settings configuration, then select **Send to Log Analytics**. The name you use shouldn't have spaces and should conform to [Azure naming conventions](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md). As part of the logs, you can select all the options that you want added to your Log Analytics, such as Checkpoint, Error, Management, and so on.

6. Select **Save**.

>[!NOTE]
>Log Analytics gives you the option to stream data to [Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md) or archive it in a storage account. To learn more about this feature, see [Stream Azure monitoring data to an event hub](../azure-monitor/platform/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs.md) and [Archive Azure resource logs to storage account](../azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-collect-storage.md). 

## How to access Log Analytics

You can access Log Analytics workspaces on the Azure portal or Azure Monitor.

### Access Log Analytics on a Log Analytics workspace

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Search for **Log Analytics workspace**. 

3. Under Services, select **Log Analytics workspaces**. 
   
4. From the list, select the workspace you configured for your Windows Virtual desktop object.

5. Once in your workspace, select **Logs**. You can filter out your menu list with the **Search** function. 

### Access Log Analytics on Azure Monitor

1. Sign into the Azure portal

2. Search for and select **Monitor**. 

3. Select **Logs**.

4. Follow the instructions in the logging page to set the scope of your query.  

5. You are ready to query diagnostics. All diagnostics tables have a "WVD" prefix.

>[!NOTE]
>For more detailed information about the tables stored in Azure Monitor Logs, see the [Azure Monitor data refence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/). All tables related to Windows Virtual Desktop are labeled "WVD."

## Cadence for sending diagnostic events

Diagnostic events are sent to Log Analytics when completed.

Log Analytics only reports in these intermediate states for connection activities:

- Started: when a user selects and connects to an app or desktop in the Remote Desktop client.
- Connected: when the user successfully connects to the VM where the app or desktop is hosted.
- Completed: when the user or server disconnects the session the activity took place in.

## Example queries

The following example queries show how the diagnostics feature generates a report for the most frequent activities in your system.

To get a list of connections made by your users, run this cmdlet:

```kusto
WVDConnections 
| project-away TenantId,SourceSystem 
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *), StartTime =  min(iff(State== 'Started', TimeGenerated , datetime(null) )), ConnectTime = min(iff(State== 'Connected', TimeGenerated , datetime(null) ))   by CorrelationId 
| join kind=leftouter ( 
    WVDErrors 
    |summarize Errors=makelist(pack('Code', Code, 'CodeSymbolic', CodeSymbolic, 'Time', TimeGenerated, 'Message', Message ,'ServiceError', ServiceError, 'Source', Source)) by CorrelationId 
    ) on CorrelationId     
| join kind=leftouter ( 
   WVDCheckpoints 
   | summarize Checkpoints=makelist(pack('Time', TimeGenerated, 'Name', Name, 'Parameters', Parameters, 'Source', Source)) by CorrelationId 
   | mv-apply Checkpoints on 
    ( 
        order by todatetime(Checkpoints['Time']) asc 
        | summarize Checkpoints=makelist(Checkpoints) 
    ) 
   ) on CorrelationId 
| project-away CorrelationId1, CorrelationId2 
| order by  TimeGenerated desc 
```

To view feed activity of your users:

```kusto
WVDFeeds  
| project-away TenantId,SourceSystem  
| join kind=leftouter (  
    WVDErrors  
    |summarize Errors=makelist(pack('Code', Code, 'CodeSymbolic', CodeSymbolic, 'Time', TimeGenerated, 'Message', Message ,'ServiceError', ServiceError, 'Source', Source)) by CorrelationId  
    ) on CorrelationId      
| join kind=leftouter (  
   WVDCheckpoints  
   | summarize Checkpoints=makelist(pack('Time', TimeGenerated, 'Name', Name, 'Parameters', Parameters, 'Source', Source)) by CorrelationId  
   | mv-apply Checkpoints on  
    (  
        order by todatetime(Checkpoints['Time']) asc  
        | summarize Checkpoints=makelist(Checkpoints)  
    )  
   ) on CorrelationId  
| project-away CorrelationId1, CorrelationId2  
| order by  TimeGenerated desc 
```

To find all connections for a single user: 

```kusto
WVDConnections
|where UserName == "userupn" 
|take 100 
|sort by TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId 
```
 

To find the number of times a user connected per day:

```kusto
WVDConnections 
|where UserName == "userupn" 
|take 100 
|sort by TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId 
|summarize dcount(CorrelationId) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d) 
```
 

To find session duration by user:

```kusto
let Events = WVDConnections | where UserName == "userupn" ; 
Events 
| where State == "Connected" 
| project CorrelationId , UserName, ResourceAlias , StartTime=TimeGenerated 
| join (Events 
| where State == "Completed" 
| project EndTime=TimeGenerated, CorrelationId) 
on CorrelationId 
| project Duration = EndTime - StartTime, ResourceAlias 
| sort by Duration asc 
```

To find errors for a specific user:

```kusto
WVDErrors
| where UserName == "userupn" 
|take 100
```

To find out whether a specific error occurred:

```kusto
WVDErrors 
| where CodeSymbolic =="ErrorSymbolicCode" 
| summarize count(UserName) by CodeSymbolic 
```

To find the occurrence of an error across all users:

```kusto
WVDErrors 
| where ServiceError =="false" 
| summarize usercount = count(UserName) by CodeSymbolic 
| sort by usercount desc
| render barchart 
```

To find the occurrence of an error across all users:

```kusto
WVDErrors 
| where ServiceError =="false" 
| summarize usercount = count(UserName) by CodeSymbolic 
| sort by usercount desc
| render barchart 
```

To query apps users have opened, run this query:

```kusto
WVDCheckpoints 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where Name == "LaunchExecutable"
| extend App = parse_json(Parameters).filename
| summarize Usage=count(UserName) by tostring(App)
| sort by Usage desc
| render columnchart
```
>[!NOTE]
>- When a user opens Full Desktop, their app usage in the session isn't tracked as checkpoints in the WVDCheckpoints table.
>- The ResourcesAlias column in the WVDConnections table shows whether a user has connected to a full desktop or a published app. The column only shows the first app they open during the connection. Any published apps the user opens are tracked in WVDCheckpoints.
>- The WVDErrors table shows you management errors, host registration issues, and other issues that happen while the user subscribes to a list of apps or desktops.
>- WVDErrors helps you to identify issues that can be resolved by admin tasks. The value on ServiceError always says “false” for those types of issues. If ServiceError = “true”, you'll need to escalate the issue to Microsoft. Ensure you provide the CorrelationID for the errors you escalate.
