# Troubleshooting overview, feedback, and support for Windows Virtual Desktop

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/troubleshoot-set-up-overview-2019.md).

This article provides an overview of the issues you may encounter when setting up a Windows Virtual Desktop environment and provides ways to resolve the issues.

## Report issues

To report issues or suggest features for Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager integration, visit the [Windows Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop). You can use the Tech Community to discuss best practices or suggest and vote for new features.

When you make a post asking for help or propose a new feature, make sure you describe your topic in as much detail as possible. Detailed information can help other users answer your question or understand the feature you're proposing a vote for.

## Escalation tracks

Before doing anything else, make sure to check the [Azure status page](https://status.azure.com/status) and [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/) to make sure your Azure service is running properly.

Use the following table to identify and resolve issues you may encounter when setting up an environment using Remote Desktop client. Once your environment's set up, you can use our new [Diagnostics service](diagnostics-role-service.md) to identify issues for common scenarios.
