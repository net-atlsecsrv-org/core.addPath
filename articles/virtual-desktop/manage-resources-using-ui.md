# Tutorial: Deploy a management tool

The management tool provides a user interface (UI) for managing Microsoft Virtual Desktop Preview resources. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy and connect to the management tool.

>[!NOTE]
>These instructions are for a Windows Virtual Desktop Preview-specific configuration that can be used with your organization's existing processes.

## Important considerations

Since the app requires consent to interact with Windows Virtual Desktop, this tool doesn't support Business-to-Business (B2B) scenarios. Each Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant's subscription will need its own separate deployment of the management tool.

This management tool is a sample. Microsoft will provide important security and quality updates. The [source code is available in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/wvd-templates/wvd-management-ux/deploy). Customers and partners are encouraged to customize the tool to fit their business needs.

## What you need to run the Azure Resource Manager template

Before deploying the Azure Resource Manager template, you'll need an Azure Active Directory user account that:

- Has Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) disabled
- Has permission to create resources in your Azure subscription
- Has permissions to read your Windows Virtual Desktop tenant

## Run the Azure Resource Manager template to provision the management UI

Before you start, ensure the server and client apps have consent by visiting the [Windows Virtual Desktop Consent Page](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com) for the Azure Active Directory (AAD) represented.

Follow these instructions to deploy the Azure Resource Management template:

1. Go to the [GitHub Azure RDS-Templates page](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/wvd-templates/wvd-management-ux/deploy).
2. Deploy the template to Azure.
    - If you're deploying in an Enterprise subscription, scroll down and select **Deploy to Azure**. See [Guidance for template parameters](#guidance-for-template-parameters).
    - If you're deploying in a Cloud Solution Provider subscription, follow these instructions to deploy to Azure:
        1. Scroll down and right-click **Deploy to Azure**, then select **Copy Link Location**.
        2. Open a text editor like Notepad and paste the link there.
        3. Right after <https://portal.azure.com/> and before the hashtag (#), enter an at sign (@) followed by the tenant domain name. Here's an example of the format: <https://portal.azure.com/@Contoso.onmicrosoft.com#create/>.
        4. Sign in to the Azure portal as a user with Admin/Contributor permissions to the Cloud Solution Provider subscription.
        5. Paste the link you copied to the text editor into the address bar.

### Guidance for template parameters
Here's how to enter parameters for configuring the tool:

- This is the RD broker URL:  <https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com/>
- This is the resource URL:  <https://mrs-prod.ame.gbl/mrs-RDInfra-prod>
- Use your AAD credentials with MFA disabled to sign in to Azure. See [What you need to run the Azure Resource Manager template](#what-you-need-to-run-the-azure-resource-manager-template).
- Use a unique name for the application that will be registered in your Azure Active Directory for the management tool; for example, Apr3UX.

## Use the management tool

After the GitHub Azure Resource Manager template completes, you'll find a resource group containing two app services along with one app service plan in the Azure portal.

Follow these instructions to launch the tool:

1. Select the Azure App Services resource with the name you provided in the template (for example, Apr3UX) and navigate to the URL associated with it; for example,  <https://rdmimgmtweb-210520190304.azurewebsites.net>.
2. Sign in using your Windows Virtual Desktop credentials.
3. When prompted to choose a Tenant Group, select **Default Tenant Group** from the drop-down list.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a custom Tenant Group, enter the name manually instead of choosing from the drop-down list.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned how to deploy and connect to the management tool, you can learn how to use Azure Service Health to monitor service issues and health advisories.
