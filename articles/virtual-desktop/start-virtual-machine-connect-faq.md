This article covers frequently asked questions about the Start Virtual Machine (VM) on Connect (preview) feature for Windows Virtual Desktop host pools.

## Are VMs automatically deallocated when a user stops using them?

No. You'll need to configure additional policies to sign users out of their sessions and run Azure automation scripts to deallocate VMs.

To configure the deallocation policy:

1. Connect remotely to the VM that you want to set the policy for.

2. Open the **Group Policy Editor**, then go to **Local Computer Policy** > **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Session Time Limits**.

3. Find the policy that says **Set time limit for disconnected sessions**, then change its value to **Enabled**.

4. After you've enabled the policy, select **End a disconnected session**.

>[!NOTE]
>Make sure to set the time limit for the "End a disconnected session" policy to a value greater than five minutes. A low time limit can cause users' sessions to end if their network loses connection for too long, resulting in lost work.

Signing users out won't deallocate their VMs. To learn how to deallocate VMs, see [Start or stop VMs during off hours](../automation/automation-solution-vm-management.md).

## Can users turn off the VM from their clients?

Yes. Users can shut down the VM by using the Start menu within their session, just like they would with a physical machine. However, shutting down the VM won't deallocate the VM. To learn how to deallocate VMs, see [Start or stop VMs during off hours](../automation/automation-solution-vm-management.md).
