# Tenant and host pool creation

This article covers issues during the initial setup of the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant and the related session host pool infrastructure.

## Provide feedback

Visit the [Windows Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop) to discuss the Windows Virtual Desktop service with the product team and active community members.

## Acquiring the Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session image

To use the Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session image, go to the Azure Marketplace, select **Get Started** > **Microsoft Windows 10** > and [Windows 10 Enterprise for Virtual Desktops, Version 1809](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoftwindowsdesktop.windows-10?tab=PlansAndPrice).

## Creating Windows Virtual Desktop tenant

This section covers potential issues when creating the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant.

### Error: The user isn't authorized to query the management service

![Screenshot of PowerShell window in which a user isn't authorized to query the management service.](media/UserNotAuthorizedNewTenant.png)

Example of raw error:

```Error
   New-RdsTenant : User isn't authorized to query the management service.
   ActivityId: ad604c3a-85c6-4b41-9b81-5138162e5559
   Powershell commands to diagnose the failure:

      ellException
       + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess,Microsoft.RDInfra.RDPowershell.Tenant.NewRdsTenant
```

**Cause:** The user who's signed in hasn't been assigned the TenantCreator role in their Azure Active Directory.

**Fix:** Follow the instructions in [Assign the TenantCreator application role to a user in your Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/tenant-setup-azure-active-directory#assign-the-tenantcreator-application-role). After following the instructions, you'll have a user assigned to the TenantCreator role.

## Creating Windows Virtual Desktop session host VMs

Session host VMs can be created in several ways, but Remote Desktop Services/Windows Virtual Desktop teams only support VM provisioning issues related to the Azure Resource Manager template. The Azure Resource Manager template is available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Issues using Windows Virtual Desktop – Provision a host pool Azure Marketplace offering

The Windows Virtual Desktop – Provision a host pool template is available from the Azure Marketplace.

### Error: When using the link from GitHub, the message “Create a free account" appears

![Screenshot to create a free account.](media/be615904ace9832754f0669de28abd94.png)

**Cause 1:** There aren't active subscriptions in the account used to sign in to Azure or the account used doesn't have permissions to view the subscriptions.

**Fix 1:** Sign in with an account that has contributor access (at a minimum) to the subscription where session host VMs are going to be deployed.

**Cause 2:** The subscription being used is part of a Microsoft Cloud Service Provider (CSP) tenant.

**Fix 2:** Go to the GitHub location for **Create and provision new Windows Virtual Desktop host pool** and follow these instructions:

1. Right-click on **Deploy to Azure** and select **Copy link address**.
2. Open **Notepad** and paste the link.
3. Before the # character, insert the CSP end customer tenant name.
4. Open the new link in a browser and the Azure portal will load the template.

    ```Example
    Example: https://portal.azure.com/<CSP end customer tenant name>
    #create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%
    2FRDS-Templates%2Fmaster%2Fwvd-templates%2FCreate%20and%20provision%20WVD%20host%20pool%2FmainTemplate.json
    ```

## Azure Resource Manager template and PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) errors

Follow these instructions to troubleshoot unsuccessful deployments of Azure Resource Manager templates and PowerShell DSC.

1. Review errors in the deployment using [View deployment operations with Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-operations).
2. If there are no errors in the deployment, review errors in the activity log using [View activity logs to audit actions on resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit).
3. Once the error is identified, use the error message and the resources in [Troubleshoot common Azure deployment errors with Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-common-deployment-errors) to address the issue.
4. Delete any resources created during the previous deployment and retry deploying the template again.

### Error: Your deployment failed….\<hostname>/joindomain

![Your Deployment Failed screenshot.](media/e72df4d5c05d390620e07f0d7328d50f.png)

Example of raw error:

```Error
 {"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. 
 Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"Conflict","message":"{\r\n \"status\": \"Failed\",\r\n \"error\":

 extension 'joindomain'. Error message: \\\"Exception(s) occurred while joining Domain 'diamondsg.onmicrosoft.com'\\\".\"\r\n }\r\n ]\r\n }\r\n}"}]}
```

**Cause 1:** Credentials provided for joining VMs to the domain are incorrect.

**Fix 1:** See the "Incorrect credentials" error for VMs are not joined to the domain in [Session host VM configuration](troubleshoot-vm-configuration.md).

**Cause 2:** Domain name doesn't resolve.

**Fix 2:** See the "Domain name doesn't resolve" error for VMs are not joined to the domain in [Session host VM configuration](troubleshoot-vm-configuration.md).


### Error: Your deployment failed...\Unauthorized

```Error
{"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"Unauthorized","message":"{\r\n \"Code\": \"Unauthorized\",\r\n \"Message\": \"The scale operation is not allowed for this subscription in this region. Try selecting different region or scale option.\",\r\n \"Target\": null,\r\n \"Details\": [\r\n {\r\n \"Message\": \"The scale operation is not allowed for this subscription in this region.

Try selecting different region or scale option.\"\r\n }\r\n }\r\n ],\r\n \"Innererror\": null\r\n}"}]}
```

**Cause:** The subscription you're using is a type that can't access required features in the region where the customer is trying to deploy. For example, MSDN, Free, or Education subscriptions can show this error.

**Fix:** Change your subscription type or region to one that can access the required features.

### Error: VMExtensionProvisioningError

![Screenshot of Your Deployment Failed with terminal provisioning state failed.](media/7aaf15615309c18a984673be73ac969a.png)

**Cause 1:** Transient error with the Windows Virtual Desktop environment.

**Cause 2:** Transient error with connection.

**Fix:** Confirm Windows Virtual Desktop environment is healthy by signing in using PowerShell. Finish the VM registration manually in [Create a host pool with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-powershell).

### Error: The Admin Username specified isn't allowed

![Screenshot of your deployment failed in which an admin specified isn't allowed.](media/f2b3d3700e9517463ef88fa41875bac9.png)

Example of raw error:

```Error

 /resourceGroups/demoHostDesktop/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/demo", "resourceType": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines", "resourceName": "demo" } }}
```

**Cause:** Password provided contains forbidden substrings (admin, administrator, root).

**Fix:** Update username or use different users.

### Error: VM has reported a failure when processing extension

![Screenshot of the resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state in Your Deployment Failed.](media/49c4a1836a55d91cd65125cf227f411f.png)

Example of raw error:

 Compute/virtualMachines/desktop-1/extensions/dscextension",
 "resourceType": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions", "resourceName": "desktop-1/dscextension" } }}
```

**Cause:** PowerShell DSC extension was not able to get admin access on the VM.

**Fix:** Confirm username and password have administrative access on the virtual machine and run the Azure Resource Manager template again.

### Error: DeploymentFailed – PowerShell DSC Configuration ‘FirstSessionHost’ completed with Error(s)

![Screenshot of deployment fail with PowerShell DSC Configuration ‘FirstSessionHost’ completed with Error(s).](media/64870370bcbe1286906f34cf0a8646ab.png)

Example of raw error:

```Error

    "code": "DeploymentFailed",
   "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list 
 deployment operations for details. 4 Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.",

              function did not succeed.\\\".\"\r\n }\r\n ]\r\n }\r\n}"  }

```

**Cause:** PowerShell DSC extension was not able to get admin access on the VM.

**Fix:** Confirm username and password provided have administrative access on the virtual machine and run the Azure Resource Manager template again.

### Error: DeploymentFailed – InvalidResourceReference

Example of raw error:

```Error
{"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation
failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-
debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"Conflict","message":"{\r\n \"status\":
\"Failed\",\r\n \"error\": {\r\n \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",\r\n
\"message\": \"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state
'Failed'.\",\r\n \"details\": [\r\n {\r\n \"code\": \"DeploymentFailed\",\r\n
\"message\": \"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list
deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage
details.\",\r\n \"details\": [\r\n {\r\n \"code\": \"BadRequest\",\r\n \"message\":
\"{\\r\\n \\\"error\\\": {\\r\\n \\\"code\\\": \\\"InvalidResourceReference\\\",\\r\\n
\\\"message\\\": \\\"Resource /subscriptions/EXAMPLE/resourceGroups/ernani-wvd-
demo/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/wvd-vnet/subnets/default
referenced by resource /subscriptions/EXAMPLE/resourceGroups/ernani-wvd-
demo/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/erd. Please make sure that
the referenced resource exists, and that both resources are in the same
region.\\\",\\r\\n\\\"details\\\": []\\r\\n }\\r\\n}\"\r\n }\r\n ]\r\n }\r\n ]\r\n }\r\n}"}]}
```

**Cause:** Part of the resource group name is used for certain resources being created by the template. Due to the name matching existing resources, the template may select an existing resource from a different group.

**Fix:** When running the Azure Resource Manager template to deploy session host VMs, make the first two characters unique for your subscription resource group name.

### Error: DeploymentFailed – InvalidResourceReference

Example of raw error:

```Error
{"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation
failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-
debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"Conflict","message":"{\r\n \"status\":
\"Failed\",\r\n \"error\": {\r\n \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",\r\n
\"message\": \"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state

resources are in the same region.\\\",\\r\\n \\\"details\\\": []\\r\\n }\\r\\n}\"\r\n
}\r\n ]\r\n }\r\n ]\r\n }\r\n\
```

**Cause:** This error is because the NIC created with the Azure Resource Manager template has the same name as another NIC already in the VNET.

**Fix:** Use a different host prefix.

### Error: DeploymentFailed – Error downloading

Example of raw error:

```Error
\\\"The DSC Extension failed to execute: Error downloading
https://catalogartifact.azureedge.net/publicartifacts/rds.wvd-provision-host-pool-
2dec7a4d-006c-4cc0-965a-02bbe438d6ff-prod
/Artifacts/DSC/Configuration.zip after 29 attempts: The remote name could not be
resolved: 'catalogartifact.azureedge.net'.\\nMore information about the failure can
be found in the logs located under
'C:\\\\WindowsAzure\\\\Logs\\\\Plugins\\\\Microsoft.Powershell.DSC\\\\2.77.0.0' on
the VM.\\\"
```

**Cause:** This error is due to a static route, firewall rule, or NSG blocking the download of the zip file tied to the Azure Resource Manager template.

**Fix:** Remove blocking static route, firewall rule, or NSG. Optionally, open the Azure Resource Manager template json file in a text editor, take the link to zip file, and download the resource to an allowed location.

### Error: The user isn't authorized to query the management service

Example of raw error:

```Error
"response": { "content": { "startTime": "2019-04-01T17:45:33.3454563+00:00", "endTime": "2019-04-01T17:48:52.4392099+00:00", 
"status": "Failed", "error": { "code": "VMExtensionProvisioningError", "message": "VM has reported a failure when processing 
extension 'dscextension'. Error message: \"DSC Configuration 'FirstSessionHost' completed with error(s). 
Following are the first few: PowerShell DSC resource MSFT_ScriptResource failed to execute Set-TargetResource
 functionality with error message: User is not authorized to query the management service.
\nActivityId: 1b4f2b37-59e9-411e-9d95-4f7ccd481233\nPowershell commands to diagnose the failure:

```

**Cause:** The specified Windows Virtual Desktop tenant admin doesn't have a valid role assignment.

**Fix:** The user who created the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant needs to sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell and assign the attempted user a role assignment. If you're running the GitHub Azure Resource Manager template parameters, follow these instructions using PowerShell commands:

```PowerShell
Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl "https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com"
New-RdsRoleAssignment -TenantName <Windows Virtual Desktop tenant name> -RoleDefinitionName "RDS Contributor" -SignInName <UPN>
```

### Error: User requires Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

![Screenshot of your deployment failed due to lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](media/MFARequiredError.png)

Example of raw error:

```Error
"message": "{\r\n  \"status\": \"Failed\",\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",\r\n    \"message\": \"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.\",\r\n    \"details\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"code\": \"VMExtensionProvisioningError\",\r\n        \"message\": \"VM has reported a failure when processing extension 'dscextension'. Error message: \\\"DSC Configuration 'FirstSessionHost' completed with error(s). Following are the first few: PowerShell DSC resource MSFT_ScriptResource  failed to execute Set-TargetResource functionality with error message: One or more errors occurred.  The SendConfigurationApply function did not succeed.\\\".\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}"
```

**Cause:** The specified Windows Virtual Desktop tenant admin requires Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to sign in.

**Fix:** Create a service principal and assign it a role for your Windows Virtual Desktop tenant by following the steps in [Tutorial: Create service principals and role assignments with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/create-service-principal-role-powershell). After verifying that you can sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop with the service principal, rerun the Azure Marketplace offering or the GitHub Azure Resource Manager template, depending on which method you're using. Follow the instructions below to enter the correct parameters for your method.

If you're running the Azure Marketplace offering, provide values for the following parameters to properly authenticate to Windows Virtual Desktop:

- Windows Virtual Desktop tenant RDS Owner: Service principal
- Application ID: The application identification of the new service principal you created
- Password/Confirm Password: The password secret you generated for the service principal
- Azure AD Tenant ID: The Azure AD Tenant ID of the service principal you created

If you're running the GitHub Azure Resource Manager template, provide values for the following parameters to properly authenticate to Windows Virtual Desktop:

- Tenant Admin user principal name (UPN) or Application ID: The application identification of the new service principal you created
- Tenant Admin Password: The password secret you generated for the service principal
- IsServicePrincipal: **true**
- AadTenantId: The Azure AD Tenant ID of the service principal you created
