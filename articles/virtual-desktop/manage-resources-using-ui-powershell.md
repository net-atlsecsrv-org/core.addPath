# Deploy a management tool with PowerShell

This article will show you how to deploy the management tool using PowerShell.

## Important considerations

Each Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant's subscription needs its own separate deployment of the management tool. This tool doesn't support Azure AD Business-to-Business (B2B) scenarios. 

This management tool is a sample. Microsoft will provide important security and quality updates. [The source code is available in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/wvd-templates/wvd-management-ux/deploy). Whether you're a customer or partner, we encourage you to customize the tool to satisfy your business needs.

The following browsers are compatible with the management tool:

- Google Chrome 68 or later
- Microsoft Edge 40.15063 or later
- Mozilla Firefox 52.0 or later
- Safari 10 or later (macOS only)

## What you need to deploy the management tool

Before deploying the management tool, you'll need an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user to create an app registration and deploy the management UI. This user must:

- Have permission to create resources in your Azure subscription
- Have permission to create an Azure AD application. Follow these steps to check if your user has the required permissions by following the instructions in [Required permissions](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#required-permissions).

In order to successfully deploy and configure the management tool, you first need to download the following PowerShell scripts from the [RDS-Templates GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/wvd-templates/wvd-management-ux/deploy/scripts) and save them to the same folder on your local machine.

  - createWvdMgmtUxAppRegistration.ps1
  - updateWvdMgmtUxApiUrl.ps1

After you deploy and configure the management tool, we recommend you ask a user to launch the management UI to make sure everything works. The user who launches the management UI must have a role assignment that lets them view or edit the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant.

## Set up PowerShell

Get started by signing in to both the Az and Azure AD PowerShell modules. Here's how to sign in:

1. Open PowerShell as an Administrator and navigate to the directory where you saved the PowerShell scripts.
2. Sign in to Azure with an account that has Owner or Contributor permissions on the Azure subscription you plan to use to create the management tool by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Login-AzAccount
    ```

3. Run the following cmdlet to sign in to Azure AD with the same account you used for the Az PowerShell module:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzureAD
    ```

4. After that, navigate to the folder where you saved the two PowerShell scripts from the RDS-Templates GitHub repo.

Keep the PowerShell window you used to sign in open to run additional PowerShell cmdlets while signed in.

## Create an Azure Active Directory app registration

Run the following commands to create the app registration with required API permissions:

```powershell
$appName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a unique name for the management tool's app registration. The name can't contain spaces or special characters."
$subscriptionId = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Azure subscription ID where you will be deploying the management tool."

.\createWvdMgmtUxAppRegistration.ps1 -AppName $appName -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId
```

Now that you've completed the Azure AD app registration, you can deploy the management tool.

## Deploy the management tool

Run the following PowerShell commands to deploy the management tool and associate it with the service principal you just created:
     
```powershell
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Resource Group name"
$location = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the location (i.e. centralus)"
$templateParameters = @{}
$templateParameters.Add('isServicePrincipal', $true)
$templateParameters.Add('azureAdminUserPrincipalNameOrApplicationId', $ServicePrincipalCredentials.UserName)
$templateParameters.Add('azureAdminPassword', $servicePrincipalCredentials.Password)
$templateParameters.Add('applicationName', $appName)

Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId | Select-AzSubscription
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/master/wvd-templates/wvd-management-ux/deploy/mainTemplate.json" `
    -TemplateParameterObject $templateParameters `
    -Verbose
```

After you've created the web app, you must add a redirect URI to the Azure AD application to successfully sign in users.

## Set the Redirect URI

Run the following PowerShell commands to retrieve the web app URL and set it as the authentication redirect URI (also called a reply URL):

```powershell
$webApp = Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $appName
$redirectUri = "https://" + $webApp.DefaultHostName + "/"
Get-AzureADApplication -All $true | where { $_.AppId -match $servicePrincipalCredentials.UserName } | Set-AzureADApplication -ReplyUrls $redirectUri  
```

Now that you've added a redirect URI, you next need to update the API URL so the management tool can interact with the API-backend service.

## Update the API URL for the web application

Run the following script to update the API URL configuration in the web application front end:

```powershell
.\updateWvdMgmtUxApiUrl.ps1 -AppName $appName -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId
```

Now that you've fully configured the management tool web app, it's time to verify the Azure AD application and provide consent.

## Verify the Azure AD application and provide consent

To verify the Azure AD application configuration and provide consent:

1. Open your internet browser and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your administrative account.
2. From the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for **App registrations** and select the item under **Services**.
3. Select **All applications** and search the unique app name you provided for the PowerShell script in [Create an Azure Active Directory app registration](#create-an-azure-active-directory-app-registration).
4. In the panel on the left side of the browser, select **Authentication** and make sure the redirect URI is the same as the web app URL for the management tool, as shown in the following image.
   
   [ ![The authentication page with the entered redirect URI](media/management-ui-redirect-uri-inline.png) ](media/management-ui-redirect-uri-expanded.png#lightbox)

5. In the left panel, select **API permissions** to confirm that permissions were added. If you're a global admin, select the **Grant admin consent for `tenantname`**  button and follow the dialog prompts to provide admin consent for your organization.

You can now start using the management tool.

## Use the management tool

Now that you've set up the management tool at any time, you can launch it anytime, anywhere. Here's how to launch the tool:

1. Open the URL of the web app in a web browser. If you don't remember the URL, you can sign in to Azure, find the app service you deployed for the management tool, and then select the URL.
2. Sign in using your Windows Virtual Desktop credentials.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you didn't grant admin consent while configuring the management tool, each user who signs in will need to provide their own user consent in order to use the tool.

3. When prompted to choose a tenant group, select **Default Tenant Group** from the drop-down list.
4. When you select **Default Tenant Group**, a menu should appear on the left side of your window. In this menu, find the name of your tenant group and select it.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have a custom tenant group, enter the name manually instead of choosing from the drop-down list.

## Report issues

If you come across any issues with the management tool or other Windows Virtual Desktop tools, follow the directions in [Azure Resource Manager templates for Remote Desktop Services](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/blob/master/README.md) to report them on GitHub.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned how to deploy and connect to the management tool, you can learn how to use Azure Service Health to monitor service issues and health advisories. To learn more, see our [Set up service alerts tutorial](./set-up-service-alerts.md).
