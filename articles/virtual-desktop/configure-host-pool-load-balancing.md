# Configure the Windows Virtual Desktop load-balancing method

Configuring the load-balancing method for a host pool allows you to adjust the Windows Virtual Desktop environment to better suit your needs.

>[!NOTE]
> This does not apply to a persistent desktop host pool because users always have a 1:1 mapping to a session host within the host pool.

## Configure breadth-first load balancing

Breadth-first load balancing is the default configuration for new non-persistent host pools. Breadth-first load balancing distributes new user sessions across all available session hosts in the host pool. When configuring breadth-first load balancing, you may set a maximum session limit per session host in the host pool.

First, [download and import the Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell module](/powershell/windows-virtual-desktop/overview/) to use in your PowerShell session if you haven't already. After that, run the following cmdlet to sign in to your account:

```powershell
Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl "https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com"
```

To configure a host pool to perform breadth-first load balancing without adjusting the maximum session limit, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-RdsHostPool <tenantname> <hostpoolname> -BreadthFirstLoadBalancer
```

To configure a host pool to perform breadth-first load balancing and to use a new maximum session limit, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-RdsHostPool <tenantname> <hostpoolname> -BreadthFirstLoadBalancer -MaxSessionLimit ###
```

## Configure depth-first load balancing

Depth-first load balancing distributes new user sessions to an available session host with the highest number of connections but has not reached its maximum session limit threshold. When configuring depth-first load balancing, you **must** set a maximum session limit per session host in the host pool.

To configure a host pool to perform depth-first load balancing, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-RdsHostPool <tenantname> <hostpoolname> -DepthFirstLoadBalancer -MaxSessionLimit ###
```
