# Storage options for FSLogix profile containers in Windows Virtual Desktop

Azure offers multiple storage solutions that you can use to store your FSLogix profile container. This article compares storage solutions that Azure offers for Windows Virtual Desktop FSLogix user profile containers. We recommend storing FSLogix profile containers on Azure Files for most of our customers.

Windows Virtual Desktop offers FSLogix profile containers as the recommended user profile solution. FSLogix is designed to roam profiles in remote computing environments, such as Windows Virtual Desktop. At sign-in, this container is dynamically attached to the computing environment using a natively supported Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) and a Hyper-V Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX). The user profile is immediately available and appears in the system exactly like a native user profile.

The following tables compare the storage solutions Azure Storage offers for Windows Virtual Desktop FSLogix profile container user profiles.

Once you've chosen your storage method, check out [Windows Virtual Desktop pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-desktop/) for information about our pricing plans.

## Azure Files tiers

Azure Files offers two different tiers of storage: premium and standard. These tiers let you tailor the performance and cost of your file shares to meet your scenario's requirements.

- Premium file shares are backed by solid-state drives (SSDs) and are deployed in the FileStorage storage account type. Premium file shares provide consistent high performance and low latency for input and output (IO) intensive workloads. 

- Standard file shares are backed by hard disk drives (HDDs) and are deployed in the general purpose version 2 (GPv2) storage account type. Standard file shares provide reliable performance for IO workloads that are less sensitive to performance variability, such as general-purpose file shares and dev/test environments. Standard file shares are only available in a pay-as-you-go billing model.

The following table lists our recommendations for which performance tier to use based on your workload. These recommendations will help you select the performance tier that meets your performance targets, budget, and regional considerations. We've based these recommendations on the example scenarios from [Remote Desktop workload types](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/remote-desktop-workloads). 

| Workload type | Recommended file tier |
|--------|-----------|
| Light (fewer than 200 users) | Standard file shares |
| Light (more than 200 users) | Premium file shares or standard with multiple file shares |
|Medium|Premium file shares|
|Heavy|Premium file shares|
|Power|Premium file shares|

If you're ready to create your own FSLogix profile containers, get started with one of these tutorials:

- [Getting started with FSLogix profile containers on Azure Files in Windows Virtual Desktop](create-file-share.md)
- [Create an FSLogix profile container for a host pool using Azure NetApp files](create-fslogix-profile-container.md)
- The instructions in [Deploy a two-node Storage Spaces Direct scale-out file server for UPD storage in Azure](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-storage-spaces-direct-deployment/) also apply when you use an FSLogix profile container instead of a user profile disk

You can also start from the very beginning and set up your own Windows Virtual Desktop solution at [Create a tenant in Windows Virtual Desktop](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/tenant-setup-azure-active-directory.md).
