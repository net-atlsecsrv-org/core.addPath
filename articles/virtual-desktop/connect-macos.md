# Connect with the macOS client

> Applies to: macOS 10.12 or later

You can access Windows Virtual Desktop resources from your macOS devices with our downloadable client. This guide will tell you how to set up the client.

## Install the client

To get started, [download](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12)Â and install the client on your macOS device.

## Subscribe to a feed

Subscribe to the feed your admin gave you to get the list of managed resources available to you on your macOS device.

To subscribe to a feed:

1. Select **Add Workspace** on the main page to connect to the service and retrieve your resources.
2. Enter the Feed URL. This can be a URL or email address:
   - If you use a URL, use the one your admin gave you. Normally, the URL is <https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com>.
   - To use email, enter your email address. This tells the client to search for a URL associated with your email address if your admin configured the server that way.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Sign in with your user account when prompted.

After you've signed in, you should see a list of available resources.

Once you've subscribed to a feed, the feed's content will update automatically on a regular basis. Resources may be added, changed, or removed based on changes made by your administrator.
