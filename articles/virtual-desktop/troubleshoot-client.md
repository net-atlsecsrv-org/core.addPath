# Troubleshoot the Remote Desktop client

This article describes common issues with the Remote Desktop client and how to fix them.

## Remote Desktop client for Windows 7 or Windows 10 stops responding or cannot be opened

Starting with version 1.2.790, you can reset the user data from the About page or using a command.

Use the following command to remove your user data, restore default settings and unsubscribe from all Workspaces.

```cmd
msrdcw.exe /reset [/f]
```

If you're using an earlier version of the Remote Desktop client, we recommend you uninstall and reinstall the client.

## Web client won't open

First, test your internet connection by opening another website in your browser; for example, [www.bing.com](https://www.bing.com).

Use **nslookup** to confirm DNS can resolve the FQDN:

```cmd
nslookup rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com
```

Try connecting with another client, like Remote Desktop client for Windows 7 or Windows 10, and check to see if you can open the web client.

### Can't open other websites while connected to the web client

If you can't open other websites while you're connected to the web client, there might be network connection problems or a network outage. We recommend you contact network support.

### Nslookup can't resolve the name

If nslookup can't resolve the name, then there might be network connection problems or a network outage. We recommend you contact network support.

### Your client can't connect but other clients on your network can connect

If your browser starts acting up or stops working while you're using the web client, follow these instructions to troubleshoot it:

1. Restart the browser.
2. Clear browser cookies. See [How to delete cookie files in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/278835/how-to-delete-cookie-files-in-internet-explorer).
3. Clear browser cache. See [clear browser cache for your browser](https://binged.it/2RKyfdU).
4. Open browser in Private mode.

## Client doesn't show my resources

First, check the Azure Active Directory account you're using. If you've already signed in with a different Azure Active Directory account than the one you want to use for Windows Virtual Desktop, you should either sign out or use a private browser window.

If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic), use the web client link in [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/connect-web-2019.md) to connect to your resources.

If that doesn't work, make sure your app group is associated with a workspace.

## Web client stops responding or disconnects

Try connecting using another browser or client.

### Other browsers and clients also malfunction or fail to open

If issues continue even after you've switched browsers, the problem may not be with your browser, but with your network. We recommend you contact network support.

## Web client keeps prompting for credentials

If the Web client keeps prompting for credentials, follow these instructions:

1. Confirm the web client URL is correct.
2. Confirm that the credentials you're using are for the Windows Virtual Desktop environment tied to the URL.
3. Clear browser cookies. For more information, see [How to delete cookie files in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/278835/how-to-delete-cookie-files-in-internet-explorer).
4. Clear browser cache. For more information, see [Clear browser cache for your browser](https://binged.it/2RKyfdU).
5. Open your browser in Private mode.

## Windows client blocks Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) feed

If the Windows client feed won't show Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) apps, follow these instructions:

1. Check if the Conditional Access policy includes the app IDs associated with Windows Virtual Desktop (classic).
2. Check if the Conditional Access policy blocks all access except Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) app IDs. If so, you'll need to add the app ID **9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07** to the policy to allow the client to discover the feeds.

If you can't find the app ID 9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07 in the list, you'll need to register the Windows Virtual Desktop resource provider. To register the resource provider:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Go to **Subscription**, then select your subscription.
3. In the menu on the left side of the page, select **Resource provider**.
4. Find and select **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization**, then select **Re-register**.
