# Configure Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager

This article explains how to configure Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to automatically apply updates to a Windows Virtual Desktop host running Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session.

## Prerequisites

To configure this setting, you'll need the following things:

   - Make sure you've installed the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager Agent on your virtual machines.
   - Make sure your version of Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager is at least on branch level 1906. For best results, use branch level 1910 or higher.

## Configure the software update point

To receive updates for Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, you need to enable Windows Server, version 1903 and later as a product within Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. This product setting also applies if you use the Windows Server Update Service to deploy updates to your systems.

To receive updates:

1. Open Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and select **Sites**.
2. Select **Configure Site Components**.
3. Select **Software Update Point** in the drop-down menu.
4. Select the **Products** tab.
5. Select the check box that says **Windows Server, version 1903 and later**.
6. Go to **Software Library** > **Overview** > **Software Updates** > **All Software Updates** and select **Synchronize Software Updates**.
7. Check the wsyncmgr.log file in **Program Files** > **Microsoft Configuration Manager** > **Logs** to make sure your changes were saved. It may take a few minutes to synchronize the updates.

## Create a query-based collection

To create a collection of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session virtual machines, a query-based collection can be used to identify the specific operating system SKU.

To create a collection:

1. Select **Assets and Compliance**.
2. Go to **Overview** > **Device Collections** and right-click **Device collections** and select **Create Device Collection** from the drop-down menu.
3. In the **General** tab of the menu that opens, enter a name that describes your collection in the **Name** field. In the **Comment** field, you can give additional information describing what the collection is. In **Limiting Collection**, define which machines you're including in the collection query.
4. In the **Membership Rules** tab, add a rule for your query by selecting **Add Rule**, then selecting **Query Rule**.
5. In **Query Rule Properties**, enter a name for your rule, then define the parameters of the rule by selecting **Edit Query Statement**.
6. Select **Show Query Statement**.
7. In the statement, enter the following string:

    ```syntax
    select
    SMS_R_SYSTEM.ResourceID,SMS_R_SYSTEM.ResourceType,SMS_R_SYSTEM.Name,SMS_R_SYSTEM.SMSUniqueIdentifier,SMS_R_SYSTEM.ResourceDomainORWorkgroup,SMS_R_SYSTEM.Client
    from SMS_R_System inner join SMS_G_System_OPERATING_SYSTEM on
    SMS_G_System_OPERATING_SYSTEM.ResourceId = SMS_R_System.ResourceId where
    SMS_G_System_OPERATING_SYSTEM.OperatingSystemSKU = 175
    ```

8. Select **OK** to create the collection.
9. To check if you successfully created the collection, go to **Assets and Compliance** > **Overview** > **Device Collections**.
