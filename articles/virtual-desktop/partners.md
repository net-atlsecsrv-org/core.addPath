## Automai

![Automai logo](./media/partners/automai.png)

You can use Automai's robotic automation platform to test key business processes in a Windows Virtual Desktop environment before your deployment goes live.

With Automai's ScenarioBuilder tool and GUI-based workflow engine, IT teams can record real end-user workflows and automatically translate them into scripts. Automai then uses bots running processes from individual desktops to emulate end-user activity in a simulation and report the results. This greatly simplifies testing processes so that IT admins can stress-test even the most complex scenarios.

Once you're ready for launch, you can use all the workflow scripts you created for load testing to continuously monitor performance in production. Automai's bots can do more than just availability monitoring. The bots can also test end-user workflows from key locations, taking screenshots and collecting error reports in real time. This leads to a more proactive than reactive approach to bug fixes for Windows Virtual Desktop applications.

Automai lets you use the same scripts for performance testing, functional testing, performance monitoring, and even robotic process automation, all on one platform.

## Nasuni

![Nasuni Logo](./media/partners/nasuni.png)

Nasuni Corp., the leading provider of cloud file services and a top Azure global ISV partner, offers the Nasuni software-as-a-service platform as the modern file storage solution for modern virtual desktops.

With Nasuni, enterprises can deploy Windows Virtual Desktops for more use cases and in more Azure regions, simplify administration, and ensure business continuity. 

Being a modern cloud VDI solution, Windows Virtual Desktop requires modern cloud file storage. Traditionally, VDI file storage has been based on Network-Attached Storage (NAS) and file server hardware located on-premises, and the accompanying required technology to provide file backups, restoration, and disaster recovery. These traditional approaches are expensive, complex to maintain and administer, and don’t scale easily. They also introduce latency if used with a modern cloud VDI solution like Windows Virtual Desktop due to the physical distance and the slower WAN connections between the desktops based in Azure and the file storage based on-premises. Nasuni, a file services platform built specifically for Azure, offers unlimited file storage capacity and high-performance file access. Nasuni can be co-located with Windows Virtual Desktop in the same Azure regions to deliver economical, high-performance file access to a single global namespace. Nasuni offers Windows Virtual Desktop file storage at a fraction of the cost of traditional NAS and Windows file servers and includes built-in backups and disaster recovery to further reduce costs and free up IT resources.
