# Connect to Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) with the web client

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Windows Virtual Desktop (classic), which doesn't support Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're trying to manage Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects, see [this article](../connect-web.md).

The web client lets you access your Windows Virtual Desktop resources from a web browser without the lengthy installation process.

>[!NOTE]
>The web client doesn't currently have mobile OS support.

## Supported operating systems and browsers

While any HTML5-capable browser should work, we officially support the following operating systems and browsers.

| Browser           | Supported OS                     | Notes               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Microsoft Edge    | Windows                          |                     |
| Internet Explorer | Windows                          |                     |
| Apple Safari      | macOS                            |                     |
| Mozilla Firefox   | Windows, macOS, Linux            | Version 55 or later |
| Google Chrome     | Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS |                     |

## Access remote resources feed

In a browser, navigate to the Windows Virtual Desktop web client at <https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/webclient> and sign in with your user account.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager integration, connect to your resources at <https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient> instead.

>[!NOTE]
>If you've already signed in with a different Azure Active Directory account than the one you want to use for Windows Virtual Desktop, you should either sign out or use a private browser window.

After signing in, you should now see a list of resources. You can launch resources by selecting them like you would a normal app in the **All Resources** tab.
