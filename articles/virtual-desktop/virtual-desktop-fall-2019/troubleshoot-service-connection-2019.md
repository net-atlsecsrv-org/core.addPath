# Windows Virtual Desktop service connections

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to the Fall 2019 release that doesn't support Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're trying to manage Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects introduced in the Spring 2020 update, see [this article](../troubleshoot-service-connection.md).

Use this article to resolve issues with Windows Virtual Desktop client connections.

## Provide feedback

You can give us feedback and discuss the Windows Virtual Desktop Service with the product team and other active community members at the [Windows Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop).

## User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A user can start Remote Desktop clients and is able to authenticate, however the user doesn't see any icons in the web discovery feed.

Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using this command line:

```PowerShell
Get-RdsAppGroupUser <tenantname> <hostpoolname> <appgroupname>
```

Confirm that the user is logging in with the correct credentials.

If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issues.

## Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session virtual machines don't respond

If a virtual machine isn't responsive and you can't access it through RDP, you'll need to troubleshoot it with the diagnostics feature by checking the host status.

To check the host status, run this cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-RdsSessionHost -TenantName $TenantName -HostPoolName $HostPool | ft SessionHostName, LastHeartBeat, AllowNewSession, Status
```

If the host status is `NoHeartBeat`, that means the VM isn't responding and the agent can't communicate with the Windows Virtual Desktop service.

```powershell
SessionHostName          LastHeartBeat     AllowNewSession    Status 
---------------          -------------     ---------------    ------ 
WVDHost1.contoso.com     21-Nov-19 5:21:35            True     Available 
WVDHost2.contoso.com     21-Nov-19 5:21:35            True     Available 
WVDHost3.contoso.com     21-Nov-19 5:21:35            True     NoHeartBeat 
WVDHost4.contoso.com     21-Nov-19 5:21:35            True     NoHeartBeat 
WVDHost5.contoso.com     21-Nov-19 5:21:35            True     NoHeartBeat 
```

There are a few things you can do to fix the NoHeartBeat status.

### Update FSLogix

If your FSLogix isn't up to date, especially if it's version 2.9.7205.27375 of frxdrvvt.sys, it could cause a deadlock. Make sure to [update FSLogix to the latest version](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2084562).

### Disable BgTaskRegistrationMaintenanceTask

If updating FSLogix doesn't work, the issue might be that a BiSrv component is exhausting system resources during a weekly maintenance task. Temporarily disable the maintenance task by disabling the BgTaskRegistrationMaintenanceTask with one of these two methods:

- Go to the Start menu and search for **Task Scheduler**. Navigate to **Task Scheduler Library** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **BrokerInfrastructure**. Look for a task named **BgTaskRegistrationMaintenanceTask**. When you find it, right-click it and select **Disable** from the drop-down menu.
- Open a command-line menu as administrator and run the following command:
    
    ```cmd
    schtasks /change /tn "\Microsoft\Windows\BrokerInfrastructure\BgTaskRegistrationMaintenanceTask" /disable 
    ```
