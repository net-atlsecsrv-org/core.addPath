# Connect with the web client

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to the Spring 2020 update with Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using the Windows Virtual Desktop Fall 2019 release without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/connect-web-2019.md).
>
> The Windows Virtual Desktop Spring 2020 update is currently in public preview. This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and we don't recommend using it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

The web client lets you access your Windows Virtual Desktop resources from a web browser without the lengthy installation process.

>[!NOTE]
>The web client doesn't currently have mobile OS support.

## Supported operating systems and browsers

While any HTML5-capable browser should work, we officially support the following operating systems and browsers.

| Browser           | Supported OS                     | Notes               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Microsoft Edge    | Windows                          |                     |
| Internet Explorer | Windows                          |                     |
| Apple Safari      | macOS                            |                     |
| Mozilla Firefox   | Windows, macOS, Linux            | Version 55 or later |
| Google Chrome     | Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS |                     |

## Access remote resources feed

In a browser, navigate to the [Windows Virtual Desktop web client](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient) and sign in with your user account.

>[!NOTE]
>If you've already signed in withÂ a different Azure Active Directory account than the one you want to use for Windows Virtual Desktop, you should either sign out or use a private browser window.

After signing in, you should now see a list of resources. You can launch resources by selecting them like you would a normal app in the **All Resources** tab.
