# Deploy a Windows 7 virtual machine on Windows Virtual Desktop

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/deploy-windows-7-virtual-machine.md).

The process to deploy a Windows 7 virtual machine (VM) on Windows Virtual Desktop is slightly different than for VMs running later versions of Windows. This guide will tell you how to deploy Windows 7.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, follow the instructions in [Create a host pool with PowerShell](create-host-pools-powershell.md) to create a host pool. If you're using the portal, follow the instructions in steps 1 through 9 of [Create a host pool using the Azure portal](create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md). After that, select **Review + Create** to create an empty host pool.

## Configure a Windows 7 virtual machine

Once you've done the prerequisites, you're ready to configure your Windows 7 VM for deployment on Windows Virtual Desktop.

To set up a Windows 7 VM on Windows Virtual Desktop:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and either search for the Windows 7 Enterprise image or upload your own customized Windows 7 Enterprise (x64) image.
2. Deploy one or multiple virtual machines with Windows 7 Enterprise as its host operating system. Make sure the virtual machines allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) (the TCP/3389 port).
3. Connect to the Windows 7 Enterprise host using the RDP and authenticate with the credentials you defined while configuring your deployment.
4. Add the account you used while connecting to the host with RDP to the "Remote Desktop User" group. If you don't add the account, you might not be able to connect to the VM after you join it to your Active Directory domain.
5. Go to Windows Update on your VM.
6. Install all Windows Updates in the Important category.
7. Install all Windows Updates in the Optional category (excluding language packs). This process installs the Remote Desktop Protocol 8.0 update ([KB2592687](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35387)) that you need to complete these instructions.
8. Open the Local Group Policy Editor and navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Remote Session Environment**.
9. Enable the Remote Desktop Protocol 8.0 policy.
10. Join this VM to your Active Directory domain.
11. Restart the virtual machine by running the following command:

     ```cmd
     shutdown /r /t 0
     ```

12. Follow the instructions [here](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization/new-azwvdregistrationinfo?view=azps-4.3.0) to get a registration token.

      - If you'd rather use the Azure portal, you can also go to the Overview page of the host pool you want to add the VM to and create a token there.

13. [Download the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent for Windows 7](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3JZCm).
14. [Download the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent Manager for Windows 7](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3K2e3).
15. Open the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent installer and follow the instructions. When prompted, give the registration key you created in step 12.
16. Open the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent Manager and follow the instructions.
17. Optionally, block the TCP/3389 port to remove direct Remote Desktop Protocol access to the VM.
18. Optionally, confirm that your .NET framework is at least version 4.7.2. Updating your framework is especially important if you're creating a custom image.

## Next steps

Your Windows Virtual Desktop deployment is now ready to use. [Download the latest version of the Windows Virtual Desktop client](https://aka.ms/wvd/clients/windows) to get started.
