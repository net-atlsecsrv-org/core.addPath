# What's new in Windows Virtual Desktop?

Windows Virtual Desktop updates on a regular basis. This article is where you'll find out about:

- The latest updates
- New features
- Improvements to existing features
- Bug fixes

This article is updated monthly. Make sure to check back here often to keep up with new updates.

## June 2020

Last month, we introduced Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager integration in preview. This update has lots of exciting new features we'd love to tell you about. Here's what's new for this version of Windows Virtual Desktop.

### Windows Virtual Desktop is now integrated with Azure Resource Manager (Preview)

Windows Virtual Desktop is now integrated into Azure Resource Manager. In the latest update, all Windows Virtual Desktop objects are now Azure Resource Manager resources. This update is also integrated with Azure role-based access controls (RBAC). See [What is Azure Resource Manager?](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) to learn more.

Here's what this change does for you:

- Windows Virtual Desktop is now integrated with the Azure portal. This means you can manage everything directly in the portal, no PowerShell, web apps, or third-party tools required. To get started, check out our tutorial at [Create a host pool with the Azure portal](create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md).

- Before this update, you could only publish RemoteApps and Desktops to individual users. With Azure Resource Manager, you can now publish resources to Azure Active Directory groups.

- The earlier version of Windows Virtual Desktop had four built-in admin roles that you could assign to a tenant or host pool. These roles are now in Azure [role-based access control](../role-based-access-control/overview.md). You can apply these roles to every Windows Virtual Desktop Azure Resource Manager object, which lets you have a full, rich delegation model.

- In this update, you no longer need to run Azure Marketplace or the GitHub template repeatedly to expand a host pool. All you need to expand a host pool is to go to your host pool in the Azure portal and select **+ Add** to deploy additional session hosts.

- Host pool deployment is now fully integrated with the [Azure Shared Image Gallery](../virtual-machines/windows/shared-image-galleries.md). Shared Image Gallery is a separate Azure service that stores virtual machine (VM) image definitions, including image versioning. You can also use global replication to copy and send your images to other Azure regions for local deployment.

- Monitoring functions that used to be done through PowerShell or the Diagnostics Service web app have now moved to Log Analytics in the Azure portal. You also now have two options to visualize your reports. You can run Kusto queries and use Workbooks to create visual reports.

- You're no longer required to complete Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) consent to use Windows Virtual Desktop. In this update, the Azure AD tenant on your Azure subscription authenticates your users and provides RBAC controls for your admins.


### PowerShell support

We've added new AzWvd cmdlets to the Azure PowerShell Az Module with this update. This new module is supported in PowerShell Core, which runs on .NET Core.

To install the module, follow the instructions in [Set up the PowerShell module for Windows Virtual Desktop](powershell-module.md).

You can also see a list of available commands at the [AzWvd PowerShell reference](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization/?view=azps-4.2.0#desktopvirtualization).

For more information about the new features, check out [our blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-virtual-desktop-spring-update-enters-public-preview/ba-p/1340245). 

### Additional gateways

We've added a new gateway cluster in South Africa to reduce connection latency.

### Microsoft Teams on Windows Virtual Desktop (Preview)

We've made some improvements to Microsoft Teams for Windows Virtual Desktop. Most importantly, Windows Virtual Desktop now supports audio and visual redirection for calls. Redirection improves latency by creating direct paths between users when they call using audio or video. Less distance means fewer hops, which makes calls look and sound smoother.
