## February 2021

Here's what changed in February 2021.

### Portal experience

We've improved the Azure portal experience in the following ways:

- Bulk drain mode on hosts in the session host grid tab. 
- MSIX app attach is now available for public preview.
- Fixed host pool overview info for dark mode.

### EU metadata storage now in public preview

We're now hosting a public preview of the Europe (EU) geography as a storage option for service metadata in Windows Virtual Desktop. Customers can choose between West or North Europe when they create their service objects. The service objects and metadata for the host pools will be stored in the Azure geography associated with each region. To learn more, read [our blog post announcing the public preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-virtual-desktop/announcing-public-preview-of-windows-virtual-desktop-service/m-p/2143939).

### Teams on Windows Virtual Desktop plugin updates

We've improved video call quality on the Windows Virtual Desktop plugin by addressing the most commonly reported issues, such as when the screen would suddenly go dark or the video and sound desynchronized. These improvements should increase the performance of single-video view with active speaker switching. We also fixed an issue where hardware devices with special characters weren't available in Teams.

## January 2021

Here's what changed in January 2021:

### New Windows Virtual Desktop offer

New customers save 30 percent on Windows Virtual Desktop computing costs for D-series and Bs-series virtual machines for up to 90 days when using the native Microsoft solution. You can redeem this offer in the Azure portal before March 31, 2021. Learn more at our [Windows Virtual Desktop offer page](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/offer/).

### networkSecurityGroupRules value change 

In the Azure Resource Manager nested template, we changed the default value for networkSecurityGroupRules from an object to an array. This will prevent any errors if you use managedDisks-customimagevm.json without specifying a value for networkSecurityGroupRules. This wasn't a breaking change and is backward compatible.

### FSLogix hotfix update

Weâ€™ve released FSLogix, version 2009 HF_01 (2.9.7654.46150) to solve issues in the previous release (2.9.7621.30127). We recommend you stop using the previous version and update FSLogix as soon as possible.

For more information, see the release notes in [What's new in FSLogix](/fslogix/whats-new#fslogix-apps-2009-hf_01-29765446150).

### Azure portal experience improvements

We've made the following improvements to the Azure portal experience:

- You can now add local VM admin credentials directly instead of having to add a local account created with the Active Directory domain join account credentials.
- Users can now list both individual and group assignments in separate tabs for individual users and groups.
- The version number of the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is now visible in the Virtual Machine overview for host pools.
- Added bulk delete for host pools and application groups.
- You can now enable or disable drain mode for multiple session hosts in a host pool.
- Removed the public IP field from the VM details page.

### Windows Virtual Desktop Agent troubleshooting

We recently set up the [Windows Virtual Desktop Agent troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot-agent.md) to help customers who have encountered common issues.

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration is now generally available. This feature gives your Windows Virtual Desktop VMs the same investigation experience as a local Windows 10 machine. If you're using Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will support up to 50 concurrent user connections, giving you the cost savings of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session and the confidence of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. For more information, check out our [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/windows-virtual-desktop-support-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2103712).

We've also introduced refreshed UI flows for improved user experiences. This update includes fluent design, light and dark modes, and many other exciting changes. We've also rewritten the client to use the same underlying remote desktop protocol (RDP) engine as the iOS, macOS, and Android clients. This lets us deliver new features at a faster rate across all platforms. [Download the client](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and give it a try!

- We fixed an issue in the Teams Desktop client (version 1.3.00.21759) where the client only showed the UTC time zone in the chat, channels, and calendar. The updated client now shows the remote session's time zone instead.

- Azure Advisor is now a part of Windows Virtual Desktop. When you access Windows Virtual Desktop through the Azure portal, you can see recommendations for optimizing your Windows Virtual Desktop environment. Learn more at [Azure Advisor](azure-advisor.md).

- Azure CLI now supports Windows Virtual Desktop (`az desktopvirtualization`) to help you automate your Windows Virtual Desktop deployments. Check out [desktopvirtualization](/cli/azure/ext/desktopvirtualization/) for a list of extension commands.

- We've updated our deployment templates to make them fully compatible with the Windows Virtual Desktop Azure Resource Manager interfaces. You can find the templates on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/ARM-wvd-templates).

- The Windows Virtual Desktop US Gov portal is now in public preview. To learn more, see [our announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/windows-virtual-desktop-is-now-available-in-the-azure-government-cloud-in-preview/).

## July 2020  

July was when Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Management integration became generally available.

Here's what changed with this new release: 

- The "Fall 2019 release" is now known as "Windows Virtual Desktop (Classic)," while the "Spring 2020 release" is now just "Windows Virtual Desktop." For more information, check out [this blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/new-windows-virtual-desktop-capabilities-now-generally-available/). 

To learn more about new features, check out [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-virtual-desktop-spring-update-enters-public-preview/ba-p/1340245). 

### Autoscaling tool update

The latest version of the autoscaling tool that was in preview is now generally available. This tool uses an Azure automation account and the Azure Logic App to automatically shut down and restart session host virtual machines (VMs) within a host pool, reducing infrastructure costs. Learn more at [Scale session hosts using Azure Automation](set-up-scaling-script.md).

### Azure portal

You can now do the following things with the Azure portal in Windows Virtual Desktop: 

- Directly assign users to personal desktop session hosts  
- Change the validation environment setting for host pools 

### Diagnostics

We've released some new prebuilt queries for the Log Analytics workspace. To access the queries, go to **Logs** and under **Category**, select **Windows Virtual Desktop**. Learn more at [Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature](diagnostics-log-analytics.md).

### Update for Remote Desktop client for Android

The client also integrates with Microsoft Authenticator on Android devices to enable conditional access when subscribing to Windows Virtual Desktop workspaces.  

The previous version of Remote Desktop client is now called â€œRemote Desktop 8." Any existing connections you have in the earlier version of the client will be transferred seamlessly to the new client. The new client has been rewritten to the same underlying RDP core engine as the iOS and macOS clients, faster release of new features across all platforms. 

### Teams update

We've made improvements to Microsoft Teams for Windows Virtual Desktop. Most importantly, Windows Virtual Desktop now supports audio and video optimization for the Windows Desktop client. Redirection improves latency by creating direct paths between users when they use audio or video in calls and meetings. Less distance means fewer hops, which makes calls look and sound smoother. Learn more at [Use Teams on Windows Virtual Desktop](teams-on-wvd.md).

## June 2020

Last month, we introduced Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager integration in preview. This update has lots of exciting new features we'd love to tell you about. Here's what's new for this version of Windows Virtual Desktop.

### Windows Virtual Desktop is now integrated with Azure Resource Manager

Windows Virtual Desktop is now integrated into Azure Resource Manager. In the latest update, all Windows Virtual Desktop objects are now Azure Resource Manager resources. This update is also integrated with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). See [What is Azure Resource Manager?](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) to learn more.

Here's what this change does for you:

- Windows Virtual Desktop is now integrated with the Azure portal. This means you can manage everything directly in the portal, no PowerShell, web apps, or third-party tools required. To get started, check out our tutorial at [Create a host pool with the Azure portal](create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md).

- Before this update, you could only publish RemoteApps and Desktops to individual users. With Azure Resource Manager, you can now publish resources to Azure Active Directory groups.

- The earlier version of Windows Virtual Desktop had four built-in admin roles that you could assign to a tenant or host pool. These roles are now in [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md). You can apply these roles to every Windows Virtual Desktop Azure Resource Manager object, which lets you have a full, rich delegation model.

- In this update, you no longer need to run Azure Marketplace or the GitHub template repeatedly to expand a host pool. All you need to expand a host pool is to go to your host pool in the Azure portal and select **+ Add** to deploy additional session hosts.

- Host pool deployment is now fully integrated with the [Azure Shared Image Gallery](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md). Shared Image Gallery is a separate Azure service that stores virtual machine (VM) image definitions, including image versioning. You can also use global replication to copy and send your images to other Azure regions for local deployment.

- Monitoring functions that used to be done through PowerShell or the Diagnostics Service web app have now moved to Log Analytics in the Azure portal. You also now have two options to visualize your reports. You can run Kusto queries and use Workbooks to create visual reports.

- You're no longer required to complete Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) consent to use Windows Virtual Desktop. In this update, the Azure AD tenant on your Azure subscription authenticates your users and provides Azure RBAC controls for your admins.

### PowerShell support

We've added new AzWvd cmdlets to the Azure PowerShell Az Module with this update. This new module is supported in PowerShell Core, which runs on .NET Core.

To install the module, follow the instructions in [Set up the PowerShell module for Windows Virtual Desktop](powershell-module.md).

You can also see a list of available commands at the [AzWvd PowerShell reference](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization/#desktopvirtualization).

For more information about the new features, check out [our blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-virtual-desktop-spring-update-enters-public-preview/ba-p/1340245).

### Additional gateways

We've added a new gateway cluster in South Africa to reduce connection latency.

### Microsoft Teams on Windows Virtual Desktop (Preview)

We've made some improvements to Microsoft Teams for Windows Virtual Desktop. Most importantly, Windows Virtual Desktop now supports audio and visual redirection for calls. Redirection improves latency by creating direct paths between users when they call using audio or video. Less distance means fewer hops, which makes calls look and sound smoother.

To learn more, see [our blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/windows-virtual-desktop-media-optimization-for-microsoft-teams-is-now-available-in-public-preview/).

## Next steps
