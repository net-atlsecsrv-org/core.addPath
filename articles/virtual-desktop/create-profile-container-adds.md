# Create an FSLogix profile container with Azure Files

This article will show you how to create an FSLogix profile container with Azure Files and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you've already set up an Azure AD DS instance. If you don't have one yet, follow the instructions in [Create a basic managed domain](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance.md) first, then return here.

## Add Azure AD DS admins

To add additional admins, you create a new user and grant them permissions.

To add an admin:

1. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the sidebar, then select **All users**, and then select **New user**.

2.  Enter the user details into the fields.

3. In the Azure Active Directory pane on the left side of the screen, select **Groups**.

4. Select the **AAD DC Administrators** group.

5. In the left pane, select **Members**, then select **Add members** in the main pane. This will show a list of all users available in Azure AD. Select the name of the user profile you just created.

## Set up an Azure Storage account

Now it's time to enable Azure AD DS authentication over Server Message Block (SMB). 

To enable authentication:

1. If you haven't already, set up and deploy a general-purpose v2 Azure Storage account by following the instructions in [Create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

2. Once you've finished setting up your account, select **Go to resource**.

3. Select **Configuration** from the pane on the left side of the screen, then enable **Azure Active Directory authentication for Azure Files** in the main pane. When you're done, select **Save**.

4. Select **Overview** in the pane on the left side of the screen, then select **Files** in the main pane.

5. Select **File share** and enter the **Name** and **Quota** into the fields that appear on the right side of the screen.

## Assign access permissions to an identity

Other users will need access permissions to access your file share. To do this, you'll need to assign each user a role with the appropriate access permissions.

To assign users access permissions:

1. From the Azure portal, open the file share you created in [Set up an Azure Storage account](#set-up-an-azure-storage-account).

2. Select **Access Control (IAM)**.

3. Select **Add a role assignment**.

4. In the **Add role assignment** tab, select the appropriate built-in role from the role list. You'll need to at least select **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor** for the account to get proper permissions.

5. For **Assign access to**, select **Azure Active Directory user, group, or service principal**.

6. Select a name or email address for the target Azure Active Directory identity.

7. Select **Save**.

## Get the Storage Account access key

Next, you'll need to get the access key for your Storage Account.

To get the Storage Account access key:

1. From the Azure portal sidebar, select **Storage accounts**.

2. From the list of storage accounts, select the account for which you enabled Azure AD DS and created the custom roles in steps above.

3. Under **Settings**, select **Access keys** and copy the key from **key1**.

4. Go to the **Virtual Machines** tab and locate any VM that will become part of your host pool.

5. Select the name of the virtual machine (VM) under **Virtual Machines (adVM)** and select **Connect**

    This will download an RDP file that will let you sign in to the VM with its own credentials.

6. When you've signed in to the VM, run a command prompt as an administrator.

7. Run the following command:

     ```cmd
     net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name> <storage-account-key> /user:Azure\<storage-account-name>
     ```

    - Replace `<desired-drive-letter>` with a drive letter of your choice (for example, `y:`).
    - Replace all instances of `<storage-account-name>` with the name of the storage account you specified earlier.
    - Replace `<share-name>` with the name of the share you created earlier.
    - Replace `<storage-account-key>` with the storage account key from Azure.

    For example:  
  
     ```cmd
     net use y: \\fsprofile.file.core.windows.net\share HDZQRoFP2BBmoYQ=(truncated)= /user:Azure\fsprofile)
     ```

8. Run the following command to grant the user full access to the Azure Files share.

     ```cmd
     icacls <mounted-drive-letter>: /grant <user-email>:(f)
     ```

    - Replace `<mounted-drive-letter>` with the letter of the drive you want the user to use.
    - Replace `<user-email>` with the UPN of the user who will use this profile to access the session host VMs.

    For example:
     
     ```cmd
     icacls y: /grant john.doe@contoso.com:(f)
     ```

## Create a profile container

Now that your profiles are ready to go, let's create a FSLogix profile container.

To configure a FSLogix profile container:

1. Sign in to the session host VM you configured at the beginning of this article, then [download and install the FSLogix agent](/fslogix/install-ht/).

2. Unzip the FSLogix agent file you downloaded and go to **x64** > **Releases**, then open **FSLogixAppsSetup.exe**.

3. Once the installer launches, select **I agree to the license terms and conditions.** If applicable, provide a new key.

4. Select **Install**.

5. Open **Drive C**, then go to **Program Files** > **FSLogix** > **Apps** to make sure the FSLogix agent was properly installed.

     >[!NOTE]
     > If there are multiple VMs in the host pool, you'll need to repeat steps 1 through 5 for each VM.

6. Run **Registry Editor** (RegEdit) as an administrator.

7. Navigate to **Computer** > **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** > **software** > **FSLogix**, right-click on **FSLogix**, select **New**, and then select **Key**.

8. Create a new key named **Profiles**.

9.  Right-click on **Profiles**, select **New**, and then select **DWORD (32-bit) Value.** Name the value **Enabled** and set the **Data** value to **1**.

    ![A screenshot of the Profiles key. The REG_DWORD file is highlighted and its Data value is set to 1.](media/dword-value.png)

10. Right-click on **Profiles**, select **New**, and then select **Multi-String Value**. Name the value **VHDLocations** and set enter the URI for the Azure Files share `\\fsprofile.file.core.windows.net\share` as the Data value.

    ![A screenshot of the Profiles key showing the VHDLocations file. Its Data value shows the URI for the Azure Files share.](media/multi-string-value.png)

## Assign users to a session host

Now you'll need to assign users to your session host.

To assign users:

1. Run Windows PowerShell as an administrator, then run the following cmdlet to sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop with PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module Microsoft.RdInfra.RdPowershell

   #Optional
   Install-Module Microsoft.RdInfra.RdPowershell

   $brokerurl = "https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com"

   Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl $brokerurl
   ```

   When prompted for credentials, enter the same user that was granted the TenantCreator, RDS Owner, or RDS Contributor role on the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant.

2. Run the following cmdlets to assign the user to the remote desktop group:

     ```powershell
     $tenant = "<your-wvd-tenant>"

     $pool1 = "<wvd-pool>"

     $appgroup = "Desktop Application Group"

     $user1 = "<user-principal>"

     Add-RdsAppGroupUser $tenant $pool1 $appgroup $user1
     ```

    Like the earlier cmdlets, make sure to replace `<your-wvd-tenant>`, `<wvd-pool>`, and `<user-principal>` with the relevant values.

    For example:

     ```powershell
     $pool1 = "contoso"
     
     $tenant = "contoso"
     
     $appgroup = "Desktop Application Group"
     
     $user1 = "jane.doe@contoso.com"
     
     Add-RdsAppGroupUser $tenant $pool1 $appgroup $user1
     ```

## Make sure your profile works

Now all you have to do is make sure the profile you created exists and works as intended.

To verify your profile:

1. Open a browser and go to [the Windows Virtual Desktop web client](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient).

2. Sign in with the user account assigned to the Remote Desktop group.

3. Once the user session has been established, open the Azure portal and sign in with an administrative account.

4. From the sidebar, select **Storage accounts**.

5. Select the storage account you configured as the file share for your session host pool and enabled with Azure AD DS.

6. Select the **Files** icon, then expand your share.

    If everything's set up correctly, you should see a **Directory** with a name that's formatted like this: `<user SID>-<username>`.
