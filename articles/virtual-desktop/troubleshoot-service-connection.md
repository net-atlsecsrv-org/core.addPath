# Windows Virtual Desktop service connections

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Windows Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/troubleshoot-service-connection-2019.md).

Use this article to resolve issues with Windows Virtual Desktop client connections.

## Provide feedback

You can give us feedback and discuss the Windows Virtual Desktop Service with the product team and other active community members at the [Windows Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop).

## User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A user can start Remote Desktop clients and is able to authenticate, however the user doesn't see any icons in the web discovery feed.

1. Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using this command line:

     ```powershell
     Get-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <userupn>
     ```

2. Confirm that the user is signing in with the correct credentials.

3. If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issues.

4. If the user is part of an Azure Active Directory (AD) user group, make sure the user group is a security group instead of a distribution group. Windows Virtual Desktop doesn't support Azure AD distribution groups.

## User loses existing feed and no remote resource is displayed (no feed)

This error usually appears after a user moved their subscription from one Azure AD tenant to another. As a result, the service loses track of their user assignments, since those are still tied to the old Azure AD tenant.

To resolve this, all you need to do is reassign the users to their app groups.
