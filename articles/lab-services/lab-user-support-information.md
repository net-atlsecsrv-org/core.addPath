# View support information (lab user in Azure Lab Services)
This article explains how you (as a lab user) can view the following support information:

You can use this information to get help when you run into any technical issues while using a lab in a lab account.

 
## View support information
1. Sign in to [Azure Lab Services portal](https://labs.azure.com).
2. Select the **lab or virtual machine** for which you need help, and select **?** at the top-right corner of the page. 
3. Confirm that you see links to the **view support website**, **email support**, and **support phone number**.
