# Specify Marketplace images available to lab creators
As a lab account owner, you can specify the Marketplace images that lab creators can use to create labs in the lab account. 

## Select images available for labs
Select **Marketplace images** on the menu to the left. By default, you see the full list of images (both enabled and disabled). You can filter the list to see only enabled/disabled images by selecting the **Enabled only**/**Disabled only** option from the drop-down list at the top.

The Marketplace images that are displayed in the list are only the ones that satisfy the following conditions:
    
- Creates a single VM.
- Uses Azure Resource Manager to provision VMs
- Doesn't require purchasing an extra licensing plan

## Disable images for a lab 
To disable a single image for a lab, select **... (ellipsis)** in the last column, and select **Disable image**.

Alternatively, you select the checkbox before the image name, and select **Disable selected images** on the toolbar. 

To disable multiple images at the same time, select checkboxes before the image names, and select **Disable selected images** on the toolbar.

## Enable images for a lab
To enable a disabled image, select **... (ellipsis)** in the last column, and select **Enable image**. Alternatively, you select the checkbox before the image name, and select **Enable selected images** on the toolbar. 

To disable multiple images at the same time, select checkboxes before the image names, and select **Enable selected images** on the toolbar. 

## Enable images at the time of lab creation
You can enable more images at the time lab creation: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com) using **lab account owner** credentials
2. Select the default virtual machine image or the down arrow. 
3. Select **Enable more image options**.
