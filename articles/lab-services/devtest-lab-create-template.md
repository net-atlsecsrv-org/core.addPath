# Create a custom image from a VHD file

[!INCLUDE [devtest-lab-create-custom-image-from-vhd-selector](../../includes/devtest-lab-create-custom-image-from-vhd-selector.md)]

[!INCLUDE [devtest-lab-custom-image-definition](../../includes/devtest-lab-custom-image-definition.md)]

## Step-by-step instructions

The following steps walk you through creating a custom image from a VHD file using the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).

1. Select **All services**, and then select **DevTest Labs** from the list.

1. From the list of labs, select the desired lab.  

1. On the lab's main pane, select **Configuration and policies**. 

1. On the **Configuration and policies** pane, select **Custom images**.

1. On the **Custom images** pane, select **+Add**.

1. Enter the name of the custom image. This name is displayed in the list of base images when creating a VM.

1. Enter the description of the custom image. This description is displayed in the list of base images when creating a VM.

1. For **OS type**, select either **Windows** or **Linux**.

    - If you select **Windows**, specify via the checkbox whether *sysprep* has been run on the machine. 
    - If you select **Linux**, specify via the checkbox whether *deprovision* has been run on the machine. 

1. Select a **VHD** from the drop-down menu. This is the VHD that will be used to create the new custom image. If necessary, select to **Upload a VHD using PowerShell**.

1. You can also enter a plan name, plan offer, and plan publisher if the image used to create the custom image is not a licensed image (published by Microsoft).

   - **Plan name:** Enter the name of the Marketplace image (SKU) from which this custom image is created 
   - **Plan offer:** Enter the product (offer) of the Marketplace image from which this custom image is created 
   - **Plan publisher:** Enter the publisher of the Marketplace image from which this custom image is created

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the image you are using to create a custom image is **not** a licensed image, then these fields are empty and can be filled in if you choose. If the image **is** a licensed image, then the fields are auto populated with the plan information. If you try to change them in this case, a warning message is displayed.
   >
   >

1. Select **OK** to create the custom image.

After a few minutes, the custom image is created and is stored inside the labâ€™s storage account. When a lab user wants to create a new VM, the image is available in the list of base images.
