# Connect to your virtual machines through a browser 

DevTest Labs integrates with [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/), which enables you to connect to your virtual machines through a browser. For information on how to enable this feature in DevTest Labs, see [Enable browser connection on lab virtual machines](enable-browser-connection-lab-virtual-machines.md).

Once the *Browser connect* is enabled, lab users can access virtual machines through a browser.  

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling browser connection on lab virtual machines is in preview.

## Create a lab virtual machine

You first need to create the lab virtual machine within a VNet that has Bastion configured on it. You can select a VNet during virtual machine creation by going to the **Advanced settings** tab.

## Launch virtual machine in a browser

Once the virtual machine is created, you can launch it in a browser by clicking the *Browser connect* button and entering your username and password for the machine.
