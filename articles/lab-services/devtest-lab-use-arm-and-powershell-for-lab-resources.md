# Create or modify labs automatically using Azure Resource Manager templates and PowerShell

DevTest Labs provides many Azure Resource Manager templates and PowerShell scripts that can help you quickly and automatically create new labs or modify existing labs and then deploy these resources.

This article helps guide you through the process of using these templates and scripts to automate the creation, modification, and deployment of your labs. This article also shows you where you can find more information about how to use PowerShell to perform some common tasks in DevTest Labs.

## Step 1: Gather your templates and scripts
You can find pre-made [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/samples/DevTestLabs/QuickStartTemplates) and [PowerShell scripts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/samples/DevTestLabs/Scripts) at our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab). Use them as-is, or customize them for your needs and store them in your own [private Git repo](devtest-lab-add-artifact-repo.md).

## Step 2: Modify your Azure Resource Manager template
You can follow the steps at [Create your first Azure Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template) if you have never created a template before.

In addition, [Best practices for creating Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-template-best-practices) offers many guidelines and suggestions to help you create Azure Resource Manager templates that are reliable and easy to use. Typically, you will use a variation of one of the approaches or examples provided and modify your template for your needs.

## Step 3: Deploy resources with PowerShell
After you have customized your templates and scripts, follow the steps necessary to [deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy). The article provides general information about using Azure PowerShell with Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy your resources to Azure.
