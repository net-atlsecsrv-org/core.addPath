# Create a custom image from a VM

[!INCLUDE [devtest-lab-custom-image-definition](../../includes/devtest-lab-custom-image-definition.md)]

## Step-by-step instructions

You can create a custom image from a provisioned VM, and afterwards use that custom image to create identical VMs. The following steps illustrate how to create a custom image from a VM:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).

1. Select **All services**, and then select **DevTest Labs** from the list.

1. From the list of labs, select the desired lab.  

1. On the lab's main pane, select **My virtual machines**.
 
1. On the **My virtual machines** pane, select the VM from which you want to create the custom image.

1. On the VM's management pane, select **Create custom image (VHD)**.

1. On the **Custom image** pane, enter a name and description for your custom image. This information is displayed in the list of bases when you create a VM. The custom image will include the OS disk and all the data disks attached to the virtual machine.

1. Select whether sysprep was run on the VM. If the sysprep was not run on the VM, specify whether you want sysprep to be run on the VM when the custom image is created.

1. Select **OK** when finished to create the custom image.

After a few minutes, the custom image is created and is stored inside the labâ€™s storage account. When a lab user wants to create a new VM, the image is available in the list of base images.
