> * Add a user to the Lab Creator role

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Create a lab account
The following steps illustrate how to use the Azure portal to create a lab account with Azure Lab Services. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All Services** on the left menu. Select **DevOps** from **Categories**. Then, select **Lab Services**. If you select star (`*`) next to **Lab Services**, it's added to the **FAVORITES** section on the left menu. From the next time onwards, you select **Lab Services** under **FAVORITES**.

## Add a user to the Lab Creator role
To set up a classroom lab in a lab account, the user must be a member of the **Lab Creator** role in the lab account. To provide educators the permission to create labs for their classes, add them to the **Lab Creator** role:

> [!NOTE]
> The account you used to create the lab account is automatically added to this role. If you are planning to use the same user account to create a classroom lab in this tutorial, skip this step. 

1. On the **Lab Account** page, select **Access control (IAM)**, select **+ Add** on the toolbar, and then select **+ Add role assignment** on the toolbar. 

    ![Access Control -> Add Role Assignment button](./media/tutorial-setup-lab-account/add-role-assignment-button.png)
1. On the **Add role assignment** page, select **Lab Creator** for **Role**, select the user you want to add to the Lab Creators role, and select **Save**.
