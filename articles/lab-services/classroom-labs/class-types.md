# Class types overview - Azure Lab Services

Azure Lab Services enables you to quickly set up classroom lab environments in the cloud. Articles in this section provide guidance on how to set up several types of classroom labs using Azure Lab Services.

## Deep learning in natural language processing

You can set up a lab focused on deep learning in natural language processing (NLP) using Azure Lab Services. Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers with translation, speech recognition, and other language understanding capabilities. Students taking an NLP class get a Linux virtual machine (VM) to learn how to apply neural network algorithms to develop deep learning models that are used for analyzing written human language.

For detailed information on how to set up this type of a lab, see [Set up a lab focused on deep learning in natural language processing using Azure Lab Services](class-type-deep-learning-natural-processing.md).

## Shell scripting on Linux

You can set up a lab to teach shell scripting on Linux. Scripting is a useful part of system administration that allows administrators to avoid repetitive tasks. In this sample scenario, the class covers traditional bash scripts and enhanced scripts. Enhanced scripts are scripts that combine bash commands and Ruby. This approach allows Ruby to pass data around and bash commands to interact with the shell.

Students taking these scripting classes get a Linux virtual machine to learn the basics of Linux, and also get familiar with the bash shell scripting. The Linux virtual machine comes with remote desktop access enabled and with [gedit](https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editors installed.

For detailed information on how to set up this type of a lab, see [Shell scripting on Linux](class-type-shell-scripting-linux.md).

## Ethical hacking

You can set up a lab for a class that focuses on forensics side of ethical hacking. Penetration testing, a practice used by the ethical hacking community, occurs when someone attempts to gain access to the system or network to demonstrate vulnerabilities that a malicious attacker may exploit.

In an ethical hacking class, students can learn modern techniques for defending against vulnerabilities. Each student gets a Windows Server host virtual machine that has two nested virtual machines â€“ one virtual machine with [Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) image and another machine with [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) image. The Metasploitable virtual machine is used for exploiting purposes.  The Kali Linux virtual machine provides access to the tools needed to execute forensic tasks.
