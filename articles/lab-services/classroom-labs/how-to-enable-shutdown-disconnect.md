# Enable automatic shutdown of VMs on disconnect
This article shows you how you can enable or disable automatic shutdown of **Windows 10** lab VMs (template or student) after a remote desktop connection is disconnected. You can also specify how long the VMs should wait for the user to reconnect before automatically shutting down.

A lab account administrator can configure this setting for the lab account in which you create labs. For more information, see [Configure automatic shutdown of VMs on disconnect for a lab account](how-to-configure-lab-accounts.md#automatic-shutdown-of-vms-on-disconnect). As a lab owner, you can override the setting when creating a lab or after the lab is created. 

## Configure when creating a lab
On the step 3 page of lab creation wizard, you can enable or disable this feature and also specify how long the VM should wait for the user to reconnect before automatically shutting down.
