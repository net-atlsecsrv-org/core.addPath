# Tutorial: Track usage of a lab in Azure Lab Service
This tutorial shows you how a lab creator/owner can track usage of a lab.

In this tutorial, you do the following actions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * View users registered with your lab
> * View the usage of VMs in the lab
> * Manage student VMs 


## View users registered with the lab

1. Navigate to [Azure Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com). 
2. Select **Sign in** and enter your credentials. Azure Lab Services supports organizational accounts and Microsoft accounts.
3. On the **My labs** page, select the lab for which you want to track the usage. 
4. Select **Users** on the left menu or **Users** tile. You see students who have registered with your lab. Select **Registration link**, copy the link, and send it any new student who hasn't registered with your lab yet.

## View the usage of VMs in the lab 

1. Select **Virtual machines** on menu to the left. 
2. Confirm that you see the status of VMs and the number of hours the VMs have been running. The time that a lab owner spends on a student VM doesn't count against the usage time shown in the last column.

## Manage student VMs 
On this page, you can start, stop, or reset student VMs by using either drop-down list in the **Status** column or buttons on the toolbar.

You can also use toolbar buttons to start, stop, or delete a VM.
