# Set up a lab to teach database management for relational databases

This article describes how to set up a lab for a basic databases management class in Azure Lab Services. Databases concepts are one of the introductory courses taught in most of the Computer Science departments in college. Structured Query Language (SQL) is an international standard. SQL is the standard language for relation database management including adding, accessing, and managing content in a database.  It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease, and flexibility of use.

In this article, we'll show how to set up a virtual machine template in a lab with both MySQL Database Server and SQL Server 2019 server.  [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).  [SQL Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2019) is the latest version of Microsoft’s RDBMS.

## Lab configuration

To set up this lab, you need an Azure subscription and lab account to get started. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin. Once you get an Azure subscription, you can create a new lab account in Azure Lab Services. For more information about creating a new lab account, see [Tutorial to Setup a Lab Account](tutorial-setup-lab-account.md).  You can also use an existing lab account.

### Lab account settings

Enable the settings described in the table below for the lab account. For more information about how to enable marketplace images, see [Specify Marketplace images available to lab creators](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lab-services/classroom-labs/tutorial-setup-lab-account#specify-marketplace-images-available-to-lab-creators).

| Lab account setting | Instructions |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
|Marketplace image| Enable the ‘SQL Server 2019 Standard on Windows Server 2019’ image for use within your lab account.|

### Lab settings

Use the settings in the table below when setting up a classroom lab.  For more information how to create a classroom lab, see [set up a classroom lab tutorial](tutorial-setup-classroom-lab.md).

| Lab settings | Value/instructions |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
|Virtual Machine Size| Medium. This size is best suited for relational databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.|
|Virtual Machine Image| SQL Server 2019 Standard on Windows Server 2019|

## Template machine configuration

To install MySQL on Windows Server 2019, you can follow the steps mentioned in [Install and Run MySQL Community Server on a Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/windows/classic/mysql-2008r2?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Fwindows%2Fclassic%2Ftoc.json#install-and-run-mysql-community-server-on-the-virtual-machine).

SQL Server 2019 is pre-installed in the virtual machine image we chose when creating the new lab.

## Cost estimate

Let's cover a possible cost estimate for this class.  We'll use a class of 25 students.  There are 20 hours of scheduled class time.  Also, each student gets 10 hours quota for homework or assignments outside scheduled class time.  The virtual machine size we chose was medium, which is 42 lab units.

Here is an example of a possible cost estimate for this class:

25 students \* (20 scheduled hours + 10 quota hours) \* 0.42 USD per hour  = 315.00 USD

Further more details on pricing, see [Azure Lab Services Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/lab-services/).

## Conclusion

This article walked you through the steps necessary to create a lab for basic database management concepts using both MySQL and SQL Server. You can use a similar setup for other databases classes.
