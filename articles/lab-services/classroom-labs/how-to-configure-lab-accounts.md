# Configure lab accounts in Azure Lab Services 
In Azure Lab Services, a lab account is a container for managed lab types such as classroom labs. An administrator sets up a lab account with Azure Lab Services and provides access to lab owners who can create labs in the account. This article describes how to create a lab account, view all lab accounts, or delete a lab account.

## Connect with a peer virtual network
To connect a virtual network as a peer network to the lab's virtual network, follow these steps:

1. On the **Lab Account** page, select **Labs configuration** on the left menu.

    ![Labs Configuration page](../media/how-to-manage-lab-accounts/labs-configuration-page.png) 
1. For **Peer virtual network**, select **Enabled** or **Disabled**. The default value is **Disabled**. To enable the peer virtual network, do the following steps: 
    1. Select **Enabled**.
    2. Select the **VNet** from the drop-down list. 
3. Select **Save** on the toolbar. 

Labs created in this account are connected to the selected virtual network. They can access to the resources in the selected virtual network. For more information, see [Connect your lab's network with a peer virtual network in Azure Lab Services](how-to-connect-peer-virtual-network.md).

When you select a virtual network for the **Peer virtual network** field, the **Allow lab creator to pick lab location** option is disabled. It's because labs in the lab account must be in the same region as the lab account for them to connect with resources in the peer virtual network. 

## Allow lab creator to pick location for the lab
You can allow lab creator to create labs in a different location than the location of the lab account by following these steps: 

1. On the **Lab Account** page, select **Labs configuration** on the left menu.
2. For the **Allow lab creator to pick lab location**, select **Enabled** if you want the lab creator to be able to select a location for the lab. If it's disabled, the labs are automatically created in the same location in which the lab account exists. 
    
    This field is disabled when you select a virtual network for the **Peer virtual network** field. It's because labs in the lab account must be in the same region as the lab account for them to access resources in the peer virtual network. 
1. Select **Save** on the toolbar.

## Specify an address range for VMs in the lab
The following procedure has steps to specify an address range for VMs in the lab. If you update the range that you previously specified, the modified address range applies only to VMs that are created after the change was made. 

Here are some restrictions when specifying the address range that you should keep in mind. 

- The prefix must be smaller than or equal to 23. 
- If a virtual network is peered to the lab account, the provided address range cannot overlap with address range from peered virtual network.

1. On the **Lab Account** page, select **Labs configuration** on the left menu.
2. For the **Address range** field, specify the address range for VMs that will be created in the lab. The address range should be in the classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation (example: 10.20.0.0/23). Virtual machines in the lab will be created in this address range.
3. Select **Save** on the toolbar.

## Add a user to the Lab Creator role
To set up a classroom lab in a lab account, the user must be a member of the **Lab Creator** role in the lab account. The account you used to create the lab account is automatically added to this role. If you are planning to use the same user account to create a classroom lab, you can skip this step. To use another user account to create a classroom lab, do the following steps: 

To provide educators the permission to create labs for their classes, add them to the **Lab Creator** role:

1. On the **Lab Account** page, select **Access control (IAM)**, and click **+ Add role assignment** on the toolbar. 

    ![Access Control -> Add Role Assignment button](../media/tutorial-setup-lab-account/add-role-assignment-button.png)
1. On the **Add role assignment** page, select **Lab Creator** for **Role**, select the user you want to add to the Lab Creators role, and select **Save**. 

    ![Add lab creator](../media/tutorial-setup-lab-account/add-lab-creator.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are adding a non-Microsoft account user as a lab creator, see the [Add a non-Microsoft account user as a lab creator](#add-a-non-microsoft-account-user-as-a-lab-creator) section. 

## Specify Marketplace images available to lab creators
As a lab account owner, you can specify the Marketplace images that lab creators can use to create labs in the lab account. 

1. Select **Marketplace images** on the menu to the left. By default, you see the full list of images (both enabled and disabled). You can filter the list to see only enabled/disabled images by selecting the **Enabled only**/**Disabled only** option from the drop-down list at the top. 
    
    ![Marketplace images page](../media/tutorial-setup-lab-account/marketplace-images-page.png)

    The Marketplace images that are displayed in the list are only the ones that satisfy the following conditions:
        
    - Creates a single VM.
    - Uses Azure Resource Manager to provision VMs
    - Doesn't require purchasing an extra licensing plan
2. To **disable** a Marketplace image that has been enabled, do one of the following actions: 
    1. Select **... (ellipsis)** in the last column, and select **Disable image**. 

        ![Disable one image](../media/tutorial-setup-lab-account/disable-one-image.png) 
    2. Select one or more images from the list by selecting the checkboxes before the image names in the list, and select **Disable selected images**. 

        ![Disable multiple images](../media/tutorial-setup-lab-account/disable-multiple-images.png) 
1. Similarly, to **enable** a Marketplace image, do one of the following actions: 
    1. Select **... (ellipsis)** in the last column, and select **Enable image**. 
    2. Select one or more images from the list by selecting the checkboxes before the image names in the list, and select **Enable selected images**. 

## Add a non-Microsoft account user as a lab creator
To add a user as a lab creator, you use their email accounts. The following types of email accounts might be used:

- An email account that's provided by your university’s Office 365 Azure Active Directory (AAD). 
- A Microsoft email account, such as `@outlook.com`, `@hotmail.com`, `@msn.com`, or `@live.com`.
- A non-Microsoft email account, such as one provided by Yahoo or Google. However, these types of accounts must be linked with a Microsoft account.
- A GitHub account. This account must be linked with a Microsoft account.

### Using a non-Microsoft email account
Lab creators/instructors can use non-Microsoft email accounts to register and sign in to a classroom lab.  However, the sign-in to the Lab Services portal requires that instructors first create a Microsoft account that's linked to their non-Microsoft email address.

Many instructors might already have a Microsoft account linked to their non-Microsoft email addresses. For example, instructors already have a Microsoft account if they have used their email address with Microsoft’s other products or services, such as Office, Skype, OneDrive, or Windows.  

When instructors sign in to the Lab Services portal, they are prompted for their email address and password. If the instructor attempts to sign in with a non-Microsoft account that does not have a Microsoft account linked, the instructor will receive the following error message: 

![Error message](../media/how-to-configure-student-usage/cant-find-account.png)

To sign up for a Microsoft account, instructors should go to [http://signup.live.com](http://signup.live.com).  


### Using a GitHub Account
Instructors can also use an existing GitHub account to register and sign in to a classroom lab. If the instructor already has a Microsoft account linked to their GitHub account, then they can sign in and provide their password as shown in the previous section. If they have not yet linked their GitHub account to a Microsoft account, they should select **Sign-in options**:

![Sign-in options link](../media/how-to-configure-student-usage/signin-options.png)

On the **Sign-in options** page, select **Sign in with GitHub**.

![Sign in with GitHub link](../media/how-to-configure-student-usage/signin-github.png)

Finally, they are prompted to create a Microsoft account that's linked to their GitHub account. It happens automatically when the instructor selects **Next**.  The instructor is then immediately signed in and connected to the classroom lab.

## Automatic shutdown of VMs on disconnect
You can enable or disable automatic shutdown of Windows lab VMs (template or student) after a remote desktop connection is disconnected. You can also specify how long the VMs should wait for the user to reconnect before automatically shutting down.

![Automatic shutdown setting at lab account](../media/how-to-configure-lab-accounts/automatic-shutdown-vm-disconnect.png)

This setting applies to all the labs created in the lab account. A lab owner can override this setting at the lab level. The change to this setting at the lab account will only affect labs that are created after the change is made.

To learn about how a lab owner can configure this setting at the lab level, see [this article](how-to-enable-shutdown-disconnect.md)
