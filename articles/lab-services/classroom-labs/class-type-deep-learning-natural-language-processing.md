# Set up a lab focused on deep learning in natural language processing using Azure Lab Services
This article shows you how to set up a lab focused on deep learning in natural language processing (NLP) using Azure Lab Services. Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers with translation, speech recognition, and other language understanding capabilities.  

Students taking an NLP class get a Linux virtual machine (VM) to learn how to apply neural network algorithms to develop deep learning models that are used for analyzing written human language. 

## Lab configuration
To set up this lab, you need an Azure subscription to get started. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin. Once you have an Azure subscription, you can either create a new lab account in Azure Lab Services or use an existing lab account. See the following tutorial for creating a new lab account: [Tutorial to Setup a Lab Account](tutorial-setup-lab-account.md).
 
After you create the lab account, enable following settings in the lab account: 

| Lab account setting | Instructions |
| ----------- | ------------ |  
| Marketplace images | Enable the Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu) image for use within your lab account.  See the following article for instructions: [Specify marketplace images available to lab creators](specify-marketplace-images.md). | 

Follow [this tutorial](tutorial-setup-classroom-lab.md) to create a new lab and apply the following settings:

| Lab settings | Value/instructions | 
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Virtual machine (VM) size | Small GPU (Compute). This size is best suited for compute-intensive and network-intensive applications like Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. |
| VM image | [Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu)](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.ubuntu-1804). This image provides deep learning frameworks and tools for machine learning and data science. To view the full list of installed tools on this image, see the following article: [Whatâ€™s included on the DSVM?](../../machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview.md#whats-included-on-the-dsvm). |
| Enable remote desktop connection | <p>Enabling this setting will allow teachers and students to connect to their Virtual Machines (VM) using Remote Desktop (RDP).</p><p>**Important**: Enabling this setting only opens the **RDP** port on Linux machines. If RDP is already installed and configured on the virtual machine image, you/students can connect to VMs via RDP without following any additional steps. <p>If the VM image doesn't have RDP installed and configured, you need to connect to the Linux machine using SSH for the first time, and install RDP and GUI packages so that you/students can connect to the Linux machine using RDP later. For more information, see [Install and configure Remote Desktop to connect to a Linux VM in Azure](../../virtual-machines/linux/use-remote-desktop.md). Then, you publish the image so that students can RDP in to the student Linux VMs.  |

The Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux image provides the necessary deep learning frameworks and tools required for this type of class. As a result, after the template machine creation, you don't need to customize it further. It can be published for students to use. Select the **Publish** button on template page to publish the template to the lab.  

## Cost
If you would like to estimate the cost of this lab, you can use the following example: 

For a class of 25 students with 20 hours of scheduled class time and 10 hours of quota for homework or assignments, the price for the lab would be - 
25 students * (20 + 10) hours * 139 Lab Units * 0.01 USD per hour = 1042.5 USD

Further more details on pricing, see [Azure Lab Services Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/lab-services/).

## Conclusion
This article walked you through the steps to create a lab for natural language processing class. You can use a similar setup for other deep learning classes.
