# Use Java to send events to or receive events from Azure Event Hubs (azure-messaging-eventhubs)

This quickstart shows how to send events to and receive events from an event hub using the **azure-messaging-eventhubs** Java package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This quickstart uses the new **azure-messaging-eventhubs** package. For a quickstart that uses the old **azure-eventhubs** and **azure-eventhubs-eph** packages, see [Send and receive events using azure-eventhubs and azure-eventhubs-eph](event-hubs-java-get-started-send-legacy.md).


## Prerequisites

If you're new to Azure Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) before you do this quickstart.

To complete this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

- **Microsoft Azure subscription**. To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you need a subscription.  If you don't have an existing Azure account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- A Java development environment. This quickstart uses [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above is required.
- **Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub**. The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md). Then, get the **connection string for the Event Hubs namespace** by following instructions from the article: [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). You use the connection string later in this quickstart.

## Send events

This section shows you how to create a Java application to send events an event hub.

### Add reference to Azure Event Hubs library

The Java client library for Event Hubs is available in the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:azure-messaging-eventhubs). You can reference this library using the following dependency declaration inside your Maven project file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventhubs</artifactId>
    <version>5.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Update the version to the latest version published to the Maven repository.

### Write code to send messages to the event hub

For the following sample, first create a new Maven project for a console/shell application in your favorite Java development environment. Add a class named `Sender`, and add the following code to the class:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update `<Event Hubs namespace connection string>` with the connection string to your Event Hubs namespace. Update `<Event hub name>` with the name of your event hub in the namespace.

```java
import com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.*;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Sender {
    private static final String connectionString = "<Event Hubs namespace connection string>";
    private static final String eventHubName = "<Event hub name>";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        publishEvents();
    }
}
```

### Add code to publish events to the event hub

Add a method named `publishEvents` to the `Sender` class:

```java
    /**
     * Code sample for publishing events.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the EventData is bigger than the max batch size.
     */
    public static void publishEvents() {
        // create a producer client
        EventHubProducerClient producer = new EventHubClientBuilder()
            .connectionString(connectionString, eventHubName)
            .buildProducerClient();

        // sample events in an array
        List<EventData> allEvents = Arrays.asList(new EventData("Foo"), new EventData("Bar"));

        // create a batch
        EventDataBatch eventDataBatch = producer.createBatch();

        for (EventData eventData : allEvents) {
            // try to add the event from the array to the batch
            if (!eventDataBatch.tryAdd(eventData)) {
                // if the batch is full, send it and then create a new batch
                producer.send(eventDataBatch);
                eventDataBatch = producer.createBatch();

                // Try to add that event that couldn't fit before.
                if (!eventDataBatch.tryAdd(eventData)) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Event is too large for an empty batch. Max size: "
                        + eventDataBatch.getMaxSizeInBytes());
                }
            }
        }
        // send the last batch of remaining events
        if (eventDataBatch.getCount() > 0) {
            producer.send(eventDataBatch);
        }
        producer.close();
    }
```

Build the program, and ensure that there are no errors. You'll run this program after you run the receiver program.

## Receive events

The code in this tutorial is based on the [EventProcessorClient sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/eventhubs/azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob/src/samples/java/com/azure/messaging/eventhubs/checkpointstore/blob/EventProcessorBlobCheckpointStoreSample.java), which you can examine to see the full working application.

> [!WARNING]
> If you run this code on Azure Stack Hub, you will experience runtime errors unless you target a specific Storage API version. That's because the Event Hubs SDK uses the latest available Azure Storage API available in  Azure that may not be available on your Azure Stack Hub platform. Azure Stack Hub may support a different version of Azure Blob Storage SDK than those typically available on Azure. If you are using Azure Blob Storage as a checkpoint store, check the [supported Azure Storage API version for your Azure Stack Hub build](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-acs-differences?#api-version) and target that version in your code.
>
> For example, If you are running on Azure Stack Hub version 2005, the highest available version for the Storage service is version 2019-02-02. By default, the Event Hubs SDK client library uses the highest available version on Azure (2019-07-07 at the time of the release of the SDK). In this case, besides following steps in this section, you will also need to add code to target the Storage service API version 2019-02-02. For an example on how to target a specific Storage API version, see [this sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/eventhubs/azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob/src/samples/java/com/azure/messaging/eventhubs/checkpointstore/blob/EventProcessorWithCustomStorageVersion.java).


### Create an Azure Storage and a blob container

In this quickstart, you use Azure Storage (specifically, Blob Storage) as the checkpoint store. Checkpointing is a process by which an event processor marks or commits the position of the last successfully processed event within a partition. Marking a checkpoint is typically done within the function that processes the events. To learn more about checkpointing, see [Event processor](event-processor-balance-partition-load.md).

Follow these steps to create an Azure Storage account.

1. [Create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal)
2. [Create a blob container](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md#create-a-container)
3. [Get the connection string to the storage account](../storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string.md)

    Note down the **connection string** and the **container name**. You'll use them in the receive code.

### Add Event Hubs libraries to your Java project

Add the following dependencies in the pom.xml file.

- [azure-messaging-eventhubs](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:azure-messaging-eventhubs)
- [azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob)

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
        <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventhubs</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
        <artifactId>azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob</artifactId>
        <version>1.6.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

1. Add the following **import** statements at the top of the Java file.

    ```java
    import com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.*;
    import com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.checkpointstore.blob.BlobCheckpointStore;
    import com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.models.*;
    import com.azure.storage.blob.*;
    import java.util.function.Consumer;
    ```
2. Create a class named `Receiver`, and add the following string variables to the class. Replace the placeholders with the correct values.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Replace the placeholders with the correct values.
    > - `<Event Hubs namespace connection string>` with the connection string to your Event Hubs namespace. Update
    > - `<Event hub name>` with the name of your event hub in the namespace.
    > - `<Storage connection string>` with the connection string to your Azure storage account.
    > - `<Storage container name>` with the name of your container in your Azure Blob storage.

    ```java
    private static final String connectionString = "<Event Hubs namespace connection string>";
    private static final String eventHubName = "<Event hub name>";
    private static final String storageConnectionString = "<Storage connection string>";
    private static final String storageContainerName = "<Storage container name>";
    ```
3. Add the following `main` method to the class.

    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a blob container client that you use later to build an event processor client to receive and process events
        BlobContainerAsyncClient blobContainerAsyncClient = new BlobContainerClientBuilder()
            .connectionString(storageConnectionString)
            .containerName(storageContainerName)
            .buildAsyncClient();

        // Create a builder object that you will use later to build an event processor client to receive and process events and errors.
        EventProcessorClientBuilder eventProcessorClientBuilder = new EventProcessorClientBuilder()
            .connectionString(connectionString, eventHubName)
            .consumerGroup(EventHubClientBuilder.DEFAULT_CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME)
            .processEvent(PARTITION_PROCESSOR)
            .processError(ERROR_HANDLER)
            .checkpointStore(new BlobCheckpointStore(blobContainerAsyncClient));

        // Use the builder object to create an event processor client
        EventProcessorClient eventProcessorClient = eventProcessorClientBuilder.buildEventProcessorClient();

        System.out.println("Starting event processor");
        eventProcessorClient.start();

        System.out.println("Press enter to stop.");
        System.in.read();

        System.out.println("Stopping event processor");
        eventProcessorClient.stop();
        System.out.println("Event processor stopped.");

        System.out.println("Exiting process");
    }
    ```
4. Add the two helper methods (`PARTITION_PROCESSOR` and `ERROR_HANDLER`) that process events and errors to the `Receiver` class.

    ```java
    public static final Consumer<EventContext> PARTITION_PROCESSOR = eventContext -> {
        PartitionContext partitionContext = eventContext.getPartitionContext();
        EventData eventData = eventContext.getEventData();

        System.out.printf("Processing event from partition %s with sequence number %d with body: %s%n",
            partitionContext.getPartitionId(), eventData.getSequenceNumber(), eventData.getBodyAsString());

        // Every 10 events received, it will update the checkpoint stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        if (eventData.getSequenceNumber() % 10 == 0) {
            eventContext.updateCheckpoint();
        }
    };

    public static final Consumer<ErrorContext> ERROR_HANDLER = errorContext -> {
        System.out.printf("Error occurred in partition processor for partition %s, %s.%n",
            errorContext.getPartitionContext().getPartitionId(),
            errorContext.getThrowable());
    };
    ```

5. Build the program, and ensure that there are no errors.

## Run the applications

1. Run the **Receiver** application first.
1. Then, run the **Sender** application.
1. In the **Receiver** application window, confirm that you see the events that were published by the Sender application.

    ```cmd
    Starting event processor
    Press enter to stop.
    Processing event from partition 0 with sequence number 331 with body: Foo
    Processing event from partition 0 with sequence number 332 with body: Bar
    ```
    
1. Press **ENTER** in the receiver application window to stop the application.

    ```cmd
    Starting event processor
    Press enter to stop.
    Processing event from partition 0 with sequence number 331 with body: Foo
    Processing event from partition 0 with sequence number 332 with body: Bar

    Stopping event processor
    Event processor stopped.
    Exiting process
    ```
