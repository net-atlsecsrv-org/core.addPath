# Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using Python (azure-eventhub version 5)
This quickstart shows how to send events to and receive events from an event hub using the **azure-eventhub version 5** Python package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This quickstart uses the latest azure-eventhub version 5 package. For a quick start that uses the old azure-eventhub version 1 package, see [Send and receive events using azure-eventhub version 1](event-hubs-python-get-started-send.md). 

## Prerequisites
If you're new to Azure Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) before you do this quickstart. 

To complete this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

- **Microsoft Azure subscription**. To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you need a subscription.  If you don't have an existing Azure account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- Python 2.7 or 3.5 or later, with PIP installed and updated.
- The Python package for Event Hubs. 

    To install the package, run this command in a command prompt that has Python in its path:

    ```cmd
    pip install azure-eventhub
    ```

    Install the following package for receiving the events by using Azure Blob storage as the checkpoint store:

    ```cmd
    pip install azure-eventhub-checkpointstoreblob-aio
    ```
- **Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub**. The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md). Then, get the **connection string for the Event Hubs namespace** by following instructions from the article: [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). You use the connection string later in this quickstart.

## Send events
In this section, you create a Python script to send events to the event hub that you created earlier.

1. Open your favorite Python editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Create a script called *send.py*. This script sends a batch of events to the event hub that you created earlier.
3. Paste the following code into *send.py*:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from azure.eventhub.aio import EventHubProducerClient
    from azure.eventhub import EventData

    async def run():
        # Create a producer client to send messages to the event hub.
        # Specify a connection string to your event hubs namespace and
     	    # the event hub name.
        producer = EventHubProducerClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE - CONNECTION STRING", eventhub_name="EVENT HUB NAME")
        async with producer:
            # Create a batch.
            event_data_batch = await producer.create_batch()

            # Add events to the batch.
            event_data_batch.add(EventData('First event '))
            event_data_batch.add(EventData('Second event'))
            event_data_batch.add(EventData('Third event'))

            # Send the batch of events to the event hub.
            await producer.send_batch(event_data_batch)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(run())

    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the complete source code, including informational comments, go to the [GitHub send_async.py page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/samples/async_samples/send_async.py).
    

## Receive events
This quickstart uses Azure Blob storage as a checkpoint store. The checkpoint store is used to persist checkpoints (that is, the last read positions).  

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running on Azure Stack Hub, that platform may support a different version of Storage Blob SDK than those typically available on Azure. For example, if you are running [on Azure Stack Hub version 2002](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/event-hubs-overview), the highest available version for the Storage service is version 2017-11-09. In this case, besides following steps in this section, you will also need to add code to target the Storage service API version 2017-11-09. For an example on how to target a specific Storage API version, see the [synchronous](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub-checkpointstoreblob/samples/receive_events_using_checkpoint_store_storage_api_version.py) and [asynchronous](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub-checkpointstoreblob-aio/samples/receive_events_using_checkpoint_store_storage_api_version_async.py) samples on GitHub. For more information on the Azure Storage service versions supported on Azure Stack Hub, please refer to [Azure Stack Hub storage: Differences and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-acs-differences).


### Create an Azure storage account and a blob container
Create an Azure storage account and a blob container in it by doing the following steps:

1. [Create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal)
2. [Create a blob container](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md#create-a-container)
3. [Get the connection string to the storage account](../storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string.md)

Be sure to record the connection string and container name for later use in the receive code.


### Create a Python script to receive events

In this section, you create a Python script to receive events from your event hub:

1. Open your favorite Python editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Create a script called *recv.py*.
3. Paste the following code into *recv.py*:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from azure.eventhub.aio import EventHubConsumerClient
    from azure.eventhub.extensions.checkpointstoreblobaio import BlobCheckpointStore


    async def on_event(partition_context, event):
        # Print the event data.
        print("Received the event: \"{}\" from the partition with ID: \"{}\"".format(event.body_as_str(encoding='UTF-8'), partition_context.partition_id))

        # Update the checkpoint so that the program doesn't read the events
        # that it has already read when you run it next time.
        await partition_context.update_checkpoint(event)

    async def main():
        # Create an Azure blob checkpoint store to store the checkpoints.
        checkpoint_store = BlobCheckpointStore.from_connection_string("AZURE STORAGE CONNECTION STRING", "BLOB CONTAINER NAME")

        # Create a consumer client for the event hub.
        client = EventHubConsumerClient.from_connection_string("EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING", consumer_group="$Default", eventhub_name="EVENT HUB NAME", checkpoint_store=checkpoint_store)
        async with client:
            # Call the receive method.
            await client.receive(on_event=on_event)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        # Run the main method.
        loop.run_until_complete(main())    
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the complete source code, including additional informational comments, go to the [GitHub recv_with_checkpoint_store_async.py 
page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/samples/async_samples/recv_with_checkpoint_store_async.py).


### Run the receiver app

To run the script, open a command prompt that has Python in its path, and then run this command:

```bash
python recv.py
```

### Run the sender app

To run the script, open a command prompt that has Python in its path, and then run this command:

```bash
python send.py
```

The receiver window should display the messages that were sent to the event hub.


## Next steps
In this quickstart, you've sent and received events asynchronously. To learn how to send and receive events synchronously, go to the [GitHub sync_samples page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/samples/sync_samples).

For all the samples (both synchronous and asynchronous) on GitHub, go to [Azure Event Hubs client library for Python samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/samples).
