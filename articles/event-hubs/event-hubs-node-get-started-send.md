# Send events to or receive events from Azure Event Hubs using Node.js

Azure Event Hubs is a Big Data streaming platform and event ingestion service that can receive and process millions of events per second. Event Hubs can process and store events, data, or telemetry produced by distributed software and devices. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters. For detailed overview of Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) and [Event Hubs features](event-hubs-features.md).

This tutorial describes how to create Node.js applications to send events to or receive events from an event hub.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download this quickstart as a sample from the [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-node/tree/master/client), replace `EventHubConnectionString` and `EventHubName` strings with your event hub values, and run it. Alternatively, you can follow the steps in this tutorial to create your own.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

- An active Azure account. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
- Node.js version 8.x and higher. Download the latest LTS version from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- Visual Studio Code (recommended) or any other IDE
- **Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub**. The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md), then continue with the following steps in this tutorial. Then, get the connection string for the event hub namespace by following instructions from the article: [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). You use the connection string later in this tutorial.


### Install npm package
To install the [npm package for Event Hubs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/event-hubs), open a command prompt that has `npm` in its path, change the directory
to the folder where you want to have your samples and then run this command

```shell
npm install @azure/event-hubs
```

To install the [npm package for Event Processor Host](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/event-processor-host), run the below command instead

```shell
npm install @azure/event-processor-host
```

## Send events

This section shows you how to create a Node.js application that sends events to an event hub. 

1. Open your favorite editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). 
2. Create a file called `send.js` and paste the below code into it. Get the connection string for the event hub namespace by following instructions from the article: [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). 

    ```javascript
    const { EventHubClient } = require("@azure/event-hubs");

    // Connection string - primary key of the Event Hubs namespace. 
    // For example: Endpoint=sb://myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    const connectionString = "Endpoint=sb://<EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE NAME>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED ACCESS KEY>";

    // Name of the event hub. For example: myeventhub
    const eventHubsName = "<EVENT HUB NAME>";

    async function main() {
      const client = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionString(connectionString, eventHubsName);

      for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        const eventData = {body: `Event ${i}`};
        console.log(`Sending message: ${eventData.body}`);
        await client.send(eventData);
      }

      await client.close();
    }

    main().catch(err => {
      console.log("Error occurred: ", err);
    });
    ```
3. Enter the connection string and the name of your Event Hub in the above code
4. Then run the command `node send.js` in a command prompt to execute this file. This will send 100 events to your Event Hub

Congratulations! You have now sent events to an event hub.


## Receive events

This section shows you how to create a Node.js application that receives events from a single partition
of the default consumer group in an event hub. 

1. Open your favorite editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). 
2. Create a file called `receive.js` and paste the below code into it.
    ```javascript
    const { EventHubClient, delay } = require("@azure/event-hubs");

    // Connection string - primary key of the Event Hubs namespace. 
    // For example: Endpoint=sb://myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    const connectionString = "Endpoint=sb://<EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE NAME>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED ACCESS KEY>";

    // Name of the event hub. For example: myeventhub
    const eventHubsName = "<EVENT HUB NAME>";

    async function main() {
      const client = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionString(connectionString, eventHubsName);
      const allPartitionIds = await client.getPartitionIds();
      const firstPartitionId = allPartitionIds[0];

      const receiveHandler = client.receive(firstPartitionId, eventData => {
        console.log(`Received message: ${eventData.body} from partition ${firstPartitionId}`);
      }, error => {
        console.log('Error when receiving message: ', error)
      });

      // Sleep for a while before stopping the receive operation.
      await delay(15000);
      await receiveHandler.stop();

      await client.close();
    }

    main().catch(err => {
      console.log("Error occurred: ", err);
    });
    ```
3. Enter the connection string and the name of your Event Hub in the above code.
4. Then run the command `node receive.js` in a command prompt to execute this file. This will receive events from one of the partitions of the default consumer group in your Event Hub

Congratulations! You have now received events from event hub.

## Receive events using Event Processor Host

This section shows how to receive events from an event hub by using Azure [EventProcessorHost](event-hubs-event-processor-host.md) in a Node.js application. The EventProcessorHost (EPH) helps you efficiently receive events from an event hub by creating receivers across all partitions in the consumer group of an event hub. It checkpoints metadata on received messages at regular intervals in an Azure Storage Blob. This approach makes it easy to continue receiving messages from where you left off at a later time.

1. Open your favorite editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). 
2. Create a file called `receiveAll.js` and paste the below code into it.
    ```javascript
    const { EventProcessorHost, delay } = require("@azure/event-processor-host");

    // Connection string - primary key of the Event Hubs namespace. 
    // For example: Endpoint=sb://myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    const connectionString = "Endpoint=sb://<EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE NAME>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED ACCESS KEY>";

    // Name of the event hub. For example: myeventhub
    const eventHubsName = "<EVENT HUB NAME>";

    // Azure Storage connection string
    const storageConnectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME>;AccountKey=<STORAGE ACCOUNT KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net";

    async function main() {
      const eph = EventProcessorHost.createFromConnectionString(
        "my-eph",
        storageConnectionString,
        "my-storage-container-name",
        eventHubConnectionString,
        {
          eventHubPath: eventHubName,
          onEphError: (error) => {
            console.log("[%s] Error: %O", error);
          }
        }
      );


      eph.start((context, eventData) => {
        console.log(`Received message: ${eventData.body} from partition ${context.partitionId}`);
      }, error => {
        console.log('Error when receiving message: ', error)
      });

      // Sleep for a while before stopping the receive operation.
      await delay(15000);
      await eph.stop();
    }

    main().catch(err => {
      console.log("Error occurred: ", err);
    });

    ```
3. Enter the connection string and the name of your Event Hub in the above code along with connection string for an Azure Blob Storage
4. Then run the command `node receiveAll.js` in a command prompt to execute this file.

Congratulations! You have now received events from event hub using Event Processor Host. This will receive events from all the partitions of the default consumer group in your Event Hub
