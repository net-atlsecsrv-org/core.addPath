# Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using JavaScript  (azure/event-hubs version 5)
This quickstart shows how to send events to and receive events from an event hub using the **azure/event-hubs version 5** JavaScript package. 


## Prerequisites
If you are new to Azure Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) before you do this quickstart. 

To complete this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

- **Microsoft Azure subscription**. To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you need a subscription.  If you don't have an existing Azure account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- Node.js version 8.x or later. Download the latest [long-term support (LTS) version](https://nodejs.org).  
- Visual Studio Code (recommended) or any other integrated development environment (IDE).  
- An active Event Hubs namespace and event hub. To create them, do the following steps: 

   1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a namespace of type *Event Hubs*, and then obtain the management credentials that your application needs to communicate with the event hub. 
   1. To create the namespace and event hub, follow the instructions at [Quickstart: Create an event hub by using the Azure portal](event-hubs-create.md).
   1. Continue by following the instructions in this quickstart. 
   1. To get the connection string for your Event Hub namespace, follow the instructions in [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). Record the connection string to use later in this quickstart.
- **Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub**. The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md). Then, get the **connection string for the Event Hubs namespace** by following instructions from the article: [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). You use the connection string later in this quickstart.

### Install the npm package
To install the [Node Package Manager (npm) package for Event Hubs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/event-hubs), open a command prompt that has *npm* in its path, change the directory
to the folder where you want to keep your samples, and then run this command:

```shell
npm install @azure/event-hubs
```

For the receiving side, you need to install two more packages. In this quickstart, you use Azure Blob storage to persist checkpoints so that the program doesn't read the events that it has already read. It performs metadata checkpoints on received messages at regular intervals in a blob. This approach makes it easy to continue receiving messages later from where you left off.

Run the following commands:

```shell
npm install @azure/storage-blob
```

```shell
npm install @azure/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob
```

## Send events

In this section, you create a JavaScript application that sends events to an event hub.

1. Open your favorite editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
1. Create a file called *send.js*, and paste the following code into it:

    ```javascript
    const { EventHubProducerClient } = require("@azure/event-hubs");

    const connectionString = "EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING";
    const eventHubName = "EVENT HUB NAME";

    async function main() {

      // Create a producer client to send messages to the event hub.
      const producer = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName);

      // Prepare a batch of three events.
      const batch = await producer.createBatch();
      batch.tryAdd({ body: "First event" });
      batch.tryAdd({ body: "Second event" });
      batch.tryAdd({ body: "Third event" });    

      // Send the batch to the event hub.
      await producer.sendBatch(batch);

      // Close the producer client.
      await producer.close();

      console.log("A batch of three events have been sent to the event hub");
    }

    main().catch((err) => {
      console.log("Error occurred: ", err);
    });
    ```
1. In the code, use real values to replace the following:
    * `EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING` 
    * `EVENT HUB NAME`
1. Run `node send.js` to execute this file. This command sends a batch of three events to your event hub.
1. In the Azure portal, verify that the event hub has received the messages. In the **Metrics** section, switch to **Messages** view. Refresh the page to update the chart. It might take a few seconds for it to show that the messages have been received.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the complete source code, including additional informational comments, go to the [GitHub sendEvents.js page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/event-hubs/samples/javascript/sendEvents.js).

Congratulations! You have now sent events to an event hub.


## Receive events
In this section, you receive events from an event hub by using an Azure Blob storage checkpoint store in a JavaScript application. It performs metadata checkpoints on received messages at regular intervals in an Azure Storage blob. This approach makes it easy to continue receiving messages later from where you left off.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running on Azure Stack Hub, that platform may support a different version of Storage Blob SDK than those typically available on Azure. For example, if you are running [on Azure Stack Hub version 2002](/azure-stack/user/event-hubs-overview), the highest available version for the Storage service is version 2017-11-09. In this case, besides following steps in this section, you will also need to add code to target the Storage service API version 2017-11-09. For an example on how to target a specific Storage API version, see [JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob/samples/javascript/receiveEventsWithApiSpecificStorage.js) and  [TypeScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob/samples/typescript/src/receiveEventsWithApiSpecificStorage.ts) samples on GitHub. For more information on the Azure Storage service versions supported on Azure Stack Hub, please refer to [Azure Stack Hub storage: Differences and considerations](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-acs-differences).


### Create an Azure storage account and a blob container
To create an Azure storage account and a blob container in it, do the following actions:

1. [Create an Azure storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal)  
2. [Create a blob container in the storage account](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md#create-a-container)  
3. [Get the connection string to the storage account](../storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string.md)

Be sure to record the connection string and container name for later use in the receive code.

### Write code to receive events

1. Open your favorite editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
1. Create a file called *receive.js*, and paste the following code into it:

    ```javascript
    const { EventHubConsumerClient } = require("@azure/event-hubs");
    const { ContainerClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");    
    const { BlobCheckpointStore } = require("@azure/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob");

    const connectionString = "EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING";    
    const eventHubName = "EVENT HUB NAME";
    const consumerGroup = "$Default"; // name of the default consumer group
    const storageConnectionString = "AZURE STORAGE CONNECTION STRING";
    const containerName = "BLOB CONTAINER NAME";

    async function main() {
      // Create a blob container client and a blob checkpoint store using the client.
      const containerClient = new ContainerClient(storageConnectionString, containerName);
      const checkpointStore = new BlobCheckpointStore(containerClient);

      // Create a consumer client for the event hub by specifying the checkpoint store.
      const consumerClient = new EventHubConsumerClient(consumerGroup, connectionString, eventHubName, checkpointStore);

      // Subscribe to the events, and specify handlers for processing the events and errors.
      const subscription = consumerClient.subscribe({
          processEvents: async (events, context) => {
            for (const event of events) {
              console.log(`Received event: '${event.body}' from partition: '${context.partitionId}' and consumer group: '${context.consumerGroup}'`);
            }
            // Update the checkpoint.
            await context.updateCheckpoint(events[events.length - 1]);
          },

          processError: async (err, context) => {
            console.log(`Error : ${err}`);
          }
        }
      );

      // After 30 seconds, stop processing.
      await new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(async () => {
          await subscription.close();
          await consumerClient.close();
          resolve();
        }, 30000);
      });
    }

    main().catch((err) => {
      console.log("Error occurred: ", err);
    });    
    ```
1. In the code, use real values to replace the following values:
    - `EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING`
    - `EVENT HUB NAME`
    - `AZURE STORAGE CONNECTION STRING`
    - `BLOB CONTAINER NAME`
1. Run `node receive.js` in a command prompt to execute this file. The window should display messages about received events.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the complete source code, including additional informational comments, go to the [GitHub receiveEventsUsingCheckpointStore.js page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob/samples/javascript/receiveEventsUsingCheckpointStore.js).

Congratulations! You have now received events from your event hub. The receiver program will receive events from all the partitions of the default consumer group in the event hub.
