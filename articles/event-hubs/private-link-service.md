# Allow access to Azure Event Hubs namespaces via private endpoints 
Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure Services (for example, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a **private endpoint** in your virtual network.

A private endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.

For more information, see [What is Azure Private Link?](../private-link/private-link-overview.md)

## Add a private endpoint using Azure portal

### Prerequisites

To integrate an Event Hubs namespace with Azure Private Link, you'll need the following entities or permissions:

- An Event Hubs namespace.
- An Azure virtual network.
- A subnet in the virtual network. You can use the **default** subnet. 
- Owner or contributor permissions for both the namespace and the virtual network.

Your private endpoint and virtual network must be in the same region. When you select a region for the private endpoint using the portal, it will automatically filter only virtual networks that are in that region. Your namespace can be in a different region.

Your private endpoint uses a private IP address in your virtual network.

### Steps
If you already have an Event Hubs namespace, you can create a private link connection by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
2. In the search bar, type in **event hubs**.
3. Select the **namespace** from the list to which you want to add a private endpoint.
4. Select **Networking** under **Settings** on the left menu.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You see the **Networking** tab only for **standard** or **dedicated** namespaces.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the **Selected networks** option is selected. If you don't specify an IP firewall rule or add a virtual network, the namespace can be accessed via public internet. 
1. Select the **Private endpoint connections** tab at the top of the page. 
1. Select the **+ Private Endpoint** button at the top of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/private-link-service/private-link-service-3.png" alt-text="Networking page - Private endpoint connections tab - Add private endpoint link":::
7. On the **Basics** page, follow these steps: 
    1. Select the **Azure subscription** in which you want to create the private endpoint. 
    2. Select the **resource group** for the private endpoint resource.
    3. Enter a **name** for the private endpoint. 
    5. Select a **region** for the private endpoint. Your private endpoint must be in the same region as your virtual network, but can be in a different region from the private link resource that you are connecting to. 
    6. Select **Next: Resource >** button at the bottom of the page.

        ![Create Private Endpoint - Basics page](./media/private-link-service/create-private-endpoint-basics-page.png)
8. On the **Resource** page, follow these steps:
    1. For connection method, if you select **Connect to an Azure resource in my directory**, follow these steps: 
        1. Select the **Azure subscription** in which your **Event Hubs namespace** exists. 
        2. For **Resource type**, Select **Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces** for the **Resource type**.
        3. For **Resource**, select an Event Hubs namespace from the drop-down list. 
        4. Confirm that the **Target subresource** is set to **namespace**.
        5. Select **Next: Configuration >** button at the bottom of the page. 
        
            ![Create Private Endpoint - Resource page](./media/private-link-service/create-private-endpoint-resource-page.png)    
    2. If you select **Connect to an Azure resource by resource ID or alias**, follow these steps:
        1. Enter the **resource ID** or **alias**. It can be the resource ID or alias that someone has shared with you. The easiest way to get the resource ID is to navigate to the Event Hubs namespace in the Azure portal and copy the portion of URI starting from `/subscriptions/`. See the following image for an example. 
        2. For **Target sub-resource**, enter **namespace**. It's the type of the sub-resource that your private endpoint can access.
        3. (optional) Enter a **request message**. The resource owner sees this message while managing private endpoint connection.
        4. Then, select **Next: Configuration >** button at the bottom of the page.

            ![Create Private Endpoint - Connect using resource ID](./media/private-link-service/connect-resource-id.png)
9. On the **Configuration** page, you select the subnet in a virtual network to where you want to deploy the private endpoint. 
    1. Select a **virtual network**. Only virtual networks in the currently selected subscription and location are listed in the drop-down list. 
    2. Select a **subnet** in the virtual network you selected. 
    3. Select **Next: Tags >** button at the bottom of the page. 

        ![Create Private Endpoint - Configuration page](./media/private-link-service/create-private-endpoint-configuration-page.png)
10. On the **Tags** page, create any tags (names and values) that you want to associate with the private endpoint resource. Then, select **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page. 
11. On the **Review + create**, review all the settings, and select **Create** to create the private endpoint.
    
    ![Create Private Endpoint - Review and Create page](./media/private-link-service/create-private-endpoint-review-create-page.png)
12. Confirm that you see the private endpoint connection you created shows up in the list of endpoints. In this example, the private endpoint is auto-approved because you connected to an Azure resource in your directory and you have sufficient permissions.

## Add a private endpoint using PowerShell
The following example shows how to use Azure PowerShell to create a private endpoint connection. It doesn't create a dedicated cluster for you. Follow steps in [this article](event-hubs-dedicated-cluster-create-portal.md) to create a dedicated Event Hubs cluster. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
# create resource group

$rgName = "<RESOURCE GROUP NAME>"
$vnetlocation = "<VIRTUAL NETWORK LOCATION>"
$vnetName = "<VIRTUAL NETWORK NAME>"
$subnetName = "<SUBNET NAME>"
$namespaceLocation = "<NAMESPACE LOCATION>"
$namespaceName = "<NAMESPACE NAME>"
$peConnectionName = "<PRIVATE ENDPOINT CONNECTION NAME>"

# create virtual network
$virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
                    -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
                    -Location $vnetlocation `
                    -Name $vnetName `
                    -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16

# create subnet with endpoint network policy disabled
$subnetConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
                    -Name $subnetName `
                    -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24 `
                    -PrivateEndpointNetworkPoliciesFlag "Disabled" `
                    -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork

# update virtual network
$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork

# create an event hubs namespace in a dedicated cluster
$namespaceResource = New-AzResource -Location $namespaceLocation `
                                    -ResourceName $namespaceName `
                                    -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
                                    -Sku @{name = "Standard"; capacity = 1} `
                                    -Properties @{clusterArmId = "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP NAME>/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/clusters/<EVENT HUBS CLUSTER NAME>"} `
                                    -ResourceType "Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces" -ApiVersion "2018-01-01-preview"

# create private endpoint connection
$privateEndpointConnection = New-AzPrivateLinkServiceConnection `
                                -Name $peConnectionName `
                                -PrivateLinkServiceId $namespaceResource.ResourceId `
                                -GroupId "namespace"

# get subnet object that you will use later
$virtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName  $rgName -Name $vnetName
$subnet = $virtualNetwork | Select -ExpandProperty subnets `
                                | Where-Object  {$_.Name -eq $subnetName}  
   
# create a private endpoint   
$privateEndpoint = New-AzPrivateEndpoint -ResourceGroupName $rgName  `
                                -Name $vnetName   `
                                -Location $vnetlocation `
                                -Subnet  $subnet   `
                                -PrivateLinkServiceConnection $privateEndpointConnection

(Get-AzResource -ResourceId $namespaceResource.ResourceId -ExpandProperties).Properties


```

### Configure the private DNS Zone
Create a private DNS zone for Event Hubs domain and create an association link with the virtual network:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$zone = New-AzPrivateDnsZone -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
                            -Name "privatelink.servicebus.windows.net" 
 
$link  = New-AzPrivateDnsVirtualNetworkLink -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
                                            -ZoneName "privatelink.servicebus.windows.net" `
                                            -Name "mylink" `
                                            -VirtualNetworkId $virtualNetwork.Id  
 
$networkInterface = Get-AzResource -ResourceId $privateEndpoint.NetworkInterfaces[0].Id -ApiVersion "2019-04-01" 
 
foreach ($ipconfig in $networkInterface.properties.ipConfigurations) { 
    foreach ($fqdn in $ipconfig.properties.privateLinkConnectionProperties.fqdns) { 
        Write-Host "$($ipconfig.properties.privateIPAddress) $($fqdn)"  
        $recordName = $fqdn.split('.',2)[0] 
        $dnsZone = $fqdn.split('.',2)[1] 
        New-AzPrivateDnsRecordSet -Name $recordName -RecordType A -ZoneName "privatelink.servicebus.windows.net"  `
                                -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Ttl 600 `
                                -PrivateDnsRecords (New-AzPrivateDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address $ipconfig.properties.privateIPAddress)  
    } 
}
```

## Manage private endpoints using Azure portal

When you create a private endpoint, the connection must be approved. If the resource for which you're creating a private endpoint is in your directory, you can approve the connection request provided you have sufficient permissions. If you're connecting to an Azure resource in another directory, you must wait for the owner of that resource to approve your connection request.

There are four provisioning states:

| Service action | Service consumer private endpoint state | Description |
|--|--|--|
| None | Pending | Connection is created manually and is pending approval from the Private Link resource owner. |
| Approve | Approved | Connection was automatically or manually approved and is ready to be used. |
| Reject | Rejected | Connection was rejected by the private link resource owner. |
| Remove | Disconnected | Connection was removed by the private link resource owner, the private endpoint becomes informative and should be deleted for cleanup. |
 
###  Approve, reject, or remove a private endpoint connection

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the search bar, type in **event hubs**.
3. Select the **namespace** that you want to manage.
4. Select the **Networking** tab.
5. Go to the appropriate section below based on the operation you want to: approve, reject, or remove.

### Approve a private endpoint connection
1. If there are any connections that are pending, you will see a connection listed with **Pending** in the provisioning state. 
2. Select the **private endpoint** you wish to approve
3. Select the **Approve** button.

    ![Image](./media/private-link-service/approve-private-endpoint.png)
4. On the **Approve connection** page, add a comment (optional), and select **Yes**. If you select **No**, nothing happens. 
5. You should see the status of the private endpoint connection in the list changed to **Approved**. 

### Reject a private endpoint connection

1. If there are any private endpoint connections you want to reject, whether it is a pending request or existing connection, select the connection and click the **Reject** button.

    ![Image](./media/private-link-service/private-endpoint-reject-button.png)
2. On the **Reject connection** page, enter a comment (optional), and select **Yes**. If you select **No**, nothing happens. 
3. You should see the status of the private endpoint connection in the list changed to **Rejected**. 

### Remove a private endpoint connection

1. To remove a private endpoint connection, select it in the list, and select **Remove** on the toolbar.
2. On the **Delete connection** page, select **Yes** to confirm the deletion of the private endpoint. If you select **No**, nothing happens.
3. You should see the status changed to **Disconnected**. Then, you will see the endpoint disappear from the list.

## Validate that the private link connection works

You should validate that the resources within the same subnet of the private endpoint resource are connecting to your Event Hubs namespace over a private IP address, and that they have the correct private DNS zone integration.

First, create a virtual machine by following the steps in [Create a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal](../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md)

In the **Networking** tab: 

1. Specify **Virtual network** and **Subnet**. You must select the Virtual Network on which you deployed the private endpoint.
2. Specify a **public IP** resource.
3. For **NIC network security group**, select **None**.
4. For **Load balancing**, select **No**.

Connect to the VM, open the command line, and run the following command:

```console
nslookup <event-hubs-namespace-name>.servicebus.windows.net
```

You should see a result that looks like the following. 

```console
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    <event-hubs-namespace-name>.privatelink.servicebus.windows.net
Address:  10.0.0.4 (private IP address associated with the private endpoint)
Aliases:  <event-hubs-namespace-name>.servicebus.windows.net
```

## Limitations and design considerations

**Pricing**: For pricing information, see [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/).

**Limitations**:  This feature is available in all Azure public regions.

**Maximum number of private endpoints per Event Hubs namespace**: 120.
