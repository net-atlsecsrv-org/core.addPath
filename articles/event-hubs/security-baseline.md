# Azure security baseline for Event Hubs

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Event Hubs. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Event Hubs. **Controls** not applicable to Event Hubs have been excluded.

 
To see how Event Hubs completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Event Hubs security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: The integration of Azure Event Hubs with virtual network service endpoints enables secure access to messaging capabilities from workloads such as virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks, with the network traffic path being secured on both ends.

Once bound to at least one virtual network subnet service endpoint, the respective Event Hubs namespace no longer accepts traffic from anywhere but authorized subnets in virtual networks. From the virtual network perspective, binding your Event Hubs namespace to a service endpoint configures an isolated networking tunnel from the virtual network subnet to the messaging service. 

You can also create a private endpoint, which is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to Event Hubs service by using the Azure Private Link service. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. 

You can also secure your Azure Event Hubs namespace by using firewalls. Event Hubs supports IP-based access controls for inbound firewall support. You can set firewall rules by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Microsoft Azure provides integrated access control management for resources and applications based on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). A key advantage of using Azure AD with Azure Event Hubs is that you don't need to store your credentials in the code anymore. Instead, you can request an OAuth 2.0 access token from the Microsoft Identity platform. The resource name to request a token is https:\//eventhubs.azure.net/. Azure AD authenticates the security principal (a user, group, or service principal) running the application. If the authentication succeeds, Azure AD returns an access token to the application, and the application can then use the access token to authorize request to Azure Event Hubs resources.

Use Managed Identities to provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Managed Identities allows you to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Azure Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.

## Malware Defense

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Malware Defense](../security/benchmarks/security-control-malware-defense.md).*

### 8.2: Pre-scan files to be uploaded to non-compute Azure resources

**Guidance**: Pre-scan any content being uploaded to non-compute Azure resources, such as Azure Event Hubs, App Service, Data Lake Storage, Blob Storage, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, etc. Microsoft cannot access your data in these instances.

Microsoft anti-malware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure Cache for Redis), however it does not run on customer content.

## Data Recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

**Guidance**: Configure geo-disaster recovery for Azure Event Hubs. When entire Azure regions or datacenters (if no availability zones are used) experience downtime, it is critical for data processing to continue to operate in a different region or datacenter. As such, Geo-disaster recovery and Geo-replication are important features for any enterprise. Azure Event Hubs supports both geo-disaster recovery and geo-replication, at the namespace level.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Azure Event Hubs provides encryption of data at rest with Azure Storage Service Encryption (Azure SSE). Event Hubs relies on Azure Storage to store the data and by default, all the data that is stored with Azure Storage is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys. If you use Azure Key Vault for storing customer-managed keys,  ensure regular automated backups of your Keys.

Ensure regular automated backups of your Key Vault Secrets with the following PowerShell command: Backup-AzKeyVaultSecret

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Test restoration of backed up customer-managed keys.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Enable soft delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion. Azure Event Hubs requires customer-managed keys to have Soft Delete and Do Not Purge configured.

Configure soft delete for the Azure storage account that's used for capturing Event Hubs data. Note that this feature isn’t supported for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 yet.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to alerts, to help you prioritize the order in which you attend to each alert, so that when a resource is compromised, you can get to it right away. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.
