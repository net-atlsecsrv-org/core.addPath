# Azure Security Baseline for Event Hubs

The Azure Security Baseline for Event Hubs contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: The integration of event hubs with virtual network service endpoints enables secure access to messaging capabilities from workloads such as virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks, with the network traffic path being secured on both ends.

Once bound to at least one virtual network subnet service endpoint, the respective Event Hubs namespace no longer accepts traffic from anywhere but authorized subnets in virtual networks. From the virtual network perspective, binding your Event Hubs namespace to a service endpoint configures an isolated networking tunnel from the virtual network subnet to the messaging service. 

You can also create a private endpoint, which is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to Azure Event Hubs service by using the Azure Private Link service. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. 

You can also secure your Azure Event Hubs namespace by using firewalls. Azure Event Hubs supports IP-based access controls for inbound firewall support. You can set firewall rules by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.
