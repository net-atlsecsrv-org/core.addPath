# Availability and consistency in Event Hubs
This article provides information about availability and consistency supported by Azure Event Hubs. 

## Availability
Azure Event Hubs spreads the risk of catastrophic failures of individual machines or even complete racks across clusters that span multiple failure domains within a datacenter. It implements transparent failure detection and failover mechanisms such that the service will continue to operate within the assured service-levels and typically without noticeable interruptions when such failures occur. If an Event Hubs namespace has been created with the enabled option for [availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md), the outage risk is further spread across three physically separated facilities, and the service has enough capacity reserves to instantly cope with the complete, catastrophic loss of the entire facility. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs - Geo-disaster recovery](event-hubs-geo-dr.md).

When a client application sends events to an event hub, events are automatically distributed among partitions in your event hub. If a partition isn't available for some reason, events are distributed among the remaining partitions. This behavior allows for the greatest amount of up time. For use cases that require the maximum up time, this model is preferred instead of sending events to a specific partition. For more information, see [Partitions](event-hubs-scalability.md#partitions).

## Consistency
In some scenarios, the ordering of events can be important. For example, you may want your back-end system to process an update command before a delete command. In this scenario, a client application sends events to a specific partition so that the ordering is preserved. When a consumer application consumes these events from the partition, they are read in order. 

With this configuration, keep in mind that if the particular partition to which you are sending is unavailable, you will receive an error response. As a point of comparison, if you don't have an affinity to a single partition, the Event Hubs service sends your event to the next available partition.

One possible solution to ensure ordering, while also maximizing up time, would be to aggregate events as part of your event processing application. The easiest way to accomplish it is to stamp your event with a custom sequence number property.

In this scenario, producer client sends events to one of the available partitions in your event hub, and sets the corresponding sequence number from your application. This solution requires state to be kept by your processing application, but gives your senders an endpoint that is more likely to be available.

## Appendix

### .NET examples

#### Send events to a specific partition
Either set the partition key on an event, or use a `PartitionSender` object (if you are using the old Microsoft.Azure.Messaging library) to only send events to a certain partition. Doing so ensures that when these events are read from the partition, they are read in order. 

If you are using the newer **Azure.Messaging.EventHubs** library, see [Migrating code from PartitionSender to EventHubProducerClient for publishing events to a partition](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/MigrationGuide.md#migrating-code-from-partitionsender-to-eventhubproducerclient-for-publishing-events-to-a-partition).

#### [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs (5.0.0 or later)](#tab/latest)

```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

await using (var producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName))
{
    var batchOptions = new CreateBatchOptions() { PartitionId = "my-partition-id" };
    using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync(batchOptions);
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));
    
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
```

#### [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs (4.1.0 or earlier)](#tab/old)

```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString){ EntityPath = eventHubName }; 
var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());
PartitionSender partitionSender = eventHubClient.CreatePartitionSender("my-partition-id");
try
{
    EventDataBatch eventBatch = partitionSender.CreateBatch();
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));

    await partitionSender.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
finally
{
    await partitionSender.CloseAsync();
    await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();
}
```

### Set a sequence number
The following example stamps your event with a custom sequence number property. 

#### [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs (5.0.0 or later)](#tab/latest)

```csharp
// create a producer client that you can use to send events to an event hub
await using (var producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName))
{
    // get the latest sequence number from your application
    var sequenceNumber = GetNextSequenceNumber();

    // create a batch of events 
    using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync();

    // create a new EventData object by encoding a string as a byte array
    var data = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("This is my message..."));

    // set a custom sequence number property
    data.Properties.Add("SequenceNumber", sequenceNumber);

    // add events to the batch. An event is a represented by a collection of bytes and metadata. 
    eventBatch.TryAdd(data);

    // use the producer client to send the batch of events to the event hub
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
```

#### [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs (4.1.0 or earlier)](#tab/old)
```csharp
// Create an Event Hubs client
var client = new EventHubClient(connectionString, eventHubName);

//Create a producer to produce events
EventHubProducer producer = client.CreateProducer();

// Get the latest sequence number from your application 
var sequenceNumber = GetNextSequenceNumber();

// Create a new EventData object by encoding a string as a byte array
var data = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("This is my message..."));

// Set a custom sequence number property
data.Properties.Add("SequenceNumber", sequenceNumber);

// Send single message async
await producer.SendAsync(data);
```

This example sends your event to one of the available partitions in your event hub, and sets the corresponding sequence number from your application. This solution requires state to be kept by your processing application, but gives your senders an endpoint that is more likely to be available.
