# Event Hubs management libraries

You can use the Azure Event Hubs management libraries to dynamically provision Event Hubs namespaces and entities. This dynamic nature enables complex deployments and messaging scenarios, so that you can programmatically determine what entities to provision. These libraries are currently available for .NET.

## Supported functionality

* Namespace creation, update, deletion
* Event Hubs creation, update, deletion
* Consumer Group creation, update, deletion

## Prerequisites

To get started using the Event Hubs management libraries, you must authenticate with Azure Active Directory (AAD). AAD requires that you authenticate as a service principal, which provides access to your Azure resources. For information about creating a service principal, see one of these articles:  

* [Use the Azure portal to create Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md)
* [Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal to access resources](../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md)
* [Use Azure CLI to create a service principal to access resources](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli)

These tutorials provide you with an `AppId` (Client ID), `TenantId`, and `ClientSecret` (authentication key), all of which are used for authentication by the management libraries. You must have **Owner** permissions for the resource group on which you want to run.

## Programming pattern

The pattern to manipulate any Event Hubs resource follows a common protocol:

1. Obtain a token from AAD using the `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory` library.
    ```csharp
    var context = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}");

    var result = await context.AcquireTokenAsync(
        "https://management.core.windows.net/",
        new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret)
    );
    ```

1. Create the `EventHubManagementClient` object.
    ```csharp
    var creds = new TokenCredentials(token);
    var ehClient = new EventHubManagementClient(creds)
    {
        SubscriptionId = SettingsCache["SubscriptionId"]
    };
    ```

1. Set the `CreateOrUpdate` parameters to your specified values.
    ```csharp
    var ehParams = new EventHubCreateOrUpdateParameters()
    {
        Location = SettingsCache["DataCenterLocation"]
    };
    ```

1. Execute the call.
    ```csharp
    await ehClient.EventHubs.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, namespaceName, EventHubName, ehParams);
    ```
