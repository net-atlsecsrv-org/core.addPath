# Quickstart: Create an event hub using Azure PowerShell

Azure Event Hubs is a Big Data streaming platform and event ingestion service, capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. Event Hubs can process and store events, data, or telemetry produced by distributed software and devices. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters. For detailed overview of Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) and [Event Hubs features](event-hubs-features.md).

In this quickstart, you create an event hub using Azure PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

To complete this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Azure subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free account][] before you begin.
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs).
- [.NET Standard SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows), version 2.0 or later.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you're using PowerShell locally, you must run the latest version of PowerShell to complete this quickstart. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical collection of Azure resources, and you need a resource group to create an event hub. 

The following example creates a resource group in the East US region. Replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of the resource group you want to use:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup –Name myResourceGroup –Location eastus
```

## Create an Event Hubs namespace

Once your resource group is made, create an Event Hubs namespace within that resource group. An Event Hubs namespace provides a unique fully-qualified domain name in which you can create your event hub. Replace `namespace_name` with a unique name for your namespace:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzEventHubNamespace -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -NamespaceName namespace_name -Location eastus
```

## Create an event hub

Now that you have an Event Hubs namespace, create an event hub within that namespace:  
Allowed period for `MessageRetentionInDays` is between 1 and 7 days.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzEventHub -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -NamespaceName namespace_name -EventHubName eventhub_name -MessageRetentionInDays 3
```

Congratulations! You have used Azure PowerShell to create an Event Hubs namespace, and an event hub within that namespace. 

## Next steps

In this article, you created the Event Hubs namespace, and used sample applications to send and receive events from your event hub. For step-by-step instructions to send events to (or) receive events from an event hub, see the **Send and receive events** tutorials:
