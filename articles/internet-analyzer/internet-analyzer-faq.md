## Do I get billed for participating in the preview?
No, Azure Internet Analyzer is free to use in preview. There is no service-level agreement during preview.

## What scenarios is Internet Analyzer designed to address?

Internet Analyzer is designed to give you networking performance insights based on your user population. To help make the best performance decisions for your users, Internet Analyzer compares the performance of two Internet endpoints using your distinct user population. While Internet Analyzer can answer a multitude of questions, some of the most common are:

* What is the performance impact of migrating to the cloud? 
    * *Suggested Test: Custom (your current on-premises infrastructure) vs. Azure (any preconfigured endpoint)*
* What is the value of putting my data at the edge vs. in a data center? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Azure vs. Azure Front Door, Azure vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* What is the performance benefit of Azure Front Door?
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom/ Azure/ CDN vs. Azure Front Door*
* What is the performance benefit of Azure CDN from Microsoft? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom/ Azure/ AFD vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* How does Azure CDN from Microsoft stack up? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom (other CDN endpoint) vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* What is the best cloud for your end-user population in each region? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom (other cloud service) vs. Azure (any preconfigured endpoint)*

## Which tests can I run in preview?

Each test you create in Internet Analyzer is composed of two endpointsâ€”Endpoint A and Endpoint B. Any of the following combinations can be run as tests:  
* Two preconfigured endpoints,
* One custom and one preconfigured endpoint, or
* Two [custom endpoints](internet-analyzer-custom-endpoint.md) (one custom endpoint must reside in Azure).

The following preconfigured endpoints are available during preview:

## How is Internet Analyzer different from other monitoring services provided by Azure?

Internet Analyzer helps you understand your end users' performance and assists in making decisions to improve their performance. While other Azure monitoring tools provide insights into your Azure services, Internet Analyzer focuses on measuring end-to-end Internet performance for your users.

## How is measurement data handled by Internet Analyzer?

Azure has [strong security processes and meets a broad range of compliance standards](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/). Only you and your designated team have access to your data. Microsoft staff can have restricted access to it only under specific limited circumstances with your knowledge. It's encrypted in transit and at rest.
