# Query Update Management logs

In addition to the details that are provided during Update Management deployment, you can search the logs stored in your Log Analytics workspace. To search the logs from your Automation account, select **Update management** and open the Log Analytics workspace associated with your deployment.

You can also customize the log queries or use them from different clients. See [Log Analytics search API documentation](https://dev.loganalytics.io/).

## Sample queries

The following sections provide sample log queries for update records that are collected for Update Management.

### Confirm that non-Azure machines are enabled for Update Management

To confirm that directly connected machines are communicating with Azure Monitor logs, run one of the following log searches.

#### Linux

```loganalytics
Heartbeat
| where OSType == "Linux" | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SourceComputerId | top 500000 by Computer asc | render table
```

#### Windows

```loganalytics
Heartbeat
| where OSType == "Windows" | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SourceComputerId | top 500000 by Computer asc | render table
```

On a Windows computer, you can review the following information to verify agent connectivity with Azure Monitor logs:

1. In Control Panel, open **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**. On the **Azure Log Analytics** tab, the agent displays the following message: **The Microsoft Monitoring Agent has successfully connected to Log Analytics**.

1. Open the Windows Event Log. Go to **Application and Services Logs\Operations Manager** and search for Event ID 3000 and Event ID 5002 from the source **Service Connector**. These events indicate that the computer has registered with the Log Analytics workspace and is receiving configuration.

If the agent can't communicate with Azure Monitor logs and the agent is configured to communicate with the internet through a firewall or proxy server, confirm the firewall or proxy server is properly configured. To learn how to verify the firewall or proxy server is properly configured, see [Network configuration for Windows agent](../../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md) or [Network configuration for Linux agent](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-linux-computer.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your Linux systems are configured to communicate with a proxy or Log Analytics Gateway and you're enabling Update Management, update the `proxy.conf` permissions to grant the omiuser group read permission on the file by using the following commands:
>
> `sudo chown omsagent:omiusers /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/proxy.conf`
> `sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/proxy.conf`

Newly added Linux agents show a status of **Updated** after an assessment has been performed. This process can take up to 6 hours.

To confirm that an Operations Manager management group is communicating with Azure Monitor logs, see [Validate Operations Manager integration with Azure Monitor logs](../../azure-monitor/platform/om-agents.md#validate-operations-manager-integration-with-azure-monitor).

### Single Azure VM Assessment queries (Windows)

Replace the VMUUID value with the VM GUID of the virtual machine you're querying. You can find the VMUUID that should be used by running the following query in Azure Monitor logs: `Update | where Computer == "<machine name>" | summarize by Computer, VMUUID`

#### Missing updates summary

```loganalytics
Update
| where TimeGenerated>ago(14h) and OSType!="Linux" and (Optional==false or Classification has "Critical" or Classification has "Security") and VMUUID=~"b08d5afa-1471-4b52-bd95-a44fea6e4ca8"
| summarize hint.strategy=partitioned arg_max(TimeGenerated, UpdateState, Classification, Approved) by Computer, SourceComputerId, UpdateID
| where UpdateState=~"Needed" and Approved!=false
| summarize by UpdateID, Classification
| summarize allUpdatesCount=count(), criticalUpdatesCount=countif(Classification has "Critical"), securityUpdatesCount=countif(Classification has "Security"), otherUpdatesCount=countif(Classification !has "Critical" and Classification !has "Security")
```

#### Missing updates list

```loganalytics

| project-away ClassificationWeight, InformationId, InformationUrl
```

### Single Azure VM assessment queries (Linux)

For some Linux distros, there is an [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) mismatch with the VMUUID value that comes from Azure Resource Manager and what is stored in Azure Monitor logs. The following query checks for a match on either endianness. Replace the VMUUID values with the big-endian and little-endian format of the GUID to properly return the results. You can find the VMUUID that should be used by running the following query in Azure Monitor logs: `Update | where Computer == "<machine name>"
| summarize by Computer, VMUUID`
