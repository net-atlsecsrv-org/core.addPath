# Azure security baseline for Automation

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Automation. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Automation. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Automation have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Automation completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Automation security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Automation account does not yet support Azure Private Link for restricting access to the service through private endpoints. Runbooks that authenticate and run against resources in Azure run on an Azure sandbox, and leverage shared backend resources, which Microsoft is responsible for isolating from each other; their networking is unrestricted and can access public resources. Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

To get further isolation for your runbooks you can use Hybrid Runbook Workers running on Azure virtual machines. When you create an Azure virtual machine, you must create a virtual network (VNet) or use an existing VNet and configure your VMs with a subnet. Ensure that all deployed subnets have a Network Security Group applied with network access controls specific to your applications trusted ports and sources. For service-specific requirements, refer to the security recommendation for that specific service. 
Alternatively, if you have a specific requirement, Azure Firewall may also be used to meet it.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Azure Automation currently does not have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, ensure the subnet containing those workers are enabled with a Network Security Group (NSG) and configure flow logs to forward logs to a Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also forward NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

While NSG rules and user-defined routes do not apply to private endpoint, NSG flow logs and monitoring information for outbound connections are still supported and can be used.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, enable Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Standard protection on your Virtual Networks hosting your Hybrid Runbook Workers to guard against DDoS attacks. By using Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence, you can deny communications with known malicious IP addresses.  Configure Azure Firewall on each of the Virtual Network segments, with Threat Intelligence enabled, and configure to **Alert and deny** for malicious network traffic.

You can use Azure Security Center's Just In Time Network access to limit exposure of Windows virtual machines to the approved IP addresses for a limited period of time.  Also, use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations for NSG configurations to limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers, this control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, then you can record NSG flow logs into a storage account to generate flow records for your Azure Virtual Machines that are acting as runbook workers. When investigating anomalous activity, you could enable Network Watcher packet capture so that network traffic can be reviewed for unusual and unexpected activity.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers hosted on Azure virtual machines, you can combine packet captures provided by Network Watcher and open source IDS tools to perform network intrusion detection for a wide range of threats to those worker machines. Also, you can deploy Azure Firewall to the Virtual Network segments as appropriate, with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall configured in Azure which require access to your Automation Resources. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (for example, GuestAndHybridManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

- [Understand and using Service Tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources used by Azure Automation with Azure Policy.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resources Manager templates, Azure RBAC controls, and policies, in a single blueprint definition. You can apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use Tags for NSGs and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) built-in administrator roles which can be explicitly assigned and can be queried. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups. Whenever using Automation Account Run As accounts for your runbooks, ensure these service principals are also tracked in your inventory since they often time have elevated permissions. Delete any unused Run As accounts to minimize your exposed attack surface.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Automation Account does not have the concept of default passwords.  Customers are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords that run on top on the service or its Hybrid Runbook Workers.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts. Whenever using Automation Account Run As accounts for your runbooks, ensure these service principals are also tracked in your inventory since they often time have elevated permissions. Scope these identities with the least privileged permissions they need in order for your runbooks to successfully perform their automated process. Delete any unused Run As accounts to minimize your exposed attack surface.

You can also enable a Just-In-Time / Just-Enough-Access by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management Privileged Roles for Microsoft Services, and Azure Resource Manager.

- [How to configure named locations in Azure](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials. If using Hybrid Runbook Workers you may leverage managed identities instead of Run As Accounts to enable more seamless secure permissions.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides logs to help discover stale accounts. In addition, use Azure identity access reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right users have continued access. Whenever using Automation Account Run As accounts for your runbooks ensure these service principals are also tracked in your inventory since they often time have elevated permissions. Delete any unused Run As accounts to minimize your exposed attack surface.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.1: Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information

**Guidance**: Use tags to assist in tracking Azure Automation resources which store or process sensitive information. 

- [How to create and use tags](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. Isolate environments by using separate Automation Account resources. Resources like Hybrid Runbook Workers should be separated by virtual network/subnet, tagged appropriately, and secured within a network security group (NSG) or Azure Firewall. For virtual machines storing or processing sensitive data, implement policy and procedure(s) to turn them off when not in use.

### 4.3: Monitor and block unauthorized transfer of sensitive information

**Guidance**: When using the Hybrid Runbook Worker feature, leverage a third-party solution from Azure Marketplace on network perimeters that monitors for unauthorized transfer of sensitive information and blocks such transfers while alerting information security professionals.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.4: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit. Ensure that any clients connecting to your Azure resources in Azure virtual networks are able to negotiate TLS 1.2 or higher. Azure Automation fully supports and enforces transport layer (TLS) 1.2  and all client calls or later versions for all external HTPS endpoints (through webhooks, DSC nodes, hybrid runbook worker).

Follow Azure Security Center recommendations for encryption at rest and encryption in transit, where applicable.

**Responsibility**: Shared

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.5: Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data

**Guidance**: Use a third-party active discovery tool to identify all sensitive information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization's technology systems, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider and update the organization's sensitive information inventory.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access to Azure Automation resources using the built-in role definitions, assign access for users accessing your automation resources following a least privileged or 'just-enough' access model. When using Hybrid Runbook Workers, leverage managed identities for those virtual machines to avoid using service principals, when using both the multi-tenant or Hybrid Runbook Workers make sure to apply properly scoped Azure RBAC permissions on the identity of the runbook workers.

- [How to configure Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)

- [Manage role permissions and security](automation-role-based-access-control.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.7: Use host-based data loss prevention to enforce access control

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently expose the underlying multi-tenant runbook worker's virtual machines, and this is handled by the platform. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, then you need to use a third-party host-based data loss prevention solution to enforce access controls to your hosted Hybrid Runbook Worker virtual machines.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Use customer-managed keys with Azure Automation. Azure Automation supports the use of customer-managed keys to encrypt all 'Secure assets' used such as: credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. Leverage encrypted variables with your runbooks for all of your persistent variable lookup needs to prevent unintended exposure.

When using Hybrid Runbook Workers, the virtual disks on the virtual machines are encrypted at rest using either server-side encryption or Azure disk encryption (ADE). Azure disk encryption leverages the BitLocker feature of Windows to encrypt managed disks with customer-managed keys within the guest VM. Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys improves on ADE by enabling you to use any OS types and images for your VMs by encrypting data in the Storage service.
