# Azure security baseline for Automation

The Azure Security Baseline for Automation contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Automation account does not yet support Azure Private Link for restricting access to the service through private endpoints. Runbooks that authenticate and run against resources in Azure run on an Azure sandbox, and leverage shared backend resources, which Microsoft is responsible for isolating from each other; their networking is unrestricted and can access public resources. Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

To get further isolation for your runbooks you can use Hybrid Runbook Workers running on Azure virtual machines. When you create an Azure virtual machine, you must create a virtual network (VNet) or use an existing VNet and configure your VMs with a subnet. Ensure that all deployed subnets have a Network Security Group applied with network access controls specific to your applications trusted ports and sources. For service-specific requirements, refer to the security recommendation for that specific service.

Alternatively, if you have a specific requirement, Azure Firewall may also be used to meet it.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Azure Automation currently does not have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, ensure the subnet containing those workers are enabled with a Network Security Group (NSG) and configure flow logs to forward logs to a Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also forward NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

While NSG rules and user defined routes do not apply to private endpoint, NSG flow logs and monitoring information for outbound connections are still supported and can be used.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, enable Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Standard protection on your Virtual Networks hosting your Hybrid Runbook Workers to guard against DDoS attacks. By using Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence, you can deny communications with known malicious IP addresses. Configure Azure Firewall on each of the Virtual Network segments, with Threat Intelligence enabled, and configure to **Alert and deny** for malicious network traffic.

You can use Azure Security Center's Just In Time Network access to limit exposure of Windows virtual machines to the approved IP addresses for a limited period of time. Also, use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations for NSG configurations to limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers, this control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, then you can record NSG flow logs into a storage account to generate flow records for your Azure Virtual Machines that are acting as runbook workers. When investigating anomalous activity, you could enable Network Watcher packet capture so that network traffic can be reviewed for unusual and unexpected activity.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently have virtual network integration for private networking beyond the support for Hybrid Runbook Workers. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers hosted on Azure virtual machines, you can combine packet captures provided by Network Watcher and open source IDS tools to perform network intrusion detection for a wide range of threats to those worker machines. Also, you can deploy Azure Firewall to the Virtual Network segments as appropriate, with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall configured in Azure which require access to your Automation Resources. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (for example, GuestAndHybridManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use Tags for NSGs and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### 4.5: Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data

**Guidance**: Use a third-party active discovery tool to identify all sensitive information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization's technology systems, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider and update the organization's sensitive information inventory.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.6: Use Azure RBAC to control access to resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access to Azure Automation resources using the built-in role definitions, assign access for users accessing your automation resources following a least privileged or 'just-enough' access model. When using Hybrid Runbook Workers, leverage managed identities for those virtual machines to avoid using service principals, when using both the multi-tenant or Hybrid Runbook Workers make sure to apply properly scoped Azure RBAC permissions on the identity of the runbook workers.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.7: Use host-based data loss prevention to enforce access control

**Guidance**: Azure Automation does not currently expose the underlying multi-tenant runbook worker's virtual machines, and this is handled by the platform. This control is not applicable if you are using the out-of-the box service without Hybrid Runbook Workers.

If you are using Hybrid Runbook Workers backed by Azure virtual machines, then you need to use a third-party host-based data loss prevention solution to enforce access controls to your hosted Hybrid Runbook Worker virtual machines.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Use customer-managed keys with Azure Automation. Azure Automation supports the use of customer-managed keys to encrypt all 'Secure assets' used such as : credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. Leverage encrypted variables with your runbooks for all of your persistent variable lookup needs to prevent unintended exposure.

When using Hybrid Runbook Workers, the virtual disks on the virtual machines are encrypted at rest using either server-side encryption or Azure disk encryption (ADE). Azure disk encryption leverages the BitLocker feature of Windows to encrypt managed disks with customer-managed keys within the guest VM. Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys improves on ADE by enabling you to use any OS types and images for your VMs by encrypting data in the Storage service.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
