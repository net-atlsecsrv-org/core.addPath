# Deploy a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker

You can use the Hybrid Runbook Worker feature of Azure Automation to run runbooks directly on the machine that's hosting the role and against resources in the environment to manage those local resources. Azure Automation stores and manages runbooks and then delivers them to one or more designated machines. This article describes how to deploy a Hybrid Runbook Worker on a Windows machine, how to remove the worker, and how to remove a Hybrid Runbook Worker group.

After you successfully deploy a runbook worker, review [Run runbooks on a Hybrid Runbook Worker](automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md) to learn how to configure your runbooks to automate processes in your on-premises datacenter or other cloud environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have the following.

### A Log Analytics workspace

The Hybrid Runbook Worker role depends on an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace to install and configure the role. You can create it through [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-monitor/samples/resource-manager-workspace.md#create-a-log-analytics-workspace), through [PowerShell](../azure-monitor/scripts/powershell-sample-create-workspace.md?toc=/powershell/module/toc.json), or in the [Azure portal](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md).

If you don't have an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace, review the [Azure Monitor Log design guidance](../azure-monitor/platform/design-logs-deployment.md) before you create the workspace.

If you have a workspace, but it is not linked to your Automation account, enabling an Automation feature adds functionality for Azure Automation, including support for the Hybrid Runbook Worker. When you enable one of the Azure Automation features in your Log Analytics workspace, specifically [Update Management](update-management/update-mgmt-overview.md) or [Change Tracking and Inventory](change-tracking.md), the worker components are automatically pushed to the agent machine.

> [!NOTE]
> When enabling Update Management or Change Tracking and Inventory feature, Azure Automation only supports certain regions for linking a Log Analytics workspace and an Automation account. For a list of the supported mapping pairs, see [Region mapping for Automation account and Log Analytics workspace](how-to/region-mappings.md). Before enabling either feature, review the [Azure pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/automation/) information for Azure Automation.

   To add the Update Management feature to your workspace, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell-interactive
   Set-AzOperationalInsightsIntelligencePack -ResourceGroupName <logAnalyticsResourceGroup> -WorkspaceName <logAnalyticsWorkspaceName> -IntelligencePackName "Updates" -Enabled $true
```

   To add the Change Tracking and Inventory feature to your workspace, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell-interactive
   Set-AzOperationalInsightsIntelligencePack -ResourceGroupName <logAnalyticsResourceGroup> -WorkspaceName <logAnalyticsWorkspaceName> -IntelligencePackName "ChangeTracking" -Enabled $true
```

### Log Analytics agent

The Hybrid Runbook Worker role requires the [Log Analytics agent](../azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent.md) for the supported Windows operating system.

### Supported Windows operating system

The following versions of the Windows operating system are officially supported for a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker:

* Windows Server 2019
* Windows Server 2016, version 1709 and 1803
* Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2008 SP2 (x64), 2008 R2
* Windows 10 Enterprise (including multi-session) and Pro
* Windows 8 Enterprise and Pro
* Windows 7 SP1

### Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements for a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker are:

* Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later ([download WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616))
* .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later
* Two cores
* 4 GB of RAM
* Port 443 (outbound)

### Network configuration

To get more networking requirements for the Hybrid Runbook Worker, see [Configuring your network](automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

### Adding a machine to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group

You can add the worker machine to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group in your Automation account. Note that you must support Automation runbooks as long as you're using the same account for both the Azure Automation feature and the Hybrid Runbook Worker group membership. This functionality has been added to version 7.2.12024.0 of the Hybrid Runbook Worker.

>[!NOTE]
>Enabling Azure Automation [Update Management](update-management/update-mgmt-overview.md) automatically configures any Windows machine that's connected to your Log Analytics workspace as a Hybrid Runbook Worker to support managing its operating system updates. However, this worker is not registered with any Hybrid Runbook Worker groups already defined in your Automation account.

## Enabling machines for management with Azure Automation State Configuration

For information about enabling machines for management with Azure Automation State Configuration, see [Enable machines for management by Azure Automation State Configuration](automation-dsc-onboarding.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To manage the configuration of machines that support the Hybrid Runbook Worker role with Desired State Configuration (DSC), you must add the machines as DSC nodes.

## Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker installation options

To install and configure a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker, you can use one of the following methods.

* For Azure VMs, install the Log Analytics agent for Windows using the [virtual machine extension for Windows](../virtual-machines/extensions/oms-windows.md). The extension installs the Log Analytics agent on Azure virtual machines, and enrolls virtual machines into an existing Log Analytics workspace using an Azure Resource Manager template or PowerShell. Once the agent is installed, the VM can be added to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group in your Automation account.

* For non-Azure VMs, install the Log Analytics agent for Windows using the deployment options described in the [Connect Windows computers to Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md) article. You can repeat this process for multiple machine to add multiple workers to your environment. Once the agent is installed, the VMs can be added to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group in your Automation account.

* Use a provided PowerShell script to completely [automate](#automated-deployment) the process of configuring one or more Windows machines. This is the recommended method for machines in your datacenter or another cloud environment.

## Automated deployment

On the target machine, perform the following steps to automate the installation and configuration of the Windows Hybrid Worker role using the PowerShell script **New-OnPremiseHybridWorker.ps1**. The script performs the following steps:

* Installs the necessary modules
* Signs in with your Azure account
* Verifies the existence of specified resource group and Automation account
* Creates references to Automation account attributes
* Creates an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace if not specified
* Enable the Azure Automation solution in the workspace
* Download and install the Log Analytics agent for Windows
* Register the machine as Hybrid Runbook Worker

### Step 1 - Download the PowerShell script

Download the **New-OnPremiseHybridWorker.ps1** script from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/New-OnPremiseHybridWorker). After you have downloaded the script, copy or run it on the target machine. The **New-OnPremiseHybridWorker.ps1** script uses the parameters described below during execution.

| Parameter | Status | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `AAResourceGroupName` | Mandatory | The name of the resource group that's associated with your Automation account. |
| `AutomationAccountName` | Mandatory | The name of your Automation account.
| `Credential` | Optional | The credentials to use when logging in to the Azure environment. |
| `HybridGroupName` | Mandatory | The name of a Hybrid Runbook Worker group that you specify as a target for the runbooks that support this scenario. |
| `OMSResourceGroupName` | Optional | The name of the resource group for the Log Analytics workspace. If this resource group is not specified, the value of `AAResourceGroupName` is used. |
| `SubscriptionID` | Mandatory | The identifier of the Azure subscription associated with your Automation account. |
| `TenantID` | Optional | The identifier of the tenant organization associated with your Automation account. |
| `WorkspaceName` | Optional | The Log Analytics workspace name. If you don't have a Log Analytics workspace, the script creates and configures one. |

### Step 2 - Open Windows PowerShell command line shell

From the **Start Menu** click **Start**, type **PowerShell**, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Run as administrator**.

### Step 3 - Run the PowerShell script

In the PowerShell command line shell, browse to the folder that contains the script that you have downloaded. Change the values for the parameters `AutomationAccountName`, `AAResourceGroupName`, `OMSResourceGroupName`, `HybridGroupName`, `SubscriptionID`, and `WorkspaceName`. Then run the script.

You're prompted to authenticate with Azure after you run the script. You must sign in with an account that's a member of the Subscription Admins role and co-administrator of the subscription.

```powershell-interactive
$NewOnPremiseHybridWorkerParameters = @{
  AutomationAccountName = <nameOfAutomationAccount>
  AAResourceGroupName   = <nameOfResourceGroup>
  OMSResourceGroupName  = <nameOfResourceGroup>
  HybridGroupName       = <nameOfHRWGroup>
  SubscriptionID        = <subscriptionId>
  WorkspaceName         = <nameOfLogAnalyticsWorkspace>
}
.\New-OnPremiseHybridWorker.ps1 @NewOnPremiseHybridWorkerParameters
```

### Step 4 - Install NuGet

You're prompted to agree to install NuGet, and to authenticate with your Azure credentials. If you don't have the latest NuGet version, you can download it from [Available NuGet Distribution Versions](https://www.nuget.org/downloads).

### Step 5 - Verify the deployment

After the script is finished, the Hybrid Worker Groups page in your Automation account shows the new group and the number of members. If it's an existing group, the number of members is incremented. You can select the group from the list on the Hybrid Worker Groups page and choose the **Hybrid Workers** tile. On the Hybrid Workers page, you can see each member of the group listed.

## Manual deployment

To install and configure a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker, perform the following steps.

### Step 1 - Verify agent is reporting to workspace

The Log Analytics agent for Windows connects machines to an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace. When you install the agent on your machine and connect it to your workspace, it automatically downloads the components that are required for the Hybrid Runbook Worker.

When the agent has successfully connected to your Log Analytics workspace after a few minutes, you can run the following query to verify that it is sending heartbeat data to the workspace.

```kusto
Heartbeat 
| where Category == "Direct Agent"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
```

In the search results, you should see heartbeat records for the machine, indicating that it is connected and reporting to the service. By default, every agent forwards a heartbeat record to its assigned workspace. Use the following steps to complete the agent installation and setup.

1. Enable the feature to add the agent machine. For Update Management and Azure VMs, see [Enable Update Management from an Automation account](update-management/update-mgmt-enable-automation-account.md), [Enable Update Management by browsing the Azure portal](update-management/update-mgmt-enable-portal.md), [Enable Update Management from a runbook](update-management/update-mgmt-enable-runbook.md), or [Enable Update Management from an Azure VM](update-management/update-mgmt-enable-vm.md). For Change Tracking and Azure VMs, see [Enable Azure VMs](automation-enable-changes-from-auto-acct.md#enable-azure-vms), and for non-Azure VMs see [Enable machines in the workspace](automation-enable-changes-from-auto-acct.md#enable-machines-in-the-workspace).

2. To confirm the version of the Hybrid Runbook Worker, browse to `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\AzureAutomation\` and note the **version** subfolder.

### Step 2 - Install the runbook environment and connect to Azure Automation

When you configure an agent to report to a Log Analytics workspace, the Azure Automation feature pushes down the `HybridRegistration` PowerShell module, which contains the `Add-HybridRunbookWorker` cmdlet. Use this cmdlet to install the runbook environment on the machine and register it with Azure Automation.

Open a PowerShell session in Administrator mode and run the following commands to import the module.

```powershell-interactive
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\AzureAutomation\<version>\HybridRegistration"
Import-Module .\HybridRegistration.psd1
```

Now run the `Add-HybridRunbookWorker` cmdlet using the following syntax.

```powershell-interactive
Add-HybridRunbookWorker –GroupName <String> -Url <Url> -Key <String>
```

You can get the information required for the parameters `Url` and `Key` from the **Keys** page in your Automation account. Select **Keys** under the **Account settings** section from the left-hand side of the page.

![Manage Keys page](media/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker/elements-panel-keys.png)

* For the `Url` parameter, copy the value for **URL**.

* For the `Key` parameter, copy the value for **PRIMARY ACCESS KEY**.

* For the `GroupName` parameter, use the name of the Hybrid Runbook Worker group. If this group already exists in the Automation account, the current machine is added to it. If this group doesn't exist, it's added.

* If required, set the `Verbose` parameter to receive details about the installation.

### Step 3 -  Install PowerShell modules

Runbooks can use any of the activities and cmdlets defined in the modules installed in your Azure Automation environment. As these modules are not automatically deployed to on-premises machines, you must install them manually. The exception is the Azure module. This module is installed by default and provides access to cmdlets for all Azure services and activities for Azure Automation.

Because the primary purpose of the Hybrid Runbook Worker is to manage local resources, you most likely need to install the modules that support these resources, particularly the `PowerShellGet` module. For information on installing Windows PowerShell modules, see [Windows PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/developer/windows-powershell).

Modules that are installed must be in a location referenced by the `PSModulePath` environment variable so that the hybrid worker can automatically import them. For more information, see [Install Modules in PSModulePath](/powershell/scripting/developer/module/installing-a-powershell-module?view=powershell-7).

## <a name="remove-windows-hybrid-runbook-worker"></a>Remove the Hybrid Runbook Worker from an on-premises Windows machine

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Automation account.

2. Under **Account Settings**, select **Keys** and note the values for **URL** and **Primary Access Key**.

3. Open a PowerShell session in Administrator mode and run the following command with your URL and primary access key values. Use the `Verbose` parameter for a detailed log of the removal process. To remove stale machines from your Hybrid Worker group, use the optional `machineName` parameter.

```powershell-interactive
Remove-HybridRunbookWorker -Url <URL> -Key <primaryAccessKey> -MachineName <computerName>
```

## Remove a Hybrid Worker group

To remove a Hybrid Runbook Worker group, you first need to remove the Hybrid Runbook Worker from every machine that is a member of the group. Then use the following steps to remove the group:

1. Open the Automation account in the Azure portal.

2. Select **Hybrid worker groups** under **Process Automation**. Select the group that you want to delete. The properties page for that group appears.

   ![Properties page](media/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker-group-properties.png)

3. On the properties page for the selected group, select **Delete**. A message asks you to confirm this action. Select **Yes** if you're sure that you want to continue.

   ![Confirmation message](media/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker-confirm-delete.png)

   This process can take several seconds to finish. You can track its progress under **Notifications** from the menu.
