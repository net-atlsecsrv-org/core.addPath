# Manage credentials in Azure Automation

An Automation credential asset holds an object that contains security credentials, such as a user name and a password. Runbooks and DSC configurations use cmdlets that accept a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=pscore-6.2.0) object for authentication. Alternatively, they can extract the user name and password of the `PSCredential` object to provide to some application or service requiring authentication. 

>[!NOTE]
>Secure assets in Azure Automation include credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. These assets are encrypted and stored in Azure Automation using a unique key that is generated for each Automation account. Azure Automation stores the key in the system-managed Key Vault. Before storing a secure asset, Automation loads the key from Key Vault and then uses it to encrypt the asset.

## PowerShell cmdlets used to access credentials

The cmdlets in the following table create and manage Automation credentials with PowerShell. They ship as part of the [Az modules](modules.md#az-modules).

| Cmdlet | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| [Get-AzAutomationCredential](/powershell/module/az.automation/get-azautomationcredential?view=azps-3.3.0) |Retrieves a [CredentialInfo](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.commands.automation.model.credentialinfo?view=azurerm-ps) object containing metadata about the credential. The cmdlet doesn't retrieve the `PSCredential` object itself.  |
| [New-AzAutomationCredential](/powershell/module/az.automation/new-azautomationcredential?view=azps-3.3.0) |Creates a new Automation credential. |
| [Remove-AzAutomationCredential](/powershell/module/az.automation/remove-azautomationcredential?view=azps-3.3.0) |Removes an Automation credential. |
| [Set-AzAutomationCredential](/powershell/module/az.automation/set-azautomationcredential?view=azps-3.3.0) |Sets the properties for an existing Automation credential. |

## Other cmdlets used to access credentials

The cmdlets in the following table are used to access credentials in your runbooks and DSC configurations. 

| Cmdlet | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| `Get-AutomationPSCredential` |Gets a `PSCredential` object to use in a runbook or DSC configuration. Most often, you should use this [internal cmdlet](modules.md#internal-cmdlets) instead of the `Get-AzAutomationCredential` cmdlet, as the latter only retrieves credential information. This information isn't normally helpful to pass to another cmdlet. |
| [Get-Credential](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential?view=powershell-7) |Gets a credential with a prompt for user name and password. This cmdlet is part of the default Microsoft.PowerShell.Security module. See [Default modules](modules.md#default-modules).|
| [New-AzureAutomationCredential](/powershell/module/servicemanagement/azure.service/new-azureautomationcredential?view=azuresmps-4.0.0) | Creates a credential asset. This cmdlet is part of the default Azure module. See [Default modules](modules.md#default-modules).|

To retrieve `PSCredential` objects in your code, you must import the `Orchestrator.AssetManagement.Cmdlets` module. For more information, see [Manage modules in Azure Automation](modules.md).

```azurepowershell
Import-Module Orchestrator.AssetManagement.Cmdlets -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should avoid using variables in the `Name` parameter of `Get-AutomationPSCredential`. Their use can complicate discovery of dependencies between runbooks or DSC configurations and credential assets at design time.

## Python 2 functions that access credentials

The function in the following table is used to access credentials in a Python 2 runbook.

| Function | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `automationassets.get_automation_credential` | Retrieves information about a credential asset. |

> [!NOTE]
> Import the `automationassets` module at the top of your Python runbook to access the asset functions.

## Create a new credential asset

You can create a new credential asset using the Azure portal or using Windows PowerShell.

### Create a new credential asset with the Azure portal

1. From your Automation account, select **Credentials** under **Shared Resources**.
1. Select **Add a credential**.
2. In the New Credential pane, enter an appropriate credential name following your naming standards. 
3. Type your access ID in the **User name** field. 
4. For both password fields, enter your secret access key.

    ![Create new credential](../media/credentials/credential-create.png)

5. If the multi-factor authentication box is checked, uncheck it. 
6. Click **Create** to save the new credential asset.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Automation does not support user accounts that use multi-factor authentication.

### Create a new credential asset with Windows PowerShell

The following example shows how to create a new Automation credential asset. A `PSCredential` object is first created with the name and password, and then used to create the credential asset. Instead, you can use the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to prompt the user to type in a name and password.

```powershell
$user = "MyDomain\MyUser"
$pw = ConvertTo-SecureString "PassWord!" -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object –TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential –ArgumentList $user, $pw
New-AzureAutomationCredential -AutomationAccountName "MyAutomationAccount" -Name "MyCredential" -Value $cred
```

## Get a credential asset

A runbook or DSC configuration retrieves a credential asset with the internal `Get-AutomationPSCredential` cmdlet. This cmdlet gets a `PSCredential` object that you can use with a cmdlet that requires a credential. You can also retrieve the properties of the credential object to use individually. The object has properties for the user name and the secure password. 

> [!NOTE]
> The `Get-AzAutomationCredential` cmdlet does not retrieve a `PSCredential` object that can be used for authentication. It only provides information about the credential. If you need to use a credential in a runbook, you must retrieve it as a `PSCredential` object using `Get-AutomationPSCredential`.

Alternatively, you can use the [GetNetworkCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential.getnetworkcredential?view=pscore-6.2.0) method to retrieve a [NetworkCredential](/dotnet/api/system.net.networkcredential) object that represents an unsecured version of the password.

### Textual runbook example

The following example shows how to use a PowerShell credential in a runbook. It retrieves the credential and assigns its user name and password to variables.


```azurepowershell
$myCredential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name 'MyCredential'
$userName = $myCredential.UserName
$securePassword = $myCredential.Password
$password = $myCredential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
```

You can also use a credential to authenticate to Azure with [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount?view=azps-3.3.0). Under most circumstances, you should use a [Run As account](../manage-runas-account.md) and retrieve the connection with [Get-AzAutomationConnection](../automation-connections.md).


```azurepowershell
$myCred = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name 'MyCredential'
$userName = $myCred.UserName
$securePassword = $myCred.Password
$password = $myCred.GetNetworkCredential().Password

$myPsCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($userName,$password)

Connect-AzAccount -Credential $myPsCred
```

### Graphical runbook example

You can add an activity for the internal `Get-AutomationPSCredential` cmdlet to a graphical runbook by right-clicking on the credential in the Library pane of the graphical editor and selecting **Add to canvas**.

![Add credential to canvas](../media/credentials/credential-add-canvas.png)

The following image shows an example of using a credential in a graphical runbook. In this case, the credential provides authentication for a runbook to Azure resources, as described in [Use Azure AD in Azure Automation to authenticate to Azure](../automation-use-azure-ad.md). The first activity retrieves the credential that has access to the Azure subscription. The account connection activity then uses this credential to provide authentication for any activities that come after it. A [pipeline link](../automation-graphical-authoring-intro.md#use-links-for-workflow) is used here since `Get-AutomationPSCredential` is expecting a single object.

## Use credentials in a DSC configuration

While DSC configurations in Azure Automation can work with credential assets using `Get-AutomationPSCredential`, they can also pass credential assets via parameters. For more information, see [Compiling configurations in Azure Automation DSC](../automation-dsc-compile.md#credential-assets).

## Use credentials in a Python 2 runbook

The following example shows an example of accessing credentials in Python 2 runbooks.


```python
import automationassets
from automationassets import AutomationAssetNotFound

# get a credential
cred = automationassets.get_automation_credential("credtest")
print cred["username"]
print cred["password"]
```
