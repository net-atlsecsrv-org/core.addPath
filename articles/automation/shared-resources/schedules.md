# Manage schedules in Azure Automation

To schedule a runbook in Azure Automation to start at a specified time, you link it to one or more schedules. A schedule can be configured to either run once or on a reoccurring hourly or daily schedule for runbooks in the Azure  portal. You can also schedule them for weekly, monthly, specific days of the week or days of the month, or a particular day of the month. A runbook can be linked to multiple schedules, and a schedule can have multiple runbooks linked to it.

> [!NOTE]
> Schedules do not currently support Azure Automation DSC configurations.

>[!NOTE]
>This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-3.5.0). For Az module installation instructions on your Hybrid Runbook Worker, see [Install the Azure PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.5.0). For your Automation account, you can update your modules to the latest version using [How to update Azure PowerShell modules in Azure Automation](../automation-update-azure-modules.md).

## Creating a schedule

You can create a new schedule for runbooks in the Azure portal or with PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Automation uses the latest modules in your Automation account when a new scheduled job is run.  To avoid impacting your runbooks and the processes they automate, you should first test any runbooks that have linked schedules with an Automation account dedicated for testing.  This validates your scheduled runbooks continue to work correctly and if not, you can further troubleshoot and apply any changes required before migrating the updated runbook version to production.
> Your Automation account does not automatically get any new versions of modules unless you have updated them manually by selecting the [Update Azure Modules](../automation-update-azure-modules.md) option from the **Modules**.

### Create a new schedule in the Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, from your automation account, select **Schedules** under the section **Shared Resources** on the left.
2. Click **Add a schedule** at the top of the page.
3. On the New schedule pane, type a name and optionally a description for the new schedule.
4. Select whether the schedule runs one time, or on a reoccurring schedule by selecting **Once** or **Recurring**. If you select **Once**, specify a start time and then click **Create**. If you select **Recurring**, specify a start time. For **Recur every**, select how often you want the runbook to repeat - by hour, day, week, or month.
    1. If you select **week**, the days of the week are presented for you to choose from. Select as many days as you want. The first run of your schedule will happen on the first day selected after the start time. For example, to choose a weekend schedule, select Saturday and Sunday.

    2. If you select **month**, you're given different options. For the **Monthly occurrences** option, select either **Month days** or **Week days**. If you choose **Month days**, a calendar is shown that allows you to choose as many days as you want. If you choose a date such as the 31st that doesn't occur in the current month, the schedule won't run. If you want the schedule to run on the last day, choose **Yes** under **Run on last day of month**. If you choose **Week days**, the **Recur every** option is presented. Choose **First**, **Second**, **Third**, **Fourth**, or **Last**. Finally choose a day to repeat on.

5. When done click **Create**.

### Create a new schedule with PowerShell

Use the [New-AzAutomationSchedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Az.Automation/New-AzAutomationSchedule?view=azps-3.7.0) cmdlet to create schedules. You specify the start time for the schedule and the frequency it should run. The following examples show how to create many different schedule scenarios.

#### Create a one-time schedule

The following sample commands create a one time schedule.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$TimeZone = ([System.TimeZoneInfo]::Local).Id
New-AzAutomationSchedule -AutomationAccountName "ContosoAutomation" -Name "Schedule01" -StartTime "23:00" -OneTime -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" -TimeZone $TimeZone
```

#### Create a recurring schedule

The following example shows how to create a recurring schedule that runs every day at 1:00PM for a year.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$StartTime = Get-Date "13:00:00"
$EndTime = $StartTime.AddYears(1)
New-AzAutomationSchedule -AutomationAccountName "ContosoAutomation" -Name "Schedule02" -StartTime $StartTime -ExpiryTime $EndTime -DayInterval 1 -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
```

#### Create a weekly recurring schedule

The following example shows how to create a weekly schedule that runs on weekdays only.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$StartTime = (Get-Date "13:00:00").AddDays(1)
[System.DayOfWeek[]]$WeekDays = @([System.DayOfWeek]::Monday..[System.DayOfWeek]::Friday)
New-AzAutomationSchedule -AutomationAccountName "ContosoAutomation" -Name "Schedule03" -StartTime $StartTime -WeekInterval 1 -DaysOfWeek $WeekDays -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
```

#### Create a weekly recurring schedule for weekends

The following sample commands show how to create a weekly schedule that runs on weekends only.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$StartTime = (Get-Date "18:00:00").AddDays(1)
[System.DayOfWeek[]]$WeekendDays = @([System.DayOfWeek]::Saturday,[System.DayOfWeek]::Sunday)
New-AzAutomationSchedule -AutomationAccountName "ContosoAutomation" -Name "Weekends 6PM" -StartTime $StartTime -WeekInterval 1 -DaysOfWeek $WeekendDays -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
```

#### Create a recurring schedule for first, 15th, and last days of the month

The following example shows how to create a recurring schedule that runs on the 1st, 15th, and last day of a month.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$StartTime = (Get-Date "18:00:00").AddDays(1)
New-AzAutomationSchedule -AutomationAccountName "TestAzureAuto" -Name "1st, 15th and Last" -StartTime $StartTime -DaysOfMonth @("One", "Fifteenth", "Last") -ResourceGroupName "TestAzureAuto" -MonthInterval 1
```

## Linking a schedule to a runbook

A runbook can be linked to multiple schedules, and a schedule can have multiple runbooks linked to it. If a runbook has parameters, then you can provide values for them. You must provide values for any mandatory parameters and may provide values for any optional parameters. These values are used each time the runbook is started by this schedule. You can attach the same runbook to another schedule and specify different parameter values.

### Link a schedule to a runbook with the Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, from your automation account, select **Runbooks** under **Process Automation**.
2. Click on the name of the runbook to schedule.
3. If the runbook isn't currently linked to a schedule, then you're offered the option to create a new schedule or link to an existing schedule.
4. If the runbook has parameters, you can select the option **Modify run settings (Default:Azure)** and the Parameters pane is presented. You can enter parameter information here.

### Link a schedule to a runbook with PowerShell

Use the [Register-AzAutomationScheduledRunbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Az.Automation/Register-AzAutomationScheduledRunbook?view=azps-3.7.0) cmdlet to link a schedule. You can specify values for the runbookâ€™s parameters with the Parameters parameter. For more information on specifying parameter values,
see [Starting a Runbook in Azure Automation](../automation-starting-a-runbook.md).
The following example shows how to link a schedule to a runbook using an Azure Resource Manager cmdlet with parameters.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$automationAccountName = "MyAutomationAccount"
$runbookName = "Test-Runbook"
$scheduleName = "Sample-DailySchedule"
$params = @{"FirstName"="Joe";"LastName"="Smith";"RepeatCount"=2;"Show"=$true}
Register-AzAutomationScheduledRunbook â€“AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName `
â€“Name $runbookName â€“ScheduleName $scheduleName â€“Parameters $params `
-ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
```

## Scheduling runbooks to run more frequently

The most frequent interval a schedule in Azure Automation can be configured for is one hour. If you require schedules to execute more frequently than that, there are two options:

* Create a [webhook](../automation-webhooks.md) for the runbook and use [Azure Logic Apps](../../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) to call the webhook. Azure Logic Apps provides more fine-grained granularity when defining a schedule.

* Create four schedules all starting within 15 minutes of each other running once every hour. This scenario allows the runbook to run every 15 minutes with the different schedules.

## Disabling a schedule

When you disable a schedule, any runbook linked to it no longer runs on that schedule. You can manually disable a schedule or set an expiration time for schedules with a frequency when you create them. Once the expiration time is reached, the schedule is disabled.

### Disable a schedule from the Azure portal

1. In your Automation account, select **Schedules** under **Shared Resources**.
2. Click the name of a schedule to open the details pane.
3. Change **Enabled** to **No**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to disable a schedule that has a start time in the past, you must change the start date to a time in the future before saving it.

### Disable a schedule with PowerShell

Use the [Set-AzAutomationSchedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Az.Automation/Set-AzAutomationSchedule?view=azps-3.7.0) cmdlet to change the properties of an existing schedule. To disable the schedule, specify False for the `IsEnabled` parameter.

The following example shows how to disable a schedule for a runbook using an Azure Resource Manager cmdlet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$automationAccountName = "MyAutomationAccount"
$scheduleName = "Sample-MonthlyDaysOfMonthSchedule"
Set-AzAutomationSchedule â€“AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName `
â€“Name $scheduleName â€“IsEnabled $false -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
```

## Removing a schedule

When you're ready to remove your schedules, you can either use the Azure portal or the `Remove-AzureRmAutomationSchedule` cmdlet. Remember that you can only remove a schedule that has been disabled as described in the previous section.

### Remove a schedule using the Azure portal

1. In your Automation account, select **Schedules** under **Shared Resources**.
2. Click the name of a schedule to open the details pane.
3. Click **Delete**.

### Remove a schedule with PowerShell

You can use the [Remove-AzAutomationSchedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Az.Automation/Remove-AzAutomationSchedule?view=azps-3.7.0) cmdlet to delete an existing schedule. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
$automationAccountName = "MyAutomationAccount"
$scheduleName = "Sample-MonthlyDaysOfMonthSchedule"
Remove-AzAutomationSchedule -AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName `
-Name $scheduleName -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
```
