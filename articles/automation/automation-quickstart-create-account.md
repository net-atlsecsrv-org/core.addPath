# Create an Azure Automation account

Azure Automation accounts can be created through Azure. This method provides a browser-based user interface for creating and configuring Automation accounts and related resources. This quickstart steps through creating an Automation account and running a runbook in the account.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to Azure at https://portal.azure.com

## Create Automation account

1. Click the **Create a resource** button found on the upper left-hand corner of Azure.

1. Select **Management Tools**, and then select **Automation**.

1. Enter the account information. For **Create Azure Run As account**, choose **Yes** so that the artifacts to simplify authentication to Azure are enabled automatically. It is important to note, that when creating an Automation Account, the name cannot be changed after it is chosen. *Automation Account names are unique per region and resource group. Names for Automation Accounts that were deleted may not be immediately available.* One Automation Account can manage resources across all regions and subscriptions for a given tenant. When complete, click **Create**, to start the Automation account deployment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For an updated list of locations that you can deploy an Automation Account to see, [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=automation&regions=all).

1. When the deployment has completed, click **All Services**, select **Automation Accounts** and select the Automation Account you created.

## Run a runbook

Run one of the tutorial runbooks.

1. Click **Runbooks** under **PROCESS AUTOMATION**. The list of runbooks is displayed. By default several tutorial runbooks are enabled in the account.

1. Click **Start**, and on the **Start Runbook** page, click **OK** to start the runbook.

    ![Runbook job page](./media/automation-quickstart-create-account/automation-tutorial-script-job.png)

1. After the **Job status** becomes **Running**, click **Output** or **All Logs** to view the runbook job output. For this tutorial runbook, the output is a list of your Azure resources.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, youâ€™ve deployed an Automation account, started a runbook job, and viewed the job results. To learn more about Azure Automation, continue to the quickstart for creating your first runbook.
