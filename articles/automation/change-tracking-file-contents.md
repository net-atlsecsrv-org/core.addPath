# View contents of a file that is being tracked with Change Tracking

File content tracking allows you to view the contents of a file before and after a change that is being tracked with Change Tracking. To do this, it saves the file contents to a storage account after each change occurs.

## Requirements

* A standard storage account using the Resource Manager deployment model is required for storing file content. Premium and classic deployment model storage accounts should not be used. For more information on storage accounts, see [About Azure storage accounts](../storage/common/storage-create-storage-account.md)

* The storage account used can only have 1 Automation Account connected.

* [Change Tracking](automation-change-tracking.md) is enabled in your Automation Account.

## Enable file content tracking

1. In the Azure portal, open your Automation account, and then select **Change tracking**.
2. On the top menu, select **Edit Settings**.
3. Select **File Content** and click **Link**. This opens the **Add Content Location for Change Tracking** pane.

4. Select the subscription and storage account to use to store the file contents to. If you want to enable file content tracking for all existing tracked files, select **On** for **Upload file content for all settings**. You can change this for each file path afterwards.

5. Once enabled, the storage account and the SAS Uris are shown. The SAS Uris expire after 365 days, and can be recreated by clicking the **Regenerate** button.

## Add a file

The following steps walk you through turning on change tracking for a file:

1. On the **Edit Settings** page of **Change Tracking**, select either **Windows Files** or **Linux Files** tab, and click **Add**

1. Fill out the information for the file path and select **True** under **Upload file content for all settings**. This setting enables file content tracking for that file path only.

## Viewing the contents of a tracked file

1. Once a change has been detected for the file or a file in the path, it shows in the portal. Select the file change from the list of changes. The **Change details** pane is displayed.
