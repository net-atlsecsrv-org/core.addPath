# Onboarding machines for management by Azure Automation State Configuration

## Why manage machines with Azure Automation State Configuration?

Azure Automation State Configuration is a configuration management service
for Desired State Configuration (DSC) nodes in any cloud or on-premises datacenter.
It enables scalability across thousands of machines quickly and easily from a central, secure location.
You can easily onboard machines,
assign them declarative configurations,
and view reports showing each machine's
compliance to the desired state you specified.
The Azure Automation State Configuration service is to DSC
what Azure Automation runbooks are to PowerShell scripting.
In other words, in the same way that Azure Automation helps you manage PowerShell scripts,
it also helps you manage DSC configurations.
To learn more about the benefits of using Azure Automation State Configuration, see
[Azure Automation State Configuration overview](automation-dsc-overview.md).

Azure Automation State Configuration can be used to manage a variety of machines:

- Azure virtual machines
- Azure virtual machines (classic)
- Physical/virtual Windows machines on-premises, or in a cloud other than Azure (including AWS EC2 instances)
- Physical/virtual Linux machines on-premises, in Azure, or in a cloud other than Azure

In addition, if you are not ready to manage machine configuration from the cloud, Azure Automation
State Configuration can also be used as a report-only endpoint.
This allows you to set (push) configurations through DSC and view reporting details in Azure Automation.

> [!NOTE]
> Managing Azure VMs with State Configuration is included at no extra charge if the virtual machine DSC extension installed is greater than 2.70. For more information, see [**Automation pricing page**](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/automation/).

The following sections outline how you can onboard each type of machine to Azure Automation State Configuration.

> [!NOTE]
>Deploying DSC to a Linux node uses the `/tmp` folder and modules like **nxAutomation** are temporarily downloaded for verification before installing them in their appropriate location. To ensure the modules install correctly, the Log Analytics agent for Linux needs read/write permission on `/tmp` folder. The Log Analytics agent for Linux runs as the `omsagent` user. 
>
>To grant write permission to `omsagent` user, run the following commands: `setfacl -m u:omsagent:rwx /tmp`
>

## Azure virtual machines

Azure Automation State Configuration lets you easily onboard Azure virtual machines for
configuration management, using either the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or
PowerShell. Under the hood, and without an administrator having to remote into the VM, the Azure VM
Desired State Configuration extension registers the VM with Azure Automation State Configuration.
Since the Azure VM Desired State Configuration extension runs asynchronously, steps to track its
progress or troubleshoot it are provided in the following [**Troubleshooting Azure virtual machine onboarding**](#troubleshooting-azure-virtual-machine-onboarding) section.

### Azure portal

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the Azure Automation account where
you want to onboard virtual machines. On the State Configuration page and the **Nodes** tab, click
**+ Add**.

Select an Azure virtual machine to onboard.

If the machine does not have the PowerShell desired state extension installed and the power state is running, click **Connect**.

Under **Registration**, enter the [PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager values](/powershell/scripting/dsc/managing-nodes/metaConfig)
required for your use case, and optionally a node configuration to assign to the VM.

### Azure Resource Manager templates

Azure virtual machines can be deployed and onboarded to Azure Automation State Configuration via
Azure Resource Manager templates. See [Server managed by Desired State Configuration service](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-automation-configuration/)
for an example template that onboards an existing VM to Azure Automation State Configuration.
If you are managing a Virtual Machine Scale Set, see the example template
[Virtual machine scale set Configuration managed by Azure Automation](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/201-vmss-automation-dsc/).

### PowerShell

The [Register-AzAutomationDscNode](/powershell/module/az.automation/register-azautomationdscnode)
cmdlet can be used to onboard virtual machines in Azure by using PowerShell.
However, this is currently only implemented for machines running Windows (the cmdlet
only triggers the Windows extension).

### Registering virtual machines across Azure subscriptions

The best way to register virtual machines from other Azure subscriptions is to use the DSC extension
in an Azure Resource Manager deployment template.
Examples are provided in
[Desired State Configuration extension with Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/dsc-template).
To find the registration key and registration URL to use as parameters in the template,
see the following [**Secure registration**](#secure-registration) section.

## Physical/virtual Windows machines on-premises, or in a cloud other than Azure (including AWS EC2 instances)

Windows servers running on-premises or in other cloud environments
can also be onboarded to Azure Automation State Configuration, as long as they have
[outbound access to Azure](automation-dsc-overview.md#network-planning):

1. Make sure the latest version of [WMF 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5latest) is installed on the machines you want to onboard to Azure Automation State Configuration.
1. Follow the directions in following section [**Generating DSC metaconfigurations**](#generating-dsc-metaconfigurations) to generate a folder containing the needed DSC metaconfigurations.
1. Remotely apply the PowerShell DSC metaconfiguration to the machines you want to onboard. **The machine this command is run from must have the latest version of [WMF 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5latest) installed**:

   ```powershell
   Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path C:\Users\joe\Desktop\DscMetaConfigs -ComputerName MyServer1, MyServer2
   ```

1. If you cannot apply the PowerShell DSC metaconfigurations remotely, copy the metaconfigurations folder from step 2 onto each machine to onboard. Then call **Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager** locally on each machine to onboard.
1. Using the Azure portal or cmdlets, check that the machines to onboard appear as State Configuration nodes registered in your Azure Automation account.

## Physical/virtual Linux machines on-premises, or in a cloud other than Azure

Linux servers running on-premises or in other cloud environments
can also be onboarded to Azure Automation State Configuration, as long as they have
[outbound access to Azure](automation-dsc-overview.md#network-planning):

1. Make sure the latest version of [PowerShell Desired State Configuration for Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerShell-DSC-for-Linux) is installed on the machines you want to onboard to Azure Automation State Configuration.
2. If the [PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager defaults](/powershell/scripting/dsc/managing-nodes/metaConfig4) match your use case, and you want to onboard machines such that they **both** pull from and report to Azure Automation State Configuration:

   - On each Linux machine to onboard to Azure Automation State Configuration, use `Register.py` to onboard using the PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager defaults:

     `/opt/microsoft/dsc/Scripts/Register.py <Automation account registration key> <Automation account registration URL>`

   - To find the registration key and registration URL for your Automation account, see the following [**Secure registration**](#secure-registration) section.

     If the PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager defaults **do not** match your use case, or you want to onboard machines such that they only report to Azure Automation State Configuration, follow steps 3 - 6. Otherwise, proceed directly to step 6.

3. Follow the directions in the following [**Generating DSC metaconfigurations**](#generating-dsc-metaconfigurations) section to generate a folder containing the needed DSC metaconfigurations.
4. Remotely apply the PowerShell DSC metaconfiguration to the machines you want to onboard:

    ```powershell
    $SecurePass = ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<root password>' -AsPlainText -Force
    $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential 'root', $SecurePass
    $Opt = New-CimSessionOption -UseSsl -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck -SkipRevocationCheck

    # need a CimSession for each Linux machine to onboard
    $Session = New-CimSession -Credential $Cred -ComputerName <your Linux machine> -Port 5986 -Authentication basic -SessionOption $Opt

    Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -CimSession $Session -Path C:\Users\joe\Desktop\DscMetaConfigs
    ```

The machine this command is run from must have the latest version of [WMF 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5latest) installed.

1. If you cannot apply the PowerShell DSC metaconfigurations remotely, copy the metaconfiguration corresponding to that machine from the folder in step 5 onto the Linux machine. Then call `SetDscLocalConfigurationManager.py` locally on each Linux machine you want to onboard to Azure Automation State Configuration:

   `/opt/microsoft/dsc/Scripts/SetDscLocalConfigurationManager.py -configurationmof <path to metaconfiguration file>`

2. Using the Azure portal or cmdlets, check that the machines to onboard now show up as DSC nodes registered in your Azure Automation account.

## Generating DSC metaconfigurations

To generically onboard any machine to Azure Automation State Configuration, a [DSC metaconfiguration](/powershell/scripting/dsc/managing-nodes/metaConfig)
can be generated that tells the DSC
agent to pull from and/or report to Azure Automation State Configuration. DSC
metaconfigurations for Azure Automation State Configuration can be generated using either a
PowerShell DSC configuration, or the Azure Automation PowerShell cmdlets.

> [!NOTE]
> DSC metaconfigurations contain the secrets needed to onboard a machine to an Automation account for management. Make sure to properly protect any DSC metaconfigurations you create, or delete them after use.

### Using a DSC Configuration

1. Open the VSCode (or your favorite editor) as an administrator in a machine in your local environment. The machine must have the latest version of [WMF 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5latest) installed.
1. Copy the following script locally. This script contains a PowerShell DSC configuration for creating metaconfigurations, and a command to kick off the metaconfiguration creation.

> [!NOTE]
> State Configuration Node Configuration names are case sensitive in the portal. If the case is mismatched the node will not show up under the **Nodes** tab.

   ```powershell
   # The DSC configuration that will generate metaconfigurations
   [DscLocalConfigurationManager()]
   Configuration DscMetaConfigs
   {
        param
        (
            [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
            [String]$RegistrationUrl,

            [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
            [String]$RegistrationKey,

            [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
            [String[]]$ComputerName,

            [Int]$RefreshFrequencyMins = 30,

            [Int]$ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins = 15,

            [String]$ConfigurationMode = 'ApplyAndMonitor',

            [String]$NodeConfigurationName,

            [Boolean]$RebootNodeIfNeeded= $False,

            [String]$ActionAfterReboot = 'ContinueConfiguration',

            [Boolean]$AllowModuleOverwrite = $False,

            [Boolean]$ReportOnly
        )

        if(!$NodeConfigurationName -or $NodeConfigurationName -eq '')
        {
            $ConfigurationNames = $null
        }
        else
        {
            $ConfigurationNames = @($NodeConfigurationName)
        }

        if($ReportOnly)
        {
            $RefreshMode = 'PUSH'
        }
        else
        {
            $RefreshMode = 'PULL'
        }

        Node $ComputerName
        {
            Settings
            {
                RefreshFrequencyMins           = $RefreshFrequencyMins
                RefreshMode                    = $RefreshMode
                ConfigurationMode              = $ConfigurationMode
                AllowModuleOverwrite           = $AllowModuleOverwrite
                RebootNodeIfNeeded             = $RebootNodeIfNeeded
                ActionAfterReboot              = $ActionAfterReboot
                ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins = $ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins
            }

            if(!$ReportOnly)
            {
            ConfigurationRepositoryWeb AzureAutomationStateConfiguration
                {
                    ServerUrl          = $RegistrationUrl
                    RegistrationKey    = $RegistrationKey
                    ConfigurationNames = $ConfigurationNames
                }

                ResourceRepositoryWeb AzureAutomationStateConfiguration
                {
                ServerUrl       = $RegistrationUrl
                RegistrationKey = $RegistrationKey
                }
            }

            ReportServerWeb AzureAutomationStateConfiguration
            {
                ServerUrl       = $RegistrationUrl
                RegistrationKey = $RegistrationKey
            }
        }
   }

    # Create the metaconfigurations
    # NOTE: DSC Node Configuration names are case sensitive in the portal.
    # TODO: edit the below as needed for your use case
   $Params = @{
        RegistrationUrl = '<fill me in>';
        RegistrationKey = '<fill me in>';
        ComputerName = @('<some VM to onboard>', '<some other VM to onboard>');
        NodeConfigurationName = 'SimpleConfig.webserver';
        RefreshFrequencyMins = 30;
        ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins = 15;
        RebootNodeIfNeeded = $False;
        AllowModuleOverwrite = $False;
        ConfigurationMode = 'ApplyAndMonitor';
        ActionAfterReboot = 'ContinueConfiguration';
        ReportOnly = $False;  # Set to $True to have machines only report to AA DSC but not pull from it
   }

   # Use PowerShell splatting to pass parameters to the DSC configuration being invoked
   # For more info about splatting, run: Get-Help -Name about_Splatting
   DscMetaConfigs @Params
   ```

1. Fill in the registration key and URL for your Automation account, as well as the names of the machines to onboard. All other parameters are optional. To find the registration key and registration URL for your Automation account, see the following [**Secure registration**](#secure-registration) section.
1. If you want the machines to report DSC status information to Azure Automation State Configuration, but not pull configuration or PowerShell modules, set the **ReportOnly** parameter to true.
1. Run the script. You should now have a folder called **DscMetaConfigs** in your working directory, containing the PowerShell DSC metaconfigurations for the machines to onboard (as an administrator):

    ```powershell
    Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path ./DscMetaConfigs
    ```

### Using the Azure Automation cmdlets

If the PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager defaults match your use case, and you want to
onboard machines such that they both pull from and report to Azure Automation State Configuration,
the Azure Automation cmdlets provide a simplified method of generating the DSC metaconfigurations
needed:

1. Open the PowerShell console or VSCode as an administrator in a machine in your local environment.
2. Connect to Azure Resource Manager using `Connect-AzAccount`
3. Download the PowerShell DSC metaconfigurations for the machines you want to onboard from the Automation account to which you want to onboard nodes:

   ```powershell
   # Define the parameters for Get-AzAutomationDscOnboardingMetaconfig using PowerShell Splatting
   $Params = @{
       ResourceGroupName = 'ContosoResources'; # The name of the Resource Group that contains your Azure Automation Account
       AutomationAccountName = 'ContosoAutomation'; # The name of the Azure Automation Account where you want a node on-boarded to
       ComputerName = @('web01', 'web02', 'sql01'); # The names of the computers that the meta configuration will be generated for
       OutputFolder = "$env:UserProfile\Desktop\";
   }
   # Use PowerShell splatting to pass parameters to the Azure Automation cmdlet being invoked
   # For more info about splatting, run: Get-Help -Name about_Splatting
   Get-AzAutomationDscOnboardingMetaconfig @Params
   ```

1. You should now have a folder called ***DscMetaConfigs***, containing the PowerShell DSC metaconfigurations for the machines to onboard (as an administrator):

    ```powershell
    Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path $env:UserProfile\Desktop\DscMetaConfigs
    ```

## Secure registration

Machines can securely onboard to an Azure Automation account through the WMF 5 DSC registration
protocol, which allows a DSC node to authenticate to a PowerShell DSC Pull or Reporting server
(including Azure Automation State Configuration). The node registers to the server at a
**Registration URL**, authenticating using a **Registration key**. During registration, the DSC
node and DSC Pull/Reporting server negotiate a unique certificate for this node to use for
authentication to the server post-registration. This process prevents onboarded nodes from
impersonating one another, such as if a node is compromised and behaving maliciously. After
registration, the Registration key is not used for authentication again, and is deleted from the
node.

You can get the information required for the State Configuration registration protocol from
**Keys** under **Account Settings** in the Azure portal. Open this blade by clicking the key icon
on the **Essentials** panel for the Automation account.

![Azure automation keys and URL](./media/automation-dsc-onboarding/DSC_Onboarding_4.png)

- Registration URL is the URL field in the Manage Keys blade.
- Registration key is the Primary Access Key or Secondary Access Key in the Manage Keys blade. Either key can be used.

For added security, the primary and secondary access keys of an Automation account can be
regenerated at any time (on the **Manage Keys** page) to prevent future node registrations using
previous keys.

## Certificate expiration and re-registration

After registering a machine as a DSC node in Azure Automation State Configuration, there are a
number of reasons why you may need to re-register that node in the future:

- For versions of Windows Server prior to Windows Server 2019, each node automatically negotiates a unique certificate for authentication that expires after one year. Currently, the PowerShell DSC registration protocol cannot automatically renew certificates when they are nearing expiration, so you need to re-register the nodes after a year's time. Before re-registering, ensure that each node is running Windows Management Framework 5.0 RTM. If a node's authentication certificate expires, and the node is not re-registered, the node is unable to communicate with Azure Automation and is marked 'Unresponsive.' Re-registration performed 90 days or less from the certificate expiration time, or at any point after the certificate expiration time, will result in a new certificate being generated and used.  A resolution to this issue is included in Windows Server 2019 and later.
- To change any [PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager values](/powershell/scripting/dsc/managing-nodes/metaConfig4) that were set during initial registration of the node, such as ConfigurationMode. Currently, these DSC agent values can only be changed through re-registration. The one exception is the Node Configuration assigned to the node -- this can be changed in Azure Automation DSC directly.

Re-registration can be performed in the same way you registered the node initially, using any of the
onboarding methods described in this document. You do not need to unregister a node from Azure
Automation State Configuration before re-registering it.

## Troubleshooting Azure virtual machine onboarding

Azure Automation State Configuration lets you easily onboard Azure Windows VMs for configuration
management. Under the hood, the Azure VM Desired State Configuration extension is used to register
the VM with Azure Automation State Configuration. Since the Azure VM Desired State Configuration
extension runs asynchronously, tracking its progress and troubleshooting its execution may be
important.

> [!NOTE]
> Any method of onboarding an Azure Windows VM to Azure Automation State Configuration that uses the Azure VM Desired State Configuration extension could take up to an hour for the node to show up as registered in Azure Automation. This is due to the installation of Windows Management Framework 5.0 on the VM by the Azure VM DSC extension, which is required to onboard the VM to Azure Automation State Configuration.

To troubleshoot or view the status of the Azure VM Desired State Configuration extension, in the
Azure portal navigate to the VM being onboarded, then click **Extensions** under **Settings**. Then
click **DSC** or **DSCForLinux** depending on your operating system. For more details, you can
click **View detailed status**.

For more information on troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting issues with Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC)](./troubleshoot/desired-state-configuration.md).
