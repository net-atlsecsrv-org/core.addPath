# Remove Start/Stop VMs during off-hours from Automation account

After you enable the Start/Stop VMs during off-hours feature to manage the running state of your Azure VMs, you may decide to stop using it. Removing this feature can be done using one of the following methods based on the supported deployment models:

* Delete the resource group containing the Automation account and linked Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace, each dedicated to support this feature.
* Unlink the Log Analytics workspace from the Automation account and delete the Automation account dedicated for this feature.
* Delete the feature from an Automation account and linked workspace that are supporting other management and monitoring objectives.

Deleting this feature only removes the associated runbooks, it doesn't delete the schedules or variables that were created during deployment or any custom-defined ones created after.

## Delete the dedicated resource group

To delete the resource group, follow the steps outlined in the [Azure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion](../azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group.md) article.

## Delete the Automation account

To delete your Automation account dedicated to Start/Stop VMs during off-hours, perform the following steps.

1. Sign in to Azure at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to your Automation account, and select **Linked workspace** under **Related resources**.

3. Select **Go to workspace**.

4. Click **Solutions** under **General**.

5. On the Solutions page, select **Start-Stop-VM[Workspace]**.

6. On the **VMManagementSolution[Workspace]** page, select **Delete** from the menu.

7. While the information is verified and the feature is deleted, you can track the progress under **Notifications**, chosen from the menu. You're returned to the Solutions page after the removal process.

### Unlink workspace from Automation account

There are two options for unlinking the Log Analytics workspace from your Automation account. You can perform this process from the Automation account or from the linked workspace.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Automation Accounts**.

2. Open your Automation account and select **Linked workspace** under **Related Resources** on the left.

3. On the **Unlink workspace** page, select **Unlink workspace** and respond to prompts.
