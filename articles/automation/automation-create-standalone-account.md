# Create a standalone Azure Automation account

This article shows you how to create an Azure Automation account in the Azure portal. You can use the portal Automation account to evaluate and learn about Automation without using additional management solutions or integration with Azure Monitor logs. You can add those management solutions or integrate with Azure Monitor logs for advanced monitoring of runbook jobs at any point in the future.

With an Automation account, you can authenticate runbooks by managing resources in either Azure Resource Manager or the classic deployment model. One Automation Account can manage resources across all regions and subscriptions for a given tenant.

When you create an Automation account in the Azure portal, these accounts are automatically created:

* **Run As account**. This account does the following tasks:
  * Creates a service principal in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
  * Creates a certificate.
  * Assigns the Contributor Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which manages Azure Resource Manager resources by using runbooks.

With these accounts created for you, you can quickly start building and deploying runbooks to support your automation needs.

## Permissions required to create an Automation account

To create or update an Automation account, and to complete the tasks described in this article, you must have the following privileges and permissions:

* To create an Automation account, your Azure AD user account must be added to a role with permissions equivalent to the Owner role for **Microsoft. Automation** resources. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control in Azure Automation](automation-role-based-access-control.md).
* In the Azure portal, under **Azure Active Directory** > **MANAGE** > **User settings**, if **App registrations** is set to **Yes**, non-admin users in your Azure AD tenant can [register Active Directory applications](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#check-azure-subscription-permissions). If **App registrations** is set to **No**, the user who performs this action must be a global administrator in Azure AD.

If you aren't a member of the subscription’s Active Directory instance before you are added to the subscription's global administrator/coadministrator role, you are added to Active Directory as a guest. In this scenario, you see this message on the **Add Automation Account** page: “You do not have permissions to create."

If a user is added to the global administrator/coadministrator role first, you can remove them from the subscription's Active Directory instance, and then readd them to the full User role in Active Directory.

To verify user roles:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **Azure Active Directory** pane.
1. Select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **All users**.
1. After you select a specific user, select **Profile**. The value of the **User type** attribute under the user's profile should not be **Guest**.

## Create a new Automation account in the Azure portal

To create an Azure Automation account in the Azure portal, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal with an account that's a member of the subscription Administrators role and a coadministrator of the subscription.
1. Select **+ Create a Resource**.
1. Search for **Automation**. In the search results, select **Automation**.

   ![Search for and select Automation & Control in the Azure Marketplace](media/automation-create-standalone-account/automation-marketplace-select-create-automationacct.png)

1. On the next screen select **Create**.

   ![Add Automation account](media/automation-create-standalone-account/automation-create-automationacct-properties.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you see the following message in the **Add Automation Account** pane, your account is not a member of the subscription Administrators role and a coadministrator of the subscription.
   >
   > ![Add Automation account warning](media/automation-create-standalone-account/create-account-without-perms.png)

1. In the **Add Automation Account** pane, in the **Name** box, enter a name for your new Automation account. This name cannot be changed after it is chosen. *Automation Account names are unique per region and resource group. Names for Automation Accounts that were deleted may not be immediately available.*
1. If you have more than one subscription, in the **Subscription** box, specify the subscription you want to use for the new account.
1. For **Resource group**, enter or select a new or existing resource group.
1. For **Location**, select an Azure datacenter location.
1. For the **Create Azure Run As account** option, ensure that **Yes** is selected, and then select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you choose not to create the Run As account by selecting **No** for **Create Azure Run As account**, a message appears in the **Add Automation Account** pane. Although the account is created in the Azure portal, the account doesn't have a corresponding authentication identity in your classic deployment model subscription or in the Azure Resource Manager subscription directory service. Therefore, the Automation account doesn't have access to resources in your subscription. This prevents any runbooks that reference this account from being able to authenticate and perform tasks against resources in those deployment models.

   >
   > When the service principal is not created, the Contributor role is not assigned.
   >

1. To track the progress of the Automation account creation, in the menu, select **Notifications**.

### Resources included

When the Automation account is successfully created, several resources are automatically created for you. After creation, these runbooks can be safely deleted if you do not wish to keep them. The Run As Accounts, can be used to authenticate to your account in a runbook, and should be left unless you create another one or do not require them. The following table summarizes resources for the Run As account.

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AzureAutomationTutorial Runbook |An example graphical runbook that demonstrates how to authenticate by using the Run As account. The runbook gets all Resource Manager resources. |
| AzureAutomationTutorialScript Runbook |An example PowerShell runbook that demonstrates how to authenticate by using the Run As account. The runbook gets all Resource Manager resources. |
| AzureAutomationTutorialPython2 Runbook |An example Python runbook that demonstrates how to authenticate by using the Run As account. The runbook lists all resource groups present in the subscription. |
| AzureRunAsCertificate |A certificate asset that's automatically created when the Automation account is created, or by using a PowerShell script for an existing account. The certificate authenticates with Azure so you can manage Azure Resource Manager resources from runbooks. This certificate has a one-year lifespan. |
| AzureRunAsConnection |A connection asset that's automatically created when the Automation account is created, or by using a PowerShell script for an existing account. |

## Classic Run-As Accounts

Classic Run-As accounts are no longer created, by default, when you create an Azure Automation account. If you still require a Classic Run-As account, please perform the following steps.

1. From your **Automation Account** page, select **Run As Accounts** under **Account Settings**.
2. Select **Azure Classic Run As Account**.
3. Click **Create** to proceed with Classic Run As account creation.
