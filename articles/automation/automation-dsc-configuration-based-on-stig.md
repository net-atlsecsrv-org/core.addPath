# Configuration based on STIG

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 5.1

Creating configuration content for the first time can be challenging.
In many cases,
the goal is to automate configuration of servers
following a "baseline" that hopefully aligns to an industry recommendation.

> [!NOTE]
> This article refers to a solution that is maintained by the Open Source community.
> Support is only available in the form of GitHub collaboration, not from Microsoft.

## Community project: PowerSTIG

A community project named
[PowerSTIG](https://github.com/microsoft/powerstig)
aims to resolve this issue by generating DSC content based on
[public information](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/)
provided about STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide),

Dealing with baselines is more complicated than it sounds.
Many organizations need to
[document exceptions](https://github.com/microsoft/powerstig#powerstigdata)
to rules and manage that data at scale.
PowerSTIG addresses the problem by providing
[Composite Resources](https://github.com/microsoft/powerstig#powerstigdsc)
to address each area of the configuration
rather than trying to address the entire range of settings
in one large file.

Once the configurations have been generated,
you can use the
[DSC Configuration scripts](/powershell/scripting/dsc/configurations/configurations)
to generate MOF files
and
[upload the MOF files to Azure Automation](/azure/automation/tutorial-configure-servers-desired-state#create-and-upload-a-configuration-to-azure-automation).
Then register your servers from either
[on-premises](/azure/automation/automation-dsc-onboarding#physicalvirtual-windows-machines-on-premises-or-in-a-cloud-other-than-azureaws)
or [in Azure](/azure/automation/automation-dsc-onboarding#azure-virtual-machines)
to pull configurations.

To try out PowerSTIG, visit the
[PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com)
and download the solution or click "Project Site"
to view the
[documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/powerstig).
