# Troubleshoot Hybrid Runbook Workers

This article provides information on troubleshooting issues with Hybrid Runbook Workers.

## General

The Hybrid Runbook Worker depends on an agent to communicate with your Automation account to register the worker, receive runbook jobs, and report status. For Windows, this agent is the Log Analytics agent for Windows, also referred to as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). For Linux, it's the Log Analytics agent for Linux.

### <a name="runbook-execution-fails"></a>Scenario: Runbook execution fails

#### Issue

Runbook execution fails and you receive the following error.

```error
"The job action 'Activate' cannot be run, because the process stopped unexpectedly. The job action was attempted three times."
```

Your runbook is suspended shortly after it attempts to execute three times. There are conditions that can interrupt the runbook from completing. The related error message might not include any additional information.

#### Cause

The following are possible causes:

* The runbooks can't authenticate with local resources.

* The hybrid worker is behind a proxy or firewall.

* The computer configured to run the Hybrid Runbook Worker feature doesn't meet the minimum hardware requirements.

#### Resolution

Verify that the computer has outbound access to ***.azure-automation.net** on port 443.

Computers running the Hybrid Runbook Worker should meet the minimum hardware requirements before the worker is configured to host this feature. Runbooks and the background process they use might cause the system to be over-used and cause runbook job delays or timeouts.

Confirm that the computer to run the Hybrid Runbook Worker feature meets the minimum hardware requirements. If it does, monitor CPU and memory use to determine any correlation between the performance of Hybrid Runbook Worker processes and Windows. Any memory or CPU pressure can indicate the need to upgrade resources. You can also select a different compute resource that supports the minimum requirements and scale when workload demands indicate that an increase is necessary.

Check the **Microsoft-SMA** event log for a corresponding event with description `Win32 Process Exited with code [4294967295]`. The cause of this error is that you haven't configured authentication in your runbooks or specified the Run As credentials for the Hybrid Runbook Worker group. Review runbook permissions in [Running runbooks on a Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md) to confirm that you have correctly configured authentication for your runbooks.

### <a name="cannot-connect-signalr"></a>Scenario: Event 15011 in Hybrid Runbook Worker

#### Issue

The Hybrid Runbook Worker receives event 15011, indicating that a query result is not valid. The following error appears when the worker attempts to open a connection with the [SignalR server](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-3.1).

```error
[AccountId={c7d22bd3-47b2-4144-bf88-97940102f6ca}]
[Uri=https://cc-jobruntimedata-prod-su1.azure-automation.net/notifications/hub][Exception=System.TimeoutException: Transport timed out trying to connect​
   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()​
   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)​
   at JobRuntimeData.NotificationsClient.JobRuntimeDataServiceSignalRClient.<Start>d__45.MoveNext()​
```

#### Cause

The Hybrid Runbook Worker has not been configured correctly for the automated deployment solution. This solution contains a part that connects the VM to the Log Analytics workspace. The PowerShell script looks for the workspace in the subscription with the supplied name. In this case, the Log Analytics workspace is in a different subscription. The script can't find the workspace and tries to create one, but the name is already taken. Thus the deployment fails.

#### Resolution

You have two options for resolving this issue:

* Modify the PowerShell script to look for the Log Analytics workspace in another subscription. This is a good solution if you plan to deploy many Hybrid Runbook Worker machines in the future.

* Manually configure the worker machine to run in an Orchestrator sandbox. Then run a runbook created in the Azure Automation account on the worker to test the functionality.

### <a name="vm-automatically-dropped"></a>Scenario: Windows Azure VMs automatically dropped from hybrid worker group

#### Issue

You can't see the Hybrid Runbook Worker or VMs when the worker machine has been turned off for a long time.

#### Cause

The Hybrid Runbook Worker machine hasn't pinged Azure Automation for more than 30 days. As a result, Automation has purged the Hybrid Runbook Worker group or the System Worker group. 

#### Resolution

Start the worker machine and then rereregister it with Azure Automation. See instructions for installing the runbook environment and connecting to Azure Automation in [Deploy a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-windows-hrw-install.md).

### <a name="no-cert-found"></a>Scenario: No certificate was found in the certificate store on Hybrid Runbook Worker

#### Issue

A runbook running on a Hybrid Runbook Worker fails with the following error message.

```error
Connect-AzureRmAccount : No certificate was found in the certificate store with thumbprint 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
At line:3 char:1
+ Connect-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -Tenant $Conn.TenantID -Appl ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : CloseError: (:) [Connect-AzureRmAccount], ArgumentException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Profile.ConnectAzureRmAccountCommand
```
#### Cause

This error occurs when you attempt to use a [Run As account](../manage-runas-account.md) in a runbook that runs on a Hybrid Runbook Worker where the Run As account certificate's not present. Hybrid Runbook Workers don't have the certificate asset locally by default, which is required by the Run As account to operate properly.

#### Resolution

If your Hybrid Runbook Worker is an Azure VM, you can use [Managed identities for Azure resources](../automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md#managed-identities-for-azure-resources) instead. This scenario simplifies authentication by allowing you to authenticate to Azure resources using the managed identity of the Azure VM instead of the Run As account. When the Hybrid Runbook Worker is an on-premises machine, you need to install the Run As account certificate on the machine. To learn how to install the certificate, see the steps to run the PowerShell runbook Export-RunAsCertificateToHybridWorker in [Running runbooks on a Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md).

### <a name="error-403-on-registration"></a>Scenario: Error 403 during registration of Hybrid Runbook Worker

#### Issue

The worker's initial registration phase fails and you receive the following error (403).

```error
"Forbidden: You don't have permission to access / on this server."
```

#### Cause

The following are possible causes:

* There's a mistyped workspace ID or workspace key (primary) in the agent's settings. 

* The Hybrid Runbook Worker can't download the configuration, causing an account linking error. When Azure enables solutions, it supports only certain regions for linking a Log Analytics workspace and an Automation account. It's also possible that an incorrect date and/or time is set on the computer. If the time is +/-15 minutes from the current time, onboarding fails.

#### Resolution

##### Mistyped workspace ID/key
To verify if the agent's workspace ID or workspace key has been mistyped, see [Adding or removing a workspace – Windows agent](../../azure-monitor/platform/agent-manage.md#windows-agent) for the Windows agent or [Adding or removing a workspace – Linux agent](../../azure-monitor/platform/agent-manage.md#linux-agent) for the Linux agent.  Make sure to select the full string from the Azure portal and copy and paste it carefully.

##### Configuration not downloaded

Your Log Analytics workspace and Automation account must be in a linked region. For a list of supported regions, see [Azure Automation and Log Analytics workspace mappings](../how-to/region-mappings.md).

You might also need to update the date and/or time zone of your computer. If you select a custom time range, make sure that the range is in UTC, which can differ from your local time zone.

## Linux

The Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker depends on the [Log Analytics agent for Linux](../../azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent.md) to communicate with your Automation account to register the worker, receive runbook jobs, and report status. If registration of the worker fails, here are some possible causes for the error:

### <a name="oms-agent-not-running"></a>Scenario: The Log Analytics agent for Linux isn't running

#### Issue

The Log Analytics agent for Linux isn't running

#### Cause

If the agent isn't running, it prevents the Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker from communicating with Azure Automation. The agent might not be running for various reasons.

#### Resolution

 Verify the agent is running by entering the command `ps -ef | grep python`. You should see output similar to the following, the Python processes with **nxautomation** user account. If the Update Management or Azure Automation solution isn't enabled, none of the following processes are running.

```bash
nxautom+   8567      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:00 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/main.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/oms.conf rworkspace:<workspaceId> <Linux hybrid worker version>
nxautom+   8593      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:02 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/hybridworker.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/worker.conf managed rworkspace:<workspaceId> rversion:<Linux hybrid worker version>
nxautom+   8595      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:02 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/hybridworker.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspaceId>/state/automationworker/diy/worker.conf managed rworkspace:<workspaceId> rversion:<Linux hybrid worker version>
```

The following list shows the processes that are started for a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker. They're all located in the **/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/** directory.

* **oms.conf** - The worker manager process. It's started directly from DSC.

* **worker.conf** - The Auto-Registered hybrid worker process. It's started by the worker manager. This process is used by Update Management and is transparent to the user. This process isn't present if the Update Management solution isn't enabled on the machine.

* **diy/worker.conf** - The DIY hybrid worker process. The DIY hybrid worker process is used to execute user runbooks on the Hybrid Runbook Worker. It only differs from the Auto-Registered hybrid worker process in the key detail that it uses a different configuration. This process isn't present if the Azure Automation solution is disabled and the DIY Linux Hybrid Worker isn't registered.

If the agent isn't running, run the following command to start the service: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart`.

### <a name="class-does-not-exist"></a>Scenario: The specified class doesn't exist

If you see the error `The specified class does not exist..` in the  **/var/opt/microsoft/omsconfig/omsconfig.log**, the Log Analytics agent for Linux needs to be updated. Run the following command to reinstall the agent:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <WorkspaceID> -s <WorkspaceKey>
```

## Windows

The Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker depends on the [Log Analytics agent for Windows](../../azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent.md) to communicate with your Automation account to register the worker, receive runbook jobs, and report status. If registration of the worker fails, this section includes some possible reasons.

### <a name="mma-not-running"></a>Scenario: The Microsoft Monitoring Agent isn't running

#### Issue

The `healthservice` service isn't running on the Hybrid Runbook Worker machine.

#### Cause

If the Microsoft Monitoring Agent service isn't running, the Hybrid Runbook Worker is prevented from communicating with Azure Automation.

#### Resolution

Verify that the agent is running by entering the following command in PowerShell: `Get-Service healthservice`. If the service is stopped, enter the following command in PowerShell to start the service: `Start-Service healthservice`.

### <a name="event-4502"></a>Scenario: Event 4502 in Operations Manager log

#### Issue

In the **Application and Services Logs\Operations Manager** event log, you see event 4502 and EventMessage that contains `Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.HealthService.AzureAutomation.HybridAgent` with the following description:<br>`The certificate presented by the service \<wsid\>.oms.opinsights.azure.com was not issued by a certificate authority used for Microsoft services. Please contact your network administrator to see if they are running a proxy that intercepts TLS/SSL communication.`

#### Cause

This issue can be caused by your proxy or network firewall blocking communication to Microsoft Azure. Verify that the computer has outbound access to ***.azure-automation.net** on port 443. 

#### Resolution

Logs are stored locally on each hybrid worker at **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\System Center\Orchestrator\7.2\SMA\Sandboxes**. You can verify if there are any warning or error events in the **Application and Services Logs\Microsoft-SMA\Operations** and **Application and Services Logs\Operations Manager** event logs. These logs indicate a connectivity or other type of issue that affects onboarding of the role to Azure Automation, or an issue encountered under normal operations. For additional help troubleshooting issues with the Log Analytics agent, see [Troubleshoot issues with the Log Analytics Windows agent](../../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows-troubleshoot.md).

Hybrid workers send [Runbook output and messages](../automation-runbook-output-and-messages.md) to Azure Automation in the same way that runbook jobs running in the cloud send output and messages. You can enable the Verbose and Progress streams just as you do for runbooks.

### <a name="no-orchestrator-sandbox-connect-O365"></a>Scenario: Orchestrator.Sandbox.exe can't connect to Office 365 through proxy

#### Issue

A script running on a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker can't connect as expected to Office 365 on an Orchestrator sandbox. The script is using [Connect-MsolService](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/msonline/connect-msolservice?view=azureadps-1.0) for connection. 

If you adjust **Orchestrator.Sandbox.exe.config** to set the proxy and the bypass list, the sandbox still doesn't connect properly. A **Powershell_ise.exe.config** file with the same same proxy and bypass list settings seems to work as you expect. Service Management Automation (SMA) logs and PowerShell logs don't provide any information regarding proxy.​

#### Cause

The connection to the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) on the server can't bypass the proxy. Remember that a PowerShell sandbox runs as the logged user. However, an Orchestrator sandbox is heavily customized and might ignore the **Orchestrator.Sandbox.exe.config** file settings. It has special code for handling machine or MMA proxy settings, but not for handling other custom proxy settings. 

#### Resolution

You can resolve the issue for the Orchestrator sandbox by migrating your script to use the Azure AD modules instead of the MSOnline module for PowerShell cmdlets. See [Migrating from Orchestrator to Azure Automation (Beta)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-orchestrator-migration).

​If you want to continue to use the MSOnline module cmdlets, change your script to use [Invoke-Command](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/invoke-command?view=powershell-7). Specify values for the `ComputerName` and `Credential` parameters. 

```powershell
$Credential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name MyProxyAccessibleCredential​
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME -Credential $Credential 
{ Connect-MsolService … }​
```

This code change starts an entirely new PowerShell session under the context of the specified credentials. It should enable the traffic to flow through a proxy server that is authenticating the active user.

>[!NOTE]
>This solution makes it unnecessary to manipulate the sandbox configuration file. Even if you succeed in making the configuration file work with your script, the file gets wiped out each time the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent is updated.​

### <a name="corrupt-cache"></a>Scenario: Hybrid Runbook Worker not reporting

#### Issue

Your Hybrid Runbook Worker machine is running but you don't see heartbeat data for the machine in the workspace.

The following example query shows the machines in a workspace and their last heartbeat:

```loganalytics
// Last heartbeat of each computer
Heartbeat
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer
```

#### Cause

This issue can be caused by a corrupt cache on the Hybrid Runbook Worker.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, sign in to the Hybrid Runbook Worker and run the following script. This script stops the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, removes its cache, and restarts the service. This action forces the Hybrid Runbook Worker to re-download its configuration from Azure Automation.

```powershell
Stop-Service -Name HealthService

Remove-Item -Path 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\Health Service State' -Recurse

Start-Service -Name HealthService
```

### <a name="already-registered"></a>Scenario: You can't add a Hybrid Runbook Worker

#### Issue

You receive the following message when trying to add a Hybrid Runbook Worker using the `Add-HybridRunbookWorker` cmdlet.

```error
Machine is already registered
```

#### Cause

This issue can be caused if the machine is already registered with a different Automation account or if you try to readd the Hybrid Runbook Worker after removing it from a machine.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, remove the following registry key, restart the `HealthService`, and try the `Add-HybridRunbookWorker` cmdlet again.

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HybridRunbookWorker`
