# Troubleshooting issues with Update Management

This article discusses solutions to resolve issues that you may run across when using Update Management.

There is an agent troubleshooter for Hybrid Worker agent to determine the underlying problem. To learn more about the troubleshooter, see [Troubleshoot update agent issues](update-agent-issues.md). For all other issues, see the detailed information below about possible issues.

## General

### <a name="components-enabled-not-working"></a>Scenario: The components for the 'Update Management' solution have been enabled, and now this virtual machine is being configured

#### Issue

You continue to see the following message on a virtual machine 15 minutes after onboarding:

```error
The components for the 'Update Management' solution have been enabled, and now this virtual machine is being configured. Please be patient, as this can sometimes take up to 15 minutes.
```

#### Cause

This error can be caused by the following reasons:

1. Communication back to the Automation Account is being blocked.
2. The VM being onboarded may have come from a cloned machine that wasn't sysprepped with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent installed.

#### Resolution

1. Visit, [Network planning](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning) to learn about which addresses and ports need to be allowed for Update Management to work.
2. If using a cloned image:
   1. In your Log Analytics workspace, remove the VM from the saved search for the Scope Configuration `MicrosoftDefaultScopeConfig-Updates` if it is shown. Saved searches can be found under **General** in your workspace.
   2. Run `Remove-Item -Path "HKLM:\software\microsoft\hybridrunbookworker" -Recurse -Force`
   3. Run `Restart-Service HealthService` to restart the `HealthService`. This will recreate the key and generate a new UUID.
   4. If this doesn't work, sysprep the image first and install the MMA agent after the fact.

### <a name="multi-tenant"></a>Scenario: You receive a linked subscription error when creating an update deployment for machines in another Azure tenant.

#### Issue

You receive the following error when trying to create an update deployment for machines in another Azure tenant:

```error
The client has permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write' on scope '/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/automationAccountName/softwareUpdateConfigurations/updateDeploymentName', however the current tenant '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' is not authorized to access linked subscription '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'.
```

#### Cause

This error occurs when you create an update deployment that has Azure virtual machines in another tenant included in an update deployment.

#### Resolution

You'll need to use the following workaround to get them scheduled. You can use the [New-AzureRmAutomationSchedule](/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/new-azurermautomationschedule) cmdlet with the switch `-ForUpdate` to create a schedule, and use the [New-AzureRmAutomationSoftwareUpdateConfiguration](/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/new-azurermautomationsoftwareupdateconfiguration
) cmdlet and pass the machines in the other tenant to the `-NonAzureComputer` parameter. The following example shows an example on how to do this:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$nonAzurecomputers = @("server-01", "server-02")

$startTime = ([DateTime]::Now).AddMinutes(10)

$s = New-AzureRmAutomationSchedule -ResourceGroupName mygroup -AutomationAccountName myaccount -Name myupdateconfig -Description test-OneTime -OneTime -StartTime $startTime -ForUpdate

New-AzureRmAutomationSoftwareUpdateConfiguration  -ResourceGroupName $rg -AutomationAccountName $aa -Schedule $s -Windows -AzureVMResourceId $azureVMIdsW -NonAzureComputer $nonAzurecomputers -Duration (New-TimeSpan -Hours 2) -IncludedUpdateClassification Security,UpdateRollup -ExcludedKbNumber KB01,KB02 -IncludedKbNumber KB100
```

### <a name="nologs"></a>Scenario: Machines don't show up in the portal under Update Management

#### Issue

You may run across the following scenarios:

* Your machine shows **Not configured** from the Update Management view of a VM

* Your machines are missing from the Update Management view of your Automation Account

* You have machines that show as **Not Assessed** under **Compliance**, but you see heartbeat data in Azure Monitor logs for the Hybrid Runbook Worker but not Update Management.

#### Cause

This can be caused by potential local configuration issues or by improperly configured Scope Configuration.

The Hybrid Runbook Worker may need to be re-registered and reinstalled.

You may have defined a quota in your workspace that has been reached and stopping data from being stored.

#### Resolution

* Ensure your machine is reporting to the correct workspace. Verify what workspace your machine is reporting to. For instructions on how to verify this, see [Verify agent connectivity to Log Analytics](../../azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows.md#verify-agent-connectivity-to-log-analytics). Then, ensure this is the workspace that is linked to your Azure Automation account. To confirm this, navigate to your Automation Account and click **Linked workspace** under **Related Resources**.

* Check to ensure the machines show up in your Log Analytics workspace. Run the following query in your Log Analytics workspace that is linked to your Automation Account. If you do not see your machine in the query results, your machine is not heartbeating, which means there is most likely a local configuration issue. You can run the troubleshooter for [Windows](update-agent-issues.md#troubleshoot-offline) or [Linux](update-agent-issues-linux.md#troubleshoot-offline) depending on the OS, or you can [re-install the agent](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-windows-computer.md#install-the-agent-for-windows). If your machine shows up in the query results, then you need to very the scope configuration specified in the following bullet.

  ```loganalytics
  Heartbeat
  | summarize by Computer, Solutions
  ```

* Check for scope configuration problems. [Scope Configuration](../automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account.md#scope-configuration) determines which machines get configured for the solution. If your machine is showing up in your workspace but is not showing up you will need to configure the scope config to target the machines. To learn how to do this, see [Onboard machines in the workspace](../automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account.md#onboard-machines-in-the-workspace).

* If the above steps do not solve your problem, Follow the steps at [Deploy a Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-windows-hrw-install.md) to reinstall the Hybrid Worker for Windows or [Deploy a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-linux-hrw-install.md) for Linux.

* In your workspace, run the following query. If you see the result `Data collection stopped due to daily limit of free data reached. Ingestion status = OverQuota` you have a quota defined on your workspace that has been reached and has stopped data from being saved. In your workspace, navigate to **Usage and estimated costs** > **data volume management** and check your quota or remove the quota you have.

  ```loganalytics
  Operation
  | where OperationCategory == 'Data Collection Status'
  | sort by TimeGenerated desc
  ```

## Windows

If you encounter issues while attempting to onboard the solution on a virtual machine, check the **Operations Manager** event log under **Application and Services Logs** on the local machine for events with event ID **4502** and event message containing **Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.HealthService.AzureAutomation.HybridAgent**.

The following section highlights specific error messages and a possible resolution for each. For other onboarding issues see, [troubleshoot solution onboarding](onboarding.md).

### <a name="machine-already-registered"></a>Scenario: Machine is already registered to a different account

#### Issue

You receive the following error message:

```error
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception System.InvalidOperationException: {"Message":"Machine is already registered to a different account."}
```

#### Cause

The machine is already onboarded to another workspace for Update Management.

#### Resolution

Perform cleanup of old artifacts on the machine by [deleting the hybrid runbook group](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#remove-a-hybrid-worker-group) and try again.

### <a name="machine-unable-to-communicate"></a>Scenario: Machine is unable to communicate with the service

#### Issue

You receive one of the following error messages:

```error
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive. ---> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The client and server can't communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm
```

```error
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: Error parsing positive infinity value.
```

```error
The certificate presented by the service <wsid>.oms.opinsights.azure.com was not issued by a certificate authority used for Microsoft services. Contact your network administrator to see if they are running a proxy that intercepts TLS/SSL communication.
```

#### Cause

There may be a proxy, gateway, or firewall blocking network communication.

#### Resolution

Review your networking and ensure appropriate ports and addresses are allowed. See [network requirements](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning), for a list of ports and addresses that are required by Update Management and Hybrid Runbook Workers.

### <a name="unable-to-create-selfsigned-cert"></a>Scenario: Unable to create self-signed certificate

#### Issue

You receive one of the following error messages:

```error
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception AgentService.HybridRegistration. PowerShell.Certificates.CertificateCreationException: Failed to create a self-signed certificate. ---> System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access is denied.
```

#### Cause

The Hybrid Runbook Worker wasn't able to generate a self-signed certificate

#### Resolution

Verify system account has read access to folder **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA** and try again.

### <a name="failed-to-start"></a>Scenario: A machine shows Failed to start in an update deployment

#### Issue

A machine has the status **Failed to start** for a machine. When you view the specific details for the machine you see the following error:

```error
Failed to start the runbook. Check the parameters passed. RunbookName Patch-MicrosoftOMSComputer. Exception You have requested to create a runbook job on a hybrid worker group that does not exist.
```

#### Cause

This error may happen due to one of the following reasons:

* The machine doesn’t exist anymore.
* The machine is turned off and unreachable.
* The machine has a network connectivity issue and the hybrid worker on the machine is unreachable.
* There was an update to the Microsoft Monitoring Agent that changed the SourceComputerId
* Your update run may have been throttled if you hit the 2,000 concurrent job limit in an Automation Account. Each deployment is considered a job and each machine in an update deployment count as a job. Any other automation job or update deployment currently running in your Automation Account count towards the concurrent job limit.

#### Resolution

When applicable use [dynamic groups](../automation-update-management.md#using-dynamic-groups) for your update deployments.

* Verify the machine still exists and is reachable. If it does not exist, edit your deployment and remove the machine.
* See the section on [network planning](../automation-update-management.md#ports) for a list of ports and addresses that are required for Update Management and verify your machine meets these requirements.
* Run the following query in Log Analytics to find machines in your environment whose `SourceComputerId` changed. Look for computers that have the same `Computer` value, but different `SourceComputerId` value. Once you find the affected machines, you must edit the update deployments that target those machines, and remove and re-add the machines so the `SourceComputerId` reflects the correct value.

   ```loganalytics
   Heartbeat | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d) | distinct SourceComputerId, Computer, ComputerIP
   ```

### <a name="hresult"></a>Scenario: Machine shows as Not assessed and shows an HResult exception

#### Issue

You have machines that show as **Not Assessed** under **Compliance**, and you see an exception message below it.

#### Cause

Windows Update or WSUS is not configured correctly in the machine. Update Management relies of Windows Update or WSUS to provide the updates that are needed, the status of the patch, and the results of patches deployed. Without this information Update Management can not properly report on the patches that are needed or installed.

#### Resolution

Double-click on the exception displayed in red to see the entire exception message. Review the following table for potential solutions or actions to take:

|Exception  |Resolution or Action  |
|---------|---------|
|`Exception from HRESULT: 0x……C`     | Search the relevant error code in [Windows update error code list](https://support.microsoft.com/help/938205/windows-update-error-code-list) to find additional details on the cause of the exception.        |
|`0x8024402C`</br>`0x8024401C`</br>`0x8024402F`      | These errors are network connectivity issues. Make sure that your machine has the proper network connectivity to Update Management. See the section on [network planning](../automation-update-management.md#ports) for a list of ports and addresses that are required.        |
|`0x8024001E`| The update operation did not complete because the service or system was shutting down.|
|`0x8024002E`| Windows Update service is disabled.|
|`0x8024402C`     | If you are using a WSUS server, make sure the registry values for `WUServer` and `WUStatusServer` under the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate` have the correct WSUS server.        |
|`The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070422)`     | Make sure the Windows Update service (wuauserv) is running and is not disabled.        |
|Any other generic exception     | Do a search the internet for the possible solutions and work with your local IT support.         |

Reviewing the `windowsupdate.log` can help you try to determine the possible cause as well. For more information on how to read the log, see [How to read the Windowsupdate.log file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/902093/how-to-read-the-windowsupdate-log-file).

Additionally you can download and run the [Windows Update troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter) to check if there are any issues with Windows Update on the machine.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Windows Update troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter) states it is for Windows clients but it works on Windows Server as well.

## Linux

### Scenario: Update run fails to start

#### Issue

An update runs fail to start on a Linux machine.

#### Cause

The Linux Hybrid Worker is unhealthy.

#### Resolution

Make a copy of the following log file and preserve it for troubleshooting purposes:

```bash
/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/run/automationworker/worker.log
```

### Scenario: Update run starts, but encounters errors

#### Issue

An update run starts, but encounters errors during the run.

#### Cause

Possible causes could be:

* Package manager is unhealthy
* Specific packages may interfere with cloud based patching
* Other reasons

#### Resolution

If failures occur during an update run after it starts successfully on Linux, check the job output from the affected machine in the run. You may find specific error messages from your machine's package manager that you can research and take action on. Update Management requires the package manager to be healthy for successful update deployments.

In some cases, package updates can interfere with Update Management preventing an update deployment from completing. If you see that, you'll have to either exclude these packages from future update runs or install them manually yourself.

If you can't resolve a patching issue, make a copy of the following log file and preserve it **before** the next update deployment starts for troubleshooting purposes:

```bash
/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/run/automationworker/omsupdatemgmt.log
```
