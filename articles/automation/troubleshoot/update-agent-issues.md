# Understand the Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker health in Update Management

There may be many reasons your machine isn't showing **Ready** in Update Management. In Update Management, you can check the health of a Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to determine the underlying problem. This article discusses how to run the troubleshooter for Azure machines from the Azure portal and non-Azure machines in the [offline scenario](#troubleshoot-offline).

The following list are the three readiness states a machine can be in:

* **Ready** - The Hybrid Runbook Worker is deployed and was last seen less than 1 hour ago.
* **Disconnected** -  The Hybrid Runbook Worker is deployed and was last seen over 1 hour ago.
* **Not configured** -  The Hybrid Runbook Worker isn't found or hasn't finished onboarding.

> [!NOTE]
> There may be a slight delay between what the Azure portal shows and the current state of the machine.

## Start the troubleshooter

For Azure machines, clicking the **Troubleshoot** link under the **Update Agent Readiness** column in the portal launches the **Troubleshoot Update Agent** page. For non-Azure machines, the link brings you to this article. See the [offline instructions](#troubleshoot-offline) to troubleshoot a non-Azure machine.

> [!NOTE]
> To check the health of the Hybrid Runbook Worker, the VM must be running. If the VM isn't running, a **Start the VM** button appears.

On the **Troubleshoot Update Agent** page, select **Run checks** to start the troubleshooter. The troubleshooter uses [Run Command](../../virtual-machines/windows/run-command.md) to run a script on the machine to verify dependencies. When the troubleshooter is finished, it returns the result of the checks.

Results are shown on the page when they're ready. The checks sections show what's included in each check.

## Prerequisite checks

### Operating system

The operating system check verifies whether the Hybrid Runbook Worker is running one of the following operating systems:

|Operating system  |Notes  |
|---------|---------|
|Windows Server 2008 R2 RTM, Windows Server 2008 | Supports only update assessments.         |
|Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later |.NET Framework 4.6 or later is required. ([Download the .NET Framework](/dotnet/framework/install/guide-for-developers))<br/> Windows PowerShell 5.1 is required.  ([Download Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616))        |

### .NET 4.6.2

The .NET Framework check verifies that the system has a minimum of [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345) installed.

### WMF 5.1

The WMF check verifies that the system has the required version of the Windows Management Framework (WMF) - [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616).

### TLS 1.2

This check determines whether you're using TLS 1.2 to encrypt your communications. TLS 1.0 is no longer supported by the platform. We recommend that clients use TLS 1.2 to communicate with Update Management.

## Connectivity checks

### Registration endpoint

This check determines whether the agent can properly communicate with the agent service.

Proxy and firewall configurations must allow the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to communicate with the registration endpoint. For a list of addresses and ports to open, see [Network planning for Hybrid Workers](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

### Operations endpoint

This check determines whether the agent can properly communicate with the Job Runtime Data Service.

Proxy and firewall configurations must allow the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to communicate with the Job Runtime Data Service. For a list of addresses and ports to open, see [Network planning for Hybrid Workers](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

## VM service health checks

### Monitoring agent service status

This check determines whether `HealthService`, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, is running on the machine.

To learn more about troubleshooting the service, see [The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is not running](hybrid-runbook-worker.md#mma-not-running).

To reinstall the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, see [Install and configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-windows-computer.md#install-the-agent-for-windows).

### Monitoring agent service events

This check determines whether any `4502` events appear in the Azure Operations Manager log on the machine in the past 24 hours.

To learn more about this event, see the [troubleshooting guide](hybrid-runbook-worker.md#event-4502) for this event.

## Access permissions checks

### MachineKeys folder access

The Crypto folder access check determines whether the Local System Account has access to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA.

## <a name="troubleshoot-offline"></a>Troubleshoot offline

You can use the troubleshooter on a Hybrid Runbook Worker offline by running the script locally. You can get the script,  [Troubleshoot-WindowsUpdateAgentRegistration](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Troubleshoot-WindowsUpdateAgentRegistration), in the PowerShell Gallery. You must have WMF 4.0, or greater, installed to run the script. To download the latest version of PowerShell, see [Installing various versions of PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell).

The output of this script looks like the following example:
