# Troubleshoot Desired State Configuration (DSC)

This article provides information on troubleshooting issues with Desired State Configuration (DSC).

## Steps to troubleshoot Desired State Configuration (DSC)

When you have errors compiling or deploying configurations in Azure State Configuration, here are a few
steps to help you diagnose the issue.

1. **Ensure your configuration compiles successfully on your local machine:**  Azure State Configuration
   is built on PowerShell DSC. You can find the documentation for the DSC language and syntax in
   the [PowerShell DSC Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview).

   By compiling your DSC configuration on your local machine you can discover and resolve common errors, such as:

   - **Missing Modules**
   - **Syntax Errors**
   - **Logic Errors**

2. **View DSC logs on your Node:** If your configuration compiles successfully, but fails when applied to a Node, you can find
   detailed information in the logs. For information about where to find DSC logs, see [Where are the DSC Event Logs](/powershell/dsc/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#where-are-dsc-event-logs).

   Furthermore, the [xDscDiagnostics](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDscDiagnostics) can assist you in parsing detailed information
   from the DSC logs. If you contact support, they will require these logs to diagnose your issue.

   You can install **xDscDiagnostics** on your local machine using the instructions found under [Install the stable version module](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDscDiagnostics#install-the-stable-version-module).

   To install **xDscDiagnostics** on your Azure machine, you can use [az vm run-command](/cli/azure/vm/run-command) or [Invoke-AzVMRunCommand](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/invoke-azurermvmruncommand). You can also use the **Run command** option from the portal, by following the steps found in [Run PowerShell scripts in your Windows VM with Run Command](../../virtual-machines/windows/run-command.md).

   For information on using **xDscDiagnostics**, see [Using xDscDiagnostics to analyze DSC logs](/powershell/dsc/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#using-xdscdiagnostics-to-analyze-dsc-logs), as well as [xDscDiagnostics Cmdlets](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDscDiagnostics#cmdlets).
3. **Ensure your Nodes and Automation workspace have the required modules:** Desired State Configuration depends on modules installed on the Node.  When using Azure Automation State Configuration, import any required modules into your automation account using the steps listed in [Import Modules](../shared-resources/modules.md#import-modules). Configurations can also have a dependency on specific versions of modules.  For more information, see, [Troubleshoot Modules](shared-resources.md#modules).

## Common errors when working with Desired State Configuration (DSC)

### <a name="unsupported-characters"></a>Scenario: A configuration with special characters cannot be deleted from the portal

#### Issue

When attempting to delete a DSC configuration from the portal, you see the following error:

```error
An error occurred while deleting the DSC configuration '<name>'.  Error-details: The argument configurationName with the value <name> is not valid.  Valid configuration names can contain only letters,  numbers, and underscores.  The name must start with a letter.  The length of the name must be between 1 and 64 characters.
```

#### Cause

This error is a temporary issue that is planned to be resolved.

#### Resolution

* Use the Az Cmdlet "Remove-AzAutomationDscConfiguration" to delete the configuration.
* The documentation for this cmdlet hasn't been updated yet.  Until then, refer to the documentation for the AzureRM module.
  * [Remove-AzureRmAutomationDSCConfiguration](/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/Remove-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration)

### <a name="failed-to-register-agent"></a>Scenario: Failed to register Dsc Agent

#### Issue

When attempting to run `Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager` or another DSC cmdlet you receive the error:

```error
Registration of the Dsc Agent with the server
https://<location>-agentservice-prod-1.azure-automation.net/accounts/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 failed. The
underlying error is: Failed to register Dsc Agent with AgentId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 with the server htt
ps://<location>-agentservice-prod-1.azure-automation.net/accounts/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/Nodes(AgentId='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'). .
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidResult: (root/Microsoft/...gurationManager:String) [], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RegisterDscAgentCommandFailed,Microsoft.PowerShell.DesiredStateConfiguration.Commands.Re
   gisterDscAgentCommand
    + PSComputerName        : <computerName>
```

#### Cause

This error is normally caused by a firewall, the machine being behind a proxy server, or other network errors.

#### Resolution

Verify your machine has access to the proper endpoints for Azure Automation DSC and try again. For a list of ports and addresses needed, see [network planning](../automation-dsc-overview.md#network-planning)

### <a name="failed-not-found"></a>Scenario: Node is in failed status with a "Not found" error

#### Issue

The node has a report with **Failed** status and containing the error:

```error
The attempt to get the action from server https://<url>//accounts/<account-id>/Nodes(AgentId=<agent-id>)/GetDscAction failed because a valid configuration <guid> cannot be found.
```

#### Cause

This error typically occurs when the node is assigned to a configuration name (for example, ABC) instead of a node configuration name (for example, ABC.WebServer).

#### Resolution

* Make sure that you're assigning the node with "node configuration name" and not the "configuration name".
* You can assign a node configuration to a node using Azure portal or with a PowerShell cmdlet.

  * To assign a node configuration to a node using Azure portal, open the **DSC Nodes** page, then select a node and click on **Assign node configuration** button.
  * To assign a node configuration to a node using PowerShell cmdlet, use **Set-AzureRmAutomationDscNode** cmdlet

### <a name="no-mof-files"></a>Scenario: No node configurations (MOF files) were produced when a configuration is compiled

#### Issue

Your DSC compilation job suspends with the error:

```error
Compilation completed successfully, but no node configuration.mofs were generated.
```

#### Cause

When the expression following the **Node** keyword in the DSC configuration evaluates to `$null`, then no node configurations are produced.

#### Resolution

Any of the following solutions fix the problem:

* Make sure that the expression next to the **Node** keyword in the configuration definition isn't evaluating to $null.
* If you are passing ConfigurationData when compiling the configuration, make sure that you are passing the expected values that the configuration requires from [ConfigurationData](../automation-dsc-compile.md).

### <a name="dsc-in-progress"></a>Scenario: The DSC node report becomes stuck "in progress" state

#### Issue

The DSC agent outputs:

```error
No instance found with given property values
```

#### Cause

You have upgraded your WMF version and have corrupted WMI.

#### Resolution

To fix the issue, follow the instructions in the [DSC known issues and limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/wmf/known-issues/known-issues-dsc) article.

### <a name="issue-using-credential"></a>Scenario: Unable to use a credential in a DSC configuration

#### Issue

Your DSC compilation job was suspended with the error:

```error
System.InvalidOperationException error processing property 'Credential' of type <some resource name>: Converting and storing an encrypted password as plaintext is allowed only if PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword is set to true.
```

#### Cause

You've used a credential in a configuration but didnâ€™t provide proper **ConfigurationData** to set **PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword** to true for each node configuration.

#### Resolution

* Make sure to pass in the proper **ConfigurationData** to set **PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword** to true for each node configuration that is mentioned in the configuration. For more information, see [assets in Azure Automation DSC](../automation-dsc-compile.md#working-with-assets-in-azure-automation-during-compilation).

### <a name="failure-processing-extension"></a>Scenario: Onboarding from dsc extension, "Failure processing extension" error

#### Issue

When onboarding using DSC extension, a failure occurs containing the error:

```error
VM has reported a failure when processing extension 'Microsoft.Powershell.DSC'. Error message: \"DSC COnfiguration 'RegistrationMetaConfigV2' completed with error(s). Following are the first few: Registration of the Dsc Agent with the server <url> failed. The underlying error is: The attempt to register Dsc Agent with Agent Id <ID> with the server <url> return unexpected response code BadRequest. .\".
```

#### Cause

This error typically occurs when the node is assigned a node configuration name that does not exist in the service.

#### Resolution

* Make sure that you're assigning the node with a node configuration name that exactly matches the name in the service.
* You can choose to not include the node configuration name, which will result in onboarding the node but not assigning a node configuration

### <a name="failure-linux-temp-noexec"></a>Scenario: Applying a configuration in Linux, a failure occurs with a general error

#### Issue

When applying a configuration in Linux, a failure occurs containing the error:

```error
This event indicates that failure happens when LCM is processing the configuration. ErrorId is 1. ErrorDetail is The SendConfigurationApply function did not succeed.. ResourceId is [resource]name and SourceInfo is ::nnn::n::resource. ErrorMessage is A general error occurred, not covered by a more specific error code..
```

#### Cause

Customers have identified that if the `/tmp` location is set to `noexec`, the current version of DSC will fail to apply configurations.

#### Resolution

* Remove the `noexec` option from the `/tmp` location.

### <a name="compilation-node-name-overlap"></a>Scenario: Node configuration names that overlap could result in bad release

#### Issue

If a single configuration script is used to generate multiple node configurations, and some of the node configurations have a name that is a subset of others, an issue in the compilation service could result in assigning the wrong configuration.  This only occurs when using a single script to generate configurations with configuration data per node, and only when the name overlap occurs at the beginning of the string.

Example, if a single configuration script is used to generate configurations based on node data passed as a hashtable using cmdlets, and the node data includes a server named "server" and "1server".

#### Cause

Known issue with the compilation service.

#### Resolution

The best workaround would be to compile locally or in a CI/CD pipeline and upload the MOF files directly to the service.  If compilation in the service is a requirement, the next best workaround would be to split the compilation jobs so there is no overlap in names.
