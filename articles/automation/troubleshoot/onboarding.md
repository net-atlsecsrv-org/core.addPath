# Troubleshoot errors when onboarding solutions

You may encounter errors when onboarding solutions like Update Management or Change Tracking and Inventory. This article describes the various errors that may occur and how to resolve them.

## General Errors

### <a name="missing-write-permissions"></a>Scenario: Onboarding fails with the message - The solution cannot be enabled

#### Issue

You receive one of the following messages when you attempt to onboard a virtual machine to a solution:

```error
The solution cannot be enabled due to missing permissions for the virtual machine or deployments
```

```error
The solution cannot be enabled on this VM because the permission to read the workspace is missing
```

#### Cause

This error is caused by incorrect or missing permissions on the virtual machine, the workspace, or for the user.

#### Resolution

Ensure you have correct permissions to onboard the virtual machine. Review the [permissions needed to onboard machines](../automation-role-based-access-control.md#onboarding) and try to onboard the solution again. If you receive the error `The solution cannot be enabled on this VM because the permission to read the workspace is missing`, ensure you have the `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read` permission to be able to find if the VM is onboarded to a workspace.

### <a name="diagnostic-logging"></a>Scenario: Onboarding fails with the message - Failed to configure Automation Account for diagnostic logging

#### Issue

You receive the following message when you attempt to onboard a virtual machine to a solution:

```error
Failed to configure automation account for diagnostic logging
```

#### Cause

This error can be caused if the pricing tier doesn't match the subscription's billing model. For more information, see [Monitoring usage and estimated costs in Azure Monitor](https://aka.ms/PricingTierWarning).

#### Resolution

Create your Log Analytics workspace manually and repeat the onboarding process to select the workspace created.

### <a name="computer-group-query-format-error"></a>Scenario: ComputerGroupQueryFormatError

#### Issue

This error code means that the saved search computer group query used to target the solution was not formatted correctly. 

#### Cause

You may have altered the query, or it may have been altered by the system.

#### Resolution

You can delete the query for this solution, and reonboard the solution, which recreates the query. The query can be found within your workspace, under **Saved searches**. The name of the query is **MicrosoftDefaultComputerGroup**, and the category of the query is the name of the solution associated with this query. If multiple solutions are enabled, the **MicrosoftDefaultComputerGroup** shows multiple times under **Saved Searches**.

### <a name="policy-violation"></a>Scenario: PolicyViolation

#### Issue

This error code means that the deployment failed due to violation of one or more policies.

#### Cause 

A policy is in place that is blocking the operation from completing.

#### Resolution

In order to successfully deploy the solution, you need to consider altering the indicated policy. As there are many different types of policies that can be defined, the specific changes required depend on the policy that is violated. For example, if a policy was defined on a resource group that denied permission to change the contents of certain types of resources within that resource group, you could, for example, do any of the following:

* Remove the policy altogether.
* Try to onboard to a different resource group.
* Revise the policy, by, for example:
  * Re-targeting the policy to a specific resource (such as to a specific Automation account).
  * Revising the set of resources that policy was configured to deny.

Check the notifications in the top-right corner of the Azure portal or navigate to the resource group that contains your automation account and select **Deployments** under **Settings** to view the failed deployment. To learn more about Azure Policy visit: [Overview of Azure Policy](../../governance/policy/overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fautomation%2ftoc.json).

### <a name="unlink"></a>Scenario: Errors trying to unlink a workspace

#### Issue

You receive the following error when trying to unlink a workspace:

```error
The link cannot be updated or deleted because it is linked to Update Management and/or ChangeTracking Solutions.
```

#### Cause

This error occurs when you still have solutions active in your Log Analytics workspace that depend on your Automation Account and Log Analtyics workspace being linked.

### Resolution

To resolve this you'll need to remove the following solutions from your Workspace if you are using them:

* Update Management
* Change Tracking
* Start/Stop VMs during off-hours

Once you remove the solutions you can unlink your workspace. It is important to clean up any existing artifacts from those solutions from your workspace and Automation Account as well.  

* Update Management
  * Remove Update Deployments (Schedules) from your Automation Account
* Start/Stop VMs during off-hours
  * Remove any locks on solution components in your Automation Account under **Settings** > **Locks**.
  * For additional steps to remove the Start/Stop VMs during off-hours solution see, [Remove the Start/Stop VM during off-hours solution](../automation-solution-vm-management.md##remove-the-solution).

## <a name="mma-extension-failures"></a>MMA Extension failures

[!INCLUDE [log-analytics-agent-note](../../../includes/log-analytics-agent-note.md)] 

When deploying a solution, a variety of related resources are deployed. One of those resources is the Microsoft Monitoring Agent Extension or Log Analytics agent for Linux. These are Virtual Machine Extensions installed by the virtual machineâ€™s Guest Agent that is responsible for communicating with the configured Log Analytics workspace, for the purpose of later coordination of the downloading of binaries and other files that the solution you're onboarding depend on once it begins execution.
You typically first become aware of MMA or Log Analytics agent for Linux installation failures from a notification appearing in the Notifications Hub. Clicking on that notification gives further information about the specific failure. Navigation to the Resource Groups resource, and then to the Deployments element within it also provides details on the deployment failures that occurred.
Installation of the MMA or Log Analytics agent for Linux can fail for a variety of reasons, and the steps to take to address these failures vary, depending on the issue. Specific troubleshooting steps follow.

The following section describes various issues that you can come across when onboarding that cause a failure in the deployment of the MMA extension.

### <a name="webclient-exception"></a>Scenario: An exception occurred during a WebClient request

The MMA extension on the virtual machine is unable to communicate with external resources and deployment fails.

#### Issue

The following are examples of error messages that are returned:

```error
Please verify the VM has a running VM agent, and can establish outbound connections to Azure storage.
```

```error
'Manifest download error from https://<endpoint>/<endpointId>/Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring_MicrosoftMonitoringAgent_australiaeast_manifest.xml. Error: UnknownError. An exception occurred during a WebClient request.
```

#### Cause

Some potential causes to this error are:

* There's a proxy configured in the VM, that only allows specific ports.

* A firewall setting has blocked access to the required ports and addresses.

#### Resolution

Ensure that you have the proper ports and addresses open for communication. For a list of ports and addresses, see [planning your network](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

### <a name="transient-environment-issue"></a>Scenario: Install failed because of a transient environment issues

The installation of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension failed during deployment because of another installation or action blocking the installation

#### Issue

The following are examples of error messages may be returned:

```error
The Microsoft Monitoring Agent failed to install on this machine. Please try to uninstall and reinstall the extension. If the issue persists, please contact support.
```

```error
'Install failed for plugin (name: Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent, version 1.0.11081.4) with exception Command C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent\1.0.11081.4\MMAExtensionInstall.exe of Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent has exited with Exit code: 1618'
```

```error
'Install failed for plugin (name: Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent, version 1.0.11081.2) with exception Command C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent\1.0.11081.2\MMAExtensionInstall.exe of Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent has exited with Exit code: 1601'
```

#### Cause

Some potential causes to this error are:

* Another installation is in progress
* The system is triggered to reboot during template deployment

#### Resolution

This error is a transient error in nature. Retry the deployment to install the extension.

### <a name="installation-timeout"></a>Scenario: Installation timeout

The installation of the MMA extension didn't complete because of a timeout.

#### Issue

The following example is of an error message that may be returned:

```error
Install failed for plugin (name: Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent, version 1.0.11081.4) with exception Command C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent\1.0.11081.4\MMAExtensionInstall.exe of Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent has exited with Exit code: 15614
```

#### Cause

This error occurs because the virtual machine being under a heavy load during installation.

### Resolution

Attempt to install the MMA extension when the VM is under a lower load.
