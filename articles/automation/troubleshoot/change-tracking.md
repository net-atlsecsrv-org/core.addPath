# Troubleshoot Change Tracking and Inventory issues

This article describes how to troubleshoot Change Tracking and Inventory issues.

>[!NOTE]
>This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-3.5.0). For Az module installation instructions on your Hybrid Runbook Worker, see [Install the Azure PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.5.0). For your Automation account, you can update your modules to the latest version using [How to update Azure PowerShell modules in Azure Automation](../automation-update-azure-modules.md).

## Windows

### <a name="records-not-showing-windows"></a>Scenario: Change Tracking and Inventory records aren't showing for Windows machines

#### Issue

You don't see any Change Tracking and Inventory results for Windows machines that are onboarded.

#### Cause

This error can have the following causes:

* The Log Analytics agent for Windows isn't running.
* Communication back to the Automation account is being blocked.
* The Change Tracking and Inventory management packs aren't downloaded.
* The VM being onboarded might have come from a cloned machine that wasn't sysprepped with the Log Analytics agent for Windows installed.

#### Resolution

On the Log Analytics agent machine, navigate to **C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\Tools** and run the following commands:

```cmd
net stop healthservice
StopTracing.cmd
StartTracing.cmd VER
net start healthservice
```

If you still need help, you can collect diagnostics information and contact support. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Log Analyticss agent enables error tracing by default. To enable verbose error messages as in the preceding example, use the `VER` parameter. For information traces, use `INF` when invoking `StartTracing.cmd`.

##### Log Analytics agent for Windows not running

Verify that the Log Analytics agent for Windows (**HealthService.exe**) is running on the machine.

##### Communication to Automation account blocked

Check Event Viewer on the machine and look for any events that have the word `changetracking` in them.

See [Automate resources in your datacenter or cloud by using Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning) to learn about addresses and ports that must be allowed for Change Tracking and Inventory to work.

##### Management packs not downloaded

Verify that the following Change Tracking and Inventory management packs are installed locally:

* `Microsoft.IntelligencePacks.ChangeTrackingDirectAgent.*`
* `Microsoft.IntelligencePacks.InventoryChangeTracking.*`
* `Microsoft.IntelligencePacks.SingletonInventoryCollection.*`

##### VM from cloned machine that has not been sysprepped

If using a cloned image, sysprep the image first and then install the Log Analytics agent for Windows.

## Linux

### Scenario: No Change Tracking and Inventory results on Linux machines

#### Issue

You don't see any Inventory and Change Tracking results for Linux machines that are onboarded for the solution. 

#### Cause
Here are possible causes specific to this issue:
* The Log Analytics agent for Linux isn't running.
* The Log Analytics agent for Linux isn't configured correctly.
* There are File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) conflicts.

#### Resolution 

##### Log Analytics agent for Linux not running

Verify that the daemon for the Log Analytics agent for Linux (**omsagent**) is running on your machine. Run the following query in the Log Analytics workspace that's linked to your Automation account.

```loganalytics Copy
Heartbeat
| summarize by Computer, Solutions
```

If you don't see your machine in query results, it hasn't recently checked in. There's probably a local configuration issue and you should reinstall the agent. For information about installation and configuration, see [Collect log data with the Log Analytics agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent). 

If your machine shows up in the query results, verify the scope configuration. See [Targeting monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solution-targeting).

For more troubleshooting of this issue, see [Issue: You are not seeing any Linux data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-linux-troubleshoot#issue-you-are-not-seeing-any-linux-data).

##### Log Analytics agent for Linux not configured correctly

The Log Analytics agent for Linux might not be configured correctly for log and command line output collection using the OMS Log Collector tool. See [Track changes in your environment with the Change Tracking and Inventory solution](../change-tracking.md).

##### FIM conflicts

Azure Security Centerâ€™s FIM feature might be incorrectly validating the integrity of your Linux files. Verify that FIM is operational and correctly configured for Linux file monitoring. See [Track changes in your environment with the Change Tracking and Inventory solution](../change-tracking.md).
