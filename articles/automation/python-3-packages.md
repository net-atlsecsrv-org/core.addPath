# Manage Python 3 packages in Azure Automation

Azure Automation allows you to run Python 3 runbooks on Azure and on Linux Hybrid Runbook Workers. To help in simplification of runbooks, you can use Python packages to import the modules that you need. This article describes how to manage and use Python 3 packages in Azure Automation.

## Import packages

In your Automation account, select **Python packages** under **Shared Resources**. select **+ Add a Python package**.

On the **Add Python Package** page, select Python 3 for the **Version**, and select a local package to upload. The package can be a **.whl** or **.tar.gz** file. When the package is selected, select **OK** to upload it.

Once a package has been imported, it's listed on the Python packages page in your Automation account, under the **Python 3 packages (preview)** tab. If you need to remove a package, select the package and click **Delete**.

## Import packages with dependencies

Azure Automation doesn't resolve dependencies for Python packages during the import process. However, there is a way to import a package with all its dependencies.

### Manually download

On a Windows 64-bit machine with [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, run the following command to download a package and all its dependencies:

```cmd
C:\Python38\Scripts\pip3.8.exe download -d <output dir> <package name>
```

Once the packages are downloaded, you can import them into your Automation account.

## Use a package in a runbook

With the package imported, you can use it in a runbook. Add the following code to list all the resource groups in an Azure subscription.

```python
import os  
import azure.mgmt.resource  
import automationassets  

def get_automation_runas_credential(runas_connection):  
    from OpenSSL import crypto  
    import binascii  
    from msrestazure import azure_active_directory  
    import adal 

    # Get the Azure Automation RunAs service principal certificate  
    cert = automationassets.get_automation_certificate("AzureRunAsCertificate")  
    pks12_cert = crypto.load_pkcs12(cert)  
    pem_pkey = crypto.dump_privatekey(crypto.FILETYPE_PEM,pks12_cert.get_privatekey())  

    # Get run as connection information for the Azure Automation service principal 
    application_id = runas_connection["ApplicationId"]  
    thumbprint = runas_connection["CertificateThumbprint"]  
    tenant_id = runas_connection["TenantId"]  

    # Authenticate with service principal certificate  
    resource ="https://management.core.windows.net/"  
    authority_url = ("https://login.microsoftonline.com/"+tenant_id)  
    context = adal.AuthenticationContext(authority_url)  
    return azure_active_directory.AdalAuthentication(  
    lambda: context.acquire_token_with_client_certificate(  
            resource,  
            application_id,  
            pem_pkey,  
            thumbprint) 
    ) 

# Authenticate to Azure using the Azure Automation RunAs service principal  
runas_connection = automationassets.get_automation_connection("AzureRunAsConnection")  
azure_credential = get_automation_runas_credential(runas_connection)  

# Intialize the resource management client with the RunAs credential and subscription  
resource_client = azure.mgmt.resource.ResourceManagementClient(  
    azure_credential,  
    str(runas_connection["SubscriptionId"]))  

# Get list of resource groups and print them out  
groups = resource_client.resource_groups.list()  
for group in groups:  
    print(group.name) 
```
