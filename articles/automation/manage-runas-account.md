# Manage Azure Automation Run As accounts

Run As accounts in Azure Automation are used to provide authentication for managing resources in Azure with the Azure cmdlets.

When you create a Run As account, it creates a new service principal user in Azure Active Directory and assigns the Contributor role to this user at the subscription level. For runbooks that use Hybrid Runbook Workers on Azure virtual machines, you can use [managed identities for Azure resources](automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md#managed-identities-for-azure-resources) instead of Run As accounts to authenticate to your Azure resources.

There are two types of Run As Accounts:

* **Azure Run As Account** - This account is used to manage [Resource Manager deployment model](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md) resources.
  * Creates an Azure AD application with a self-signed certificate, creates a service principal account for the application in Azure AD, and assigns the Contributor role for the account in your current subscription. You can change this setting to Owner or any other role. For more information, see [Role-based access control in Azure Automation](automation-role-based-access-control.md).
  * Creates an Automation certificate asset named *AzureRunAsCertificate* in the specified Automation account. The certificate asset holds the certificate private key that's used by the Azure AD application.
  * Creates an Automation connection asset named *AzureRunAsConnection* in the specified Automation account. The connection asset holds the applicationId, tenantId, subscriptionId, and certificate thumbprint.

* **Azure Classic Run As Account** - This account is used to manage [Classic deployment model](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md) resources.
  * Creates a management certificate in the subscription
  * Creates an Automation certificate asset named *AzureClassicRunAsCertificate* in the specified Automation account. The certificate asset holds the certificate private key used by the management certificate.
  * Creates an Automation connection asset named *AzureClassicRunAsConnection* in the specified Automation account. The connection asset holds the subscription name, subscriptionId, and certificate asset name.
  * Must be a co-administrator on the subscription to create or renew

  > [!NOTE]
  > Azure Cloud Solution Provider (Azure CSP) subscriptions support only the Azure Resource Manager model, non-Azure Resource Manager services are not available in the program. When using a CSP subscription the Azure Classic Run As Account does not get created. The Azure Run As Account still gets created. To learn more about CSP subscriptions, see [Available services in CSP subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-solution-provider/overview/azure-csp-available-services#comments).

  > [!NOTE]
  > The service principal for a Run as Account does not have permissions to read Azure Active Directory by default. If you want to add permissions to read or manage Azure Active directory, you'll need to grant that permission on the service principal under **API permissions**. To learn more, see [Add permissions to access web APIs](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis).

## <a name="permissions"></a>Permissions to configure Run As accounts

To create or update a Run As account, you must have specific privileges and permissions. An Application administrator in Azure Active Directory and an Owner in a subscription can complete all the tasks. In a situation where you have separation of duties, the following table shows a listing of the tasks, the equivalent cmdlet and permissions needed:

|Task|Cmdlet  |Minimum Permissions  |Where you set the permissions|
|---|---------|---------|---|
|Create Azure AD Application|[New-AzureRmADApplication](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermadapplication)     | Application Developer Role<sup>1</sup>        |[Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#required-permissions)</br>Home > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations |

<sup>1</sup> Non-admin users in your Azure AD tenant can [register AD applications](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#required-permissions) if the Azure AD tenant's **Users can register applications** option in **User settings** page is set to **Yes**. If the app registrations setting is set to **No**, the user performing this action must be what is defined in the preceding table.

If you aren't a member of the subscription’s Active Directory instance before you're added to the **Global Administrator** role of the subscription, you're added as a guest. In this situation, you receive a `You do not have permissions to create…` warning on the **Add Automation Account** page. Users who were added to the **Global Administrator** role first can be removed from the subscription's Active Directory instance and re-added to make them a full User in Active Directory. To verify this situation, from the **Azure Active Directory** pane in the Azure portal, select **Users and groups**, select **All users** and, after you select the specific user, select **Profile**. The value of the **User type** attribute under the users profile should not equal **Guest**.

## <a name="permissions-classic"></a>Permissions to configure Classic Run As accounts

To configure or renew Classic Run As accounts, you must have the **Co-administrator** role at the subscription level. To learn more about Classic permissions, see [Azure classic subscription administrators](../role-based-access-control/classic-administrators.md#add-a-co-administrator).

## Create a Run As account in the Portal

In this section, perform the following steps to update your Azure Automation account in the Azure portal. You create the Run As and Classic Run As accounts individually. If you don't need to manage classic resources, you can just create the Azure Run As account.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal with an account that is a member of the Subscription Admins role and co-administrator of the subscription.
2. In Azure portal, search for and select **Automation Accounts**.
3. On the **Automation Accounts** page, select your Automation account from the list of Automation accounts.
4. In the left-hand pane, select **Run As Accounts** under the section **Account Settings**.
5. Depending on which account you require, select either **Azure Run As Account** or **Azure Classic Run As Account**. After selecting either the **Add Azure Run As** or **Add Azure Classic Run As Account** pane appears and after reviewing the overview information, click **Create** to proceed with Run As account creation.
6. While Azure creates the Run As account, you can track the progress under **Notifications** from the menu. A banner is also displayed stating the account is being created. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

## Create Run As account using PowerShell

## Prerequisites

The following list provides the requirements to create a Run As account in PowerShell:

* Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with Azure Resource Manager modules 3.4.1 and later. The PowerShell script does not support earlier versions of Windows.
* Azure PowerShell 1.0 and later. For information about the PowerShell 1.0 release, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs).
* An Automation account, which is referenced as the value for the *–AutomationAccountName* and *-ApplicationDisplayName* parameters.
* Permissions equivalent to what is listed in [Required permissions to configure Run As accounts](#permissions)

To get the values for *SubscriptionID*, *ResourceGroup*, and *AutomationAccountName*, which are required parameters for the script, complete the following steps:

1. In Azure portal, search for and select **Automation Accounts**.
1. On the Automation account page, select your Automation account, and then under **Account Settings** select **Properties**.
1. Note the **Subscription ID**, **Name**, and **Resource Group** values on the **Properties** page.

   ![The Automation account "Properties" page](media/manage-runas-account/automation-account-properties.png)

This PowerShell script includes support for the following configurations:

* Create a Run As account by using a self-signed certificate.
* Create a Run As account and a Classic Run As account by using a self-signed certificate.
* Create a Run As account and a Classic Run As account by using a certificate issued by your enterprise certification authority (CA).
* Create a Run As account and a Classic Run As account by using a self-signed certificate in the Azure Government cloud.

>[!NOTE]
> If you select either option for creating a Classic Run As account, after the script is executed, upload the public certificate (.cer file name extension) to the management store for the subscription that the Automation account was created in.

1. Save the following script on your computer. In this example, save it with the filename *New-RunAsAccount.ps1*.

   The script uses multiple Azure Resource Manager cmdlets to create resources. The preceding [permissions](#permissions) table shows the cmdlets and their permissions needed.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Add-AzureRmAccount** is now an alias for **Connect-AzureRMAccount**. When searching your library items, if you do not see **Connect-AzureRMAccount**, you can use **Add-AzureRmAccount**, or you can [update your modules](automation-update-azure-modules.md) in your Automation Account.

1. On your computer, start **Windows PowerShell** from the **Start** screen with elevated user rights.
1. From the elevated command-line shell, go to the folder that contains the script you created in step 1.
1. Execute the script by using the parameter values for the configuration you require.

    **Create a Run As account by using a self-signed certificate**

    ```powershell
    .\New-RunAsAccount.ps1 -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -AutomationAccountName <NameofAutomationAccount> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId> -ApplicationDisplayName <DisplayNameofAADApplication> -SelfSignedCertPlainPassword <StrongPassword> -CreateClassicRunAsAccount $false
    ```

    **Create a Run As account and a Classic Run As account by using a self-signed certificate**

    ```powershell
    .\New-RunAsAccount.ps1 -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -AutomationAccountName <NameofAutomationAccount> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId> -ApplicationDisplayName <DisplayNameofAADApplication> -SelfSignedCertPlainPassword <StrongPassword> -CreateClassicRunAsAccount $true
    ```

    **Create a Run As account and a Classic Run As account by using an enterprise certificate**

    ```powershell
    .\New-RunAsAccount.ps1 -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -AutomationAccountName <NameofAutomationAccount> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId> -ApplicationDisplayName <DisplayNameofAADApplication>  -SelfSignedCertPlainPassword <StrongPassword> -CreateClassicRunAsAccount $true -EnterpriseCertPathForRunAsAccount <EnterpriseCertPfxPathForRunAsAccount> -EnterpriseCertPlainPasswordForRunAsAccount <StrongPassword> -EnterpriseCertPathForClassicRunAsAccount <EnterpriseCertPfxPathForClassicRunAsAccount> -EnterpriseCertPlainPasswordForClassicRunAsAccount <StrongPassword>
    ```

    **Create a Run As account and a Classic Run As account by using a self-signed certificate in the Azure Government cloud**

    ```powershell
    .\New-RunAsAccount.ps1 -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -AutomationAccountName <NameofAutomationAccount> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId> -ApplicationDisplayName <DisplayNameofAADApplication> -SelfSignedCertPlainPassword <StrongPassword> -CreateClassicRunAsAccount $true  -EnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > After the script has executed, you will be prompted to authenticate with Azure. Sign in with an account that is a member of the subscription administrators role and co-administrator of the subscription.

After the script has executed successfully, note the following:

* If you created a Classic Run As account with a self-signed public certificate (.cer file), the script creates and saves it to the temporary files folder on your computer under the user profile *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp*, which you used to execute the PowerShell session.

* If you created a Classic Run As account with an enterprise public certificate (.cer file), use this certificate. Follow the instructions for [uploading a management API certificate to the Azure portal](../azure-api-management-certs.md).

## Delete a Run As or Classic Run As account

This section describes how to delete and re-create a Run As or Classic Run As account. When you perform this action, the Automation account is retained. After you delete a Run As or Classic Run As account, you can re-create it in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, open the Automation account.

2. On the **Automation account** page, select **Run As Accounts**.

3. On the **Run As Accounts** properties page, select either the Run As account or Classic Run As account that you want to delete. Then, on the **Properties** pane for the selected account, click **Delete**.

   ![Delete Run As account](media/manage-runas-account/automation-account-delete-runas.png)

1. While the account is being deleted, you can track the progress under **Notifications** from the menu.

1. After the account has been deleted, you can re-create it on the **Run As Accounts** properties page by selecting the create option **Azure Run As Account**.

   ![Re-create the Automation Run As account](media/manage-runas-account/automation-account-create-runas.png)

## <a name="cert-renewal"></a>Self-signed certificate renewal

At some point before your Run As account expires, you need to renew the certificate. If you believe that the Run As account has been compromised, you can delete and re-create it. This section discusses how to perform these operations.

The self-signed certificate that you created for the Run As account expires one year from the date of creation. You can renew it at any time before it expires. When you renew it, the current valid certificate is retained to ensure that any runbooks that are queued up or actively running, and that authenticate with the Run As account, aren't negatively affected. The certificate remains valid until its expiration date.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have configured your Automation Run As account to use a certificate issued by your enterprise certificate authority and you use this option, the enterprise certificate is replaced by a self-signed certificate.

To renew the certificate, do the following:

1. In the Azure portal, open the Automation account.

1. Select **Run As Accounts** under **Account Settings**.

    ![Automation account properties pane](media/manage-runas-account/automation-account-properties-pane.png)

1. On the **Run As Accounts** properties page, select either the Run As account or the Classic Run As account that you want to renew the certificate for.

1. On the **Properties** pane for the selected account, click **Renew certificate**.

    ![Renew certificate for Run As account](media/manage-runas-account/automation-account-renew-runas-certificate.png)

1. While the certificate is being renewed, you can track the progress under **Notifications** from the menu.

## <a name="auto-cert-renewal"></a>Set up automatic certificate renewal with an automation runbook

To renew certificates automatically, you can use an automation runbook. The following script on [GitHub](https://github.com/ikanni/PowerShellScripts/blob/master/AzureAutomation/RunAsAccount/GrantPermissionToRunAsAccountAADApplication-ToRenewCertificateItself-CreateSchedule.ps1) enables this functionality in your
automation account.

- The `GrantPermissionToRunAsAccountAADApplication-ToRenewCertificateItself-CreateSchedule.ps1` script creates a weekly schedule to renew Run As Account certificates.
- The script adds an **Update-AutomationRunAsCredential** runbook to your automation account.
  - You can also view the runbook code on GitHub, in the script: [Update-AutomationRunAsCredential.ps1](https://github.com/azureautomation/runbooks/blob/master/Utility/ARM/Update-AutomationRunAsCredential.ps1).
  - You can also use the PowerShell code in the file to renew certificates manually as needed.

To test the renewal process immediately, use the following steps:

1. Edit the **Update-AutomationRunAsCredential** runbook and place a comment character (`#`) on line 122, in front of the `Exit(1)` command, as shown below.

   ```powershell
   #Exit(1)
   ```

2. Publish the runbook.
3. Start the runbook.
4. Verify successful renewal with the following code:

   ```powershell
   (Get-AzAutomationCertificate -AutomationAccountName TestAA
                                -Name AzureRunAsCertificate
                                -ResourceGroupName TestAutomation).ExpiryTime.DateTime
   ```

   ```Output
   Thursday, November 7, 2019 7:00:00 PM
   ```

5. After the test, edit the runbook, and remove the comment character you added in **Step 1**.
6. **Publish** the runbook.

To control targeting of automation against resources in Azure, you can run the [Update-AutomationRunAsAccountRoleAssignments.ps1](https://aka.ms/AA5hug8) script in the PowerShell gallery to change your existing Run As Account service principal to create and use a custom role definition. This role will have permissions to all resources except [Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After running the `Update-AutomationRunAsAccountRoleAssignments.ps1` script, runbooks that access KeyVault through the use of RunAs accounts will no longer work. You should review runbooks in your account for calls to Azure KeyVault.
>
> To enable access to KeyVault from Azure Automation runbooks you would need to [add the RunAs account to KeyVault’s permissions](#add-permissions-to-key-vault).

If you need to restrict what the RunAs service principal can do further, you can add other resource types to the `NotActions` of the custom role definition. The following example restricts access to `Microsoft.Compute`. If you add this to the **NotActions** of the role definition, this role will not be able to access any Compute resource. To learn more about role definitions, see [Understand role definitions for Azure resources](../role-based-access-control/role-definitions.md).

```powershell
$roleDefinition = Get-AzureRmRoleDefinition -Name 'Automation RunAs Contributor'
$roleDefinition.NotActions.Add("Microsoft.Compute/*")
$roleDefinition | Set-AzureRMRoleDefinition
```

To determine if the Service Principal used by your Run As Account is in the **Contributor** or a custom role definition go to your Automation Account and under **Account Settings**, select **Run as accounts** > **Azure Run As Account**. Under **Role** you'll find the role definition that is being used.

[![](media/manage-runas-account/verify-role.png "Verify the Run As Account role")](media/manage-runas-account/verify-role-expanded.png#lightbox)

To determine the role definition used by the Automation Run As accounts for multiple subscriptions or Automation Accounts, you can use the [Check-AutomationRunAsAccountRoleAssignments.ps1](https://aka.ms/AA5hug5) script in the PowerShell Gallery.

### Add permissions to Key Vault

If you want to allow Azure Automation to manage Key Vault and your Run As Account service principal is using a custom role definition you'll need to take additional steps to allow this behavior:

* Grant permissions to the Key Vault
* Set the Access Policy

You can use the [Extend-AutomationRunAsAccountRoleAssignmentToKeyVault.ps1](https://aka.ms/AA5hugb) script in the PowerShell Gallery to give your Run As Account permissions to KeyVault, or visit [Grant applications access to a key vault](../key-vault/key-vault-group-permissions-for-apps.md) for more details on settings permissions on KeyVault.

## Misconfiguration

Some configuration items necessary for the Run As or Classic Run As account to function properly might have been deleted or created improperly during initial setup. The items include:

* Certificate asset
* Connection asset
* Run As account has been removed from the contributor role
* Service principal or application in Azure AD

In the preceding and other instances of misconfiguration, the Automation account detects the changes and displays a status of *Incomplete* on the **Run As Accounts** properties pane for the account.

![Incomplete Run As account configuration status](media/manage-runas-account/automation-account-runas-incomplete-config.png)

When you select the Run As account, the account **Properties** pane displays the following error message:

```text
The Run As account is incomplete. Either one of these was deleted or not created - Azure Active Directory Application, Service Principal, Role, Automation Certificate asset, Automation Connect asset - or the Thumbprint is not identical between Certificate and Connection. Please delete and then re-create the Run As Account.
```

You can quickly resolve these Run As account issues by deleting and re-creating the account.
