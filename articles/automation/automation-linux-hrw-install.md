# Deploy a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker

You can use the Hybrid Runbook Worker feature of Azure Automation to run runbooks directly on the computer that's hosting the role and against resources in the environment to manage those local resources. The Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker executes runbooks as a special user that can be elevated for running commands that need elevation. Runbooks are stored and managed in Azure Automation and then delivered to one or more designated computers.

This article describes how to install the Hybrid Runbook Worker on a Linux machine, how to remove the worker, and how to remove a Hybrid Runbook Worker group.

## Supported Linux operating systems

The Hybrid Runbook Worker feature supports the following distributions:

* Amazon Linux 2012.09 to 2015.09 (x86/x64)
* CentOS Linux 5, 6, and 7 (x86/x64)
* Oracle Linux 5, 6, and 7 (x86/x64)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5, 6, and 7 (x86/x64)
* Debian GNU/Linux 6, 7, and 8 (x86/x64)
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, and 18.04 (x86/x64)
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 and 12 (x86/x64)

## Supported runbook types

Linux Hybrid Runbook Workers don't support the full set of runbook types in Azure Automation.

The following runbook types work on a Linux Hybrid Worker:

* Python 2
* PowerShell

  > [!NOTE]
  > PowerShell runbooks require PowerShell Core to be installed on the Linux machine. See [Installing PowerShell Core on Linux](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux) to learn how to install it.

The following runbook types don't work on a Linux Hybrid Worker:

* PowerShell Workflow
* Graphical
* Graphical PowerShell Workflow

## Deployment requirements

The minimum requirements for a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker are:

* Two cores
* 4 GB of RAM
* Port 443 (outbound)

### Package requirements

| **Required package** | **Description** | **Minimum version**|
|--------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------|
|Glibc |GNU C Library| 2.5-12 |
|Openssl| OpenSSL Libraries | 1.0 (TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are supported)|
|Curl | cURL web client | 7.15.5|
|Python-ctypes | Python 2.x is required |
|PAM | Pluggable Authentication Modules|
| **Optional package** | **Description** | **Minimum version**|
| PowerShell Core | To run PowerShell runbooks, PowerShell needs to be installed, see [Installing PowerShell Core on Linux](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux) to learn how to install it.  | 6.0.0 |

## Install a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker

To install and configure a Hybrid Runbook Worker on your Linux computer, follow a straightforward manual process. It requires enabling the Automation Hybrid Worker solution in your Azure Log Analytics workspace and then running a set of commands to register the computer as a worker and add it to a group.

Before you proceed, note the Log Analytics workspace that your Automation account is linked to. Also note the primary key for your Automation account. You can find both from the Azure portal by selecting your Automation account, selecting **Workspace** for the workspace ID, and selecting **Keys** for the primary key. For information on ports and addresses that you need for the Hybrid Runbook Worker, see [Configuring your network](automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

>[!NOTE]
> The [nxautomation account](automation-runbook-execution.md#log-analytics-agent-for-linux) with the corresponding sudo permissions must be present during installation of the Linux Hybrid Worker. If you try to install the worker and the account is not present or doesnâ€™t have the appropriate permissions, the installation fails.

1. Enable the Automation Hybrid Worker solution in Azure by using one of the following methods:

   * Add the Automation Hybrid Worker solution to your subscription by using the procedure at [Add Azure Monitor log solutions to your workspace](../log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions.md).
   * Run the following cmdlet:

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
         Set-AzureRmOperationalInsightsIntelligencePack -ResourceGroupName  <ResourceGroupName> -WorkspaceName <WorkspaceName> -IntelligencePackName  "AzureAutomation" -Enabled $true
        ```

1. Install the Log Analytics agent for Linux by running the following command. Replace \<WorkspaceID\> and \<WorkspaceKey\> with the appropriate values from your workspace.

   [!INCLUDE [log-analytics-agent-note](../../includes/log-analytics-agent-note.md)]

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <WorkspaceID> -s <WorkspaceKey>
   ```

1. Run the following command, changing the values for the parameters *-w*, *-k*, *-g*, and *-e*. For the *-g* parameter, replace the value with the name of the Hybrid Runbook Worker group that the new Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker should join. If the name doesn't exist in your Automation account, a new Hybrid Runbook Worker group is made with that name.

   ```bash
   sudo python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/scripts/onboarding.py --register -w <LogAnalyticsworkspaceId> -k <AutomationSharedKey> -g <hybridgroupname> -e <automationendpoint>
   ```

1. After the command is completed, the Hybrid Worker Groups page in the Azure portal shows the new group and the number of members. If this is an existing group, the number of members is incremented. You can select the group from the list on the Hybrid Worker Groups page and select the **Hybrid Workers** tile. On the Hybrid Workers page, you see each member of the group listed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the Azure Monitor virtual machine extension for Linux for an Azure VM we recommend setting `autoUpgradeMinorVersion` to false as auto-upgrading versions can cause issues the Hybrid Runbook Worker. To learn how to upgrade the extension manually, see [Azure CLI deployment](../virtual-machines/extensions/oms-linux.md#azure-cli-deployment).

## Turn off signature validation

By default, Linux Hybrid Runbook Workers require signature validation. If you run an unsigned runbook against a worker, you see a `Signature validation failed` error. To turn off signature validation, run the following command. Replace the second parameter with your Log Analytics workspace ID.

 ```bash
 sudo python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/scripts/require_runbook_signature.py --false <LogAnalyticsworkspaceId>
 ```

## <a name="remove-linux-hybrid-runbook-worker"></a>Remove the Hybrid Runbook Worker from an on-premises Linux computer

You can use the command `ls /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent` on the Hybrid Runbook Worker to get the workspace ID. A folder is created that is named with the workspace ID.

```bash
sudo python onboarding.py --deregister --endpoint="<URL>" --key="<PrimaryAccessKey>" --groupname="Example" --workspaceid="<workspaceId>"
```

> [!NOTE]
> This code doesn't remove the Log Analytics agent for Linux from the computer. It only removes the functionality and configuration of the Hybrid Runbook Worker role.

## Remove a Hybrid Worker group

To remove a Hybrid Runbook Worker group of Linux computers, you use the same steps as for a Windows hybrid worker group. See [Remove a Hybrid Worker group](automation-windows-hrw-install.md#remove-a-hybrid-worker-group).
