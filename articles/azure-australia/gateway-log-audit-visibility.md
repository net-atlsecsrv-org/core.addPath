# Gateway logging, auditing, and visibility in Azure Australia

Detecting and responding to cyber security threats relies on generating, collecting and analyzing data related to the operation of a system.

Microsoft has built-in tools in Azure to help you implement logging, auditing, and visibility to manage the security of your systems deployed in Azure. There is also a reference architecture that aligns with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Consumer Guidance and the intent of the Information Security Manual (ISM).

Gateways act as information flow control mechanisms at the network layer and may also control information at the higher layers of the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model. Gateways are necessary to control data flows between security domains and prevent unauthorised access from external networks. Given the criticality of gateways in controlling the flow of information between security domains, any failure, particularly at higher classifications, may have serious consequences. As such, robust mechanisms for alerting personnel to situations that may cause cyber security incidents are especially important for gateways.

Implementing logging and alerting capabilities for gateways can assist in detecting cyber security incidents, attempted intrusions, and unusual usage patterns. In addition, storing event logs on a separate secure log server increases the difficulty for an adversary to delete logging information in order to destroy evidence of a targeted cyber intrusion.

## Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) requirements

The overall security requirements for Commonwealth systems are defined in the ACSC Information Security Manual (ISM). To assist Commonwealth entities to meet these requirements within Azure, the *ACSC CONSUMER GUIDE – Microsoft Azure at PROTECTED* and *ACSC CERTIFICATION REPORT – Microsoft Azure* publications detail the following specific requirements related to Logging, Auditing, and Visibility:

1. To mitigate the risks arising from using shared underlying cloud resources, Commonwealth entities must opt in to Microsoft Azure provided capabilities including Azure Security Centre, Azure Monitor, Azure Policy, and Azure Advisor to assist entities to perform real-time monitoring of their Azure workloads

2. The ACSC also recommends that Commonwealth entities forward all mandated security logs to the ACSC for whole of Australian Government monitoring

3. To assist in risk mitigation, Commonwealth entities should configure within their Azure subscriptions:

    * Enable Azure Security Centre
    * Upgrade to the Standard Tier
    * Enable Automatic Provisioning of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent to supported Azure VMs
    * Regularly review, prioritise, and mitigate the security recommendations and alerts on the Security Centre dashboard

4. Government entities must enable log and event forwarding from their Azure subscription to the ACSC to provide the ACSC with visibility of non-compliance with this guidance. Azure Event Hubs provides the capability to perform external log streaming to the ACSC or on-premises systems owned by the Commonwealth entity

5. Commonwealth entities should align the logging they enable within Azure to the requirements specified in the ISM

6. Microsoft keeps logs within Azure for 90 days. Customer entities must implement a log archival regime to ensure logs can be kept for the seven years required under the NAA AFDA

7. Commonwealth entities that have on-premises or Azure-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities can also forward logs to those systems

8. Commonwealth entities should implement Network Watcher flow logs for Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Virtual Machines. These logs should be stored in a dedicated storage account containing only security logs, and access to the storage account should be secured with Role-Based Access Controls

9. Commonwealth entities must implement ACSC Consumer Guidance to ensure Azure workloads meet the intent of the ISM for logging and monitoring. Commonwealth entities must also opt in to Azure capabilities that assist the ACSC to receive real-time monitoring, alerting, and logs associated with Australian Government usage of Azure

## Architecture

To confidently understand the network traffic entering and leaving your Azure environment, the necessary logging must be enabled on the right set of components. Doing this ensures complete visibility of the environment and provides the necessary data to do analysis.

![Azure Monitoring Architecture](media/visibility.png)

## Components

The architecture shown above is made up of discrete components that provide the function of either Log Sources, Log Collection, Log Retention, Log Analysis or Incident Response. This architecture includes individual components that are typically involved in internet accessible Azure deployments.

|Functions|Components|
|---|---|
|Log Sources|<ul><li>Application Gateway</li><li>VPN Gateway</li><li>Azure Firewall</li><li>Network Virtual Appliances</li><li>Azure Load Balancer</li><li>Virtual Machines</li><li>Domain Naming System (DNS) Servers</li><li>Syslog and/or Log Collection Servers</li><li>NSGs</li><li>Azure Activity Log</li><li>Azure Diagnostic Log</li><li>Azure Policy</li></ul>|
|Log Collection|<ul><li>Event Hubs</li><li>Network Watcher</li><li>Log Analytics</li></ul>|
|Log Retention|<ul><li>Azure Storage</li></ul>|
|Log Analysis|<ul><li>Azure Security Center (ASC)</li><li>Azure Advisor</li><li>Log Analytics Solutions<ul><li>Traffic Analytics</li><li>DNS Analytics (Preview)</li><li>Activity Log Analytics</li></ul></li><li>SIEM</li><li>ACSC</li></ul>|
|Incident Response|<ul><li>Azure Alerts</li><li>Azure Automation</li></ul>|
|

The architecture works by first generating logs from the necessary sources and then collecting them into centralised repositories. Once you've collected the logs, they can be:

* used by Azure analysis services to get insight,
* get forwarded to external systems, or
* get archived to storage for long-term retention.

To respond to key events or incidents identified by analysis tools, alerts can be configured, and automation developed to take necessary actions for proactive management and response.

## General guidance

When implementing the components listed in this article, the following general guidance applies:

* Validate the region availability of services, ensuring that all data remains within authorised locations and deploy to AU Central or AU Central 2 as the first preference for PROTECTED workloads

* Refer to the *Azure - ACSC Certification Report – Protected 2018* publication for the certification status of individual services and perform self-assessments on any relevant components not included in the report as per the *ACSC CONSUMER GUIDE – Microsoft Azure at PROTECTED*

* For components not referenced in this article, Commonwealth entities should follow the principles included about generating, capturing, analysing, and keeping logs

* Identify and prioritise the logging, auditing, and visibility on high value systems as well as all network ingress and egress points to systems hosted in Azure

* Consolidate logs and minimise the number of instances of logging tools such as storage accounts, Log Analytics workspaces and Event Hubs

* Restrict administrative privileges through Role-Based Access Controls

* Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accounts administering or configuring resources in Azure

* When centralising log collection across multiple subscriptions, ensure that administrators have the necessary privileges in each subscription

* Ensure network connectivity and any necessary proxy configuration for Virtual Machines, including Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs), Log Collection Servers and DNS Servers, to connect to necessary Azure services such as the Log Analytics workspaces, Event Hubs, and Storage

* Configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to utilise TLS version 1.2

* Use Azure Policy to monitor and enforce compliance with requirements

* Enforce encryption on all data repositories such as Storage and Databases

* Use Locally redundant storage (LRS) and snapshots for availability of Storage Accounts and associated data

* Consider Geo-redundant storage (GRS) or off-site storage to align with Disaster Recovery strategies

## Component guidance

This section provides information on the purpose of each component and its role in the overall logging, auditing, and visibility architecture. Additional links are provided to access useful resources such as reference documentation, guides, and tutorials.

## Log sources

Before any analysis, alerting or reporting can be completed, the necessary logs must be generated. Azure logs are categorized into control/management logs, data plane logs, and processed events.

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Control/management logs|Provide information about Azure Resource Manager operations|
|Data plane logs|Provide information about events raised as part of Azure resource usage, such as logs in a Virtual Machine and the diagnostics logs available through Azure Monitor|
|Processed events|Provide information about analysed events/alerts that have been processed by Azure, such as where Azure Security Center has processed and analysed subscriptions to provide security alerts|
|

### Application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway is one of the possible entry points into an Azure environment so you need to capture information related to incoming connections communicating with web applications. Application Gateway can provide crucial information relating to web application usage as well as assisting in detecting cyber security incidents. Application Gateway sends metadata to the Activity Log and Diagnostic Logs in Azure Monitor where it can be utilised in Log Analytics or distributed to an Event Hub or Storage Account.

|

### Network Virtual Appliances (NVA)

NVAs can be used to complement the security capabilities available natively in Azure. The logs generated on NVAs can be valuable resources in detecting cyber security incidents and are a key part of an overall logging, auditing, and visibility strategy. To capture logs from NVAs, utilise the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). For NVAs that don't support the installation of the MMA, consider using a Syslog or other log collection server to relay logs.

|

### Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines are end points that send and receive network communications, process data and provide services. As Virtual Machines can host data or crucial system services, ensuring that they're operating correctly and detecting cyber security incidents can be critical. Virtual Machines collect various event and audit logs that can track the operation of the system and the actions done on that system. Logs collected on Virtual Machines can be forwarded to a Log Analytics Workspace using the Microsoft Monitoring Agent where they can be analysed by Azure Security Center and applicable Log Analytics solutions. Virtual Machines can also integrate directly with Azure Event Hubs or to a SIEM, either directly or through a Log Collection Server.

|

### Syslog and log collection servers

To receive logs from Network Virtual Appliances, or custom security logs from other systems for use within a SIEM, dedicated servers can be deployed within Azure VNets. Syslog logs can be collected on a Syslog server and relayed to Log Analytics for analysis. A Log Collection Server is a generic term for any log aggregation and distribution capability used by centralised monitoring systems or SIEMs. These can be used to simplify network architecture and security and to filter and aggregate logs before being distributed to the centralised capability.

### Network Security Groups (NSGs)

NSGs control traffic into and out of virtual networks in Azure. NSGs apply rules for the traffic flows that are permitted or denied, which includes traffic within Azure and between Azure and external networks such as on-premises or the Internet. NSGs are applied to subnets within a virtual network or to individual network interfaces. To capture information on the traffic entering and leaving systems in Azure, NSG logs can be enabled through the Network Watcher NSG Flow Logs feature. These logs are used to form a baseline for the standard operation of a system and are the data source for Traffic Analytics, which provides detailed insights into the traffic patterns of systems hosted in Azure.

## Log retention

For Australian Government organisations, the logs captured within Azure must be retained in accordance with the National Archives of Australia [Administrative Functions Disposal Authority (AFDA)](https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/records-authorities/types-records-authorities/afda-express-version-2-functions), which specifies retaining logs up to seven years.

|Log Location|Retention Period|
|---|---|
|Azure Activity Log|Up to 90 days|
|Log Analytics workspace|Up to two years|
|Event Hub|Up to seven days|
|

It is your responsibility to ensure that logs are archived appropriately to adhere to AFDA and other legislative requirements.

### Azure Storage

Azure Storage is the repository for logs for long-term retention in Azure. Azure Storage can be used to archive logs from Azure including Event Hubs, Azure Activity Log, and Azure Diagnostic Logs. The period of retention of data in Storage can be set to zero, or can be specified as a number of days.
