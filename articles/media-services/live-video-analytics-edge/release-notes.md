## September 22, 2020

This release tag for the September 2020 refresh of the module is:

```
mcr.microsoft.com/media/live-video-analytics:1.0.4
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the quickstarts and tutorials, the deployment manifests use a tag of 1 (live-video-analytics:1). So simply redeploying such manifests should update the module on your edge > devices.

### Module updates

* A new graph extension node, [MediaGraphCognitiveServicesVisionExtension](spatial-analysis-tutorial.md) is available to integrate with the [Spatial Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/intro-to-spatial-analysis-public-preview)(preview) module from Cognitive Services.
* Added support for Linux ARM64 devices - use [manual steps](deploy-iot-edge-device.md) for deploying to such devices.

### Documentation updates

* [Instructions](deploy-azure-stack-edge-how-to.md) are available for using Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge on Azure Stack Edge devices.
* New tutorial on developing scenario specific computer vision models using [Custom Vision service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) and using it to [analyze live video](custom-vision-tutorial.md) in real time.

## August 19, 2020

This release tag for the August 2020 refresh of the module is:

```
mcr.microsoft.com/media/live-video-analytics:1.0.3
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the quickstarts and tutorials, the deployment manifests use a tag of 1 (live-video-analytics:1). So simply redeploying such manifests should update the module on your edge > devices.

### Module updates

* You can now get high data content transfer performance between Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge and your custom extension using gRPC framework. See [this](analyze-live-video-use-your-grpc-model-quickstart.md) to get started.
* Broader regional deployment of Live Video Analytics and only the cloud service has been updated.  
* Live Video Analytics is now available in 25 additional regions across the globe. Here is the [list](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=media-services) of all available regions.  
* The [set up](https://aka.ms/lva-edge/setup-resources-for-samples) for quick starts has been updated as well with new regions support.
    * There is no call to action for anyone who has already setup resources

### Bug fixes 

* Remove the use of a deprecated azure extension in the set up script

## July 13, 2020

This release tag for the July 2020 refresh of the module is:

```
mcr.microsoft.com/media/live-video-analytics:1.0.2
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the quickstarts and tutorials, the deployment manifests use a tag of 1 (live-video-analytics:1). So simply redeploying such manifests should update the module on your edge > devices.

### Module updates

* You can now create graph topologies that have an asset sink node as well as a file sink node downstream of a signal gate processor node. See [this](https://github.com/Azure/live-video-analytics/tree/master/MediaGraph/topologies/evr-motion-assets-files) for an example.

### Bug fixes

* Improvements to validation of desired properties
