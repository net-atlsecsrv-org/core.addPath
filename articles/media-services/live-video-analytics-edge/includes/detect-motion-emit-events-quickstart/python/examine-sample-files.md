1. In Visual Studio Code, go to *src/edge*. You'll see the *.env* file and a few deployment template files.

    The deployment template refers to the deployment manifest for the edge device, where variables are used for some properties. The *.env* file contains the values for those variables.
1. Go to the *src/cloud-to-device-console-app* folder. Here you see the *appsettings.json* file and a few other files:

    * ***operations.json*** - A list of the operations that you want the program to run.
    * **main.py** - The sample program code. This code:
    
      * Loads the app settings.
      * Invokes direct methods that are exposed by the Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge module. You can use the module to analyze live video streams by invoking its [direct methods](../../../direct-methods.md).
      * Pauses so you can examine the program's output in the **TERMINAL** window and examine the events generated by the module in the **OUTPUT** window.
      * Invokes direct methods to clean up resources.
