The deployment manifest defines what modules are deployed to an edge device. It also defines configuration settings for those modules. 

Follow these steps to generate the manifest from the template file and then deploy it to the edge device.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Next to the **AZURE IOT HUB** pane, select the **More actions** icon to set the IoT Hub connection string. You can copy the string from the *src/cloud-to-device-console-app/appsettings.json* file.

1. Right-click **src/edge/deployment.template.json** and select **Generate IoT Edge Deployment Manifest**.

    ![Generate the IoT Edge deployment manifest](../../../media/quickstarts/generate-iot-edge-deployment-manifest.png)

    This action should create a manifest file named *deployment.amd64.json* in the *src/edge/config* folder.
1. Right-click **src/edge/config/deployment.amd64.json**, select **Create Deployment for Single Device**, and then select the name of your edge device.

1. When you're prompted to select an IoT Hub device, choose **lva-sample-device** from the drop-down menu.
1. After about 30 seconds, in the lower-left corner of the window, refresh Azure IoT Hub. The edge device now shows the following deployed modules:

    * Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge (module name `lvaEdge`)
    * Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) simulator (module name `rtspsim`)

The RTSP simulator module simulates a live video stream by using a video file that was copied to your edge device when you ran the [Live Video Analytics resources setup script](https://github.com/Azure/live-video-analytics/tree/master/edge/setup). 

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using your own edge device instead of the one provisioned by our setup script, go to your edge device and run the following commands with **admin rights**, to pull and store the sample video file used for this quickstart:  

```
mkdir /home/lvaadmin/samples      
mkdir /home/lvaadmin/samples/input    
curl https://lvamedia.blob.core.windows.net/public/camera-300s.mkv > /home/lvaadmin/samples/input/camera-300s.mkv  
chown -R lvaadmin /home/lvaadmin/samples/  
```
At this stage, the modules are deployed but no media graphs are active.
