Make sure you've completed the steps to [Prepare to monitor events](../../../detect-motion-emit-events-quickstart.md#prepare-to-monitor-events).

![Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint](../../../media/quickstarts/start-monitoring-iothub-events.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You might be asked to provide Built-in endpoint information for the IoT Hub. To get that information, in Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Hub and look for **Built-in endpoints** option in the left navigation pane. Click there and look for the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** under **Event Hub compatible endpoint** section. Copy and use the text in the box. The endpoint will look something like this:  
    ```
    Endpoint=sb://iothub-ns-xxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=XXX;EntityPath=<IoT Hub name>
    ```
