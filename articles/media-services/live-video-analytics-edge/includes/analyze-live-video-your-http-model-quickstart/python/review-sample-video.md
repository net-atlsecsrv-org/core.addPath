When you set up the Azure resources, a short video of highway traffic is copied to the Linux VM in Azure that you're using as the IoT Edge device. This quickstart uses the video file to simulate a live stream.

Open an application such as [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). Select Ctrl+N and then paste a link to [the video](https://lvamedia.blob.core.windows.net/public/camera-300s.mkv) to start playback. You see the footage of many vehicles moving in highway traffic.

In this quickstart, you'll use Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge to detect objects such as vehicles and persons. You'll publish associated inference events to IoT Edge Hub.
