When you run the media graph, the results from the HTTP extension processor node pass through the IoT Hub sink node to the IoT hub. The messages you see in the **OUTPUT** window contain a `body` section and an `applicationProperties` section. For more information, see [Create and read IoT Hub messages](../../../../../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-construct.md).

In the following messages, the Live Video Analytics module defines the application properties and the content of the body. 

### MediaSessionEstablished event

When a media graph is instantiated, the RTSP source node attempts to connect to the RTSP server that runs on the rtspsim-live555 container. If the connection succeeds, then the following event is printed. The event type is `Microsoft.Media.MediaGraph.Diagnostics.MediaSessionEstablished`.

In this message, notice these details:

* The message is a diagnostics event. `MediaSessionEstablished` indicates that the RTSP source node (the subject) connected with the RTSP simulator and has begun to receive a (simulated) live feed.
* In `applicationProperties`, `subject` indicates that the message was generated from the RTSP source node in the media graph.
* In `applicationProperties`, `eventType` indicates that this event is a diagnostics event.
* The `eventTime` indicates the time when the event occurred.
* The `body` contains data about the diagnostics event. In this case, the data comprises the [Session Description Protocol (SDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol) details.

### Inference event

The HTTP extension processor node receives inference results from the yolov3 module. It then emits the results through the IoT Hub sink node as inference events. 

In these events, the type is set to `entity` to indicate it's an entity, such as a car or truck. The `eventTime` value is the UTC time when the object was detected. 

In the following example, two cars were detected in the same video frame, with varying levels of confidence.

In the messages, notice the following details:

* In `applicationProperties`, `subject` references the node in the graph topology from which the message was generated. 
* In `applicationProperties`, `eventType` indicates that this event is an analytics event.
* The `eventTime` value is the time when the event occurred.
* The `body` section contains data about the analytics event. In this case, the event is an inference event, so the body contains `inferences` data.
* The `inferences` section indicates that the `type` is `entity`. This section includes additional data about the entity.
