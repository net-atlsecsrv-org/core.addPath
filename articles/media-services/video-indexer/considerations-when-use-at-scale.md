# Things to consider when using Video Indexer at scale

When using Azure Media Services Video indexer to index videos and your archive of videos is growing, consider scaling. 

This article answers questions like:

* Are there any technological constraints I need to take into account?
* Is there a smart and efficient way of doing it?
* Can I prevent spending excess money in the process?

The article provides six best practices of how to use Video Indexer at scale.

## When uploading videos consider using a URL over byte array

Video Indexer does give you the choice to upload videos from URL or directly by sending the file as a byte array, the latter comes with some constraints. For more information, see [uploading considerations and limitations)](upload-index-videos.md#uploading-considerations-and-limitations)

First, it has file size limitations. The size of the byte array file is limited to 2 GB compared to the 30-GB upload size limitation while using URL.

Second, consider just some of the issues that can affect your performance and hence your ability to scale:

* Sending files using multi-part means high dependency on your network, 
* service reliability, 
* connectivity, 
* upload speed, 
* lost packets somewhere in the world wide web.

When you upload videos using URL, you just need to provide a path to the location of a media file and Video Indexer takes care of the rest (see the `videoUrl` field in the [upload video](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Upload-Video?&pattern=upload) API).

> [!TIP]
> Use the `videoUrl` optional parameter of the upload video API.

To see an example of how to upload videos using URL, check out [this example](upload-index-videos.md#code-sample). Or, you can use [AzCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) for a fast and reliable way to get your content to a storage account from which you can submit it to Video Indexer using [SAS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview).

## Increase media reserved units if needed

Usually in the proof of concept stage when you just start using Video Indexer, you don’t need a lot of computing power. When you start having a larger archive of videos you need to index and you want the process to be at a pace that fits your use case, you need to scale up your usage of Video Indexer. Therefore, you should think about increasing the number of compute resources you use if the current amount of computing power is just not enough.

In Azure Media Services, when you want to increase computing power and parallelization, you need to pay attention to media [reserved units](../latest/concept-media-reserved-units.md)(RUs). The RUs are the compute units that determine the parameters for your media processing tasks. The number of RUs affects the number of media tasks that can be processed concurrently in each account and their type determines the speed of processing and one video might require more than one RU if its indexing is complex. When your RUs are busy, new tasks will be held in a queue until another resource is available.

To operate efficiently and to avoid having resources that stay idle part of the time, Video Indexer offers an auto-scale system that spins RUs down when less processing is needed and spin RUs up when you are in your rush hours (up to fully use all of your RUs). You can enable this functionality by [turning on the autoscale](manage-account-connected-to-azure.md#autoscale-reserved-units) in the account settings or using [Update-Paid-Account-Azure-Media-Services API](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Update-Paid-Account-Azure-Media-Services?&pattern=update).

To minimize indexing duration and low throughput we recommend, you start with 10 RUs of type S3. Later if you scale up to support more content or higher concurrency, and you need more resources to do so, you can [contact us using the support system](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) (on paid accounts only) to ask for more RUs allocation.

## Respect throttling

Video Indexer is built to deal with indexing at scale, and when you want to get the most out of it you should also be aware of the system's capabilities and design your integration accordingly. You don't want to send an upload request for a batch of videos just to discover that some of the movies didn't upload and you are receiving an HTTP 429 response code (too many requests). It can happen due to the fact that you sent more requests than the [limit of movies per minute we support](upload-index-videos.md#uploading-considerations-and-limitations). Video Indexer adds a `retry-after` header in the HTTP response, the header specifies when you should attempt your next retry. Make sure you respect it before trying your next request.

## Use callback URL

We recommend that instead of polling the status of your request constantly from the second you sent the upload request, you can add a [callback URL](upload-index-videos.md#callbackurl), and wait for Video Indexer to update you. As soon as there is any status change in your upload request, you get a POST notification to the URL you specified.

You can add a callback URL as one of the parameters of the [upload video API](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Upload-Video?&pattern=upload). Check out the code samples in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-video-indexer/tree/master/). 

For callback URL you can also use Azure Functions, a serverless event-driven platform that can be triggered by HTTP and implement a following flow.

### callBack URL definition

[!INCLUDE [callback url](./includes/callback-url.md)]

## Use the right indexing parameters for you

When making decisions related to using Video Indexer at scale, look at how to get the most out of it with the right parameters for your needs. Think about your use case, by defining different parameters you can save money and make the indexing process for your videos faster.

Before uploading and indexing your video read this short [documentation](upload-index-videos.md), check the [indexingPreset](upload-index-videos.md#indexingpreset) and [streamingPreset](upload-index-videos.md#streamingpreset) to get a better idea of what your options are.

For example, don’t set the preset to streaming if you don't plan to watch the video, don't index video insights if you only need audio insights.

## Index in optimal resolution, not highest resolution

You might be asking, what video quality do you need for indexing your videos? 

In many cases, indexing performance has almost no difference between HD (720P) videos and 4K videos. Eventually, you’ll get almost the same insights with the same confidence. The higher the quality of the movie you upload means the higher the file size, and this leads to higher computing power and time needed to upload the video.

For example, for the face detection feature, a higher resolution can help with the scenario where there are many small but contextually important faces. However, this will come with a quadratic increase in runtime and an increased risk of false positives.

Therefore, we recommend you to verify that you get the right results for your use case and to first test it locally. Upload the same video in 720P and in 4K and compare the insights you get.
