# Customizing content models in Video Indexer

Video Indexer allows you to customize some of its models to be adapted to your specific use case. These models include [brands](customize-brands-model-overview.md), [language](customize-language-model-overview.md), and [person](customize-person-model-overview.md). You can easily customize these models using the Video Indexer website or API.
