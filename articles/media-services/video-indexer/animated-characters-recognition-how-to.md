# Use the animated character detection (preview) with portal and API 

Azure Media Services Video Indexer supports detection, grouping, and recognition of characters in animated content, this functionality is available through the Azure portal and through API. Review [this overview](animated-characters-recognition.md) topic.

This article demonstrates to how to use the animated character detection with the Azure portal and the Video Indexer API.

## Use the animated character detection with portal 

In the trial accounts the Custom Vision integration is managed by Video Indexer, you can start creating and using the animated characters model. If using the trial account, you can skip the following ("Connect your Custom Vision account") section.

### Connect your Custom Vision account (paid accounts only)

If you own a Video Indexer paid account, you need to connect a Custom Vision account first. If you don't have a Custom Vision account already, please create one. For more information, see [Custom Vision](../../cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Both accounts need to be in the same region. The Custom Vision integration is currently not supported in the Japan region.

Paid accounts that have access to their Custom Vision account can see the models and tagged images there. Learn more about [improving your classifier in Custom Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-improving-your-classifier). 

Note that the training of the model should be done only via Video Indexer, and not via the Custom Vision website. 

#### Connect a Custom Vision account with API 

Follow these steps to connect you Custom Vision account to Video Indexer, or to change the Custom Vision account that is currently connected to Video Indexer:

1. Browse to [www.customvision.ai](https://www.customvision.ai) and login.
1. Copy the keys for the Training and Prediction resources:

    > [!NOTE]
    > To provide all the keys you need to have two separate resources in Custom Vision, one for training and one for prediction.
1. Provide other information:

    * Endpoint 
    * Prediction resource ID
1. Browse and sign in to the [Video Indexer](https://vi.microsoft.com/).
1. Click on the question mark on the top-right corner of the page and choose **API Reference**.
1. Make sure you are subscribed to API Management by clicking **Products** tab. If you have an API connected you can continue to the next step, otherwise, subscribe. 
1. On the developer portal, click the **Complete API Reference** and browse to **Operations**.  
1. Select **Connect Custom Vision Account (PREVIEW)** and click **Try it**.
1. Fill in the required fields as well as the access token and click **Send**. 

    For more information about how to get the Video Indexer access token go to the [developer portal](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/operations/operations/Get-Account-Access-Token?), and see the [relevant documentation](video-indexer-use-apis.md#obtain-access-token-using-the-authorization-api).  
1. Once the call return 200 OK response, your account is connected.
1. To verify your connection by browse to the [Video Indexer](https://vi.microsoft.com/)) portal:
1. Click on the **Content model customization** button in the top-right corner.
1. Go to the **Animated characters** tab.
1. Once you click on Manage models in Custom Vision, you will be transferred to the Custom Vision account you just connected.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only models that were created via Video Indexer are supported. Models that are created through Custom Vision will not be available. In addition, the best practice is to edit models that were created through Video Indexer only through the Video Indexer platform, since changes made through Custom Vision may cause unintended results.

### Create an animated characters model

1. Browse to the [Video Indexer](https://vi.microsoft.com/) website and sign in.
1. To customize a model in your account, select the **Content model customization** button on the left of the page.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/content-model-customization/content-model-customization.png" alt-text="Customize content model in Video Indexer":::
1. Go to the **Animated characters** tab in the model customization section.
1. Click on **Add model**.
1. Name you model and click enter to save the name.

> [!NOTE]
> The best practice is to have one custom vision model for each animated series. 

### Index a video with an animated model

For the initial training, upload at least two videos. Each should be preferably longer than 15 minutes, before expecting good recognition model. If you have shorter episodes, we recommend uploading at least 30 minutes of video content before training. This will allow you to merge groups that belong to the same character from different scenes and backgrounds, and therefore increase the chance it will detect the character in the following episodes you index. To train a model on multiple videos (episodes) you need to index them all with the same animation model. 

1. Click on the **Upload** button.
1. Choose a video to upload (from a file or a URL).
1. Click on **Advanced options**.
1. Under **People / Animated characters** choose **Animation models**.
1. If you have one model it will be chosen automatically, and if you have multiple models you can choose the relevant one out of the dropdown menu.
1. Click on upload.
1. Once the video is indexed, you will see the detected characters in the **Animated characters** section in the **Insights** pane.

Before tagging and training the model, all animated characters will be named “Unknown #X”. After you train the model they will also be recognized.

### Customize the animated characters models

1. Name the characters in Video Indexer.

    1. After the model created character group, it is recommended to review these groups in Custom Vision. 
    1. To tag an animated character in your video, go to the **Insights** tab and click on the **Edit** button on the top-right corner of the window. 
    1. In the **Insights** pane, click on any of the detected animated characters and change their names from "Unknown #X" to a temporary name (or the name that was previously assigned to the character). 
    1. After typing in the new name, click on the check icon next to the new name. This saves the new name in the model in Video Indexer. 
1. Paid accounts only: Review the groups in Custom Vision 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Paid accounts that have access to their Custom Vision account can see the models and tagged images there. Learn more about [improving your classifier in Custom Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-improving-your-classifier). It’s important to note that training of the model should be done only via Video Indexer (as described in this topid), and not via the Custom Vision website. 

    1. Go to the **Custom Models** page in Video Indexer and choose the **Animated characters** tab. 
    1. Click on the Edit button for the model you are working on to manage it in Custom Vision. 
    1. Review each character group: 

        * If the group contains unrelated images it is recommended to delete these in the Custom Vision website. 
        * If there are images that belong to a different character, change the tag on these specific images by click on the image, adding the right tag and deleting the wrong tag. 
        * If the group is not correct, meaning it contains mainly non-character images or images from multiple characters, you can delete in in Custom Vision website or in Video Indexer insights. 
        * The grouping algorithm will sometimes split your characters to different groups. It is therefore recommended to give all the groups that belong to the same character the same name (in Video Indexer Insights), which will immediately cause all these groups to appear as on in Custom Vision website. 
    1. Once the group is refined, make sure the initial name you tagged it with reflects the character in the group. 
1. Train the model 

    1. After you finished editing all names you want, you need to train the model. 
    1. Once a character is trained into the model, it will be recognized it the next video indexed with that model. 
    1. Open the customization page and click on the **Animated characters** tab and then click on the **Train** button to train your model. In order to keep the connection between Video 
    
Indexer and the model, don't train the model in the Custom Vision website (paid accounts have access to Custom Vision website), only in Video Indexer. 
Once trained, any video that will be indexed or reindexed with that model will recognize the trained characters. 

## Delete an animated character and the model

1. Delete an animated character.

    1. To delete an animated character in your video insights, go to the **Insights** tab and click on the **Edit** button on the top-right corner of the window.
    1. Choose the animated character and then click on the **Delete** button under their name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This will delete the insight from this video but will not affect the model.
1. Delete a model.

    1. Click on the **Content model customization** button on the top menu and go to the **Animated characters** tab.
    1. Click on the ellipsis icon to the right of the model you wish to delete and then on the delete button.
    
    * Paid account: the model will be disconnected from Video Indexer and you will not be able to reconnect it.
    * Trial account: the model will be deleted from Customs vision as well. 
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > In a trial account, you only have one model you can use. After you delete it, you can’t train other models.

## Use the animated character detection with API 

1. Connect a Custom Vision account.

    If you own a Video Indexer paid account, you need to connect a Custom Vision account first. <br/>
    If you don’t have a Custom Vision account already, please create one. For more information, see [Custom Vision](../../cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/overview.md).

    [Connect your Custom Vision account using API](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Connect-Custom-Vision-Account?tags=&pattern=&groupBy=tag).
1. Create an animated characters model.

    Use the [create animation model](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Create-Animation-Model?&groupBy=tag) API.
1. Index or re-index a video.

    Use the [re-indexing](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/operations/operations/Re-Index-Video?) API. 
1. Customize the animated characters models.

    Use the [train animation model](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Train-Animation-Model?&groupBy=tag) API.

## Limitations

* Currently, the "animation identification" capability is not supported in East-Asia region.
* Characters that appear to be small or far in the video may not be identified properly if the video's quality is poor.
* The recommendation is to use a model per set of animated characters (for example per an animated series).
