# Trace observed people in a video

Video Indexer detects observed people in videos and provides information such as the location of the person in the video frame and the exact timestamp (start, end) when a person appears. The API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each person instance detected, including detection confidence.  
 
Some scenarios where this feature could be useful:

* Post-event analysis—detect and track a person’s movement to better analyze an accident or crime post-event (for example, explosion, bank robbery, incident).  
* Improve efficiency when creating raw data for content creators, like video advertising, news, or sport games (for example, find people wearing a red shirt in a video archive).
* Create a summary out of a long video, like court evidence of a specific person’s appearance in a video, using the same detected person’s ID.
* Learn and analyze trends over time, for example—how customers move across aisles in a shopping mall or how much time they spend in checkout lines.

For example, if a video contains a person, the detect operation will list the person’s appearances together with their coordinates in the video frames. You can use this functionality to determine the person’s path in a video. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same person in a video.

The newly added **Observed people tracing** feature is available when indexing your file by choosing the **Advanced option** -> **Advanced video** or **Advanced video + audio** preset (under **Video + audio indexing**). Standard indexing will not include this new advanced model.

When you choose to see **Insights** of your video on the [Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/account/login) website, the Observed People Tracing will show up on the page with all detected people thumbnails. You can choose a thumbnail of a person and see where the person appears in the video player. 

The following JSON response illustrates what Video Indexer returns when tracing observed people:

                        }
                    ]
                },]

    ]
}
```

## Limitations and assumptions 

It's important to note the limitations of Observed People Tracing, to avoid or mitigate the effects of false negatives (missed detections) and limited detail.

* To optimize the detector results, use video footage from static cameras (although a moving camera or mixed scenes will also give results). 
* People are generally not detected if they appear small (minimum person height is 200 pixels).
* Maximum frame size is HD
* People are generally not detected if they're not standing or walking. 
* Low quality video (for example, dark lighting conditions) may impact the detection results. 
* The recommended frame rate —at least 30 FPS. 
* Recommended video input should contain up to 10 people in a single frame. The feature could work with more people in a single frame, but the detection result retrieves up to 10 people in a frame with the detection highest confidence. 
* People with similar clothes (for example, people wear uniforms, players in sport games) could be detected as the same person with the same ID number. 
* Occlusions – there maybe errors where there are occlusions (scene/self or occlusions by other people).
* Pose: The tracks may be split due to different poses (back/front)
