### Search by topics

You can now use the search API to search for videos with specific topics (API only).

### Labels enhancement

The label tagger was upgraded and now includes more visual labels that can be identified.

## May 2020

### Video Indexer deployed in the East US

You can now create a Video Indexer paid account in the East US region.
 
### Video Indexer URL

Video Indexer regional endpoints were all unified to start only with www. No action item is required.

From now on, you reach www.videoindexer.ai whether it is for embedding widgets or logging into Video Indexer web applications.

Also wus.videoindexer.ai would be redirected to www. More information is available in [Embed Video Indexer widgets in your apps](video-indexer-embed-widgets.md).

## April 2020

### New widget parameters capabilities

The **Insights** widget includes new parameters: `language` and `control`.

The **Player** widget has a new `locale` parameter. Both `locale` and `language` parameters control the player’s language.

For more information, see the [widget types](video-indexer-embed-widgets.md#widget-types) section. 

### New player skin

A new player skin launched with updated design.

### Prepare for upcoming changes

* Today, the following APIs return an account object:

    * [Create-Paid-Account](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Create-Paid-Account)
    * [Get-Account](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Get-Account)
    * [Get-Accounts-Authorization](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Get-Accounts-Authorization)
    * [Get-Accounts-With-Token](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Get-Accounts-With-Token)
 
    The Account object has a `Url` field pointing to the location of the [Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/).
For paid accounts the `Url` field is currently pointing to an internal URL instead of the public website.
In the coming weeks we will change it and return the [Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) URL for all accounts (trial and paid).

    Do not use the internal URLs, you should be using the [Video Indexer public APIs](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/).
* If you are embedding Video Indexer URLs in your applications and the URLs are not pointing to the [Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) or the Video Indexer API endpoint (`https://api.videoindexer.ai`) but rather to a regional endpoint (for example, `https://wus2.videoindexer.ai`), regenerate the URLs.

   You can do it it by either:

    * Replacing the URL with a URL pointing to the Video Indexer widget APIs (for example, the [insights widget](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Get-Video-Insights-Widget))
    * Using the Video Indexer website to generate a new embedded URL:
         
         Press **Play** to get to your video's page -> click the **&lt;/&gt; Embed** button -> copy the URL into your application:
   
    The regional URLs are not supported and will be blocked in the coming weeks.

## January 2020
 
### Custom language support for additional languages

Video Indexer now supports custom language models for `ar-SY` , `en-UK`, and `en-AU` (API only).
 
### Delete account timeframe action update

Delete account action now deletes the account within 90 days instead of 48 hours.
 
### New Video Indexer GitHub repository

A new Video Indexer GitHub with different projects, getting started guides and code samples is now available:
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-video-indexer
 
### Swagger update

Video Indexer unified **authentications** and **operations** into a single [Video Indexer OpenAPI Specification (swagger)](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/export?DocumentFormat=OpenApiJson). Developers can find the APIs in [Video Indexer Developer Portal](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/).

## December 2019

### Update transcript with the new API

Update a specific section in the transcript using the [Update-Video-Index](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Update-Video-Index?&pattern=update) API.

### Fix account configuration from the Video Indexer portal

You can now update Media Services connection configuration in order to self-help with issues like: 

* incorrect Azure Media Services resource
* password changes
* Media Services resources were moved between subscriptions  

To fix the account configuration, in the Video Indexer portal navigate to Settings > Account tab (as owner).

### Configure the custom vision account

Configure the custom vision account on paid accounts using the Video Indexer portal (previously, this was only supported by API). To do that, sign in to the Video Indexer portal, choose Model Customization > Animated characters > Configure. 

### Scenes, shots and keyframes – now in one insight pane

Scenes, shots, and keyframes are now merged into one insight for easier consumption and navigation. When you select the desired scene you can see what shots and keyframes it consists of. 

### Notification about a long video name

When a video name is longer than 80 characters, Video Indexer shows a descriptive error on upload.

### Streaming endpoint is disabled notification

When streaming endpoint is disabled, Video Indexer will show a descriptive error on the player page.

### Error handling improvement

Status code 409 will now be returned from [Re-Index Video](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Re-Index-Video?https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Re-Index-Video?) and [Update Video Index](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Update-Video-Index?) APIs in case a video is actively indexed, to prevent overriding the current re-index changes by accident.

## November 2019
 
* Korean custom language models support

    Video indexer now supports custom language models in Korean (`ko-KR`) in both the API and portal.

### New People and Locations entities extraction available
