# Search for exact moments in videos with Video Indexer

This topic shows you how to use the Video Indexer website to search for exact moments in videos.

1. Go to the [Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website and sign in.
1. Specify the search keywords and the search will be performed among all videos in your account's library. 

    You can filter your search by selecting **Filters**. In below example, we search for "Microsoft" that appears as an on-screen text only (OCR).

    If you select one of the results, the player brings you to that exact moment in the video.
1. View and search the summarized insights of the video by clicking **Play** on the video or selecting one of your original search results. 

    You can view, search, edit the **insights**. When you select one of the insights, the player brings you to that exact moment in the video.
