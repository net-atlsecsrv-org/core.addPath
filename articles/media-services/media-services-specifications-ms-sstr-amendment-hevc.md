# Smooth Streaming Protocol (MS-SSTR) Amendment for HEVC 

## 1 Introduction 

This article provides detailed amendments to be applied to the Smooth Streaming Protocol
specification [MS-SSTR] to enable Smooth Streaming of HEVC encoded video. In this specification, we
outline only the changes required to deliver the HEVC video codec. The article follows the same
numbering schema as the [MS-SSTR] specification. The empty headlines presented throughout the article are provided to orient the reader to their position in the [MS-SSTR] specification.  “(No Change)” indicates text is copied for clarification purposes only.

The article provides technical implementation requirements for the signaling of HEVC video codec 
in a Smooth Streaming manifest and normative  references are updated to reference the current MPEG standards 
that include HEVC, Common Encryption of HEVC, and box names for ISO Base Media File
Format have been updated to be consistent with the latest specifications. 

The referenced Smooth Streaming Protocol specification [MS-SSTR] describes the
wire format used to deliver live and on-demand digital media,
such as audio and video, in the following manners: from an encoder to a web
server, from a server to another server, and from a server to an HTTP client.
The use of an MPEG-4 ([[MPEG4-RA])](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=327787)-based data
structure delivery over HTTP allows seamless switching in near real time between
different quality levels of compressed media content. The result is a constant
playback experience for the HTTP client end user, even if network and video
rendering conditions change for the client computer or device.

>    Hz).

#### 2.2.2.2 ProtectionElement 

The ProtectionElement SHALL be present when Common Encryption (CENC) has been
applied to video or audio streams. HEVC encrypted streams SHALL conform to

>   in this stream, specified as the number of increments in one second. A value
>   of 90000 is recommended for HEVC streams. A value matching the waveform

##### 2.2.2.3.1 StreamProtectionElement

#### 2.2.2.4 UrlPattern 

#### 2.2.5 TrackElement 

>   **FourCC (variable):** A four-character code that identifies which media
>   format is used for each sample. The following range of values is reserved
>   with the following semantic meanings:
> 
> * "hev1”: Video samples for this track use HEVC video, using the ‘hev1’
>   sample description format specified in [ISO/IEC-14496-15].

>   **"hev1"** and;
> 
>   The **CodecPrivateData** field SHALL contain a hex-coded string
>   representation of the following byte sequence, specified in ABNF
>   [[RFC5234]:](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096) (no change from

>   Encryption Second Edition.

### 2.2.4 Fragment Response 

#### 2.2.4.1 MoofBox 

#### 2.2.4.2 MfhdBox 

#### 2.2.4.3 TrafBox 

#### 2.2.4.4 TfxdBox 

>   The **TfxdBox** is deprecated, and its function replaced by the Track
>   Fragment Decode Time Box (‘tfdt’) specified in [ISO/IEC 14496-12] section
>   8.8.12.
> 
>   **Note**: A client may calculate the duration of a fragment by summing the
>   sample durations listed in the Track Run Box (‘trun’) or multiplying the
>   number of samples times the default sample duration. The baseMediaDecodeTime
>   in ‘tfdt’ plus fragment duration equals the URL time parameter for the next
>   fragment.
> 
>   A Producer Reference Time Box (‘prft’) SHOULD be inserted prior to a Movie
>   Fragment Box (‘moof’) as needed, to indicate the UTC time corresponding to
>   the Track Fragment Decode Time of the first sample referenced by the Movie
>   Fragment Box, as specified in [ISO/IEC 14496-12] section 8.16.5.

>   in ‘tfdt’ plus fragment duration equals the URL time parameter for the next
>   fragment. Look ahead addresses are deprecated because they delay live
>   streaming.

#### 2.2.4.6 TfhdBox 

>   The **TfhdBox** and related fields encapsulate defaults for per sample
>   metadata in the fragment. The syntax of the **TfhdBox** field is a strict
>   subset of the syntax of the Track Fragment Header Box defined in
>   [[ISO/IEC-14496-12]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=183695) section
>   8.8.7.
> 
>   **BaseDataOffset (8 bytes):** The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of
>   the **MdatBox** field to the sample field in the **MdatBox** field. To
>   signal this restriction, the default-base-is-moof flag (0x020000) must be
>   set.

#### 2.2.4.7 TrunBox 

>   The **TrunBox** and related fields encapsulate per sample metadata for the
>   requested fragment. The syntax of **TrunBox** is a strict subset of the
>   Version 1 Track Fragment Run Box defined in
>   [[ISO/IEC-14496-](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=183695)*12]*

>   **SampleCompositionTimeOffset (4 bytes):** The Sample Composition Time
>   offset of each sample adjusted so that the presentation time of the first
>   presented sample in the fragment is equal to the decode time of the first
>   decoded sample. Negative video sample composition offsets SHALL be used,
> 
>   as defined in
>   [[ISO/IEC-14496-12].](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=183695)
> 
>   Note: This avoids a video synchronization error caused by video lagging
>   audio equal to the largest decoded picture buffer removal delay, and
>   maintains presentation timing between alternative fragments that may have
>   different removal delays.
> 
>   The syntax of the fields defined in this section, specified in ABNF
>   [[RFC5234],](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096) remains the
>   same, except as follows:
> 
>   SampleCompositionTimeOffset = SIGNED_INT32

#### 2.2.4.9 Fragment Response Common Fields 

### 2.2.5 Sparse Stream Pointer

>   MPEG-4 ([[MPEG4-RA])](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=327787) file,
>   and high-level attributes.
> 
>   **MajorBrand (variable):** The major brand of the media file. MUST be set to

    FileType = MajorBrand MinorVersion CompatibleBrands
    MajorBrand = STRING_UINT32
    MinorVersion = STRING_UINT32
    CompatibleBrands = "ccff" "iso8" 0\*(STRING_UINT32)

**Note**: The compatibility brands ‘ccff’ and ‘iso8’ indicate that fragments conform
