# Tutorial: Media Services trusted storage

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - How to enable trusted storage for Azure Media Services
> - How to use Managed Identities for trusted storage
> - How to give Azure Services to access to a storage account when using network access control such as a firewall or VPN

With the 2020-05-01 API, you can enable trusted storage by associating a Managed Identity with a Media Services account.

>[!NOTE]
>Trusted storage is only available in the API, and is not currently enabled in the Azure portal.

Media Services can automatically access your storage account using system authentication. Media Services validates that the Media Services account and the storage account are in the same subscription. It also validates that the user adding the association has access the storage account with Azure Resource Manager RBAC.

However, if you want to use network access control to secure your storage account and enable trusted storage, [Managed Identities](concept-managed-identities.md) authentication is required. It allows Media Services to access the storage account that has been configured with a firewall or a VNet restriction through trusted storage access.

## Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the 2020-05-01 API for all requests to Media Services.

These are the general steps for creating trusted storage for Media Services:

1. Create a resource group.
1. Create a storage account.
1. Poll the storage account until it's ready. When the storage account is ready, the request will return the service principal ID.
1. Find the ID of the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role.
1. Call the authorization provider and add a role assignment.
1. Update the media services account to authenticate to the storage account using Managed Identity.
1. Delete the resources if you don't want to continue to use them and be charged for them.

## Prerequisites

You need an Azure subscription to get started.  If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Get your tenant ID and subscription ID

If you don't know how to get your tenant ID and subscription ID, see [How to find your tenant ID](how-to-set-azure-tenant.md) and [Find your tenant ID](how-to-set-azure-tenant.md).

### Create a service principal and secret

If you don't know how to create a service principal and secret, see [Get credentials to access Media Services API](access-api-howto.md).

## Use a REST client

This script is intended for use with a REST client such as what is available in Visual Studio code extensions.  Adapt it for your development environment.

## Set initial variables

This part of the script is for use in a REST client. You may use variables differently within your development environment.

```rest
### AAD details
@tenantId = your tenant ID
@servicePrincipalId = the service principal ID
@servicePrincipalSecret = the service principal secret

### AAD resources
@armResource = https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.core.windows.net%2F
@graphResource = https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.windows.net%2F
@storageResource = https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.azure.com%2F

### Service endpoints
@armEndpoint = management.azure.com
@graphEndpoint = graph.windows.net
@aadEndpoint = login.microsoftonline.com

### ARM details
@subscription = your subscription id
@resourceGroup = the resource group you'll be creating
@storageName = the name of the storage you'll be creating
@accountName = the name of the account you'll be creating
@resourceLocation = East US (or the location that works best for your region)
```

## Get a token for Azure Resource Manager

```rest
// @name getArmToken
POST https://{{aadEndpoint}}/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/token
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

resource={{armResource}}&client_id={{servicePrincipalId}}&client_secret={{servicePrincipalSecret}}&grant_type=client_credentials
```

## Get a token for the Graph API

This part of the script is for use in a REST client. You may use variables differently within your development environment.

```rest
// @name getGraphToken
POST https://{{aadEndpoint}}/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/token
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

resource={{graphResource}}&client_id={{servicePrincipalId}}&client_secret={{servicePrincipalSecret}}&grant_type=client_credentials
```

## Get the service principal details

```rest
// @name getServicePrincipals
GET https://{{graphEndpoint}}/{{tenantId}}/servicePrincipals?$filter=appId%20eq%20'{{servicePrincipalId}}'&api-version=1.6
x-ms-client-request-id: cae3e4f7-17a0-476a-a05a-0dab934ba959
Authorization:  Bearer {{getGraphToken.response.body.access_token}}
```

## Store the service principal ID

```rest
@servicePrincipalObjectId = {{getServicePrincipals.response.body.value[0].objectId}}
```

## Create a resource group

```rest
// @name createResourceGroup
PUT https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}
    ?api-version=2016-09-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "location": "{{resourceLocation}}"
}
```

## Create storage account

```rest
// @name createStorageAccount
PUT https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}
    ?api-version=2019-06-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_GRS"
    },
    "kind": "StorageV2",
    "location": "{{resourceLocation}}",
    "properties": {
    }
}
```

## Get the storage account status

The storage account will take a while to be ready so this request polls for its status.  Repeat this request until the storage account is ready.

```rest
// @name getStorageAccountStatus
GET {{createStorageAccount.response.headers.Location}}
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
```

## Get the storage account details

When the storage account is ready, get the properties of the storage account.

```rest
// @name getStorageAccount
GET https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}
    ?api-version=2019-06-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
```

## Get a token for ARM

```rest
// @name getStorageToken
POST https://{{aadEndpoint}}/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/token
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

resource={{storageResource}}&client_id={{servicePrincipalId}}&client_secret={{servicePrincipalSecret}}&grant_type=client_credentials
```

## Create a Media Services account with a system-assigned managed identity

```rest
// @name createMediaServicesAccount
PUT https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/{{accountName}}?api-version=2020-05-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned"
  },
  "properties": {
    "storageAccounts": [
      {
        "id": "{{getStorageAccountStatus.response.body.id}}"
      }
    ],
    "encryption": {
      "type": "SystemKey"
    }
  },
  "location": "{{resourceLocation}}"
}
```

## Get the storage Storage Blob Data role definition

```rest
// @name getStorageBlobDataContributorRoleDefinition
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions?$filter=roleName%20eq%20%27Storage%20Blob%20Data%20Contributor%27&api-version=2015-07-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
```

### Set the storage role assignment

The role assignment says that the service principal for the Media Services account has the storage role *Storage Blob Data Contributor*.  This may take a while and it's important to wait or the Media Services account won't be set up correctly.

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{{$guid}}?api-version=2020-04-01-preview
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "properties": {
    "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{{getStorageBlobDataContributorRoleDefinition.response.body.value[0].name}}",
    "principalId": "{{createMediaServicesAccount.response.body.identity.principalId}}"
  }
}
```

## Give Managed Identity bypass access to the storage account

This action changes the access from system-managed identity to the Managed Identity. In this way, the storage account can access the storage account through a firewall as Azure services can access the storage account regardless of IP access rules (ACLs).

Again, wait until the role has been assigned in the storage account, or the Media Services account will be set up incorrectly.

```rest
// @name setStorageAccountFirewall
PUT https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}
    ?api-version=2019-06-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_GRS"
    },
    "kind": "StorageV2",
    "location": "{{resourceLocation}}",
    "properties": {
      "minimumTlsVersion": "TLS1_2",
      "networkAcls": {
        "bypass": "AzureServices",
        "virtualNetworkRules": [],
        "ipRules": [],
        "defaultAction": "Deny"
      }
    }
}
```

## Update the Media Services account to use the Managed Identity

This request may need to be retried a few times as the storage role assignment can take a few minutes to propagate.

```rest
// @name updateMediaServicesAccountWithManagedStorageAuth
PUT https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/{{accountName}}?api-version=2020-05-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned"
  },
  "properties": {
    "storageAccounts": [
      {
        "id": "{{getStorageAccountStatus.response.body.id}}"
      }
    ],
    "storageAuthentication": "ManagedIdentity",
    "encryption": {
      "type": "SystemKey"
    }
  },
  "location": "{{resourceLocation}}"
}
```

## Test access

Test access by creating an asset in the storage account.

```rest
// @name createAsset
PUT https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/{{accountName}}/assets/testasset{{index}}withoutmi?api-version=2018-07-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
}
```

## Delete resources

If you don't want to keep the resources that you created and continue to be charged for them, delete them.

```rest
### Clean up the Storage account
DELETE https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{{storageName}}
    ?api-version=2019-06-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}

### Clean up the Media Services account
DELETE https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/{{accountName}}?api-version=2020-05-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}

### Clean up the Media Services account
GET https://{{armEndpoint}}/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/{{accountName}}?api-version=2020-05-01
Authorization: Bearer {{getArmToken.response.body.access_token}}
```
