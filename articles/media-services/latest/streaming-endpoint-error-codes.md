# Streaming Endpoint (Origin) errors 

This topic describes errors that you may receive from the Azure Media Services [Streaming Endpoint service](streaming-endpoint-concept.md).

## 400 Bad Request

The request contains invalid information and is rejected with these error codes and due to one of the following reasons:

|Error code|Hexadecimal value |Error description|
|---|---|---|
|MPE_BAD_URL_SYNTAX |0x80890201|A URL syntax or format error. Examples include requests for an invalid type, an invalid fragment, or an invalid track. |
|MPE_ENC_ENCRYPTION_NOT_SPECIFIED_IN_URL |0x8088024C|The request has no encryption tag in the URL. CMAF requests require an encryption tag in the URL. Other protocols that are configured with more than one encryption type also require the encryption tag for disambiguation. |
|MPE_STORAGE_BAD_URL_SYNTAX |0x808900E9|The request to storage to fulfill the request failed with a Bad Request error. |

## 403 Forbidden

The request is not allowed due to one of the following reasons:

|Error code|Hexadecimal value |Error description|
|---|---|---|
|MPE_STORAGE_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED |0x808900EA|The request to storage to fulfill the request failed with an Authentication failure. This can happen if the storage keys were rotated and the service was unable to sync the storage keys. <br/><br/>Contact Azure support by going to [Help + support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) in the Azure portal.|

## 503 Service Unavailable

The server is currently unable to receive requests. This error may be caused by excessive requests to the service. Media Services throttling mechanism restricts the resource usage for applications that make excessive request to the service.

> [!NOTE]
> Check the error message and error code string to get more detailed information about the reason you got the 503 error. This error does not always mean throttling.
