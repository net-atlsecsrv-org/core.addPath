# Developing with Media Services v3 APIs

As a developer, you can use Media Services [REST API](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-ref) or client libraries that allow you to interact with the REST API to easily create, manage, and maintain custom media workflows. The [Media Services v3](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-sdk) API is based on the OpenAPI specification (formerly known as a Swagger).

This article discusses rules that apply to entities and APIs when developing with Media Services v3.

## Accessing the Azure Media Services API

To be authorized to access Media Services resources and the Media Services API, you must first be authenticated. Media Services supports [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)-based](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) authentication. Two common authentication options are:
 
* **Service principal authentication** - Used to authenticate a service (for example: web apps, function apps, logic apps, API, and microservices). Applications that commonly use this authentication method are apps that run daemon services, middle-tier services, or scheduled jobs. For example, for Web applications there should always be a mid-tier that connects to Media Services with a Service Principal.
* **User authentication** - Used to authenticate a person who is using the app to interact with Media Services resources. The interactive application should first prompt the user for the user's credentials. An example is a management console app used by authorized users to monitor encoding jobs or live streaming.

The Media Services API requires that the user or application making the REST API requests have access to the Media Services account resource and use a **Contributor** or **Owner** role. The API can be accessed with the **Reader** role but only **Get** or **List**  operations will be available. For more information, see [Role-based access control for Media Services accounts](rbac-overview.md).

Instead of creating a service principal, consider using managed identities for Azure resources to access the Media Services API through Azure Resource Manager. To learn more about managed identities for Azure resources, see [What is managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

### Azure AD service principal 

If you are creating an Azure AD application and service principal, the application has to be in its own tenant. After you create the application, give the app **Contributor** or **Owner** role access to the Media Services account. 

If you are not sure whether you have permissions to create an Azure AD application, see [Required permissions](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#required-permissions).

In the following figure, the numbers represent the flow of the requests in chronological order:

![Middle-tier apps](./media/use-aad-auth-to-access-ams-api/media-services-principal-service-aad-app1.png)

1. A middle-tier app requests an Azure AD access token that has the following parameters:  

   * Azure AD tenant endpoint.
   * Media Services resource URI.
   * Resource URI for REST Media Services.
   * Azure AD application values: the client ID and client secret.
   
   To get all the needed values, 
see [Access Azure Media Services API with the Azure CLI](access-api-cli-how-to.md)

2. The Azure AD access token is sent to the middle tier.
4. The middle tier sends request to the Azure Media REST API with the Azure AD token.
5. The middle tier gets back the data from Media Services.

### Samples

See the following samples that show how to connect with Azure AD service principal:

* [Connect with REST](media-rest-apis-with-postman.md)  
* [Connect with Java](configure-connect-java-howto.md)
* [Connect with .NET](configure-connect-dotnet-howto.md)
* [Connect with Node.js](configure-connect-nodejs-howto.md)
* [Connect with Python](configure-connect-python-howto.md)

## Naming conventions

Azure Media Services v3 resource names (for example, Assets, Jobs, Transforms) are subject to Azure Resource Manager naming constraints. In accordance with Azure Resource Manager, the resource names are always unique. Thus, you can use any unique identifier strings (for example, GUIDs) for your resource names. 

Media Services resource names cannot include: '<', '>', '%', '&', ':', '&#92;', '?', '/', '*', '+', '.', the single quote character, or any control characters. All other characters are allowed. The max length of a resource name is 260 characters. 

For more information about Azure Resource Manager naming, see: [Naming requirements](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-rpc/blob/master/v1.0/resource-api-reference.md#arguments-for-crud-on-resource) and [Naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions).

## Long-running operations

The operations marked with `x-ms-long-running-operation` in the Azure Media Services [swagger files](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/stable/2018-07-01/streamingservice.json) are long running operations. 

For details about how to track asynchronous Azure operations, see [Async operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-async-operations#monitor-status-of-operation).

Media Services has the following long-running operations:

* Create LiveEvent
* Update LiveEvent
* Delete LiveEvent
* Start LiveEvent
* Stop LiveEvent
* Reset LiveEvent
* Create LiveOutput
* Delete LiveOutput
* Create StreamingEndpoint
* Update StreamingEndpoint
* Delete StreamingEndpoint
* Start StreamingEndpoint
* Stop StreamingEndpoint
* Scale StreamingEndpoint


## SDKs

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Media Services v3 SDKs are not guaranteed to be thread-safe. When developing a multi-threaded application, you should add your own thread synchronization logic to protect the client or use a new AzureMediaServicesClient object per thread. You should also be careful of multi-threading issues introduced by optional objects provided by your code to the client (like an HttpClient instance in .NET).

## Azure Media Services Explorer

[Azure Media Services Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer) (AMSE) is a tool available to Windows customers who want to learn about Media Services. AMSE is a Winforms/C# application that does upload, download, encode, stream VOD and live content with Media Services. The AMSE tool is for clients who want to test Media Services without writing any code. The AMSE code is provided as a resource for customers who want to develop with Media Services.

AMSE is an Open Source project, support is provided by the community (issues can be reported to https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer/issues). This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
