# Azure Event Grid schemas for Media Services events

This article provides the schemas and properties for Media Services events.

For a list of sample scripts and tutorials, see [Media Services event source](../../event-grid/event-sources.md#azure-subscriptions).

## Job related event types

Media Services emits the **Job** related event types described below. There are two categories for the **Job** related events: "Monitoring Job State Changes" and "Monitoring Job Output State Changes". 

You can register for all of the events by subscribing to the JobStateChange event. Or, you can subscribe for specific events only (for example, final states like JobErrored, JobFinished, and JobCanceled). 

### Monitoring Job state changes

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Media.JobStateChange| Get an event for all Job State changes. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobScheduled| Get an event when Job transitions to scheduled state. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobProcessing| Get an event when Job transitions to processing state. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobCanceling| Get an event when Job transitions to canceling state. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobFinished| Get an event when Job transitions to finished state. This is a final state that includes Job outputs.|
| Microsoft.Media.JobCanceled| Get an event when Job transitions to canceled state. This is a final state that includes Job outputs.|
| Microsoft.Media.JobErrored| Get an event when Job transitions to error state. This is a final state that includes Job outputs.|

See [Schema examples](#event-schema-examples) that follow.

### Monitoring Job output state changes

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputStateChange| Get an event for all Job output State changes. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputScheduled| Get an event when Job output transitions to scheduled state. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputProcessing| Get an event when Job output transitions to processing state. |
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputCanceling| Get an event when Job output transitions to canceling state.|
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputFinished| Get an event when Job output transitions to finished state.|
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputCanceled| Get an event when Job output transitions to canceled state.|
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputErrored| Get an event when Job output transitions to error state.|

See [Schema examples](#event-schema-examples) that follow.

### Monitoring Job output progress

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Media.JobOutputProgress| This event reflects the job processing progress, from 0% to 100%. The service attempts to send an event if there has been 5% or greater increase in the progress value or it has been more than 30 seconds since the last event (heartbeat). The progress value is not guaranteed to start at 0%, or to reach 100%, nor is it guaranteed to increase at a constant rate over time. This event should not be used to determine that the processing has been completed â€“ you should instead use the state change events.|

See [Schema examples](#event-schema-examples) that follow.

## Live event types

Media Services also emits the **Live** event types described below. There are two categories for the **Live** events: stream-level events and track-level events. 

### Stream-level events

Stream-level events are raised per stream or connection. Each event has a `StreamId` parameter that identifies the connection or stream. Each stream or connection has one or more tracks of different types. For example, one connection from an encoder may have one audio track and four video tracks. The stream event types are:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventConnectionRejected | Encoder's connection attempt is rejected. |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventEncoderConnected | Encoder establishes connection with live event. |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventEncoderDisconnected | Encoder disconnects. |

See [Schema examples](#event-schema-examples) that follow.

### Track-level events

Track-level events are raised per track. 

> [!NOTE]
> All track-level events are raised after a live encoder is connected.

The track-level event types are:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventIncomingDataChunkDropped | Media server drops data chunk because it's too late or has an overlapping timestamp (timestamp of new data chunk is less than the end time of the previous data chunk). |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventIncomingStreamReceived | Media server receives first data chunk for each track in the stream or connection. |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventIncomingStreamsOutOfSync | Media server detects audio and video streams are out of sync. Use as a warning because user experience may not be impacted. |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventIncomingVideoStreamsOutOfSync | Media server detects any of the two video streams coming from external encoder are out of sync. Use as a warning because user experience may not be impacted. |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventIngestHeartbeat | Published every 20 seconds for each track when live event is running. Provides ingest health summary.<br/><br/>After the encoder was initially connected, the heartbeat event continues to emit every 20 sec whether the encoder is still connected or not. |
| Microsoft.Media.LiveEventTrackDiscontinuityDetected | Media server detects discontinuity in the incoming track. |

See [Schema examples](#event-schema-examples) that follow.

## Event schema examples

### JobStateChange

The following example shows the schema of the **JobStateChange** event: 

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/<account-name>",

      "unexpectedBitrate": false,
      "state": "Running",
      "healthy": true
    },
    "dataVersion": "1.0",
    "metadataVersion": "1"
  }
]
```

The data object has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| trackType | string | Type of the track (Audio / Video). |
| trackName | string | Name of the track (either provided by the encoder or, in case of RTMP, server generates in *TrackType_Bitrate* format). |
| bitrate | integer | Bitrate of the track. |
| incomingBitrate | integer | Calculated bitrate based on data chunks coming from encoder. |
| lastTimestamp | string | Latest timestamp received for a track in last 20 seconds. |
| timescale | string | Timescale in which timestamps are expressed. |
| overlapCount | integer | Number of data chunks had overlapped timestamps in last 20 seconds. |
| discontinuityCount | integer | Number of discontinuities observed in last 20 seconds. |
| nonIncreasingCount | integer | Number of data chunks with timestamps in the past were received in last 20 seconds. |
| unexpectedBitrate | bool | If expected and actual bitrates differ by more than allowed limit in last 20 seconds. It's true if and only if, incomingBitrate >= 2* bitrate OR incomingBitrate <= bitrate/2 OR IncomingBitrate = 0. |
| state | string | State of the live event. |
| healthy | bool | Indicates whether ingest is healthy based on the counts and flags. Healthy is true if overlapCount = 0 && discontinuityCount = 0 && nonIncreasingCount = 0 && unexpectedBitrate = false. |

### LiveEventTrackDiscontinuityDetected

The following example shows the schema of the **LiveEventTrackDiscontinuityDetected** event: 

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/<account-name>",
    "subject": "liveEvent/mle1",
    "eventType": "Microsoft.Media.LiveEventTrackDiscontinuityDetected",
    "eventTime": "2018-08-07T23:18:06.1270405Z",
    "id": "5f4c510d-5be7-4bef-baf0-64b828be9c9b",
    "data": {
      "trackName": "video",
      "previousTimestamp": "15336837615032322",
      "trackType": "video",
      "bitrate": 2962000,
      "newTimestamp": "15336837619774273",
      "discontinuityGap": "575284",
      "timescale": "10000000"
    },
    "dataVersion": "1.0",
    "metadataVersion": "1"
  }
]
```

The data object has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| trackType | string | Type of the track (Audio / Video). |
| trackName | string | Name of the track (either provided by the encoder or, in case of RTMP, server generates in *TrackType_Bitrate* format). |
| bitrate | integer | Bitrate of the track. |
| previousTimestamp | string | Timestamp of the previous fragment. |
| newTimestamp | string | Timestamp of the current fragment. |
| discontinuityGap | string | Gap between above two timestamps. |
| timescale | string | Timescale in which both timestamp and discontinuity gap are represented. |

### Common event properties

An event has the following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| topic | string | The EventGrid topic. This property has the resource ID for the Media Services account. |
| subject | string | The resource path for the Media Services channel under the Media Services account. Concatenating the topic and subject give you the resource ID for the job. |
| eventType | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. For example, "Microsoft.Media.JobStateChange". |
| eventTime | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| data | object | Media Services event data. |
| dataVersion | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| metadataVersion | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |
