# Create a transform

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

The Azure CLI script in this article shows how to create a transform. Transforms describe a simple workflow of tasks for processing your video or audio files (often referred to as a "recipe"). You should always check if a Transform with desired name and "recipe" already exist. If it does, you should reuse it.

## Prerequisites

[Create a Media Services account](./create-account-howto.md).

## [CLI](#tab/cli/)

[!INCLUDE [media-services-cli-instructions.md](../../../includes/media-services-cli-instructions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> You can only specify a path to a custom Standard Encoder preset JSON file for [StandardEncoderPreset](/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#standardencoderpreset), see the [encode with a custom transform](custom-preset-cli-howto.md) example.
>
> You cannot pass a file name when using [BuiltInStandardEncoderPreset](/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#builtinstandardencoderpreset).

## Example script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/media-services/create-transform/Create-Transform.sh "Create a transform")]

## [REST](#tab/rest/)

[!INCLUDE [task general transform creation](./includes/task-create-basic-audio-rest.md)]
