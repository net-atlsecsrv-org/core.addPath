# How to encode with a custom transform - REST

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

When encoding with Azure Media Services, you can get started quickly with one of the recommended built-in presets, based on industry best practices, as demonstrated in the [Streaming files](stream-files-tutorial-with-rest.md#create-a-transform) tutorial. You can also build a custom preset to target your specific scenario or device requirements.

## Considerations

When creating custom presets, the following considerations apply:

* All values for height and width on AVC content must be a multiple of 4.
* In Azure Media Services v3, all of the encoding bitrates are in bits per second. This is different from the presets with our v2 APIs, which used kilobits/second as the unit. For example, if the bitrate in v2 was specified as 128 (kilobits/second), in v3 it would be set to 128000 (bits/second).

## Prerequisites 

- [Create a Media Services account](./create-account-howto.md). <br/>Make sure to remember the resource group name and the Media Services account name. 
- [Configure Postman for Azure Media Services REST API calls](media-rest-apis-with-postman.md).<br/>Make sure to follow the last step in the topic [Get Azure AD Token](media-rest-apis-with-postman.md#get-azure-ad-token). 

## Define a custom preset

The following example defines the request body of a new Transform. We define a set of outputs that we want to be generated when this Transform is used. 

In this example, we first add an AacAudio layer for the audio encoding and two H264Video layers for the video encoding. In the video layers, we assign labels so that they can be used in the output file names. Next, we want the output to also include thumbnails. In the example below we specify images in PNG format, generated at 50% of the resolution of the input video, and at three timestamps - {25%, 50%, 75} of the length of the input video. Lastly, we specify the format for the output files - one for video + audio, and another for the thumbnails. Since we have multiple H264Layers, we have to use macros that produce unique names per layer. We can either use a `{Label}` or `{Bitrate}` macro, the example shows the former.

## Create a new transform  

In this example, we create a **Transform** that is based on the custom preset we defined earlier. When creating a Transform, you should first use [Get](/rest/api/media/transforms/get) to check if one already exists. If the Transform exists, reuse it. 

In the Postman's collection that you downloaded, select **Transforms and Jobs**->**Create or Update Transform**.

The **PUT** HTTP request method is similar to:

```
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/resourceGroups/:resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaServices/:accountName/transforms/:transformName?api-version={{api-version}}
```

Select the **Body** tab and replace the body with the json code you [defined earlier](#define-a-custom-preset). For Media Services to apply the Transform to the specified video or audio, you need to submit a Job under that Transform.

Select **Send**. 

For Media Services to apply the Transform to the specified video or audio, you need to submit a Job under that Transform. For a complete example that shows how to submit a job under a transform, see [Tutorial: Stream video files - REST](stream-files-tutorial-with-rest.md).
