# How to scale media reserved units

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

This article shows you how to scale Media Reserved Units (MRSs) for faster encoding.

> [!WARNING]
> This command will no longer work for Media Services accounts that are created with the 2020-05-01 version of the API or later. For these accounts media reserved units are no longer needed as the system will automatically scale up and down based on load. If you don’t see the option to manage MRUs in the Azure portal, you’re using an account that was created with the 2020-05-01 API or later.

## Prerequisites

[Create a Media Services account](./account-create-how-to.md).

Understand [Media Reserved Units](concept-media-reserved-units.md).

## Scale Media Reserved Units with CLI

Run the `mru` command.

The following [az ams account mru](/cli/azure/ams/account/mru) command sets Media Reserved Units on the "amsaccount" account using the **count** and **type** parameters.

```azurecli
az ams account mru set -n amsaccount -g amsResourceGroup --count 10 --type S3
```

## Billing

You are charged based on number of minutes the Media Reserved Units are provisioned in your account. This occurs independent of whether there are any Jobs running in your account. For a detailed explanation, see the FAQ section of the [Media Services pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/media-services/) page.
