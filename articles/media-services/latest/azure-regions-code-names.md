# Regional code names and endpoints

### Region code name

When the **location** parameter is used in a command or request, you need to provide the region code name as the **location** value. To get the code name of the region that your account is in and that your call should be routed to, you can run the following line in Azure CLI.

```azurecli-interactive
az account list-locations
```

Once you run the line shown above, you get a list of all Azure regions. Navigate to the Azure region that has the *displayName* you are looking for, and use its *name* value for the **location** parameter.

For example, for the Azure region West US 2 (displayed below), you will use "westus2" for the **location** parameter.

```json
   {
      "displayName": "West US 2",
      "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-23da-4fce-b59c-f6fb9513eeeb/locations/westus2",
      "latitude": "47.233",
      "longitude": "-119.852",
      "name": "westus2",
      "subscriptionId": null
    }
```
