# Create an Azure Media Services live stream with OBS

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

This quickstart will help you create a Media Services Live Event by using the Azure portal and broadcast using Open Broadcasting Studio (OBS). It assumes that you have an Azure subscription and have created a Media Services account.

In this quickstart, we'll cover:

- Setting up an on-premises encoder with OBS.
- Setting up a live stream.
- Setting up live stream outputs.
- Running a default streaming endpoint.
- Using Azure Media Player to view the live stream and on-demand output.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Open your web browser, and go to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Enter your credentials to sign in to the portal. The default view is your service dashboard.

## Set up an on-premises encoder by using OBS

1. Download and install OBS for your operating system on the [Open Broadcaster Software website](https://obsproject.com/).
1. Start the application and keep it open.

## Run the default streaming endpoint

1. Select **Streaming endpoints** in the Media Services listing.

   ![Streaming endpoints menu item.](media/live-events-obs-quickstart/streaming-endpoints.png)
1. If the default streaming endpoint status is stopped, select it. This step takes you to the page for that endpoint.
1. Select **Start**.

1. In the **Server** field, paste the RTMPS URL you copied to your clipboard.

1. Enter something into the **Stream key** field.  It doesn't really matter what it is, but it needs to have a value.

    ![OBS stream settings.](media/live-events-obs-quickstart/live-event-obs-stream-settings.png)

1. Select **Output** from the **Settings** menu.

1. Select the **Output Mode** dropdown at the top of the page and choose **Advanced** to access all of the available encoder settings.

1. Select the **Streaming** tab to set up the encoder.

1. Select the right encoder for your system.  If your hardware supports GPU acceleration, choose from NVIDIA **NVENC** H.264 or Intel **QuickSync** H.264. If your system doesn't have a supported GPU, select the **X264** software encoder option.

#### X264 Encoder settings

1. If you have selected the **X264** encoding option select the **Rescale Output** box. Select either 1920x1080 if you are using a Premium Live Event in Media Services or 1280x720 if you're using a Standard (720P) Live Event.  If you're using a pass-through live event, you can choose any available resolution.

1. Set the **Bitrate** to anywhere between 1500 Kbps and 4000 Kbps. We recommend 2500 Kbps if you are using a Standard encoding Live Event at 720P. If you are using a 1080P Premium Live Event, 4000 Kbps is recommended. You may wish to adjust the bitrate based on available CPU capabilities and bandwidth on your network to achieve the desired quality setting.

1. Enter *2* into the **Keyframe interval** field. The value sets the key frame interval to 2 seconds, which controls the final size of the fragments delivered over HLS or DASH from Media Services. Never set the key frame interval any higher than 4 seconds.  If you are seeing high latency when broadcasting, you should always double check or inform your application users to always set this value to 2 seconds. When attempting to achieve lower latency live delivery you can choose to set this value to as low as 1 second.

1. OPTIONAL: Set the CPU Usage Preset to **veryfast** and run some experiments to see if your local CPU can handle the combination of bitrate and preset with enough overhead. Try to avoid settings that would result in an average CPU higher than 80% to avoid any issues during live streaming. To improve quality, you can test with **faster** and **fast** preset settings until you reach your CPU limitations.

   ![OBS X264 encoder settings](media/live-events-obs-quickstart/live-event-obs-x264-settings.png)

1. Leave the rest of the settings unchanged and select **OK**.

#### Nvidia NVENC Encoder settings

1. If you have selected the **NVENC** GPU encoding option, check the **Rescale Output** box and select either 1920x1080 if you are using a Premium Live Event in Media Services, or 1280x720 if you are using a Standard (720P) Live Event. If you are using a pass-through live event, you can choose any available resolution.

1. Set the **Rate Control** to CBR for Constant Bitrate rate control.

1. Set the **Bitrate** anywhere between 1500 Kbps and 4000 Kbps. We recommend 2500 Kbps if you are using a Standard encoding Live Event at 720P. If you are using a 1080P Premium Live Event, 4000 Kbps is recommended. You may choose to adjust this based on available CPU capabilities and bandwidth on your network to achieve the desired quality setting.

1. Set the **Keyframe Interval** to 2 seconds as noted above under the X264 options. Do not exceed 4 seconds, as this can significantly impact the latency of your live broadcast.

1. Set the **Preset** to Low-Latency, Low-Latency Performance, or Low-Latency Quality depending on the CPU speed on your local machine. Experiment with these settings to achieve the best balance between quality and CPU utilization on your own hardware.

1. Set the **Profile** to "main" or "high" if you are using a more powerful hardware configuration.

1. Leave the **Look-ahead** unchecked. If you have a very powerful machine you can check this.

1. Leave the **Psycho Visual Tuning** unchecked. If you have a very powerful machine you can check this.

1. Set the **GPU** to 0 to automatically decide which GPUs to allocate. If desired, you can restrict GPU usage.

1. Set the **Max B-frames** to 2

#### Intel QuickSync Encoder settings

1. If you have selected the Intel **QuickSync** GPU encoding option, check the **Rescale Output** box and select either 1920x1080 if you are using a Premium Live Event in Media Services, or 1280x720 if you are using a Standard (720P) Live Event. If you are using a pass-through live event, you can choose any available resolution.

1. Set the **Target Usage** to "balanced" or adjust as needed based on your CPU and GPU combined load. Adjust as necessary and experiment to achieve an 80% max CPU utilization on average with the quality that your hardware is capable of producing. If you are on more constrained hardware, test with "fast" or drop to "very fast" if you are having performance issues.

1. Set the **Profile** to "main" or "high" if you are using a more powerful hardware configuration.

1. Set the **Keyframe Interval** to 2 seconds as noted above under the X264 options. Do not exceed 4 seconds, as this can significantly impact the latency of your live broadcast.

1. Set the **Rate Control** to CBR for Constant Bitrate rate control.

1. Set the **Bitrate** anywhere between 1500 and 4000 Kbps.  We recommend 2500 Kbps if you are using a Standard encoding Live Event at 720P. If you are using a 1080P Premium Live Event, 4000 Kbps is recommended. You may choose to adjust this based on available CPU capabilities and bandwidth on your network to achieve the desired quality setting.

1. Set the **Latency** to "low".

1. Set the **B frames** to 2.

1. Leave the **Subjective Video Enhancements** unchecked.
