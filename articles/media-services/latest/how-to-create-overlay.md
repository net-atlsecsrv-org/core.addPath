# How to create an overlay with Media Encoder Standard

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

The Media Encoder Standard allows you to overlay an image, audio file, or another video onto another video. The input must specify exactly one file. You can specify an image file in JPG, PNG, GIF or BMP format, or an audio file (such as a WAV, MP3, WMA or M4A file), or a video file.


## Prerequisites

* Collect the account information that you need to configure the *appsettings.json* file in the sample. If you're not sure how to do that, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](../../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md). The following values are expected in the *appsettings.json* file.

    ```json
    {
    "AadClientId": "",
    "AadEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "AadSecret": "",
    "AadTenantId": "",
    "AccountName": "",
    "ArmAadAudience": "https://management.core.windows.net/",
    "ArmEndpoint": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "Location": "",
    "ResourceGroup": "",
    "SubscriptionId": ""
    }
    ```

If you aren't already familiar with Transforms, it is recommended that you complete the following activities:

* Read [Encoding video and audio with Media Services](encoding-concept.md)
* Read [How to encode with a custom transform - .NET](customize-encoder-presets-how-to.md). Follow the steps in that article to set up the .NET needed to work with transforms, then return here to try out an overlays preset sample.
* See the [Transforms reference document](/rest/api/media/transforms).

Once you are familiar with Transforms, download the overlays sample.
