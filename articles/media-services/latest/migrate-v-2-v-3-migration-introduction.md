# Migrate from Media Services v2 to v3 introduction

![migration guide logo](./media/migration-guide/azure-media-services-logo-migration-guide.svg)

The Media Services migration guide helps you migrate from Media Services V2 APIs to V3 APIs based on a migration that takes advantage of the new features and functions that are now available. You should use your best judgment and determine what best fits your scenario.

## How to use this guide

### Navigating

Throughout the guide, you will see the following graphic.

The step you are on will be indicated by a color change in the number of the step, like so:

![migration steps 2](./media/migration-guide/steps-2.svg)<br/>

At the end of each page, you will see links to the rest of the migration documents you can read underneath the **Next steps** heading.

### Guidance

The guidance provided here is *general*. It includes content to improve your awareness of what is now available in V3 as well as what has changed in the Media Services workflows.

For more detailed guidance, including screenshots and conceptual graphics, there are links to concepts, tutorials, quickstarts, samples and API references in each scenario-based topic. We have also listed samples that help you compare the V2 API to the V3 API.
