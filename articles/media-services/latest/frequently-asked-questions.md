# Azure Media Services v3 frequently asked questions

This article gives answers to Azure Media Services (AMS) v3 frequently asked questions.

## v3 APIs

### What Azure roles can perform actions on Azure Media Services resources? 

See [Role-based access control (RBAC) for Media Services accounts](rbac-overview.md).

### How do I configure Media Reserved Units?

For the Audio Analysis and Video Analysis Jobs that are triggered by Media Services v3 or Video Indexer, it is highly recommended to provision your account with 10 S3 MRUs. If you need more than 10 S3 MRUs, open a support ticket using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

For details, see [Scale media processing with CLI](media-reserved-units-cli-how-to.md).

### What is the recommended method to process videos?

Use [Transforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms) to configure common tasks for encoding or analyzing videos. Each **Transform** describes a recipe, or a workflow of tasks for processing your video or audio files. A [Job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/jobs) is the actual request to Media Services to apply the **Transform** to a given input video or audio content. Once the Transform has been created, you can submit jobs using Media Services APIs, or any of the published SDKs. For more information, see [Transforms and Jobs](transforms-jobs-concept.md).

### How does pagination work?

When using pagination, you should always use the next link to enumerate the collection and not depend on a particular page size. For details and examples, see [Filtering, ordering, paging](entities-overview.md).

### What features are not yet available in Azure Media Services v3?

For details, see [feature gaps with respect to v2 APIs](migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md#feature-gaps-with-respect-to-v2-apis).

## Live streaming 

###  How to insert breaks/videos and image slates during live stream?

Media Services v3 live encoding does not yet support inserting video or image slates during live stream. 

You can use a [live on-premises encoder](recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md) to switch the source video. Many apps provide ability to switch sources, including Telestream Wirecast, Switcher Studio (on iOS), OBS Studio (free app), and many more.

## Content protection

### How and where to get JWT token before using it to request license or key?

1. For production, you need to have a Secure Token Services (STS) (web service) which issues JWT token upon a HTTPS request. For test, you could use the code shown in **GetTokenAsync** method defined in [Program.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/blob/master/AMSV3Tutorials/EncryptWithDRM/Program.cs).
2. Player will need to make a request, after a user is authenticated, to the STS for such a token and assign it as the value of the token. You can use the [Azure Media Player API](https://amp.azure.net/libs/amp/latest/docs/).

* For an example of running STS, with either symmetric and asymmetric key, please see [https://aka.ms/jwt](https://aka.ms/jwt). 
* For an example of a player based on Azure Media Player using such JWT token, see [https://aka.ms/amtest](https://aka.ms/amtest) (expand "player_settings" link to see the token input).

### How do you authorize requests to stream videos with AES encryption?

The correct approach is to leverage STS (Secure Token Service):

In STS, depending on user profile, add different claims (such as "Premium User", "Basic User", "Free Trial User"). With different claims in a JWT, the user can see different contents. Of course, for different content/asset, the ContentKeyPolicyRestriction will have the corresponding RequiredClaims.

Use Azure Media Services APIs for configuring license/key delivery and encrypting your assets (as shown in [this sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/blob/master/AMSV3Tutorials/EncryptWithAES/Program.cs)).

For more information, see:

- [Content protection overview](content-protection-overview.md)
- [Design of a multi-DRM content protection system with access control](design-multi-drm-system-with-access-control.md)

## Media Services v2 vs v3 

### Can I use the Azure portal to manage v3 resources?

Currently, you cannot use the Azure portal to manage v3 resources. Use the [REST API](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-ref), [CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli-ref), or one of the supported [SDKs](media-services-apis-overview.md#sdks).

### Is there an AssetFile concept in v3?

The AssetFiles were removed from the AMS API in order to separate Media Services from Storage SDK dependency. Now Storage, not Media Services, keeps the information that belongs in Storage. 

For more information, see [Migrate to Media Services v3](migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md).

### Where did client-side storage encryption go?

It is now recommended to use the server-side storage encryption (which is on by default). For more information, see [Azure Storage Service Encryption for Data at Rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).
