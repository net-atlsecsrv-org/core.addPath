# Offline Widevine streaming for Android

In addition to protecting content for online streaming, media content subscription and rental services offer downloadable content that works when you are not connected to the internet. You might need to download content onto your phone or tablet for playback in airplane mode when flying disconnected from the network. Additional scenarios, in which you might want to download content:

- Some content providers may disallow DRM license delivery beyond a country/region's border. If a user wants to watch content while traveling abroad, offline download is needed.
- In some countries/regions, Internet availability and/or bandwidth is limited. Users may choose to download content to be able to watch it in high enough resolution for satisfactory viewing experience.

This article discusses how to implement offline mode playback for DASH content protected by Widevine on Android devices. Offline DRM allows you to provide subscription, rental, and purchase models for your content, enabling customers of your services to easily take content with them when disconnected from the internet.

For building the Android player apps, we outline three options:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Build a player using the Java API of ExoPlayer SDK
> * Build a player using Xamarin binding of ExoPlayer SDK
> * Build a player using Encrypted Media Extension (EME) and Media Source Extension (MSE) in Chrome mobile browser v62 or later

The article also answers some common questions related to offline streaming of Widevine protected content.

## Prerequisites 

Before implementing offline DRM for Widevine on Android devices, you should first:

- Become familiar with the concepts introduced for online content protection using Widevine DRM. This is covered in detail in the following documents/samples:
    - [Design of a multi-DRM content protection system with access control](design-multi-drm-system-with-access-control.md)
    - [Use DRM dynamic encryption and license delivery service](protect-with-drm.md)
- Clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials.git.

    You will need to modify the code in [Encrypt with DRM using .NET](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/tree/master/AMSV3Tutorials/EncryptWithDRM) to add Widevine configurations.  
- Become familiar with the Google ExoPlayer SDK for Android, an open-source video player SDK capable of supporting offline Widevine DRM playback. 
    - [ExoPlayer SDK](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)
    - [ExoPlayer Developer Guide](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/guide.html)
    - [EoPlayer Developer Blog](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer)

## Configure content protection in Azure Media Services

In the [GetOrCreateContentKeyPolicyAsync](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/blob/master/AMSV3Tutorials/EncryptWithDRM/Program.cs#L189) method, the following necessary steps are present:

1. Specify how content key delivery is authorized in the license delivery service: 

    ```csharp
    ContentKeyPolicySymmetricTokenKey primaryKey = new ContentKeyPolicySymmetricTokenKey(tokenSigningKey);
    List<ContentKeyPolicyTokenClaim> requiredClaims = new List<ContentKeyPolicyTokenClaim>()
    {
        ContentKeyPolicyTokenClaim.ContentKeyIdentifierClaim
    };
    List<ContentKeyPolicyRestrictionTokenKey> alternateKeys = null;
    ContentKeyPolicyTokenRestriction restriction 
        = new ContentKeyPolicyTokenRestriction(Issuer, Audience, primaryKey, ContentKeyPolicyRestrictionTokenType.Jwt, alternateKeys, requiredClaims);
    ```
2. Configure Widevine license template:  

    ```csharp
    ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration widevineConfig = ConfigureWidevineLicenseTempate();
    ```

3. Create ContentKeyPolicyOptions:

    ```csharp
    options.Add(
        new ContentKeyPolicyOption()
        {
            Configuration = widevineConfig,
            Restriction = restriction
        });
    ```

## Enable offline mode

To enable **offline** mode for Widevine licenses, you need to configure [Widevine license template](widevine-license-template-overview.md). In the **policy_overrides** object, set the **can_persist** property to **true** (default is false), as shown in [ConfigureWidevineLicenseTempate](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/blob/master/AMSV3Tutorials/EncryptWithDRM/Program.cs#L563). 

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/AMSV3Tutorials/EncryptWithDRM/Program.cs#ConfigureWidevineLicenseTempate)]

## Configuring the Android player for offline playback

The easiest way to develop a native player app for Android devices is to use the [Google ExoPlayer SDK](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer), an open-source video player SDK. ExoPlayer supports features not currently supported by Androidâ€™s native MediaPlayer API, including MPEG-DASH and Microsoft Smooth Streaming delivery protocols.

ExoPlayer version 2.6 and higher includes many classes that support offline Widevine DRM playback. In particular, the OfflineLicenseHelper class provides utility functions to facilitate the use of the DefaultDrmSessionManager for downloading, renewing, and releasing offline licenses. The classes provided in the SDK folder "library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/offline/" support offline video content downloading.

The following list of classes facilitates offline mode in the ExoPlayer SDK for Android:

- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/drm/OfflineLicenseHelper.java  
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/drm/DefaultDrmSession.java
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/drm/DefaultDrmSessionManager.java
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/drm/DrmSession.java
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/drm/ErrorStateDrmSession.java
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/drm/ExoMediaDrm.java
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/offline/SegmentDownloader.java
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/offline/DownloaderConstructorHelper.java 
- library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/offline/Downloader.java
- library/dash/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/source/dash/offline/DashDownloader.java 

Developers should reference the [ExoPlayer Developer Guide](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/guide.html) and the corresponding [Developer Blog](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer) during development of an application. Google has not released a fully documented reference implementation or sample code for the ExoPlayer app supporting Widevine offline at this time, so the information is limited to the developers' guide and blog. 

### Working with older Android devices

For some older Android devices, you must set values for the following **policy_overrides** properties (defined in [Widevine license template](widevine-license-template-overview.md): **rental_duration_seconds**, **playback_duration_seconds**, and **license_duration_seconds**. Alternatively, you can set them to zero, which means infinite/unlimited duration.  

The values must be set to avoid an integer overflow bug. For more explanation about the issue, see https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3150 and https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3112. <br/>If you do not set the values explicitly, very large values for  **PlaybackDurationRemaining** and **LicenseDurationRemaining** will be assigned, (for example, 9223372036854775807, which is the maximum positive value for a 64-bit integer). As a result, the Widevine license appears expired and hence the decryption will not happen. 

This issue does not occur on Android 5.0 Lollipop or later since Android 5.0 is the first Android version, which has been designed to fully support ARMv8 ([Advanced RISC Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)) and 64-bit platforms, while Android 4.4 KitKat was originally designed to support  ARMv7 and 32-bit platforms as with other older Android versions.

## Using Xamarin to build an Android playback app

You can find Xamarin bindings for ExoPlayer using the following links:

- [Xamarin bindings library for the Google ExoPlayer library](https://github.com/martijn00/ExoPlayerXamarin)
- [Xamarin bindings for ExoPlayer NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.Android.ExoPlayer/)

Also, see the following thread: [Xamarin binding](https://github.com/martijn00/ExoPlayerXamarin/pull/57). 

## Chrome player apps for Android

Starting with the release of [Chrome for Android v. 62](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/chrome-62-media-updates), persistent license in EME is supported. [Widevine L1](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/chrome-62-media-updates#widevine_l1) is now also supported in Chrome for Android. This allows you to create offline playback applications in Chrome if your end users have this (or higher) version of Chrome. 

In addition, Google has produced a Progressive Web App (PWA) sample and open-sourced it: 

- [Source code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sample-media-pwa)
- [Google hosted version](https://biograf-155113.appspot.com/ttt/episode-2/) (only works in Chrome v 62 and higher on Android devices)

If you upgrade your mobile Chrome browser to v62 (or higher) on an Android phone and test the above hosted sample app, you will see that both online streaming and offline playback work.

The above open-source PWA app is authored in Node.js. If you want to host your own version on an Ubuntu server, keep in mind the following common encountered issues that can prevent playback:

1. CORS issue: The sample video in the sample app is hosted in https://storage.googleapis.com/biograf-video-files/videos/. Google has set up CORS for all their test samples hosted in Google Cloud Storage bucket. They are served with CORS headers, specifying explicitly the CORS entry: https://biograf-155113.appspot.com (the domain in which google hosts their sample) preventing access by any other sites. If you try, you will see the following HTTP error: Failed to load https://storage.googleapis.com/biograf-video-files/videos/poly-sizzle-2015/mp4/dash.mpd: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https:\//13.85.80.81:8080' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
2. Certificate issue: Starting from Chrome v 58, EME for Widevine requires HTTPS. Therefore, you need to host the sample app over HTTPS with an X509 certificate. A usual test certificate does not work due to the following requirements: You need to obtain a certificate meeting the following minimum requirements:
    - Chrome and Firefox require SAN-Subject Alternative Name setting to exist in the certificate
    - The certificate must have trusted CA and a self-signed development certificate does not work
    - The certificate must have a CN matching the DNS name of the web server or gateway

## Frequently asked questions

### Question

How can I deliver persistent licenses (offline-enabled) for some clients/users and non-persistent licenses (offline-disabled) for others? Do I have to duplicate the content and use separate content key?

### Answer
Since Media Services v3 allows an Asset to have multiple StreamingLocators. You can have

1.	One ContentKeyPolicy with license_type = "persistent", ContentKeyPolicyRestriction with claim on "persistent", and its StreamingLocator;
2.	Another ContentKeyPolicy with license_type="nonpersistent", ContentKeyPolicyRestriction with claim on "nonpersistent", and its StreamingLocator.
3.	The two StreamingLocators have different ContentKey.

Depending on business logic of custom STS, different claims are issued in the JWT token. With the token, only the corresponding license can be obtained and only the corresponding URL can be played.

### Question

For Widevine security levels, in Googleâ€™s [Widevine DRM Architecture Overview doc](https://storage.googleapis.com/wvdocs/Widevine_DRM_Architecture_Overview.pdf) documentation,
it defines three different security levels. However, in [Azure Media Services documentation on Widevine license template](widevine-license-template-overview.md),
five different security levels are outlined. What is the relationship or mapping between the two different sets of security levels?

### Answer

In Googleâ€™s [Widevine DRM Architecture Overview](https://storage.googleapis.com/wvdocs/Widevine_DRM_Architecture_Overview.pdf),
it defines the following three security levels:

1.  Security Level 1: All content processing, cryptography, and control are performed within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). In some implementation models, security processing may be performed in different chips.
2.  Security Level 2: Performs cryptography (but not video processing) within the TEE: decrypted buffers are returned to the application domain and processed through separate video hardware or software. At level 2, however, cryptographic information is still processed only within the TEE.
3.  Security Level 3 Does not have a TEE on the device. Appropriate measures may be taken to protect the cryptographic information and decrypted content on host operating system. A Level 3 implementation may also include a hardware cryptographic engine, but that only enhances performance, not security.

At the same time, in [Azure Media Services documentation on Widevine license template](widevine-license-template-overview.md), the security_level property of content_key_specs can have the following five different values (client robustness requirements for playback):

1.  Software-based whitebox crypto is required.
2.  Software crypto and an obfuscated decoder is required.
3.  The key material and crypto operations must be performed within a hardware backed TEE.
4.  The crypto and decoding of content must be performed within a hardware backed TEE.
5.  The crypto, decoding, and all handling of the media (compressed and uncompressed) must be handled within a hardware backed TEE.

Both security levels are defined by Google Widevine. The difference is in its usage level: architecture level or API level. The five security levels are used in the Widevine API. The content_key_specs object, which
contains security_level is deserialized and passed to the Widevine global delivery service by Azure Media Services Widevine license service. The table below shows the mapping between the two sets of security levels.

| **Security Levels Defined in Widevine Architecture** |**Security Levels Used in Widevine API**|
|---|---| 
| **Security Level 1**: All content processing, cryptography, and control are performed within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). In some implementation models, security processing may be performed in different chips.|**security_level=5**: The crypto, decoding, and all handling of the media (compressed and uncompressed) must be handled within a hardware backed TEE.<br/><br/>**security_level=4**: The crypto and decoding of content must be performed within a hardware backed TEE.|
**Security Level 2**: Performs cryptography (but not video processing) within the TEE: decrypted buffers are returned to the application domain and processed through separate video hardware or software. At level 2, however, cryptographic information is still processed only within the TEE.| **security_level=3**: The key material and crypto operations must be performed within a hardware backed TEE. |
| **Security Level 3**: Does not have a TEE on the device. Appropriate measures may be taken to protect the cryptographic information and decrypted content on host operating system. A Level 3 implementation may also include a hardware cryptographic engine, but that only enhances performance, not security. | **security_level=2**: Software crypto and an obfuscated decoder are required.<br/><br/>**security_level=1**: Software-based whitebox crypto is required.|

### Question

Why does content download take so long?

### Answer

There are two ways to improve download speed:

1.  Enable CDN so that end users are more likely to hit CDN instead of origin/streaming endpoint for content download. If user hits streaming endpoint, each HLS segment or DASH fragment is dynamically packaged and encrypted. Even though this latency is in millisecond scale for each segment/fragment, when you have an hour long video, the accumulated latency can be large causing longer download.
2.  Provide end users the option to selectively download video quality layers and audio tracks instead of all contents. For offline mode, there is no point to download all of the quality layers. There are two ways to achieve this:
    1.  Client controlled: either player app auto selects or user selects video  quality layer and audio tracks to download;
    2.  Service controlled: one can use Dynamic Manifest feature in Azure Media Services to create a (global) filter, which limits HLS playlist or DASH MPD to a single video quality layer and selected audio tracks. Then the download URL presented to end users will include this filter.
