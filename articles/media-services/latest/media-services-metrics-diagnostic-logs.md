# Monitor Media Services metrics and diagnostic logs

[Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md) enables you to monitor metrics and diagnostic logs that help you understand how your applications are performing. All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types, metrics and logs. You can monitor Media Services diagnostic logs and create alerts and notifications for the collected metrics and logs. 
You can visualize and analyze the metrics data using [Metrics explorer](../../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started.md). You can send logs to [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/), stream them to [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/), and export them to [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/log-analytics/), or use 3rd party services.

For detailed overview, see [Azure Monitor Metrics](../../azure-monitor/platform/data-platform.md) and [Azure Monitor Diagnostic logs](../../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-overview.md).

This topic discusses currently available [Media Services Metrics](#media-services-metrics) and [Media Services Diagnostic logs](#media-services-diagnostic-logs).

## Media Services metrics

Metrics are collected at regular intervals whether or not the value changes. They're useful for alerting because they can be sampled frequently, and an alert can be fired quickly with relatively simple logic.

Currently, the following Media Services [Streaming Endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/streamingendpoints) metrics are emitted by Azure:

|Metric|Display name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Requests|Requests|Gives details around total # of requests serviced by the Streaming Endpoint.|
|Egress|Egress|Total number of egress bytes. For example, bytes streamed by the Streaming Endpoint.|
|SuccessE2ELatency|Success end to end Latency| Gives information about end to end latency of successful requests.|

For example, to get "Egress" metrics with CLI, you would run the following `az monitor metrics` CLI command:

```cli
az monitor metrics list --resource \
   "/subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourcegroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/<Media Services account name>/streamingendpoints/<streaming endpoint name>" \
   --metric "Egress"
```

For information on how to create metric alerts, see [Create, view, and manage metric alerts using Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric.md).

## Media Services diagnostic logs

Currently, you can get the following diagnostic logs:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Key delivery service request|Logs that show the key delivery service request information. For more details, see [schemas](media-services-diagnostic-logs-schema.md).|

To enable storage of diagnostic logs in a Storage Account, you would run the following `az monitor diagnostic-settings` CLI command: 

```cli
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic name> \
    --storage-account <name or ID of storage account> \
    --resource <target resource object ID> \
    --resource-group <storage account resource group> \
    --logs '[
    {
        "category": <category name>,
        "enabled": true,
        "retentionPolicy": {
            "days": <# days to retain>,
            "enabled": true
        }
    }]'
```

For example:

```cli
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name amsv3diagnostic \
    --storage-account storageaccountforamsv3  \
    --resource "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000/resourceGroups/amsv3ResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaservices/amsv3account" \
    --resource-group "amsv3ResourceGroup" \
    --logs '[{"category": "KeyDeliveryRequests",  "enabled": true, "retentionPolicy": {"days": 3, "enabled": true }}]'
```
