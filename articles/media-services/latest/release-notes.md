## Known issues

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to manage v3 [Live Events](live-events-outputs-concept.md), view v3 [Assets](assets-concept.md), get info about accessing APIs. For all other management tasks (for example, Transforms and Jobs), use the [REST API](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-ref), [CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli-ref), or one of the supported [SDKs](media-services-apis-overview.md#sdks).

For more information, see [Migration guidance for moving from Media Services v2 to v3](migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md#known-issues).
 
## January 2020

### Improvements in media processors

- Improved support for interlaced sources in Video Analysis – such content is now de-interlaced correctly before being sent to inference engines.
- When generating thumbnails with the “Best” mode, the encoder now searches beyond 30 seconds to select a frame that is not monochromatic.

### Azure Government cloud updates

Media Services GA’ed in the following Azure Government regions: *USGov Arizona* and *USGov Texas*.

## December 2019

Added CDN support for *Origin-Assist Prefetch* headers for both live and video on-demand streaming; available for customers who have direct contract with Akamai CDN. Origin-Assist CDN-Prefetch feature involves the following HTTP header exchanges between Akamai CDN and Azure Media Services origin:

|HTTP header|Values|Sender|Receiver|Purpose|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
|CDN-Origin-Assist-Prefetch-Enabled | 1 (default) or 0 |CDN|Origin|To indicate CDN is prefetch enabled|
|CDN-Origin-Assist-Prefetch-Path| Example: <br/>Fragments(video=1400000000,format=mpd-time-cmaf)|Origin|CDN|To provide prefetch path to CDN|
|CDN-Origin-Assist-Prefetch-Request|1 (prefetch request) or 0 (regular request)|CDN|Origin|To indicate the request from CDN is a prefetch|

To see part of the header exchange in action, you can try the following steps:

1. Use Postman or curl to issue a request to Media Services origin for an audio or video segment or fragment. Make sure to add the header CDN-Origin-Assist-Prefetch-Enabled: 1 in the request.
2. In the response, you should see the header CDN-Origin-Assist-Prefetch-Path with a relative path as its value.

## November 2019

### Live transcription Preview

Live transcription is now in public preview and available for use in the West US 2 region.

Live transcription is designed to work in conjunction with live events as an add-on capability.  It is supported on both pass-through and Standard or Premium encoding live events.  When this feature is enabled, the service uses the [Speech-To-Text](../../cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-to-text.md) feature of Cognitive Services to transcribe the spoken words in the incoming audio into text. This text is then made available for delivery along with video and audio in MPEG-DASH and HLS protocols. Billing is based on a new add-on meter that is additional cost to the live event when it is in the "Running" state.  For details on Live transcription and billing, see [Live transcription](live-transcription.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, live transcription is only available as a preview feature in the West US 2 region. It supports transcription of spoken words in English (en-us) only at this time.

### Content protection

The *Token Replay Prevention* feature released in limited regions back in September is now available in all regions.
 Media Services customers can now set a limit on the number of times the same token can be used to request a key or a license. For more information, see [Token Replay Prevention](content-protection-overview.md#token-replay-prevention).

### New recommended live encoder partners

Added support for the following new recommended partner encoders for RTMP live streaming:

- [Cambria Live 4.3](https://www.capellasystems.net/products/cambria-live/)
- [GoPro Hero7/8 and Max action cameras](https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/getting-started-with-live-streaming)
- [Restream.io](https://restream.io/)

### File Encoding enhancements

- A new Content Aware Encoding preset is now available. It produces a set of GOP-aligned MP4s by using content-aware encoding. Given any input content, the service performs an initial lightweight analysis of the input content. It uses those results to determine the optimal number of layers, appropriate bit rate, and resolution settings for delivery by adaptive streaming. This preset is particularly effective for low-complexity and medium-complexity videos, where the output files are at lower bit rates but at a quality that still delivers a good experience to viewers. The output will contain MP4 files with video and audio interleaved. For more information, see the [open API specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/stable/2018-07-01/Encoding.json).
- Improved performance and multi-threading for the re-sizer in Standard Encoder. Under specific conditions, customer should see a performance boost between 5-40% VOD encoding. Low complexity content encoded into multiple bit-rates will see the highest performance increases. 
- Standard encoding now maintains a regular GOP cadence for variable frame rate  (VFR) contents during VOD encoding when using the time-based GOP setting.  This means that customer submitting mixed frame rate content that varies between 15-30 fps for example should now see regular GOP distances calculated on output to adaptive bitrate streaming MP4 files. This will improve the ability to switch seamlessly between tracks when delivering over HLS or DASH. 
-  Improved AV sync for variable frame rate (VFR) source content

### Video Indexer, Video analytics

- Keyframes extracted using the VideoAnalyzer preset are now in the original resolution of the video instead of being resized. High resolution keyframe extraction gives you original quality images and allows you to make use of the image-based artificial intelligence models provided by the Microsoft Computer Vision and Custom Vision services to gain even more insights from your video.

## September 2019

## July 2019

### Content protection

When streaming content protected with token restriction, end users need to obtain a token that is sent as part of the key delivery request. The *Token Replay Prevention* feature allows Media Services customers to set a limit on how many times the same token can be used to request a key or a license. For more information, see [Token Replay Prevention](content-protection-overview.md#token-replay-prevention).

As of July, the preview feature was only available in US Central and US West Central.

## June 2019

### Video subclipping

You can now trim or subclip a video when encoding it using a [Job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/jobs). 

This functionality works with any [Transform](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms) that is built using either the [BuiltInStandardEncoderPreset](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#builtinstandardencoderpreset) presets, or the [StandardEncoderPreset](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#standardencoderpreset) presets. 

See examples:

* [Subclip a video with .NET](subclip-video-dotnet-howto.md)
* [Subclip a video with REST](subclip-video-rest-howto.md)

## May 2019

### Azure Monitor support for Media Services diagnostic logs and metrics

You can now use Azure Monitor to view telemetry data emitted by Media Services.

* Use the Azure Monitor diagnostic logs to monitor requests sent by the Media Services Key Delivery endpoint. 
* Monitor metrics emitted by Media Services [Streaming Endpoints](streaming-endpoint-concept.md).   

For details, see [Monitor Media Services metrics and diagnostic logs](media-services-metrics-diagnostic-logs.md).

### Multi audio tracks support in Dynamic Packaging

* The maximum file size supported for processing was updated. See, [Quotas and limits](limits-quotas-constraints.md).
* [Encoding speeds improvements](media-reserved-units-cli-how-to.md#choosing-between-different-reserved-unit-types).

## April 2019

### New presets

* [FaceDetectorPreset](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#facedetectorpreset) was added to the built-in analyzer presets.
* [ContentAwareEncodingExperimental](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#encodernamedpreset) was added to the built-in encoder presets. For more information, see [Content-aware encoding](content-aware-encoding.md). 

## March 2019

Dynamic Packaging now supports Dolby Atmos. For more information, see [Audio codecs supported by dynamic packaging](dynamic-packaging-overview.md#audio-codecs).

You can now specify a list of asset or account filters, which would apply to your Streaming Locator. For more information, see [Associate filters with Streaming Locator](filters-concept.md#associating-filters-with-streaming-locator).

## February 2019

Media Services v3 is now supported in Azure national clouds. Not all features are available in all clouds yet. For details, see [Clouds and regions in which Azure Media Services v3 exists](azure-clouds-regions.md).

[Microsoft.Media.JobOutputProgress](media-services-event-schemas.md#monitoring-job-output-progress) event was added to the Azure Event Grid schemas for Media Services.

## January 2019

### Media Encoder Standard and MPI files 

When encoding with Media Encoder Standard to produce MP4 file(s), a new .mpi file is generated and added to the output Asset. This MPI file is intended to improve performance for [dynamic packaging](dynamic-packaging-overview.md) and streaming scenarios.

You should not modify or remove the MPI file, or take any dependency in your service on the existence (or not) of such a file.

## December 2018

Updates from the GA release of the V3 API include:
       
* The **PresentationTimeRange** properties are no longer 'required' for **Asset Filters** and **Account Filters**. 
* The $top and $skip query options for **Jobs** and **Transforms** have been removed and $orderby was added. As part of adding the new ordering functionality, it was discovered that the $top and $skip options had accidentally been exposed previously even though they are not implemented.
* Enumeration extensibility was re-enabled. This feature was enabled in the preview versions of the SDK and got accidentally disabled in the GA version.
* Two predefined streaming policies have been renamed. **SecureStreaming** is now **MultiDrmCencStreaming**. **SecureStreamingWithFairPlay** is now **Predefined_MultiDrmStreaming**.

## October 2018 - GA

This section describes Azure Media Services (AMS) October updates.

### REST v3 GA release

The [REST v3 GA release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/stable/2018-07-01) includes more APIs for Live, Account/Asset level manifest filters, and DRM support.

#### Azure Resource Management 

Support for Azure Resource Management enables unified management and operations API (now everything in one place).

Starting with this release, you can use Resource Manager templates to create Live Events.

#### Improvement of Asset operations 

The following improvements were introduced:

- Ingest from HTTP(s) URLs or Azure Blob Storage SAS URLs.
- Specify you own container names for Assets. 
- Easier output support to create custom workflows with Azure Functions.

#### New Transform object

The new **Transform** object simplifies the Encoding model. The new object makes it easy to create and share encoding Resource Manager templates and presets. 

#### Azure Active Directory authentication and RBAC

Azure AD Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enable secure Transforms, LiveEvents, Content Key Policies, or Assets by Role or Users in Azure AD.

#### Client SDKs  

Languages supported in Media Services v3: .NET Core, Java, Node.js, Ruby, Typescript, Python, Go.

#### Live encoding updates

The following live encoding updates are introduced:

- New low latency mode for live (10 seconds end-to-end).
- Improved RTMP support (increased stability and more source encoder support).
- RTMPS secure ingest.

    When you create a Live Event, you now get 4 ingest URLs. The 4 ingest URLs are almost identical, have the same streaming token (AppId), only the port number part is different. Two of the URLs are primary and backup for RTMPS. 
- 24-hour transcoding support. 
- Improved ad-signaling support in RTMP via SCTE35.

#### Improved Event Grid support

You can see the following Event Grid support improvements:

- Azure Event Grid integration for easier development with Logic Apps and Azure Functions.

For new information about currently supported features, see [What is Video Indexer](../../cognitive-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-overview.md?toc=/azure/media-services/video-indexer/toc.json&bc=/azure/media-services/video-indexer/breadcrumb/toc.json). 

### Plans for changes

#### Azure CLI 2.0
 
The Azure CLI 2.0 module that includes operations on all features (including Live, Content Key Policies, Account/Asset Filters, Streaming Policies) is coming soon. 

### Known issues

Only customers that used the preview API for Asset or AccountFilters are impacted by the following issue.

If you created Assets or Account Filters between 09/28 and 10/12 with Media Services v3 CLI or APIs, you need to remove all Asset and AccountFilters and re-create them due to a version conflict. 

## May 2018 - Preview

### .NET SDK

The following features are present in the .NET SDK:

* **Transforms** and **Jobs** to encode or analyze media content. For examples, see [Stream files](stream-files-tutorial-with-api.md) and [Analyze](analyze-videos-tutorial-with-api.md).
* **Streaming Locators** for publishing and streaming content to end-user devices
* **Streaming Policies** and **Content Key Policies** to configure key delivery and content protection (DRM) when delivering content.
* **Live Events** and **Live Outputs** to configure the ingest and archiving of live streaming content.
* **Assets** to store and publish media content in Azure Storage. 
* **Streaming Endpoints** to configure and scale dynamic packaging, encryption, and streaming for both live and on-demand media content.
