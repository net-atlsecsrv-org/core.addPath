# Create clips with Azure Media Clipper 

Azure Media Clipper is a free JavaScript library that enables web developers to provide their users with an interface for creating media clips. This tool can be integrated into any web page and provides APIs for loading assets and submitting clipping jobs.

Azure Media Clipper enables you to:
- Trim the pre-slate and post-slate from live archives 
- Compose video highlights from AMS live events, live archives, or fMP4 VOD files 
- Concatenate videos from multiple sources 
- Produce summary clips from your AMS media assets 
- Clip videos with frame accuracy 
- Generate dynamic manifest filters over existing live and VOD assets with group-of-pictures (GOP) accuracy 
- Produce encoding jobs against the assets in your media services account

To request new features, provide ideas or feedback, submit to [UserVoice for Azure Media Services](https://aka.ms/amsvoice/). If you have and specific issues, questions or find any bugs, drop the Media Services team a line at amcinfo@microsoft.com.
