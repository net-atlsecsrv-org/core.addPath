# Signaling Timed Metadata in Live Streaming 

Last Updated: 2019-07-01


## 1 Introduction 

In order to facilitate the insertion of advertisements, or custom events on a client player, broadcasters often make use of timed metadata embedded within the video. To enable these scenarios, Media Services provides support for the transport of timed metadata along with the media, from the ingest point of the live streaming channel to the client application.
This specification outlines two modes that are supported by Media Services for timed metadata within live streaming signals:

1. [SCTE-35] signaling that heeds the recommended practices outlined by [SCTE-35], [SCTE-214-1], [SCTE-214-3] and [RFC8216]

2. A generic timed metadata signaling mode, for messages that are **NOT** [SCTE-35] and could carry [ID3v2] or other custom schemas

### 1.2 Conformance Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119

### 1.3 Terms Used

| Term              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ad Break          | A location or point in time where one or more ads may be scheduled for delivery; same as avail and placement opportunity. |
| Ad Decision Service| external service that decides which ad(s) and durations will be shown to the user. The services is typically provided by a partner and are out of scope for this document.|
| Cue               | Indication of time and parameters of the upcoming ad break. Note that cues can indicate a pending switch to an ad break, pending switch to the next ad within an ad break, and pending switch from an ad break to the main content. |
| Packager          | The Azure Media Services "Streaming Endpoint" provides dynamic packaging capabilities for DASH and HLS and is referred to as a "Packager" in the media industry. 
| Presentation Time | The time that an event is presented to a viewer. The  time represents the moment on the media timeline that a viewer would see the event. For example, the presentation time of a SCTE-35 splice_info() command message is the splice_time(). |
| Arrival Time      | The time that an event message arrives. The time is typically distinct from the presentation time of the event, since event messages are sent ahead of the presentation time of the event.                                     |

## 2 Timed Metadata Ingest

## 2.1 RTMP Ingest

[RTMP] supports timed metadata signals sent as [AMF0] cue messages embedded within the [RTMP] stream. The cue messages may be sent some time before the actual custom event, or [SCTE35] ad splice insertion needs to occur. To support this scenario, the actual time of the splice or segment is sent within the cue message. For more information, see [AMF0].

The following table describes the format of the AMF message payload that Media Services will ingest.

The name of the AMF message can be used to differentiate multiple event streams of the same type.  For [SCTE-35] messages, the name of the AMF message MUST be “onAdCue” as recommended in [SCTE-67].  Any fields not listed below MUST be ignored, so that innovation of this design is not inhibited in the future.

### 2.1.1 Signal Syntax

For RTMP simple mode, Media Services supports a single AMF cue message called "onAdCue" using a payload of "Simple Mode" or "SCTE-35 Mode" in compliance with  [Adobe-Primetime]:

### 2.1.2 Simple Mode

| Field Name | Field Type | Required? | Descriptions                                                                                                             |
|------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cue        | String     | Required | The event message.  Shall be "SpliceOut" to designate a simple mode splice.                                              |
| id         | String     | Required | A unique identifier describing the splice or segment. Identifies this instance of the message                            |
| duration   | Number     | Required | The duration of the splice. Units are fractional seconds.                                                                |
| elapsed    | Number     | Optional | When the signal is being repeated in order to support tune in, this field shall be the amount of presentation time that has elapsed since the splice began. Units are fractional seconds. When using simple mode, this value should not exceed the original duration of the splice.                                                  |
| time       | Number     | Required | Shall be the time of the splice, in presentation time. Units are fractional seconds.                                     |

---

### 2.1.3 SCTE-35 Mode

| Field Name | Field Type | Required? | Descriptions                                                                                                             |
|------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cue        | String     | Required | The event message.  For [SCTE-35] messages, this MUST be the base64-encoded [RFC4648] binary splice_info_section() in order for messages to be sent to HLS, Smooth, and Dash clients.                                              |
| type       | String     | Required | A URN or URL identifying the message scheme. For [SCTE-35] messages, this **SHOULD** be **"scte35"** in order for messages to be sent to HLS, Smooth, and Dash clients, in compliance with [Adobe-Primetime]. Optionally, the URN "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin" may also be used to signal a [SCTE-35] message. |
| id         | String     | Required | A unique identifier describing the splice or segment. Identifies this instance of the message.  Messages with equivalent semantics shall have the same value.|
| duration   | Number     | Required | The duration of the event or ad splice-segment, if known. If unknown, the value **SHOULD** be 0.                                                                 |
| elapsed    | Number     | Optional | When the [SCTE-35] ad signal is being repeated in order to tune in, this field shall be the amount of presentation time that has elapsed since the splice began. Units are fractional seconds. In [SCTE-35] mode, this value may exceed the original specified duration of the splice or segment.                                                  |
| time       | Number     | Required | The presentation time of the event or ad splice.  The presentation time and duration **SHOULD** align with Stream Access Points (SAP) of type 1 or 2, as defined in [ISO-14496-12] Annex I. For HLS egress, time and duration **SHOULD** align with segment boundaries. The presentation time and duration of different event messages within the same event stream MUST not overlap. Units are fractional seconds.

---

#### 2.1.1 Cancellation and Updates

Messages can be canceled or updated by sending multiple messages with the same
presentation time and ID. The presentation time and ID uniquely identify the
event, and the last message received for a specific presentation time that meets
pre-roll constraints is the message that is acted upon. The updated event replaces any
previously received messages. The pre-roll constraint is four seconds. Messages
received at least four seconds prior to the presentation time will be acted upon.

## 2.2 Fragmented MP4 Ingest (Smooth Streaming)

Refer to [MS-SSTR-Ingest] for requirements on live stream ingest. The following sections provide details regarding ingest of timed presentation metadata.  Timed presentation metadata is ingested as a sparse track, which is defined in both the Live Server Manifest Box (see MS-SSTR) and the Movie Box (‘moov’).  Each sparse fragment consists of a Movie Fragment Box (‘moof’) and Media Data Box (‘mdat’), where the ‘mdat’ box is the binary message.

#### 2.2.1 Live Server Manifest Box

The sparse track **MUST** be declared in the Live Server Manifest box with a
**\<textstream\>** entry and it **MUST** have the following attributes set:

| **Attribute Name** | **Field Type** | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|----------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| duration       | 64-bit unsigned integer | Required      | **SHOULD** be 0, since the track box has zero samples and the total duration of the samples in the track box is 0. |

---

The ‘moov’ box **SHOULD** contain a **HandlerBox (‘hdlr’)** as defined in
[ISO-14496-12] with the following constraints:

| **Field Name** | **Field Type**          | **Required?** | **Description**   |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| handler_type   | 32-bit unsigned integer | Required      | **SHOULD** be ‘meta’. |

---

The ‘stsd’ box **SHOULD** contain a MetaDataSampleEntry box with a coding name as defined in [ISO-14496-12].  For example, for SCTE-35 messages the coding name **SHOULD** be 'scte'.

### 2.2.3 Movie Fragment Box and Media Data Box

Sparse track fragments consist of a Movie Fragment Box (‘moof’) and a Media Data
Box (‘mdat’).

The MovieFragmentBox (‘moof’) box **MUST** contain a
**TrackFragmentExtendedHeaderBox (‘uuid’)** box as defined in [MS-SSTR] with the
following fields:

| **Field Name**         | **Field Type**          | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fragment_absolute_time | 64-bit unsigned integer | Required      | **MUST** be the arrival time of the event. This value aligns the message with the parent track.   |
| fragment_duration      | 64-bit unsigned integer | Required      | **MUST** be the duration of the event. The duration can be zero to indicate that the duration is unknown. |

---


The MediaDataBox (‘mdat’) box **MUST** have the following format:

| **Field Name**          | **Field Type**                   | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| version                 | 32-bit unsigned integer (uimsbf) | Required      | Determines the format of the contents of the ‘mdat’ box. Unrecognized versions will be ignored. Currently the only supported version is 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| id                      | 32-bit unsigned integer (uimsbf) | Required      | Identifies this instance of the message. Messages with equivalent semantics shall have the same value; that is, processing any one event message box with the same id is sufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| presentation_time_delta | 32-bit unsigned integer (uimsbf) | Required      | The sum of the fragment_absolute_time, specified in the TrackFragmentExtendedHeaderBox, and the presentation_time_delta **MUST** be the presentation time of the event. The presentation time and duration **SHOULD** align with Stream Access Points (SAP) of type 1 or 2, as defined in [ISO-14496-12] Annex I. For HLS egress, time and duration **SHOULD** align with segment boundaries. The presentation time and duration of different event messages within the same event stream **MUST** not overlap. |
| message                 | byte array                       | Required      | The event message. For [SCTE-35] messages, the message is the binary splice_info_section(). For [SCTE-35] messages, this **MUST** be the splice_info_section() in order for messages to be sent to HLS, Smooth, and Dash clients in compliance with [SCTE-35]. For [SCTE-35] messages, the binary splice_info_section() is the payload of the ‘mdat’ box, and it is **NOT** base64 encoded.                                                            |

---


### 2.2.4 Cancellation and Updates

Messages can be canceled or updated by sending multiple messages with the same presentation time and ID.  The presentation time and ID uniquely identify the event. The last message received for a specific presentation time, that meets pre-roll constraints, is the message that is acted upon. The updated message replaces any previously received messages.  The pre-roll constraint is four seconds. Messages received at least four seconds prior to the presentation time will be acted upon. 


## 3 Timed Metadata Delivery

Event stream data is opaque to Media Services. Media Services merely
passes three pieces of information between the ingest endpoint and the client
endpoint. The following properties are delivered to the client, in compliance
with [SCTE-35] and/or the client’s streaming protocol:

1.  Scheme – a URN or URL identifying the scheme of the message.
2.  Presentation Time – the presentation time of the event on the media
    timeline.
3.  Duration – the duration of the event.
4.  ID – an optional unique identifier for the event.
5.  Message – the event data.

## 3.1 Smooth Streaming Manifest Delivery  

Refer to sparse track handling [MS-SSTR] for details on how to format a sparse message track.
For [SCTE35] messages, Smooth Streaming will output the base64-encoded splice_info_section() into a sparse fragment.
The StreamIndex **MUST** have a Subtype of "DATA", and the CustomAttributes **MUST** contain an Attribute with Name="Schema" and Value="urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".

## 3.2 Apple HLS (RFC-8216) manifest output using EXT-X-DATERANGE

The Apple HTTP Live Streaming [RFC8216] specification allows for signaling of [SCTE-35] messages. The messages are inserted into the segment playlist in an EXT-X-DATERANGE tag per [RFC8216] section titled "Mapping SCTE-35 into EXT-X-DATERANGE".  The client application layer can parse the M3U playlist and process M3U tags, or receive the events through the Apple player framework.  

The **RECOMMENDED** approach in Azure Media Services (version 3 API only) is to follow [RFC8216] and output the EXT-X_DATERANGE tag using the SCTE35 attributes.

### 3.2.1 "Legacy" mode for HLS signaling using the Adobe Primetime EXT-X-CUE tag

There is also a "legacy" implementation provided in Azure Media Services (version 2 and 3 API) that uses the EXT-X-CUE tag as defined in [Adobe-Primetime] "SCTE-35 Mode". In this mode, Azure Media Services will embed base64-encoded [SCTE-35] splice_info_section() in the EXT-X-CUE tag.  

The "legacy" EXT-X-CUE tag is defines as below and also can be normative referenced in the [Adobe-Primetime] specification. This should only be used for legacy SCTE35 signaling where needed, otherwise the recommended tag is defined in [RFC8216] as EXT-X_DATERANGE. 

| **Attribute Name** | **Type**                      | **Required?**                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

For [SCTE-35] messages, the type takes the special value “scte35”.                                                                                                                                |
| ID                 | quoted string                 | Required                                  | A unique identifier for the event. If the ID is not specified when the message is ingested, Azure Media Services will generate a unique id.                                                                                                                                          |
| DURATION           | decimal floating point number | Required                                  | The duration of the event. If unknown, the value **SHOULD** be 0. Units are factional seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ELAPSED            | decimal floating point number | Optional, but Required for sliding window | When the signal is being repeated to support a sliding presentation window, this field **MUST** be the amount of presentation time that has elapsed since the event began. Units are fractional seconds. This value may exceed the original specified duration of the splice or segment. |
| TIME               | decimal floating point number | Required                                  | The presentation time of the event. Units are fractional seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |


The HLS player application layer will use the TYPE to identify the format of the message, decode the message, apply the necessary time conversions, and process the event.  The events are time synchronized in the segment playlist of the parent track, according to the event timestamp.  They are inserted before the nearest segment (#EXTINF tag).

#### HLS Message Handling for "Legacy" Adobe Primetime EXT-X-CUE signaling

Events are signaled in the segment playlist of each video and audio track. The
position of the EXT-X-CUE tag **MUST** always be either immediately before the first
HLS segment (for splice out or segment start) or immediately after the last HLS
segment (for splice in or segment end) to which its TIME and DURATION
attributes refer, as required by [Adobe-Primetime].

When a sliding presentation window is enabled, the EXT-X-CUE tag **MUST** be
repeated often enough that the splice or segment is always fully described in
the segment playlist, and the ELAPSED attribute **MUST** be used to indicate the
amount of time the splice or segment has been active, as required by [Adobe-Primetime].

When a sliding presentation window is enabled, the EXT-X-CUE tags are removed
from the segment playlist when the media time that they refer to has rolled out
of the sliding presentation window.

## 3.3	DASH MPD manifest output

[MPEGDASH] provides three ways to signal events:

1.  Events signaled in the MPD
2.  Events signaled in-band in the Representation (using Event Message Box
    (‘emsg’)
3.  A combination of both 1 and 2

Events signaled in the MPD are useful for VOD streaming because clients have
access to all the events, immediately when the MPD is downloaded. The in-band
solution is useful for live streaming because clients do not need to download the MPD again. For time-based segmentation, the client determines the URL for the next segment by adding the duration and timestamp of the current segment. If that request fails, the client assumes a discontinuity and downloads the MPD, but otherwise continues streaming without downloading the MPD.

Azure Media Services will do both signaling in the MPD and in-band signaling using the Event Message Box ('emsg').

Cue messages ingested over [RTMP] or [MS-SSTR-Ingest] are mapped into DASH events, using in-band 'emsg' boxes and/or in-MPD events
In-band SCTE-35 signaling for DASH follows the definition and requirements defined in [SCTE-214-3] and also in [DASH-IF-IOP] section 13.12.2 ('SCTE35 Events').

For in-band [SCTE-35] carriage, signals **MUST** use the schemeId = "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".
For MPD carriage, the schemeId uses "urn:scte:scte35:2014:xml+bin".  

Normative definitions of carriage of [SCTE-35] cue messages are in [SCTE-214-1] sec 6.7.4 (MPD) and [SCTE-214-3] sec 7.3.2 (Carriage of SCTE 35 cue messages).

Events will be signaled in the MPD using the EventStream element, which appears
within the Period element. The schemeId used is "urn:scte:scte35:2014:xml+bin".

>[!NOTE]
> For brevity purposes [SCTE-35] allows use of the base64-encoded section in Signal.Binary element (rather than the
> Signal.SpliceInfoSection element) as an alternative to
> carriage of a completely parsed cue message.
> Azure Media Services uses this 'xml+bin' approach to signaling in the MPD manifest.
> This is also the recommended method used in the [DASH-IF-IOP] - see section titled ['Ad insertion event streams' of the DASH IF IOP guideline](https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/DASH-IF-IOP/master/DASH-IF-IOP.html#ads-insertion-event-streams)
> 

The EventStream element has the following attributes:

| **Attribute Name** | **Type**                | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| scheme_id_uri      | string                  | Required      | Identifies the scheme of the message. The scheme is set to the value of the Scheme attribute in the Live Server Manifest box. The value **SHOULD** be a URN or URL identifying the message scheme; The supported output schemeId should be "urn:scte:scte35:2014:xml+bin" per [SCTE-214-1] sec 6.7.4 (MPD), as the service supports only "xml+bin" at this time for brevity in the MPD.  |
| value              | string                  | Optional      | An additional string value used by the owners of the scheme to customize the semantics of the message. In order to differentiate multiple event streams with the same scheme, the value **MUST** be set to the name of the event stream (trackName for [MS-SSTR-Ingest] or AMF message name for [RTMP] ingest). |
| Timescale          | 32-bit unsigned integer | Required      | The timescale, in ticks per second, of the times and duration fields within the ‘emsg’ box.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

                                                         |

### 4.3.1 MPEG DASH In-band Event Message Box Signaling

An in-band event stream requires the MPD to have an InbandEventStream element at the Adaptation Set level.  This element has a mandatory schemeIdUri attribute and optional timescale attribute, which also appear in the Event Message Box (‘emsg’).  Event message boxes with scheme identifiers that are not defined in the MPD **SHOULD** not be present.

For in-band [SCTE-35] carriage, signals **MUST** use the schemeId = "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".
Normative definitions of carriage of [SCTE-35] in-band messages are defined in [SCTE-214-3] sec 7.3.2 (Carriage of SCTE 35 cue messages).

The following details outline the specific values the client should expect in the 'emsg' in compliance with [SCTE-214-3]:

| **Field Name**          | **Field Type**          | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| scheme_id_uri           | string                  | Required      | Identifies the scheme of the message. The scheme is set to the value of the Scheme attribute in the Live Server Manifest box. The value **MUST** be a URN identifying the message scheme. For [SCTE-35] messages, this **MUST** be “urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin” in compliance with [SCTE-214-3] |
| Value                   | string                  | Required      | An additional string value used by the owners of the scheme to customize the semantics of the message. In order to differentiate multiple event streams with the same scheme, the value will be set to the name of the event stream (trackName for Smooth ingest or AMF message name for RTMP ingest).                                                                  |
| Timescale               | 32-bit unsigned integer | Required      | The timescale, in ticks per second, of the times and duration fields within the ‘emsg’ box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Presentation_time_delta | 32-bit unsigned integer | Required      | The media presentation time delta of the presentation time of the event and the earliest presentation time in this segment. The presentation time and duration **SHOULD** align with Stream Access Points (SAP) of type 1 or 2, as defined in [ISO-14496-12] Annex I.                                                                                            |
| event_duration          | 32-bit unsigned integer | Required      | The duration of the event, or 0xFFFFFFFF to indicate an unknown duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Id                      | 32-bit unsigned integer | Required      | Identifies this instance of the message. Messages with equivalent semantics shall have the same value. If the ID is not specified when the message is ingested, Azure Media Services will generate a unique id.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Message_data            | byte array              | Required      | The event message. For [SCTE-35] messages, the message data is the binary splice_info_section() in compliance with [SCTE-214-3] |

### 3.3.2 DASH Message Handling

Events are signaled in-band, within the ‘emsg’ box, for both video and audio tracks.  The signaling occurs for all segment requests for which the presentation_time_delta is 15 seconds or less. 

When a sliding presentation window is enabled, event messages are removed from the MPD when the sum of the time and duration of the event message is less than the time of the media data in the manifest.  In other words, the event messages are removed from the manifest when the media time to which they refer has rolled out of the sliding presentation window.

## 4 SCTE-35 Ingest

[SCTE-35] messages are ingested in binary format using the Scheme
**“urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin”** for [MS-SSTR-Ingest] and the type **“scte35”** for
[RTMP] ingest. To facilitate the conversion of [SCTE-35] timing, which is based on
MPEG-2 transport stream presentation time stamps (PTS), a mapping between PTS
(pts_time + pts_adjustment of the splice_time()) and the media timeline is
provided by the event presentation time (the fragment_absolute_time field for
Smooth ingest and the time field for RTMP ingest). The mapping is necessary because the
33-bit PTS value rolls over approximately every 26.5 hours.

Smooth Streaming ingest [MS-SSTR-Ingest] requires that the Media Data Box (‘mdat’) **MUST** contain the
**splice_info_section()** defined in [SCTE-35]. 

For RTMP ingest,the cue attribute of the AMF message is set to the base64-encoded
**splice_info_section()**defined in [SCTE-35].  

When the messages have the format described above, they are sent to HLS, Smooth, and DASH clients as defined above.
