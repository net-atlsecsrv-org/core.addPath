# Azure Media Services overview 

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Media Services that you are using:"]
> * [Version 3](../latest/media-services-overview.md)
> * [Version 2](media-services-overview.md)

> [!NOTE]
> No new features are being added to Media Services v2. <br/>Check out the latest version, [Media Services v3](../latest/index.yml). Also, see [migration guidance from v2 to v3](../latest/migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md)

Microsoft Azure Media Services (AMS) is an extensible cloud-based platform that enables developers to build scalable media management and delivery applications. Media Services is based on REST APIs that enable you to securely upload, store, encode, and package video or audio content for both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (for example, TV, PC, and mobile devices).

You can build end-to-end workflows using entirely Media Services. You can also choose to use third-party components for some parts of your workflow. For example, encode using a third-party encoder. Then, upload, protect, package, deliver using Media Services. You can choose to stream your content live or deliver content on-demand. 


## Compliance, Privacy and Security

As an important reminder, you must comply with all applicable laws in your use of Azure Media Services, and you may not use Media Services or any Azure service in a manner that violates the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others.

Before uploading any video/image to Media Services, You must have all the proper rights to use the video/image, including, where required by law, all the necessary consents from individuals (if any) in the video/image, for the use, processing, and storage of their data in Media Services and Azure. Some jurisdictions may impose special legal requirements for the collection, online processing and storage of certain categories of data, such as biometric data. Before using Media Services and Azure for the processing and storage of any data subject to special legal requirements, You must ensure compliance with any such legal requirements that may apply to You.

To learn about compliance, privacy and security in Media Services please visit the Microsoft [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/?rtc=1). For Microsoft’s privacy obligations, data handling and retention practices, including how to delete your data, please review Microsoft’s [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/PrivacyStatement), the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1) (“OST”) and [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=67) (“DPA”).

## Prerequisites

To start using Azure Media Services, you should have the following:

* An Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com).
* An Azure Media Services account. For more information, see [Create Account](media-services-portal-create-account.md).
* (Optional) Set up development environment. Choose .NET or REST API for your development environment. For more information, see [Set up environment](media-services-dotnet-how-to-use.md).

	Also, learn how to [connect  programmatically to AMS API](media-services-use-aad-auth-to-access-ams-api.md).
* A standard or premium streaming endpoint in started state.  For more information, see [Managing streaming endpoints](media-services-portal-manage-streaming-endpoints.md)

## SDKs and tools

To build Media Services solutions, you can use:

* [Media Services REST API](/rest/api/media/operations/azure-media-services-rest-api-reference)
* One of the available client SDKs:
	* Azure Media Services SDK for .NET
	
		* [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/windowsazure.mediaservices/)
		* [GitHub source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-media-services)
	* [Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java),
	* [Azure PHP SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-php),
	* [Azure Media Services for Node.js](https://github.com/michelle-becker/node-ams-sdk/blob/master/lib/request.js) (This is a non-Microsoft version of a Node.js SDK. It is maintained by a community and currently does not have a 100% coverage of the AMS APIs).
* Existing tools:
	* [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
	* [Azure-Media-Services-Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer) (Azure Media Services Explorer (AMSE) is a Winforms/C# application for Windows)

> [!NOTE]
> To get the latest version of Java SDK and get started developing with Java, see [Get started with the Java client SDK for Media Services](./media-services-java-how-to-use.md). <br/>
> To download the latest PHP SDK for Media Services, look for version 0.5.7 of the Microsoft/WindowAzure package in the [Packagist repository](https://packagist.org/packages/microsoft/windowsazure#v0.5.7).
