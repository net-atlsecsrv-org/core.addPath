# Monitor Job Progress using .NET

[!INCLUDE [media services api v2 logo](./includes/v2-hr.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> No new features or functionality are being added to Media Services v2. <br/>Check out the latest version, [Media Services v3](../latest/index.yml). Also, see [migration guidance from v2 to v3](../latest/migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md)

When you run jobs, you often require a way to track job progress. You can check the progress by defining a StateChanged event handler (as described in this topic) or using Azure Queue storage to monitor Media Services job notifications (as described in [this](media-services-dotnet-check-job-progress-with-queues.md) topic).

## Define StateChanged event handler to monitor job progress

The following code example defines the StateChanged event handler. This event handler tracks job progress and provides updated status, depending on the state. The code also defines the LogJobStop method. This helper method logs error details.

```csharp
    private static void StateChanged(object sender, JobStateChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Job state changed event:");
        Console.WriteLine("  Previous state: " + e.PreviousState);
        Console.WriteLine("  Current state: " + e.CurrentState);

        switch (e.CurrentState)
        {
            case JobState.Finished:
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine("********************");
                Console.WriteLine("Job is finished.");
                Console.WriteLine("Please wait while local tasks or downloads complete...");
                Console.WriteLine("********************");
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine();
                break;
            case JobState.Canceling:
            case JobState.Queued:
            case JobState.Scheduled:
            case JobState.Processing:
                Console.WriteLine("Please wait...\n");
                break;
            case JobState.Canceled:
            case JobState.Error:
                // Cast sender as a job.
                IJob job = (IJob)sender;
                // Display or log error details as needed.
                LogJobStop(job.Id);
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }

    private static void LogJobStop(string jobId)
    {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        IJob job = GetJob(jobId);

        builder.AppendLine("\nThe job stopped due to cancellation or an error.");
        builder.AppendLine("***************************");
        builder.AppendLine("Job ID: " + job.Id);
        builder.AppendLine("Job Name: " + job.Name);
        builder.AppendLine("Job State: " + job.State.ToString());
        builder.AppendLine("Job started (server UTC time): " + job.StartTime.ToString());
        builder.AppendLine("Media Services account name: " + _accountName);
        builder.AppendLine("Media Services account location: " + _accountLocation);
        // Log job errors if they exist.  
        if (job.State == JobState.Error)
        {
            builder.Append("Error Details: \n");
            foreach (ITask task in job.Tasks)
            {
                foreach (ErrorDetail detail in task.ErrorDetails)
                {
                    builder.AppendLine("  Task Id: " + task.Id);
                    builder.AppendLine("    Error Code: " + detail.Code);
                    builder.AppendLine("    Error Message: " + detail.Message + "\n");
                }
            }
        }
        builder.AppendLine("***************************\n");
        // Write the output to a local file and to the console. The template 
        // for an error output file is:  JobStop-{JobId}.txt
        string outputFile = _outputFilesFolder + @"\JobStop-" + JobIdAsFileName(job.Id) + ".txt";
        WriteToFile(outputFile, builder.ToString());
        Console.Write(builder.ToString());
    }

    private static string JobIdAsFileName(string jobID)
    {
        return jobID.Replace(":", "_");
    }
```
