# Playing your content with existing players
Azure Media Services supports many popular streaming formats, such as Smooth Streaming, HTTP Live Streaming, and MPEG-Dash. This topic points you to existing players that you can use to test your streams.

### The Azure portal Media Services content player
The **Azure** portal provides a content player that you can use to test your video.

Click on the desired video (make sure it was [published](media-services-portal-publish.md)) and click the **Play** button at the bottom of the portal.

Some considerations apply:

* The **MEDIA SERVICES CONTENT PLAYER** plays from the default streaming endpoint. If you want to play from a non-default streaming endpoint, use another player. For example, [Azure Media Player](https://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/azuremediaplayer.html).
