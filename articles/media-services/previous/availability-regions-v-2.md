Microsoft Azure Media Services (AMS) enables you to securely upload, store, encode, and package video or audio content for both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (for example, TV, PC, and mobile devices).

AMS operates in multiple regions around the world, giving you flexibility in choosing where to build your applications. This article is an overview of Microsoft Azure Media Services features and service regional availability.

For more information about the entire Azure global infrastructure, see [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/).
