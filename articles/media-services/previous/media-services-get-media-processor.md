# How to: Get a Media Processor instance

## Overview
In Media Services a media processor is a component that handles a specific processing task, such as encoding, format conversion, encrypting, or decrypting media content. You typically create a media processor when you are creating a task to encode, encrypt, or convert the format of media content.

## Azure media processors 

The following topic provides lists of media processors:

* [Encoding media processors](scenarios-and-availability.md#encoding-media-processors)
* [Analytics media processors](scenarios-and-availability.md#analytics-media-processors)

## Get Media Processor

The following method shows how to get a media processor instance. The code example assumes the use of a module-level variable named **_context** to reference the server context as described in the section [How to: Connect to Media Services Programmatically](media-services-use-aad-auth-to-access-ams-api.md).

```csharp
private static IMediaProcessor GetLatestMediaProcessorByName(string mediaProcessorName)
{
    var processor = _context.MediaProcessors.Where(p => p.Name == mediaProcessorName).
    ToList().OrderBy(p => new Version(p.Version)).LastOrDefault();

    if (processor == null)
    throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Unknown media processor", mediaProcessorName));

    return processor;
}
```
