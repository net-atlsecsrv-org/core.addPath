# Monitor encoding job progress with the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [media services api v2 logo](./includes/v2-hr.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> No new features or functionality are being added to Media Services v2. <br/>Check out the latest version, [Media Services v3](../latest/index.yml). Also, see [migration guidance from v2 to v3](../latest/migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md)

## Overview

When you run jobs, you often require a way to track job progress. 

To monitor the progress of the encoding job, click **Settings** (at the top of the page) and then select **Jobs**.
