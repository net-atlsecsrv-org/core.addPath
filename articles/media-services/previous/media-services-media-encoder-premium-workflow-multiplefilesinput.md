# Using multiple input files and component properties with Premium Encoder
## Overview
There are scenarios in which you might need to customize component properties, specify Clip List XML content, or send multiple input files when you submit a task with the **Media Encoder Premium Workflow** media processor. Some examples are:

* Overlaying text on video and setting the text value (for example, the current date) at runtime for each input video.
* Customizing the Clip List XML (to specify one or several source files, with or without trimming, etc.).
* Overlaying a logo image on the input video while the video is encoded.
* Multiple audio language encoding.

To let the **Media Encoder Premium Workflow** know that you are changing some properties in the workflow when you create the task or send multiple input files, you have to use a configuration string that contains **setRuntimeProperties** and/or **transcodeSource**. This topic explains how to use them.

## Configuration string syntax
The configuration string to set in the encoding task uses an XML document that looks like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<transcodeRequest>
  <transcodeSource>
  </transcodeSource>
  <setRuntimeProperties>
    <property propertyPath="Media File Input/filename" value="VideoFileName.mp4" />
  </setRuntimeProperties>
</transcodeRequest>
```

The following is the C# code that reads the XML configuration from a file, update it with the right video filename and passes it to the task in a job:

```csharp
string premiumConfiguration = ReadAllText(@"D:\home\site\wwwroot\Presets\SetRuntime.xml").Replace("VideoFileName", myVideoFileName);

// Declare a new job.
IJob job = _context.Jobs.Create("Premium Workflow encoding job");

// Get a media processor reference, and pass to it the name of the 
// processor to use for the specific task.
IMediaProcessor processor = GetLatestMediaProcessorByName("Media Encoder Premium Workflow");

// Create a task with the encoding details, using a string preset.
ITask task = job.Tasks.AddNew("Premium Workflow encoding task",
                              processor,
                              premiumConfiguration,
                              TaskOptions.None);

// Specify the input assets
task.InputAssets.Add(workflow); // workflow asset
task.InputAssets.Add(video); // video asset with multiple files

// Add an output asset to contain the results of the job. 
// This output is specified as AssetCreationOptions.None, which 
// means the output asset is not encrypted. 
task.OutputAssets.AddNew("Output asset", AssetCreationOptions.None);
```

## Customizing component properties
### Property with a simple value
In some cases, it is useful to customize a component property together with the workflow file that is going to be executed by Media Encoder Premium Workflow.

Suppose you designed a workflow that overlays text on your videos, and the text (for example, the current date) is supposed to be set at runtime. You can do this by sending the text to be set as the new value for the text property of the overlay component from the encoding task. You can use this mechanism to change other properties of a component in the workflow (such as the position or color of the overlay, the bitrate of the AVC encoder, etc.).

**setRuntimeProperties** is used to override a property in the components of the workflow.

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input/filename" value="MyInputVideo.mp4" />
      <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="MyInputVideo.mp4" />
      <property propertyPath="Optional Text Overlay/Text To Image Converter/text" value="Today is Friday the 13th of May, 2016"/>
  </setRuntimeProperties>
</transcodeRequest>
```

### Property with an XML value
To set a property that expects an XML value, encapsulate by using `<![CDATA[ and ]]>`.

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="start.mxf" />
      <property propertyPath="/inactiveTimeout" value="65" />
      <property propertyPath="clipListXml" value="xxx">
      <extendedValue><![CDATA[<clipList>
        <clip>
          <videoSource>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>start.mxf</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </videoSource>
          <audioSource>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>start.mxf</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </audioSource>
        </clip>
        <primaryClipIndex>0</primaryClipIndex>
        </clipList>]]>
      </extendedValue>
      </property>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input Logo/filename" value="logo.png" />
    </setRuntimeProperties>
  </transcodeRequest>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure not to put a carriage return just after `<![CDATA[`.

### propertyPath value
In the previous examples, the propertyPath was "/Media File Input/filename" or "/inactiveTimeout" or "clipListXml".
This is, in general, the name of the component, then the name of the property. The path can have more or fewer levels, like "/primarySourceFile" (because the property is at the root of the workflow) or "/Video Processing/Graphic Overlay/Opacity" (because the Overlay is in a group).    

To check the path and property name, use the action button that is immediately beside each property. You can click this action button and select **Edit**. This will show you the actual name of the property, and immediately above it, the namespace.

![Action/Edit](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture6_actionedit.png)

![Property](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture7_viewproperty.png)

## Multiple input files
Each task that you submit to the **Media Encoder Premium Workflow** requires two assets:

* The first one is a *Workflow Asset* that contains a workflow file. You can design workflow files by using the [Workflow Designer](media-services-workflow-designer.md).
* The second one is a *Media Asset* that contains the media file(s) that you want to encode.

When you're sending multiple media files to the **Media Encoder Premium Workflow** encoder, the following constraints apply:

* All the media files must be in the same *Media Asset*. Using multiple Media Assets is not supported.
* You must set the primary file in this Media Asset (ideally, this is the main video file that the encoder is asked to process).
* It is necessary to pass configuration data that includes the **setRuntimeProperties** and/or **transcodeSource** element to the processor.
  * **setRuntimeProperties** is used to override the filename property or another property in the components of the workflow.
  * **transcodeSource** is used to specify the Clip List XML content.

Connections in the workflow:

* If you use one or several Media File Input components and plan to use **setRuntimeProperties** to specify the file name, then do not connect the primary file component pin to them. Make sure that there is no connection between the primary file object and the Media File Input(s).
* If you prefer to use Clip List XML and one Media Source component, then you can connect both together.

![No connection from Primary Source File to Media File Input](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture0_nopin.png)

*There is no connection from the primary file to Media File Input component(s) if you use setRuntimeProperties to set the filename property.*

![Connection from Clip List XML to Clip List Source](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture1_pincliplist.png)

*You can connect Clip List XML to Media Source and use transcodeSource.*

### Clip List XML customization
You can specify the Clip List XML in the workflow at runtime by using **transcodeSource** in the configuration string XML. This requires the Clip List XML pin to be connected to the Media Source component in the workflow.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <transcodeSource>
      <clipList>
        <clip>
          <videoSource>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>video-part1.mp4</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </videoSource>
          <audioSource>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>video-part1.mp4</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </audioSource>
        </clip>
        <primaryClipIndex>0</primaryClipIndex>
      </clipList>
    </transcodeSource>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input Logo/filename" value="logo.png" />
    </setRuntimeProperties>
  </transcodeRequest>
```

If you want to specify /primarySourceFile to use this property to name the output files by using 'Expressions', then we recommend passing the Clip List XML as a property *after* the /primarySourceFile property, to avoid having the Clip List be overridden by the /primarySourceFile setting.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="c:\temp\start.mxf" />
      <property propertyPath="/inactiveTimeout" value="65" />
      <property propertyPath="clipListXml" value="xxx">
      <extendedValue><![CDATA[<clipList>
        <clip>
          <videoSource>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>c:\temp\start.mxf</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </videoSource>
          <audioSource>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>c:\temp\start.mxf</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </audioSource>
        </clip>
        <primaryClipIndex>0</primaryClipIndex>
        </clipList>]]>
      </extendedValue>
      </property>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input Logo/filename" value="logo.png" />
    </setRuntimeProperties>
  </transcodeRequest>
```

With additional frame-accurate trimming:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="start.mxf" />
      <property propertyPath="/inactiveTimeout" value="65" />
      <property propertyPath="clipListXml" value="xxx">
      <extendedValue><![CDATA[<clipList>
        <clip>
          <videoSource>
            <trim>
              <inPoint fps="25">00:00:05:24</inPoint>
              <outPoint fps="25">00:00:10:24</outPoint>
            </trim>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>start.mxf</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </videoSource>
          <audioSource>
            <trim>
              <inPoint fps="25">00:00:05:24</inPoint>
              <outPoint fps="25">00:00:10:24</outPoint>
            </trim>
            <mediaFile>
              <file>start.mxf</file>
            </mediaFile>
          </audioSource>
        </clip>
        <primaryClipIndex>0</primaryClipIndex>
        </clipList>]]>
      </extendedValue>
      </property>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input Logo/filename" value="logo.png" />
    </setRuntimeProperties>
  </transcodeRequest>
```

## Example 1 : Overlay an image on top of the video

### Presentation
Consider an example in which you want to overlay a logo image on the input video while the video is encoded. In this example, the input video is named "Microsoft_HoloLens_Possibilities_816p24.mp4" and the logo is named "logo.png". You should perform the following steps:

* Create a Workflow Asset with the workflow file (see the following example).
* Create a Media Asset, which contains two files: MyInputVideo.mp4 as the primary file and MyLogo.png.
* Send a task to the Media Encoder Premium Workflow media processor with the above input assets and specify the following configuration string.

Configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input/filename" value="Microsoft_HoloLens_Possibilities_816p24.mp4" />
      <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="Microsoft_HoloLens_Possibilities_816p24.mp4" />
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input Logo/filename" value="logo.png" />
    </setRuntimeProperties>
  </transcodeRequest>
```

In the example above, the name of the video file is sent to the Media File Input component and the primarySourceFile property. The name of the logo file is sent to another Media File Input that is connected to the graphic overlay component.

> [!NOTE]
> The video file name is sent to the primarySourceFile property. The reason for this is to use this property in the workflow for building the correct output file name using Expressions, for example.

### Step-by-step workflow creation
Here are the steps to create a workflow that takes two files as input: a video and an image. It will overlay the image on top of the video.

Open **Workflow Designer** and select **File** > **New Workspace** > **Transcode Blueprint**.

The new workflow shows three elements:

* Primary Source File
* Clip List XML
* Output File/Asset  

![New Encoding Workflow](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture9_empty.png)

*New Encoding Workflow*

In order to accept the input media file, start with adding a Media File Input component. To add a component to the workflow, look for it in the Repository search box and drag the desired entry onto the designer pane.

Next, add the video file to be used for designing your workflow. To do so, click the background pane in Workflow Designer and look for the Primary Source File property on the right-hand property pane. Click the folder icon and select the appropriate video file.

![Primary File Source](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture10_primaryfile.png)

*Primary File Source*

Next, specify the video file in the Media File Input component.   

![Media File Input Source](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture11_mediafileinput.png)

*Media File Input Source*

As soon as this is done, the Media File Input component will inspect the file and populate its output pins to reflect the file that it inspected.

The next step is to add a "Video Data Type Updater" to specify the color space to Rec.709. Add a "Video Format Converter" that is set to Data Layout/Layout type = Configurable Planar. This will convert the video stream to a format that can be taken as a source of the overlay component.

![video Data Type Updater and Format Converter](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture12_formatconverter.png)

*Video Data Type Updater and Format Converter*

![Layout type = Configurable Planar](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture12_formatconverter2.png)

*Layout type is Configurable Planar*

Next, add a Video Overlay component and connect the (uncompressed) video pin to the (uncompressed) video pin of the media file input.

Add another Media File Input (to load the logo file), click on this component and rename it to "Media File Input Logo", and select an image (a .png file for example) in the file property. Connect the Uncompressed image pin to the Uncompressed image pin of the overlay.

![Overlay component and image file source](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture13_overlay.png)

*Overlay component and image file source*

If you want to modify the position of the logo on the video (for example, you might want to position it at 10 percent off of the top left corner of the video), clear the "Manual Input" check box. You can do this because you are using a Media File Input to provide the logo file to the overlay component.

![Overlay position](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture14_overlay_position.png)

*Overlay position*

To encode the video stream to H.264, add the AVC Video Encoder and AAC encoder components to the designer surface. Connect the pins.
Set up the AAC encoder and select Audio Format Conversion/Preset : 2.0 (L, R).

![Audio and Video Encoders](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture15_encoders.png)

*Audio and Video Encoders*

Now add the **ISO Mpeg-4 Multiplexer** and **File Output** components and connect the pins as shown.

![MP4 multiplexer and file output](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture16_mp4output.png)

*MP4 multiplexer and file output*

You need to set the name for the output file. Click the **File Output** component and edit the expression for the file:

    ${ROOT_outputWriteDirectory}\${ROOT_sourceFileBaseName}_withoverlay.mp4

![File output name](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture17_filenameoutput.png)

*File output name*

You can run the workflow locally to check that it is running correctly.

After it finishes, you can run it in Azure Media Services.

First, prepare an asset in Azure Media Services with two files in it: the video file and the logo. You can do this by using the .NET or REST API. You can also do this by using the Azure portal or [Azure Media Services Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer) (AMSE).

This tutorial shows you how to manage assets with AMSE. There are two ways to add files to an asset:

* Create a local folder, copy the two files in it, and drag and drop the folder to the **Asset** tab.
* Upload the video file as an asset, display the asset information, go to the files tab, and upload an additional file (logo).

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to set a primary file in the asset (the main video file).

![Asset files in AMSE](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture18_assetinamse.png)

*Asset files in AMSE*

Select the asset and choose to encode it with Premium Encoder. Upload the workflow and select it.

Click the button to pass data to the processor, and add the following XML to set the runtime properties:

![Premium Encoder in AMSE](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture19_amsepremium.png)

*Premium Encoder in AMSE*

Then, paste the following XML data. You need to specify the name of the video file for both the Media File Input and primarySourceFile. Specify the name of the file name for the logo too.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
  <transcodeRequest>
    <setRuntimeProperties>
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input/filename" value="Microsoft_HoloLens_Possibilities_816p24.mp4" />
      <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="Microsoft_HoloLens_Possibilities_816p24.mp4" />
      <property propertyPath="Media File Input Logo/filename" value="logo.png" />
    </setRuntimeProperties>
  </transcodeRequest>
```

![setRuntimeProperties](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture20_amsexmldata.png)

*setRuntimeProperties*

If you use the .NET SDK to create and run the task, this XML data has to be passed as the configuration string.

```csharp
public ITask AddNew(string taskName, IMediaProcessor mediaProcessor, string configuration, TaskOptions options);
```

After the job is complete, the MP4 file in the output asset displays the overlay!

![Overlay on the video](./media/media-services-media-encoder-premium-workflow-multiplefilesinput/capture21_resultoverlay.png)

*Overlay on the video*

You can download the sample workflow from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-media-services-samples/tree/master/Encoding%20Presets/VoD/MediaEncoderPremiumWorkfows/).

## Example 2 : Multiple audio language encoding

An example of multiple audio language encoding workflow is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-media-services-samples/tree/master/Encoding%20Presets/VoD/MediaEncoderPremiumWorkfows/MultilanguageAudioEncoding).

This folder contains a sample workflow which can be used to encode a MXF file to a multi MP4 files asset with multiple audio tracks.

This workflow assumes that the MXF file contains one audio track ; the additional audio tracks should be passed as separate audio files (WAV or MP4...).

To encode, please follow these steps:

* Create a Media Services asset with the MXF file and the Audio files (0 to 18 audio files).
* Make sure that the MXF file is set as a primary file.
* Create a job and a task using the Premium Workflow Encoder processor. Use the workflow provided (MultiMP4-1080p-19audio-v1.workflow).
* Pass the setruntime.xml data to the task (if you use Azure Media Services Explorer, use the “pass xml data to the workflow” button).
  * Please update the XML data to specify the correct file names and languages tags.
  * The workflow has audio components named Audio 1 to Audio 18.
  * RFC5646 is supported for the language tag.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<transcodeRequest>
  <setRuntimeProperties>
    <property propertyPath="Media File Input Video/filename" value="MainVideo.mxf" />
    <property propertyPath="Language/language_code" value="en" />
    <property propertyPath="/primarySourceFile" value="MainVideo.mxf" />
    <property propertyPath="Audio 1/Media File Input/filename" value="french-audio.wav" />
    <property propertyPath="Audio 1/Language/language_code" value="fr" />
    <property propertyPath="Audio 2/Media File Input/filename" value="german-audio.wav" />
    <property propertyPath="Audio 2/Language/language_code" value="de" />
    <property propertyPath="Audio 3/Media File Input/filename" value="japanese-audio.wav" />
    <property propertyPath="Audio 3/Language/language_code" value="ja" />
  </setRuntimeProperties>
</transcodeRequest>
```

* The encoded asset will contain multi language audio tracks and these tracks should be selectable in Azure Media Player.
