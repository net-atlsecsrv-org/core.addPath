# Azure Media Player overview #

Azure Media Player is a web video player built to play back media content from [Microsoft Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/) on a wide variety of browsers and devices. Azure Media Player utilizes industry standards, such as HTML5, Media Source Extensions (MSE), and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) to provide an enriched adaptive streaming experience.  When these standards are not available on a device or in a browser, Azure Media Player uses Flash and Silverlight as fallback technology. Regardless of the playback technology used, developers will have a unified JavaScript interface to access APIs.  This allows for content served by Azure Media Services to be played across a wide-range of devices and browsers without any extra effort.

Microsoft Azure Media Services allows for content to be served up with DASH, Smooth Streaming and HLS streaming formats to play back content. Azure Media Player takes into account these various formats and automatically plays the best link based on the platform/browser capabilities. Microsoft Azure Media Services also allows for dynamic encryption of assets with common encryption (PlayReady or Widevine) or AES-128 bit envelope encryption. Azure Media Player allows for decryption of PlayReady and AES-128 bit encrypted content when appropriately configured.  See the [Protected Content](azure-media-player-protected-content.md) section for how to configure this.
