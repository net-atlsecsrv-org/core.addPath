# Azure Media Player localization #

Multiple language support allows for users of non-English locales to natively interact with the player. Azure Media Player will instantiate with a global dictionary of languages, which will localize the error messages based on the page language. A developer can also create a player instance with a forced set language. The default language is English (en).
