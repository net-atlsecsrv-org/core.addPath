# Understand cache usage models

Cache usage models let you customize how your Azure HPC Cache stores files to speed up your workflow.

## Basic file caching concepts

File caching is how Azure HPC Cache expedites client requests. It uses these basic practices:

* **Read caching** - Azure HPC Cache keeps a copy of files that clients request from the storage system. The next time a client requests the same file, HPC cache can provide the version in its cache instead of having to fetch it from the back-end storage system again.

* **Write caching** - Optionally, Azure HPC Cache can store a copy of any changed files sent from the client machines. If multiple clients make changes to the same file over a short period, the cache can collect all the changes in the cache instead of having to write each change individually to the back-end storage system.

  After a specified amount of time with no changes, the cache moves the file to the long-term storage system.

  If write caching is disabled, the cache doesn't store the changed file and immediately writes it to the back-end storage system.

* **Write-back delay** - For a cache with write caching turned on, write-back delay is the amount of time the cache waits for additional file changes before copying the file to the back-end storage system.

* **Back-end verification** - The back-end verification setting determines how frequently the cache compares its local copy of a file with the remote version on the back-end storage system. If the back-end copy is newer than the cached copy, the cache fetches the remote copy and stores it for future requests.

  The back-end verification setting shows when the cache *automatically* compares its files with source files in remote storage. However, you can force Azure HPC Cache to compare files by performing a directory operation that includes a readdirplus request. Readdirplus is a standard NFS API (also called extended read) that returns directory metadata, which causes the cache to compare and update files.

The usage models built into Azure HPC Cache have different values for these settings so that you can choose the best combination for your situation.

## Choose the right usage model for your workflow

You must choose a usage model for each NFS-mounted storage target that you use. Azure Blob storage targets have a built-in usage model that can't be customized.

HPC cache usage models let you choose how to balance fast response with the risk of getting stale data. If you want to optimize speed for reading files, you might not care whether the files in the cache are checked against the back-end files. On the other hand, if you want to make sure your files are always up to date with the remote storage, choose a model that checks frequently.

These are the usage model options:

* **Read heavy, infrequent writes** - Use this option if you want to speed up read access to files that are static or rarely changed.

  This option caches client reads but doesn't cache writes. It passes writes through to the back-end storage immediately.
  
  Files stored in the cache are not automatically compared to the files on the NFS storage volume. (Read the description of back-end verification above to learn how to compare them manually.)

  Do not use this option if there is a risk that a file might be modified directly on the storage system without first writing it to the cache. If that happens, the cached version of the file will be out of sync with the back-end file.

* **Greater than 15% writes** - This option speeds up both read and write performance. When using this option, all clients must access files through the Azure HPC Cache instead of mounting the back-end storage directly. The cached files will have recent changes that have not yet been copied to the back end.

  In this usage model, files in the cache are only checked against the files on back-end storage every eight hours. The cached version of the file is assumed to be more current. A modified file in the cache is written to the back-end storage system after it has been in the cache for 20 minutes<!-- an hour --> with no additional changes.

* **Clients write to the NFS target, bypassing the cache** - Choose this option if any clients in your workflow write data directly to the storage system without first writing to the cache, or if you want to optimize data consistency. Files that clients request are cached (reads), but any changes to those files from the client (writes) are not cached. They are passed through directly to the back-end storage system.

  With this usage model, the files in the cache are frequently checked against the back-end versions for updates - every 30 seconds. This verification allows files to be changed outside of the cache while maintaining data consistency.

  > [!TIP]
  > Those first three basic usage models can be used to handle the majority of Azure HPC Cache workflows. The next options are for less common scenarios.

* **Greater than 15% writes, checking the backing server for changes every 30 seconds** and **Greater than 15% writes, checking the backing server for changes every 60 seconds** - These options are designed for workflows where you want to speed up both reads and writes, but there's a chance that another user will write directly to the back-end storage system. For example, if multiple sets of clients are working on the same files from different locations, these usage models might make sense to balance the need for quick file access with low tolerance for stale content from the source.

* **Greater than 15% writes, write back to the server every 30 seconds** - This option is designed for the scenario where multiple clients are actively modifying the same files, or if some clients access the back-end storage directly instead of mounting the cache.

  The frequent back-end writes affect cache performance, so you should consider using the **Greater than 15% writes** usage model if there's a low risk of file conflict - for example, if you know that different clients are working in different areas of the same file set.

* **Read heavy, checking the backing server every 3 hours** - This option prioritizes fast reads on the client side, but also refreshes cached files from the back-end storage system regularly, unlike the **Read heavy, infrequent writes** usage model.
