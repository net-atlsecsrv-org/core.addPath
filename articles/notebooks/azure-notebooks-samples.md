# Discover and use sample notebooks

The Internet has many collections of interesting and useful Jupyter notebooks that you can easily bring into Azure Notebooks. This article provides a list of notable samples.

Once you've identified a notebook you'd like to explore, here are a few details you'll want to understand:

- If a notebook is already in Azure Notebooks, use the **Clone** button on its project dashboard to make a copy of the project in your own account.
- Some notebooks require specific packages to run. Although you can use `!pip install` (Python) or `install.packages` (R) to install packages from a notebook itself, you can also [configure an Azure Notebooks project with the appropriate environment](configure-manage-azure-notebooks-projects.md).

## Great sample notebooks

- [Azure Notebooks starter set](https://notebooks.azure.com/#sample-redirect) includes introductions to Python, R, and F#, along with notebooks demonstrating data access, Azure Machine Learning Services, and a few data science exercises.
