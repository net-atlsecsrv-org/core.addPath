# Use Azure Machine Learning in a notebook

Azure Notebooks comes pre-configured with the necessary environment to work with [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/service/). You can easily clone a sample project into your Notebooks account to explore a variety of Machine Learning scenarios.

## Clone the sample into your account

1. Sign into [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/).
1. Select **My Projects** to go to the projects dashboard.
1. Select the **Upload GitHub Repo** (the up arrow) button to open the **Upload GitHub Repository** popup.
1. In the popup, enter `Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks` in **GitHub repository**, provide a name for the project in **Project Name** like "Azure Machine Learning", provide an identifier in **Project ID**, clear **Public** if you want, then select **Import**.

1. After a minute or two, Azure Notebooks automatically takes you to the new project's dashboard.

## Run a sample notebook

1. Select **00 - configuration.ipynb** to start the configuration section of the notebook, and follow its instructions to create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

    - Because Azure Notebooks already contains the necessary Python packages, you can just run the code snippet in step 2 of the Prerequisites to verify the Azure ML SDK version.

1. Once configuration is complete, select **01.getting-started** to open the folder containing thirteen different sample notebooks, each of which is self-explanatory.
