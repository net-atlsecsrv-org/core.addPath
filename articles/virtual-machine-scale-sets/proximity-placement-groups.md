# Preview: Creating and using proximity placement groups using PowerShell

To get VMs as close as possible, achieving the lowest possible latency, you should deploy your scale set within a [proximity placement group](co-location.md#preview-proximity-placement-groups).

A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Proximity Placement Groups is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
>
> Proximity placement groups are not available in these regions during the preview: **Japan East**, **Australia East** and **India Central**.


## Create a proximity placement group
Create a proximity placement group using the [New-AzProximityPlacementGroup](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azproximityplacementgroup) cmdlet. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroup = "myPPGResourceGroup"
$location = "East US"
$ppgName = "myPPG"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location
$ppg = New-AzProximityPlacementGroup `
   -Location $location `
   -Name $ppgName `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
   -ProximityPlacementGroupType Standard
```

## List proximity placement groups

You can list all of the proximity placement groups using the [Get-AzProximityPlacementGroup](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azproximityplacementgroup) cmdlet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzProximityPlacementGroup
```


## Create a scale set

Create a scale in the proximity placement group using `-ProximityPlacementGroup $ppg.Id` to refer to the proximity placement group ID when you use [New-AzVMSS](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmss) to create the scale set.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$scalesetName = "myVM"

New-AzVmss `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Location $location `
  -VMScaleSetName $scalesetName `
  -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" `
  -SubnetName "mySubnet" `
  -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIPAddress" `
  -LoadBalancerName "myLoadBalancer" `
  -UpgradePolicyMode "Automatic" `
  -ProximityPlacementGroup $ppg.Id
```

You can see the instance in the placement group using [Get-AzProximityPlacementGroup](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azproximityplacementgroup).

```azurepowershell-interactive
  Get-AzProximityPlacementGroup `
   -ResourceId $ppg.Id | Format-Table `
   -Wrap `
   -Property VirtualMachineScaleSets
```

## Next steps

You can also use the [Azure CLI](../virtual-machines/linux/proximity-placement-groups.md) to create proximity placement groups.
