# Create a virtual machine scale set from a custom VM image with the Azure CLI
This script creates a virtual machine scale set that uses a custom VM image as the source for the VM instances.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-custom-vm-image/use-custom-vm-image.sh "Create a virtual machine scale set with a custom VM image")]

## Clean up deployment
Run the following command to remove the resource group, scale set, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation
This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine scale set, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/ad/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vmss create](/cli/azure/vmss) | Creates the virtual machine scale set and connects it to the virtual network, subnet, and network security group. A load balancer is also created to distribute traffic to multiple VM instances. This command also specifies the VM image to be used and administrative credentials.  |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/ad/group) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
