# Azure Service Fabric hosting lifecycle

This article provides an overview of events that happen in Azure Service Fabric when an application is activated on a node and various cluster configs used to control the behavior.

Before proceeding further, be sure that you understand the various concepts and relationships explained in [Model an application in Service Fabric][a1].

## Activation of Application/ServicePackage

The pipeline for activation is as follows:

1. Download the ApplicationPackage. For example: ApplicationManifest.xml etc.
2. Set up environment for Application for ex: create users etc.
3. Start tracking Application for deactivation.
4. Download ServicePackage. For example: ServiceManifest.xml, code, config, data packages etc.
5. Set up environment for Service Package for ex: setup firewall, allocate ports for endpoints etc.
6. Start tracking ServicePackage for deactivation.
7. Start SetupEntryPoint of CodePackages and wait for completion.
8. Start MainEntryPoint of CodePackages.

### ServiceType Blocklisting
**ServiceTypeDisableFailureThreshold** determines the number of failures (activation, download, CodePackage failures) after which the ServiceType is scheduled for blocklisting. The first activation failure, download failure, or CodePackage crash will schedule ServiceType blocklisting. The **ServiceTypeDisableGraceInterval** config determines the grace interval after which ServiceType is marked as blocklisted on that node. While all this is happening, activation, download, and CodePackage restart are being retried in parallel. Retrying, means for example, that CodePackage will be scheduled to start again after the crash or Service Fabric will try to download packages again.

When ServiceType is blocklisted, you will see a health error "'System.Hosting' reported Error for property 'ServiceTypeRegistration:ServiceType'. The ServiceType was disabled on the node."

ServiceType will be enabled on the node again if any of the following things happens:
- Activation succeeds or reaches **ActivationMaxFailureCount** retries upon failure.
- Download succeeds or reaches **DeploymentMaxFailureCount** retries upon failure.
- A CodePackage that has crashed starts and successfully registers the ServiceType.

**ActivationMaxFailureCount** and **DeploymentMaxFailureCount** are the maximum number of attempts Service Fabric will make to activate/download an application on a node, after which Service Fabric will enable the ServiceType for activation again. This is to give the service another opportunity for activation, which might succeed, resulting in the issue automatically healing. A new activation/download operation triggered by placement and activation of a Replica can trigger the ServiceType blocklisting again or may succeed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your CodePackage which does not register a ServiceType is crashing, then it doesn't impact the ServiceType. Only the CodePackage hosting a Replica crash will impact the ServiceType.
>

### CodePackage crash
When a CodePackage crashes, Service Fabric uses a backoff to start it again. The backoff is independent of whether the code package has registered a type with the Service Fabric runtime or not.

The backoff value is Min(RetryTime, **ActivationMaxRetryInterval**), and this backoff value is incremented in constant, linear, or exponential amounts based on the **ActivationRetryBackoffExponentiationBase** configuration setting.

- Constant: If **ActivationRetryBackoffExponentiationBase** == 0 then RetryTime = **ActivationRetryBackoffInterval**;
- Linear:  If  **ActivationRetryBackoffExponentiationBase** == 0  then RetryTime = ContinuousFailureCount* **ActivationRetryBackoffInterval** where ContinousFailureCount is the number of times a CodePackage crashes or fails to activate.
- Exponential: RetryTime = (**ActivationRetryBackoffInterval** in seconds) * (**ActivationRetryBackoffExponentiationBase** ^ ContinuousFailureCount);
	
You can control the behavior by changing the values. For example, if you want several quick restart attempts, you could use Linear by setting **ActivationRetryBackoffExponentiationBase** to 0 and **ActivationRetryBackoffInterval** to 10. With these settings, if a CodePackage crashed, the start interval will be after 10 seconds. If the package continued to crash, the backoff would change to, 20, 30, 40 seconds, and so on, until the CodePackage activation succeeded or the code package was deactivated. 
	
The maximum amount of time Service Fabric backs off (waits) after a failure is governed by the **ActivationMaxRetryInterval**.
	
If your CodePackage crashes and comes back up, it needs to stay up for **CodePackageContinuousExitFailureResetInterval** for Service Fabric to consider it as healthy, at which point it will overwrite the prior Error health report as OK and reset the ContinousFailureCount.

### CodePackage not registering ServiceType
If a CodePackage stays alive and is expected to register a ServiceType with us but does not, Service Fabric will generate a warning HealthReport after **ServiceTypeRegistrationTimeout** saying that ServiceType has not been registered within the expected amount of time.

### Activation Failure
Service Fabric always uses a linear back-off (same as CodePackage crash) when it finds error during activation. This means that the activation operation will give up after (0 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 40) = 100 sec (first retry is immediate). After this activation is not retried.
	
Max Activation backoff can be **ActivationMaxRetryInterval** and retry **ActivationMaxFailureCount**.

### Download Failure
Service Fabric always uses a linear back-off when it encounters error during download. This means that the activation operation will give up after (0+ 10 + 20 + 30 + 40) = 100 sec (first retry is immediate). After this, the download is not retried. The linear back-off for download is equal to ContinuousFailureCount***DeploymentRetryBackoffInterval** and can max back-off to **DeploymentMaxRetryInterval**. Like activations, download operation can retry for **ActivationMaxFailureCount**.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you change these settings, here are a few examples you should keep in mind.

* If the CodePackage keeps crashing and backs off, the ServiceType will be disabled. But if the activation configuration is such that it has a quick restart then the CodePackage can come up a few times before the ServiceType is actually blocklisted. For ex: assume your CodePackage comes up, registers the ServiceType with Service Fabric and then crashes. In that case, once Hosting receives a type registration the **ServiceTypeDisableGraceInterval** period is canceled. And this can repeat until your CodePackage backs offs to a value greater than  **ServiceTypeDisableGraceInterval** and then ServiceType will be blocklisted on the node. It maytake longer than you expect to see the ServiceType blocklisted.

* In case of activations, when Service Fabric system needs to place a Replica on a node, the RA (ReconfigurationAgent) asks Hosting subSystem to activate the application and retries the activation request every 15 seconds (governed by the **RAPMessageRetryInterval** configuration setting). For Service Fabric to know that the ServiceType has been blocklisted, the activation operation in hosting needs to live for a longer period than the retry interval and the **ServiceTypeDisableGraceInterval**. For example: assume the cluster has **ActivationMaxFailureCount** set to 5 and **ActivationRetryBackoffInterval** set to 1 second. This means that the activation operation will give up after (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 10 seconds (recall that the first retry is immediate) and after that Hosting gives up retrying. In this case, the activation operation will get completed and will not retry after 15 seconds. This happens because Service Fabric exhausted all the allowed retries within 15 seconds. So, every retry from ReconfigurationAgent creates a new activation operation in Hosting subSystem and the pattern will keep repeating. As a result, the ServiceType will never be blocklisted on the node. Since the ServiceType will not get blocklisted on the node, the Replica will not be moved and tried on a different node.

## Deactivation

When a ServicePackage is activated on a node, it is tracked for deactivation. 

Deactivation works in two ways:

- Periodically:  At every **DeactivationScanInterval**, it checks for ServicePackages that have NEVER hosted a Replica and marks them as candidates for deactivation.
- ReplicaClose: If a Replica is closed, Deactivator gets a DecrementUsageCount. If the count goes to 0, it means the ServicePackage is not hosting any Replica and hence is a candidate for deactivation.

 Based on the activation mode [Exclusive/Shared][a2], the candidates for deactivation are scheduled after the **DeactivationGraceInterval** for SharedMode and after the **ExclusiveModeDeactivationGraceInterval** for ExclusiveMode. If a new replica placement comes in in between this time, the deactivation is canceled.

### Periodically:
Let's discuss some examples of periodic deactivation:

Example 1: Letâ€™s say the Deactivator does a scan at Time T(**DeactivationScanInterval**). Its next scan will be at 2T. Assume a ServicePackage activation happened at T+1. This ServicePackage is not hosting a Replica and hence needs to be deactivated. For the ServicePackage to be a candidate for deactivation, it needs to be in the state of no Replica for atleast T time. That means, it will be eligible for deactivation at 2T+1. So, the scan at 2T wonâ€™t find this ServicePackage as a candidate for deactivation. The next deactivation cycle 3T will schedule this ServicePackage for deactivation because now it has been in no Replica state for time T.  

Example 2: Letâ€™s say a ServicePackage gets activated at time T-1 and Deactivator does a scan at T. The ServicePackage doesnâ€™t host a Replica. Then at next scan 2T this ServicePackage will be found as a candidate for deactivation and hence will be scheduled for deactivation.  

Example 3: Letâ€™s say a ServicePackage gets activated at Tâ€“1 and Deactivator does a scan at T. The ServicePackage doesnâ€™t host a Replica yet. Now at T+1 a Replica gets placed, i.e Hosting gets an IncrementUsageCount, which means a Replica is created. Now at 2T this ServicePackage will not be scheduled for deactivation. Because it contains a replica, deactivation will move to the ReplicaClose logic explained below.

Example 4: Let's say your ServicePackage is large, say 10 GB, and can take a bit of time to download on the node. Once an application is activated, the Deactivator tracks its lifecycle. Now, if you have the **DeactivationScanInterval** config set to a small value, you may run into issues where your ServicePackage is not getting time to activate on the node because all the time went into downloading. To overcome the problem, you can [pre-download the ServicePackage on the node][p1] or increase the **DeactivationScanInterval**. 

> [!NOTE]
> A ServicePackage can get deactivated anywhere between (**DeactivationScanInterval** To 2***DeactivationScanInterval**) + **DeactivationGraceInterval**/**ExclusiveModeDeactivationGraceInterval**. 
>

### Replica Close:
Deactivation keeps count of Replicas that a ServicePackage holds. If a ServicePackage is holding a Replica and the Replica is closed/down, Hosting gets a DecrementUsageCount. When a Replica is opened, Hosting gets an IncrementUsageCount. The Decrement means that the ServicePackage is now hosting one less Replica and when the count drops to 0, then the ServicePackage is scheduled for deactivation and the time after which it will be deactivated is **DeactivationGraceInterval**/**ExclusiveModeDeactivationGraceInterval**. 

For ex: letâ€™s say a Decrement happens at T and ServicePackage is scheduled to deactivate at 2T+X(**DeactivationGraceInterval**/**ExclusiveModeDeactivationGraceInterval**). If during this time Hosting gets an IncrementUsage meaning a Replica is created then the deactivation is canceled.

> [!NOTE]
> What do these config settings means?
**DeactivationGraceInterval**/**ExclusiveModeDeactivationGraceInterval**: The time given to a ServicePackage to host again another Replica once it has hosted any Replica. 
**DeactivationScanInterval**: The minimum time given to ServicePackage to host a Replica if it has NEVER hosted any Replica i.e if not used.
>

### Ctrl+C
Once a ServicePackage passes the **DeactivationGraceInterval**/**ExclusiveModeDeactivationGraceInterval** and is still not hosting a Replica, the deactivation is non-cancellable. CodePackage are issued a Ctrl+C handler that means that now the deactivation pipeline has to go through to bring the process down. 
During this time if a new Replica for the same ServicePackage is trying to get placed it will fail because we cannot transition from Deactivation to Activation.
