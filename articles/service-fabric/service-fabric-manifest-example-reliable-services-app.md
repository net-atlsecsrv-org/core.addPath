# Reliable services application and service manifest examples
The following are examples of the application and service manifests for a Service Fabric application with an ASP.NET Core web front-end and a stateful back-end. The purpose of these examples is to show what settings are available and how to use them. These application and service manifests are based on the [Service Fabric .NET Quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-quickstart/) manifests.

The following features are shown:

|Manifest|Features|
|---|---|
|[Application manifest](#application-manifest)| [resource governance](service-fabric-resource-governance.md), [run a service as a local admin account](service-fabric-application-runas-security.md), [apply a default policy to all service code packages](service-fabric-application-runas-security.md#apply-a-default-policy-to-all-service-code-packages), [create user and group principals](service-fabric-application-runas-security.md), share a data package between service instances, [override service endpoints](service-fabric-service-manifest-resources.md#overriding-endpoints-in-servicemanifestxml)| 
|FrontEndService service manifest| [Run a script at service startup](service-fabric-run-script-at-service-startup.md), [define an HTTPS endpoint](service-fabric-tutorial-dotnet-app-enable-https-endpoint.md#define-an-https-endpoint-in-the-service-manifest) | 
|BackEndService service manifest| [Declare a config package](service-fabric-application-and-service-manifests.md), [declare a data package](service-fabric-application-and-service-manifests.md), [configure an endpoint](service-fabric-service-manifest-resources.md)| 

See [Application manifest elements](#application-manifest-elements), [VotingWeb service manifest elements](#votingweb-service-manifest-elements), and [VotingData service manifest elements](#votingdata-service-manifest-elements) for more information on specific XML elements.

## Application manifest elements
### ApplicationManifest Element
Declaratively describes the application type and version. One or more service manifests of the constituent services are referenced to compose an application type. Configuration settings of the constituent services can be overridden using parameterized application settings. Default services, service templates, principals, policies, diagnostics set-up, and certificates can also declared at the application level. For more information, see [ApplicationManifest Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ApplicationManifestElementApplicationManifestTypeComplexType)

### Parameters Element
Declares the parameters that are used in this application manifest. The value of these parameters can be supplied when the application is instantiated and can be used to override application or service configuration settings. For more information, see [Parameters Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ParametersElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInApplicationManifestTypecomplexType)

### Parameter Element
An application parameter to be used in this manifest. The parameter value can be changed during application instantiation, or, if no value is supplied the default value is used. For more information, see [Parameter Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ParameterElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInParameterselement)

### ServiceManifestImport Element
Imports a service manifest created by the service developer. A service manifest must be imported for each constituent service in the application. Configuration overrides and policies can be declared for the service manifest. For more information, see [ServiceManifestImport Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceManifestImportElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInApplicationManifestTypecomplexType)

### ServiceManifestRef Element
Imports the service manifest by reference. Currently the service manifest file (ServiceManifest.xml) must be present in the build package. For more information, see [ServiceManifestRef Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceManifestRefElementServiceManifestRefTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportelement)

### ResourceOverrides Element
Specifies resource overrides for endpoints declared in service manifest resources. For more information, see [ResourceOverrides Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ResourceOverridesElementResourceOverridesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportelement)

### Endpoints Element
The endpoint(s) to override. For more information, see [Endpoints Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EndpointsElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInResourceOverridesTypecomplexType)

### Endpoint Element
The endpoint, declared in the service manifest, to override. For more information, see [Endpoint Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EndpointElementEndpointOverrideTypeComplexTypeDefinedInEndpointselement)

### Policies Element
Describes policies (end-point binding, package sharing, run-as, and security access) to be applied on the imported service manifest. For more information, see [Policies Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#PoliciesElementServiceManifestImportPoliciesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportelement)

### ServicePackageResourceGovernancePolicy Element
Defines the resource governance policy that is applied at the level of the entire service package. For more information, see [ServicePackageResourceGovernancePolicy Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServicePackageResourceGovernancePolicyElementServicePackageResourceGovernancePolicyTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportPoliciesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInServicePackageTypecomplexType)

### ResourceGovernancePolicy Element
Specifies resource limits for a codepackage. For more information, see [ResourceGovernancePolicy Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ResourceGovernancePolicyElementResourceGovernancePolicyTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportPoliciesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedCodePackageelementDefinedInDigestedEndpointelement)

### PackageSharingPolicy Element
Indicates if a code, config or data package should be shared across service instances of the same service type. For more information, see [PackageSharingPolicy Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#PackageSharingPolicyElementPackageSharingPolicyTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportPoliciesTypecomplexType)

### SecurityAccessPolicy Element
Grants access permissions to a principal on a resource (such as an endpoint) defined in a service manifest. Typically, it is very useful to control and restrict access of services to different resources in order to minimize security risks. This is especially important when the application is built from a collection of services from a marketplace which are developed by different developers. For more information, see [SecurityAccessPolicy Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#SecurityAccessPolicyElementSecurityAccessPolicyTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportPoliciesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInSecurityAccessPolicieselementDefinedInDigestedEndpointelement)

### RunAsPolicy Element
Specifies the local user or local system account that a service code package will run as. Domain accounts are supported on Windows Server deployments where Azure Active Directory is available. By default, applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Applications can also run as other accounts, which must be declared in the Principals section. If you apply a RunAs policy to a service, and the service manifest declares endpoint resources with the HTTP protocol, you must also specify a SecurityAccessPolicy to ensure that ports allocated to these endpoints are correctly access-control listed for the RunAs user account that the service runs under. For an HTTPS endpoint, you also have to define a EndpointBindingPolicy to indicate the name of the certificate to return to the client. For more information, see [RunAsPolicy Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#RunAsPolicyElementRunAsPolicyTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestImportPoliciesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedCodePackageelement)

### DefaultServices Element
Declares service instances that are automatically created whenever an application is instantiated against this application type. For more information, see [DefaultServices Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#DefaultServicesElementDefaultServicesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInApplicationManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInApplicationInstanceTypecomplexType)

### Service Element
Declares a service to be created automatically when the application is instantiated. For more information, see [Service Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInDefaultServicesTypecomplexType)

Defines a stateful service. For more information, see [StatefulService Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#StatefulServiceElementStatefulServiceTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceTemplatesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInServiceelement)

### StatelessService Element
Defines a stateless service. For more information, see [StatelessService Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#StatelessServiceElementStatelessServiceTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceTemplatesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInServiceelement)

### Principals Element
Describes the security principals (users, groups) required for this application to run services and secure resources. Principals are referenced in the policies sections. For more information, see [Principals Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#PrincipalsElementSecurityPrincipalsTypeComplexTypeDefinedInApplicationManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInEnvironmentTypecomplexType)

### Groups Element
Declares a set of groups as security principals, which can be referenced in policies. Groups are useful if there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level. For more information, see [Groups Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#GroupsElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInSecurityPrincipalsTypecomplexType)

### Group Element
Declares a group as a security principal, which can be referenced in policies. For more information, see [Group Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#GroupElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInGroupselement)

### Membership Element
 For more information, see [Membership Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#MembershipElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInGroupelement)

### SystemGroup Element
 For more information, see [SystemGroup Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#SystemGroupElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInMembershipelement)

### Users Element
Declares a set of users as security principals, which can be referenced in policies. For more information, see [Users Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#UsersElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInSecurityPrincipalsTypecomplexType)

### User Element
Declares a user as a security principal, which can be referenced in policies. For more information, see [User Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#UserElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInUserselement)

### MemberOf Element
Users can be added to any existing membership group, so it can inherit all the properties and security settings of that membership group. The membership group can be used to secure external resources that need to be accessed by different services or the same service (on a different machine). For more information, see [MemberOf Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#MemberOfElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInUserelement)

### SystemGroup Element
The system group to add the user to.  The system group must be defined in the Groups section. For more information, see [SystemGroup Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#SystemGroupElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInMemberOfelement)

### Group Element
The group to add the user to.  The group must be defined in the Groups section. For more information, see [Group Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#GroupElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInMemberOfelement)

### Policies Element
Describes the policies (log collection, default run-as, health, and security access) to be applied at the application level. For more information, see [Policies Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#PoliciesElementApplicationPoliciesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInApplicationManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInEnvironmentTypecomplexType)

### DefaultRunAsPolicy Element
Specify a default user account for all service code packages that don't have a specific RunAsPolicy defined in the ServiceManifestImport section. For more information, see [DefaultRunAsPolicy Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#DefaultRunAsPolicyElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInApplicationPoliciesTypecomplexType)




## VotingWeb service manifest elements
### ServiceManifest Element
Declaratively describes the service type and version. It lists the independently upgradeable code, configuration, and data packages that together compose a service package to support one or more service types. Resources, diagnostics settings, and service metadata, such as service type, health properties, and load-balancing metrics, are also specified. For more information, see [ServiceManifest Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceManifestElementServiceManifestTypeComplexType)

### ServiceTypes Element
Defines what service types are supported by a CodePackage in this manifest. When a service is instantiated against one of these service types, all code packages declared in this manifest are activated by running their entry points. Service types are declared at the manifest level and not the code package level. For more information, see [ServiceTypes Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceTypesElementServiceAndServiceGroupTypesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexType)

### StatelessServiceType Element
Describes a stateless service type. For more information, see [StatelessServiceType Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#StatelessServiceTypeElementStatelessServiceTypeTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceAndServiceGroupTypesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInServiceTypesTypecomplexType)

### CodePackage Element
Describes a code package that supports a defined service type. When a service is instantiated against one of these service types, all code packages declared in this manifest are activated by running their entry points. The resulting processes are expected to register the supported service types at run time. When there are multiple code packages, they are all activated whenever the system looks for any one of the declared service types. For more information, see [CodePackage Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#CodePackageElementCodePackageTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedCodePackageelement)

### SetupEntryPoint Element
A privileged entry point that by default runs with the same credentials as Service Fabric (typically the NETWORKSERVICE account) before any other entry point. The executable specified by EntryPoint is typically the long-running service host. The presence of a separate setup entry point avoids having to run the service host with high privileges for extended periods of time. For more information, see [SetupEntryPoint Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#SetupEntryPointElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInCodePackageTypecomplexType)

### ExeHost Element
 For more information, see [ExeHost Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ExeHostElementExeHostEntryPointTypeComplexTypeDefinedInSetupEntryPointelement)

### Program Element
The executable name.  For example, "MySetup.bat" or "MyServiceHost.exe". For more information, see [Program Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ProgramElementxs:stringComplexTypeDefinedInExeHostEntryPointTypecomplexType)

### Arguments Element
 For more information, see [Arguments Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ArgumentsElementxs:stringComplexTypeDefinedInExeHostEntryPointTypecomplexType)

### WorkingFolder Element
The working directory for the process in the code package on the cluster node where the application is deployed. You can specify three values: Work (the default), CodePackage, or CodeBase. CodeBase specifies that the working directory is set to the directory in which the EXE is defined in the code package. CodePackage sets the working directory to be the root of the code package regardless of where the EXE is defined in the code package directory. Work sets the work directory to a unique folder created on the node.  This folder is the same for the entire application instance. By default, the working directory of all processes in the application is set to the application work folder. This is where the processes can write the data. Writing data in the code package or code base is not recommended as those folders could be shared between different application instances and may get deleted. For more information, see [WorkingFolder Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#WorkingFolderElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInExeHostEntryPointTypecomplexType)

> Do not use console redirection in a production application, only use it for local development and debugging. Redirects console output from the startup script to an output file in the application folder called "log" on the cluster node where the application is deployed and run. For more information, see [ConsoleRedirection Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ConsoleRedirectionElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInExeHostEntryPointTypecomplexType)

### EntryPoint Element
The executable specified by EntryPoint is typically the long-running service host. The presence of a separate setup entry point avoids having to run the service host with high privileges for extended periods of time. The executable specified by EntryPoint is run after SetupEntryPoint exits successfully. The resulting process is monitored and restarted (beginning again with SetupEntryPoint) if it ever terminates or crashes. For more information, see [EntryPoint Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EntryPointElementEntryPointDescriptionTypeComplexTypeDefinedInCodePackageTypecomplexType)

### ExeHost Element
 For more information, see [ExeHost Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ExeHostElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInEntryPointDescriptionTypecomplexType)

### ConfigPackage Element
Declares a folder, named by the Name attribute, under PackageRoot that contains a Settings.xml file. This file contains sections of user-defined, key-value pair settings that the process can read back at run time. During an upgrade, if only the ConfigPackage version has changed, then the running process is not restarted. Instead, a callback notifies the process that configuration settings have changed so they can be reloaded dynamically. For more information, see [ConfigPackage Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ConfigPackageElementConfigPackageTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedConfigPackageelement)

### Resources Element
Describes the resources used by this service, which can be declared without modifying compiled code and changed when the service is deployed. Access to these resources is controlled through the Principals and Policies sections of the application manifest. For more information, see [Resources Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ResourcesElementResourcesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexType)

### Endpoints Element
Defines endpoints for the service. For more information, see [Endpoints Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EndpointsElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInResourcesTypecomplexType)

### Endpoint Element
The endpoint, declared in the service manifest, to override. For more information, see [Endpoint Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EndpointElementEndpointOverrideTypeComplexTypeDefinedInEndpointselement)



## VotingData service manifest elements
### ServiceManifest Element
Declaratively describes the service type and version. It lists the independently upgradeable code, configuration, and data packages that together compose a service package to support one or more service types. Resources, diagnostics settings, and service metadata, such as service type, health properties, and load-balancing metrics, are also specified. For more information, see [ServiceManifest Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceManifestElementServiceManifestTypeComplexType)

### ServiceTypes Element
Defines what service types are supported by a CodePackage in this manifest. When a service is instantiated against one of these service types, all code packages declared in this manifest are activated by running their entry points. Service types are declared at the manifest level and not the code package level. For more information, see [ServiceTypes Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ServiceTypesElementServiceAndServiceGroupTypesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexType)

### StatefulServiceType Element
Describes a stateful service type. For more information, see [StatefulServiceType Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#StatefulServiceTypeElementStatefulServiceTypeTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceAndServiceGroupTypesTypecomplexTypeDefinedInServiceTypesTypecomplexType)

### CodePackage Element
Describes a code package that supports a defined service type. When a service is instantiated against one of these service types, all code packages declared in this manifest are activated by running their entry points. The resulting processes are expected to register the supported service types at run time. When there are multiple code packages, they are all activated whenever the system looks for any one of the declared service types. For more information, see [CodePackage Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#CodePackageElementCodePackageTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedCodePackageelement)

### EntryPoint Element
The executable specified by EntryPoint is typically the long-running service host. The presence of a separate setup entry point avoids having to run the service host with high privileges for extended periods of time. The executable specified by EntryPoint is run after SetupEntryPoint exits successfully. The resulting process is monitored and restarted (beginning again with SetupEntryPoint) if it ever terminates or crashes. For more information, see [EntryPoint Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EntryPointElementEntryPointDescriptionTypeComplexTypeDefinedInCodePackageTypecomplexType)

### ExeHost Element
 For more information, see [ExeHost Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ExeHostElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInEntryPointDescriptionTypecomplexType)

### Program Element
The executable name.  For example, "MySetup.bat" or "MyServiceHost.exe". For more information, see [Program Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ProgramElementxs:stringComplexTypeDefinedInExeHostEntryPointTypecomplexType)

### WorkingFolder Element
The working directory for the process in the code package on the cluster node where the application is deployed. You can specify three values: Work (the default), CodePackage, or CodeBase. CodeBase specifies that the working directory is set to the directory in which the EXE is defined in the code package. CodePackage sets the working directory to be the root of the code package regardless of where the EXE is defined in the code package directory. Work sets the work directory to a unique folder created on the node.  This folder is the same for the entire application instance. By default, the working directory of all processes in the application is set to the application work folder. This is where the processes can write the data. Writing data in the code package or code base is not recommended as those folders could be shared between different application instances and may get deleted. For more information, see [WorkingFolder Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#WorkingFolderElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInExeHostEntryPointTypecomplexType)

### ConfigPackage Element
Declares a folder, named by the Name attribute, under PackageRoot that contains a Settings.xml file. This file contains sections of user-defined, key-value pair settings that the process can read back at run time. During an upgrade, if only the ConfigPackage version has changed, then the running process is not restarted. Instead, a callback notifies the process that configuration settings have changed so they can be reloaded dynamically. For more information, see [ConfigPackage Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ConfigPackageElementConfigPackageTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedConfigPackageelement)

### DataPackage Element
Declares a folder, named by the Name attribute, under PackageRoot which contains static data files to be consumed by the process at run time. Service Fabric will recycle all EXEs and DLLHOSTs specified in the host and support packages when any of the data packages listed in the service manifest are upgraded. For more information, see [DataPackage Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#DataPackageElementDataPackageTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexTypeDefinedInDigestedDataPackageelement)

### Resources Element
Describes the resources used by this service, which can be declared without modifying compiled code and changed when the service is deployed. Access to these resources is controlled through the Principals and Policies sections of the application manifest. For more information, see [Resources Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#ResourcesElementResourcesTypeComplexTypeDefinedInServiceManifestTypecomplexType)

### Endpoints Element
Defines endpoints for the service. For more information, see [Endpoints Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EndpointsElementanonymouscomplexTypeComplexTypeDefinedInResourcesTypecomplexType)

### Endpoint Element
The endpoint, declared in the service manifest, to override. For more information, see [Endpoint Element](service-fabric-service-model-schema-elements.md#EndpointElementEndpointOverrideTypeComplexTypeDefinedInEndpointselement)
