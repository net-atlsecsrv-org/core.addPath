## sfctl service report-health
Sends a health report on the Service Fabric service.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric service. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Service, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, check that the report appears in the health events of the service.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --health-property [Required] | The property of the health information. <br><br> An entity can have health reports for different properties. The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node. Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information. |
| --health-state    [Required] | Possible values include\: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'. |
| --service-id      [Required] | The identity of the service. <br><br> This is typically the full name of the service without the 'fabric\:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the '\~' character. For example, if the service name is 'fabric\:/myapp/app1/svc1', the service identity would be 'myapp\~app1\~svc1' in 6.0+ and 'myapp/app1/svc1' in previous versions. |
| --source-id       [Required] | The source name that identifies the client/watchdog/system component that generated the health information. |
| --description | The description of the health information. <br><br> It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters. If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string. |
| --immediate | A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. <br><br> A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. |
| --remove-when-expired | Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires. <br><br> If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires. If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (e.g. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state. |
| --sequence-number | The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. <br><br> The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added. |
| --timeout -t | Server timeout in seconds.  Default\: 60. |
| --ttl | The duration for which this health report is valid. This field uses ISO8601 format for specifying the duration. <br><br> When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite. When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value. |

| --- | --- |
| --service-id [Required] | The identity of the service. This ID is typically the full name of the service without the 'fabric\:' URI scheme.

This is valid for the partitions with partitioning scheme as Named. The value is 3. |
| --partition-key-value | Partition key. This is required if the partition scheme for the service is Int64Range or Named.
