# Azure security baseline for Service Fabric

The Azure Security Baseline for Service Fabric contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).



## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Ensure that all Virtual Network subnet deployments have a Network Security Group applied with network access controls specific to your application's trusted ports and sources.

* [Deploy Azure Firewall using a template](../firewall/deploy-template.md)

* [Create perimeter networks by using Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)](../security/fundamentals/service-fabric-best-practices.md#use-network-isolation-and-security-with-azure-service-fabric)

* [How to integrate your Azure Service Fabric cluster with an existing virtual network](./service-fabric-patterns-networking.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the virtual network, subnet, and network security group being used to secure your Azure Service Fabric cluster. Enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account to traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to an Azure Log Analytics Workspace and use Azure Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

* [Understand Network Security provided by Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-network-recommendations.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Provide a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. Azure API Management integrates directly with Service Fabric, allowing you to secure access to back-end services, prevent DOS attacks by using throttling, and verify API keys, JWT tokens, certificates, and other credentials.

Consider deploying Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of critical web applications for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Enable Diagnostic Setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics Workspace.

* [Use traffic analytics to visualize NSG flow logs](../network-watcher/traffic-analytics.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities. If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or deny malicious traffic.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) that are attached to the subnet your Azure Service Fabric cluster is deployed in. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
