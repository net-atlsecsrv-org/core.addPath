# Azure security baseline for Service Fabric

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Service Fabric. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Service Fabric.

> [!NOTE]
> **Controls** not applicable to Service Fabric, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded. To see how Service Fabric completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the **[full Service Fabric security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/raw/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines/1.1/service-fabric-security-baseline-v1.1.xlsx)**.

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Ensure that all Virtual Network subnet deployments have a network security group applied with network access controls specific to your application's trusted ports and sources. 

- [Deploy Azure Firewall using a template](../firewall/deploy-template.md)

- [Create perimeter networks by using Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/service-fabric-best-practices#use-network-isolation-and-security-with-azure-service-fabric)

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the virtual network, subnet, and network security group being used to secure your Azure Service Fabric cluster. Enable network security group flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account to traffic audit. You may also send network security groups flow logs to an Azure Log Analytics Workspace and use Azure Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Provide a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. Azure API Management integrates directly with Service Fabric, allowing you to secure access to back-end services, prevent DOS attacks by using throttling, and verify API keys, JWT tokens, certificates, and other credentials.

Consider deploying Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of critical web applications for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Enable Diagnostic Setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics Workspace.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities.  If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed. 

Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or deny malicious traffic.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) that are attached to the subnet your Azure Service Fabric cluster is deployed in. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources related to your Azure Service Fabric cluster. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ServiceFabric" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Service Fabric cluster.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure RBAC controls, and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for network security groups and other resources related to network security and traffic flow that are associated with your Service Fabric cluster. For individual network security groups rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need, duration and so on, for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure command-line interface (CLI) to look up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.
