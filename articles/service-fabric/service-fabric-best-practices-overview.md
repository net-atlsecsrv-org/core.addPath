# Azure Service Fabric application and cluster best practices

This article provides links to best practices for managing Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters. We highly recommend that you implement these practices to optimize the reliability of your production environment. Use one of the [Service Fabric cluster templates](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-cluster-templates) to begin designing your production solution, or update your existing template to incorporate these practices.

## Security

## Compute planning and scaling

* [Best practices for compute scaling](service-fabric-best-practices-capacity-scaling.md)
* [Compute capacity planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity)

## Infrastructure as code
