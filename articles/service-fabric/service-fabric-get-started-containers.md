Running an existing application in a Windows container on a Service Fabric cluster doesn't require any changes to your application. This article walks you through creating a Docker image containing a Python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web application and deploying it to an Azure Service Fabric cluster. You will also share your containerized application through [Azure Container Registry](../container-registry/index.yml). This article assumes a basic understanding of Docker. You can learn about Docker by reading the [Docker Overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/).

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a Windows development environment.  The Service Fabric cluster runtime and the Docker runtime must be running on the same OS.  You cannot run Windows containers on a Linux cluster.


[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

* A development computer running:
  * Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2019.
  * [Service Fabric SDK and tools](service-fabric-get-started.md).
  *  Docker for Windows. [Get Docker CE for Windows (stable)](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows?tab=description). After installing and starting Docker, right-click on the tray icon and select **Switch to Windows containers**. This step is required to run Docker images based on Windows.

* A Windows cluster with three or more nodes running on Windows Server with Containers. 

  For this article, the version (build) of Windows Server with Containers running on your cluster nodes must match that on your development machine. This is because you build the docker image on your development machine and there are compatibility constraints between versions of the container OS and the host OS on which it is deployed. For more information, see [Windows Server container OS and host OS compatibility](#windows-server-container-os-and-host-os-compatibility). 
  
To determine the version of Windows Server with Containers you need for your cluster, run the `ver` command from a Windows command prompt on your development machine:

* If the version contains *x.x.14323.x*, then select *WindowsServer 2016-Datacenter-with-Containers* for the operating system when [creating a cluster](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-portal.md).
  * If the version contains *x.x.16299.x*, then select *WindowsServerSemiAnnual Datacenter-Core-1709-with-Containers* for the operating system when [creating a cluster](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-portal.md).

* A registry in Azure Container Registry - [Create a container registry](../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal.md) in your Azure subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Deploying containers to a Service Fabric cluster running on Windows 10 is supported.  See [this article](service-fabric-how-to-debug-windows-containers.md) for information on how to configure Windows 10 to run Windows containers.
>   

> [!NOTE]
> Service Fabric versions 6.2 and later support deploying containers to clusters running on Windows Server version 1709.

## Define the Docker container

Build an image based on the [Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) located on Docker Hub.

Specify your Docker container in a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile consists of instructions for setting up the environment inside your container, loading the application you want to run, and mapping ports. The Dockerfile is the input to the `docker build` command, which creates the image.

Create an empty directory and create the file *Dockerfile* (with no file extension). Add the following to *Dockerfile* and save your changes:

```
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:2.7-windowsservercore

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Read the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for more information.

## Create a basic web application
Create a Flask web application listening on port 80 that returns `Hello World!`. In the same directory, create the file *requirements.txt*. Add the following and save your changes:
```
Flask
```

Also create the *app.py* file and add the following snippet:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def hello():

    return 'Hello World!'


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

<a id="Build-Containers"></a>
## Build the image
Run the `docker build` command to create the image that runs your web application. Open a PowerShell window and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile. Run the following command:

```
docker build -t helloworldapp .
```

This command builds the new image using the instructions in your Dockerfile, naming (-t tagging) the image `helloworldapp`. To build a container image, the base image is first downloaded down from Docker Hub to which the application is added. 

Once the build command completes, run the `docker images` command to see information on the new image:

```
$ docker images

REPOSITORY                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
helloworldapp                 latest              8ce25f5d6a79        2 minutes ago       10.4 GB
```

## Run the application locally
Verify your image locally before pushing it the container registry. 

Run the application:

```
docker run -d --name my-web-site helloworldapp
```

*name* gives a name to the running container (instead of the container ID).

Once the container starts, find its IP address so that you can connect to your running container from a browser:
```
docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}" my-web-site
```

If that command does not return anything, run the following command and inspect the **NetworkSettings**->**Networks** element for the IP address:
```
docker inspect my-web-site
```

Connect to the running container. Open a web browser pointing to the IP address returned, for example "http:\//172.31.194.61". You should see the heading "Hello World!" display in the browser.

To stop your container, run:

```
docker stop my-web-site
```

Delete the container from your development machine:

```
docker rm my-web-site
```

<a id="Push-Containers"></a>
## Push the image to the container registry

After you verify that the container runs on your development machine, push the image to your registry in Azure Container Registry.

Run ``docker login`` to sign in to your container registry with your [registry credentials](../container-registry/container-registry-authentication.md).

The following example passes the ID and password of an Azure Active Directory [service principal](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). For example, you might have assigned a service principal to your registry for an automation scenario. Or, you could sign in using your registry username and password.

```
docker login myregistry.azurecr.io -u xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx -p myPassword
```

The following command creates a tag, or alias, of the image, with a fully qualified path to your registry. This example places the image in the ```samples``` namespace to avoid clutter in the root of the registry.

```
docker tag helloworldapp myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp
```

Push the image to your container registry:

```
docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp
```

## Create the containerized service in Visual Studio
The Service Fabric SDK and tools provide a service template to help you create a containerized application.

1. Start Visual Studio. Select **File** > **New** > **Project**.
2. Select **Service Fabric application**, name it "MyFirstContainer", and click **OK**.
3. Select **Container** from the list of **service templates**.
4. In **Image Name** enter "myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp", the image you pushed to your container repository.
5. Give your service a name, and click **OK**.

## Configure communication
The containerized service needs an endpoint for communication. Add an `Endpoint` element with the protocol, port, and type to the ServiceManifest.xml file. In this example, a fixed port 8081 is used. If no port is specified, a random port from the application port range is chosen. 

```xml
<Resources>
  <Endpoints>
    <Endpoint Name="Guest1TypeEndpoint" UriScheme="http" Port="8081" Protocol="http"/>
  </Endpoints>
</Resources>
```
> [!NOTE]
> Additional Endpoints for a service can be added by declaring additional EndPoint elements with applicable property values. Each Port can only declare one protocol value.

By defining an endpoint, Service Fabric publishes the endpoint to the Naming service. Other services running in the cluster can resolve this container. You can also perform container-to-container communication using the [reverse proxy](service-fabric-reverseproxy.md). Communication is performed by providing the reverse proxy HTTP listening port and the name of the services that you want to communicate with as environment variables.

The service is listening on a specific port (8081 in this example). When the application deploys to a cluster in Azure, both the cluster and the application run behind an Azure load balancer. The application port must be open in the Azure load balancer so that inbound traffic can get through to the service.  You can open this port in the Azure load balancer using a [PowerShell script](./scripts/service-fabric-powershell-open-port-in-load-balancer.md) or in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Configure and set environment variables
Environment variables can be specified for each code package in the service manifest. This feature is available for all services irrespective of whether they are deployed as containers or processes or guest executables. You can override environment variable values in the application manifest or specify them during deployment as application parameters.

The following service manifest XML snippet shows an example of how to specify environment variables for a code package:
```xml
<CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
  ...
  <EnvironmentVariables>
    <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value=""/>    
  </EnvironmentVariables>
</CodePackage>
```

These environment variables can be overridden in the application manifest:

```xml
<ServiceManifestImport>
  <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="Guest1Pkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
  <EnvironmentOverrides CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
    <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value="19080"/>
  </EnvironmentOverrides>
  ...
</ServiceManifestImport>
```

## Configure container port-to-host port mapping and container-to-container discovery
Configure a host port used to communicate  with the container. The port binding maps the port on which the service is listening inside the container to a port on the host. Add a `PortBinding` element in `ContainerHostPolicies` element of the ApplicationManifest.xml file. For this article, `ContainerPort` is 80 (the container exposes port 80, as specified in the Dockerfile) and `EndpointRef` is "Guest1TypeEndpoint" (the endpoint previously defined in the service manifest). Incoming requests to the service on port 8081 are mapped to port 80 on the container.

```xml
<ServiceManifestImport>
    ...
    <Policies>
        <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
            <PortBinding ContainerPort="80" EndpointRef="Guest1TypeEndpoint"/>
        </ContainerHostPolicies>
    </Policies>
    ...
</ServiceManifestImport>
```
> [!NOTE]
> Additional PortBindings for a service can be added by declaring additional PortBinding elements with applicable property values.

## Configure container repository authentication

See [Container Repository Authentication](configure-container-repository-credentials.md)to learn how to configure different types of authentication for container image downloading.

## Configure isolation mode
Windows supports two isolation modes for containers: process and Hyper-V. With the process isolation mode, all the containers running on the same host machine share the kernel with the host. With the Hyper-V isolation mode, the kernels are isolated between each Hyper-V container and the container host. The isolation mode is specified in the `ContainerHostPolicies` element in the application manifest file. The isolation modes that can be specified are `process`, `hyperv`, and `default`. The default  is process isolation mode on Windows Server hosts. On Windows 10 hosts, only Hyper-V isolation mode is supported, so the container runs in Hyper-V isolation mode regardless of its isolation mode setting. The following snippet shows how the isolation mode is specified in the application manifest file.

```xml
<ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code" Isolation="hyperv">
```
   > [!NOTE]
   > The hyperv isolation mode is available on Ev3 and Dv3 Azure SKUs which have nested virtualization support. 
   >
   >

## Configure resource governance
[Resource governance](service-fabric-resource-governance.md) restricts the resources that the container can use on the host. The `ResourceGovernancePolicy` element, which is specified in the application manifest, is used to declare resource limits for a service code package. Resource limits can be set for the following resources: Memory, MemorySwap, CpuShares (CPU relative weight), MemoryReservationInMB, BlkioWeight (BlockIO relative weight). In this example, service package Guest1Pkg gets one core on the cluster nodes where it is placed. Memory limits are absolute, so the code package is limited to 1024 MB of memory (and a soft-guarantee reservation of the same). Code packages (containers or processes) are not able to allocate more memory than this limit, and attempting to do so results in an out-of-memory exception. For resource limit enforcement to work, all code packages within a service package should have memory limits specified.

```xml
<ServiceManifestImport>
  <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="Guest1Pkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
  <Policies>
    <ServicePackageResourceGovernancePolicy CpuCores="1"/>
    <ResourceGovernancePolicy CodePackageRef="Code" MemoryInMB="1024"  />
  </Policies>
</ServiceManifestImport>
```
## Configure docker HEALTHCHECK 

Starting v6.1, Service Fabric automatically integrates [docker HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) events to its system health report. This means that if your container has **HEALTHCHECK** enabled, Service Fabric will report health whenever the health status of the container changes as reported by Docker. An **OK** health report will appear in [Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md) when the *health_status* is *healthy* and **WARNING** will appear when *health_status* is *unhealthy*. 

Starting with the latest refresh release of v6.4, you have the option to specify that docker HEALTHCHECK evaluations should be reported as an error. If this option is enabled, an **OK** health report will appear when *health_status* is *healthy* and **ERROR** will appear when *health_status* is *unhealthy*.

The **HEALTHCHECK** instruction pointing to the actual check that is performed for monitoring container health must be present in the Dockerfile used while generating the container image.

![Screenshot shows details of the Deployed Service Package NodeServicePackage.][3]

![HealthCheckUnhealthyApp][4]

![HealthCheckUnhealthyDsp][5]

You can configure **HEALTHCHECK**  behavior for each container by specifying **HealthConfig** options as part of **ContainerHostPolicies** in ApplicationManifest.

```xml
<ServiceManifestImport>
    <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="ContainerServicePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="2.0.0" />
    <Policies>
      <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
        <HealthConfig IncludeDockerHealthStatusInSystemHealthReport="true"
		      RestartContainerOnUnhealthyDockerHealthStatus="false" 
		      TreatContainerUnhealthyStatusAsError="false" />
      </ContainerHostPolicies>
    </Policies>
</ServiceManifestImport>
```
By default *IncludeDockerHealthStatusInSystemHealthReport* is set to **true**, *RestartContainerOnUnhealthyDockerHealthStatus* is set to **false**, and *TreatContainerUnhealthyStatusAsError* is set to **false**. 

If *RestartContainerOnUnhealthyDockerHealthStatus* is set to **true**, a container repeatedly reporting unhealthy is restarted (possibly on other nodes).

If *TreatContainerUnhealthyStatusAsError* is set to **true**, **ERROR** health reports will appear when the container's *health_status* is *unhealthy*.

If you want to the disable the **HEALTHCHECK** integration for the entire Service Fabric cluster, you will need to set [EnableDockerHealthCheckIntegration](service-fabric-cluster-fabric-settings.md) to **false**.

## Deploy the container application
Save all your changes and build the application. To publish your application, right-click on **MyFirstContainer** in Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.

In **Connection Endpoint**, enter the management endpoint for the cluster. For example, `containercluster.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com:19000`. You can find the client connection endpoint in the Overview tab for your cluster in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Click **Publish**.

[Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md) is a web-based tool for inspecting and managing applications and nodes in a Service Fabric cluster. Open a browser and navigate to `http://containercluster.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/` and follow the application deployment. The application deploys but is in an error state until the image is downloaded on the cluster nodes (which can take some time, depending on the image size):
![Error][1]

The application is ready when it's in ```Ready``` state:
![Ready][2]

Open a browser and navigate to `http://containercluster.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com:8081`. You should see the heading "Hello World!" display in the browser.

## Clean up

You continue to incur charges while the cluster is running, consider [deleting your cluster](./service-fabric-tutorial-delete-cluster.md).

After you push the image to the container registry, you can delete the local image from your development computer:

```
docker rmi helloworldapp
docker rmi myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp
```

## Windows Server container OS and host OS compatibility

Windows Server containers are not compatible across all versions of a host OS. For example:
 
- Windows Server containers built using Windows Server version 1709 do not work on a host running Windows Server version 2016. 
- Windows Server containers built using Windows Server 2016 work in Hyper-V isolation mode only on a host running Windows Server version 1709. 
- With Windows Server containers built using Windows Server 2016, it might be necessary to ensure that the revision of the container OS and host OS are the same when running in process isolation mode on a host running Windows Server 2016.
 
To learn more, see [Windows Container Version Compatibility](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility).

Consider the compatibility of the host OS and your container OS when building and deploying containers to your Service Fabric cluster. For example:

- Make sure you deploy containers with an OS compatible with the OS on your cluster nodes.
- Make sure that the isolation mode specified for your container app is consistent with support for the container OS on the node where it is being deployed.
- Consider how OS upgrades to your cluster nodes or containers may affect their compatibility. 

We recommend the following practices to make sure that containers are deployed correctly on your Service Fabric cluster:

- Use explicit image tagging with your Docker images to specify the version of Windows Server OS that a container is built from. 
- Use [OS tagging](#specify-os-build-specific-container-images) in your application manifest file to make sure that your application is compatible across different Windows Server versions and upgrades.

> [!NOTE]
> With Service Fabric version 6.2 and later, you can deploy containers based on Windows Server 2016 locally on a Windows 10 host. On Windows 10, containers run in Hyper-V isolation mode, regardless of the isolation mode set in the application manifest. To learn more, see [Configure isolation mode](#configure-isolation-mode).   
>
 
## Specify OS build specific container images 

Windows Server containers may not be compatible across different versions of the OS. For example, Windows Server containers built using Windows Server 2016 do not work on Windows Server version 1709 in process isolation mode. Hence, if cluster nodes are updated to the latest version, container services built using the earlier versions of the OS may fail. To circumvent this with version 6.1 of the runtime and newer, Service Fabric supports specifying multiple OS images per container and tagging them with the build versions of the OS in the application manifest. You can get the build version of the OS by running `winver` at a Windows command prompt. Update the application manifests and specify image overrides per OS version before updating the OS on the nodes. The following snippet shows how to specify multiple container images in the application manifest, **ApplicationManifest.xml**:


```xml
      <ContainerHostPolicies> 
         <ImageOverrides> 
	       <Image Name="myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldappDefault" /> 
               <Image Name="myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp1701" Os="14393" /> 
               <Image Name="myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp1709" Os="16299" /> 
         </ImageOverrides> 
      </ContainerHostPolicies> 
```
The build version for WIndows Server 2016 is 14393, and the build version for Windows Server version 1709 is 16299. The service manifest continues to specify only one image per container service as the following shows:

```xml
<ContainerHost>
    <ImageName>myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp</ImageName> 
</ContainerHost>
```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The OS build version tagging features is only available for Service Fabric on Windows
   >

If the underlying OS on the VM is build 16299 (version 1709), Service Fabric picks the container image corresponding to that Windows Server version. If an untagged container image is also provided alongside tagged container images in the application manifest, then Service Fabric treats the untagged image as one that works across versions. Tag the container images explicitly to avoid issues during upgrades.

The untagged container image will work as an override for the one provide in the ServiceManifest. So image "myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldappDefault" will override the ImageName "myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp" in the ServiceManifest.

## Configure time interval before container is force terminated

You can configure a time interval for the runtime to wait before the container is removed after the service deletion (or a move to another node) has started. Configuring the time interval sends the `docker stop <time in seconds>` command to the container.  For more detail, see [docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/). The time interval to wait is specified under the `Hosting` section. The `Hosting` section can be added at cluster creation or later in a configuration upgrade. The following cluster manifest snippet shows how to set the wait interval:

```json
"fabricSettings": [
	...,
	{
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
                "name": "ContainerDeactivationTimeout",
                "value" : "10"
          },
	      ...
        ]
	}
]
```
The default time interval is set to 10 seconds. Since this configuration is dynamic, a config only upgrade on the cluster updates the timeout. 


## Configure the runtime to remove unused container images

You can configure the Service Fabric cluster to remove unused container images from the node. This configuration allows disk space to be recaptured if too many container images are present on the node. To enable this feature, update the [Hosting](service-fabric-cluster-fabric-settings.md#hosting) section in the cluster manifest as shown in the following snippet: 


```json
"fabricSettings": [
	...,
	{
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
                "name": "PruneContainerImages",
                "value": "True"
          },
          {
                "name": "ContainerImagesToSkip",
                "value": "microsoft/windowsservercore|microsoft/nanoserver|microsoft/dotnet-frameworku|..."
          }
          ...
          }
        ]
	} 
]
```

For images that shouldn't be deleted, you can specify them under the `ContainerImagesToSkip` parameter.  


## Configure container image download time

The Service Fabric runtime allocates 20 minutes to download and extract container images, which work for the majority of container images. For large images, or when the network connection is slow, it might be necessary to increase the time to wait before aborting the image download and extraction. This time out is set using the **ContainerImageDownloadTimeout** attribute in the **Hosting** section of the cluster manifest as shown in the following snippet:

```json
"fabricSettings": [
	...,
	{
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
              "name": "ContainerImageDownloadTimeout",
              "value": "1200"
          }
        ]
	}
]
```


## Set container retention policy

To assist with diagnosing container startup failures, Service Fabric (version 6.1 or higher) supports retaining containers that terminated or failed to startup. This policy can be set in the **ApplicationManifest.xml** file as shown in the following snippet:

```xml
 <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="NodeService.Code" Isolation="process" ContainersRetentionCount="2"  RunInteractive="true"> 
```

The setting **ContainersRetentionCount** specifies the number of containers to retain when they fail. If a negative value is specified, all failing containers will be retained. When the **ContainersRetentionCount**  attribute is not specified, no containers will be retained. The attribute **ContainersRetentionCount** also supports Application Parameters so users can specify different values for test and production clusters. Use placement constraints to target the container service to a particular node when using this feature to prevent the container service from moving to other nodes. 
Any containers retained using this feature must be manually removed.

## Start the Docker daemon with custom arguments

With the 6.2 version of the Service Fabric runtime and greater, you can start the Docker daemon with custom arguments. When custom arguments are specified, Service Fabric does not pass any other argument to docker engine except the `--pidfile` argument. Hence, `--pidfile` shouldn't be passed as an argument. Additionally, the argument should continue to have the docker daemon listen on the default name pipe on Windows (or unix domain socket on Linux) for Service Fabric to communicate with the Daemon. The custom arguments are passed in the cluster manifest under the **Hosting** section under **ContainerServiceArguments** as shown in the following snippet: 
 

```json
"fabricSettings": [
	...,
	{ 
        "name": "Hosting", 
        "parameters": [ 
          { 
            "name": "ContainerServiceArguments", 
            "value": "-H localhost:1234 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock" 
          } 
        ] 
	} 
]
```
