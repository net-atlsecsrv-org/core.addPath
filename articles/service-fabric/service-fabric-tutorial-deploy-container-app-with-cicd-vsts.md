# Tutorial: Deploy a container application with CI/CD to a Service Fabric cluster

This tutorial is part two of a series and describes how to set up continuous integration and deployment for an Azure Service Fabric container application using Visual Studio and Azure DevOps.  An existing Service Fabric application is needed, the application created in [Deploy a .NET application in a Windows container to Azure Service Fabric](service-fabric-host-app-in-a-container.md) is used as an example.

In part two of the series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add source control to your project
> * Create a build definition in Visual Studio Team Explorer
> * Create a release definition in Visual Studio Team Explorer
> * Automatically deploy and upgrade an application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* Have a cluster on Azure, or [create one with this tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md)
* [Deploy a containerized application to it](service-fabric-host-app-in-a-container.md)

## Prepare a publish profile

Now that you've [deployed a container application](service-fabric-host-app-in-a-container.md), you're ready to set up continuous integration.  First, prepare a publish profile within your application for use by the deployment process that executes within Azure DevOps.  The publish profile should be configured to target the cluster that you've previously created.  Start Visual Studio and open an existing Service Fabric application project.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the application and select **Publish...**.

Choose a target profile within your application project to use for your continuous integration workflow, for example Cloud.  Specify the cluster connection endpoint.  Check the **Upgrade the Application** checkbox so that your application upgrades for each deployment in Azure DevOps.  Click the **Save** hyperlink to save the settings to the publish profile and then click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

## Share your Visual Studio solution to a new Azure DevOps Git repo

Share your application source files to a team project in Azure DevOps so you can generate builds.

Create a new local Git repo for your project by selecting **Add to Source Control** -> **Git** on the status bar in the lower right-hand corner of Visual Studio.

In the **Push** view in **Team Explorer**, select the **Publish Git Repo** button under **Push to Azure DevOps**.

![Screenshot of the Team Explorer - Synchronization window in Visual Studio. Under Push to Azure DevOps, the Publish to Git Repo button is highlighted.][push-git-repo]

Verify your email and select your organization in the **Account** drop-down. You may have to set up an organization if you don't already have one. Enter your repository name and select **Publish repository**.

![Screenshot of the Push to Azure DevOps window. The settings for Email, Account, Repository name, and the Publish Repository button are highlighted.][publish-code]

Publishing the repository creates a new team project in your account with the same name as the local repo. To create the repository in an existing team project, click **Advanced** next to **Repository** name and select a team project. You can view your code on the web by selecting **See it on the web**.

## Configure Continuous Delivery with Azure Pipelines

An Azure DevOps build definition describes a workflow that is composed of a set of build steps that are executed sequentially. Create a build definition that produces a Service Fabric application package, and other artifacts, to deploy to a Service Fabric cluster. Learn more about Azure DevOps [build definitions](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/build/define/create). 

An Azure DevOps release definition describes a workflow that deploys an application package to a cluster. When used together, the build definition and release definition execute the entire workflow starting with source files to ending with a running application in your cluster. Learn more about Azure DevOps [release definitions](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/release/author-release-definition/more-release-definition).

### Create a build definition

Open your new team project by navigating to https://dev.azure.com in a web browser and selecting your organization, followed by the new project. 

Select the **Pipelines** option on the left panel, then click **New Pipeline**.

>[!NOTE]
>If you do not see the build definition template, make sure the **New YAML pipeline creation experience** feature is turned off. This feature is configured within the **Preview Features** section of your DevOps account.

![New Pipeline][new-pipeline]

Select **Azure Repos Git** as source, your Team project name, your project Repository, and **master** Default branch or manual and scheduled builds.  Then click **Continue**.

In **Select a template**, select the **Azure Service Fabric application with Docker support** template and click **Apply**.

![Choose build template][select-build-template]

In **Tasks**, select **Hosted VS2017** as the **Agent pool**.

![Select tasks][task-agent-pool]

Click **Tag images**.

In **Container Registry Type**, select **Azure Container Registry**. Select an **Azure Subscription**, then click **Authorize**. Select an **Azure Container Registry**.

![Select Docker Tag images][select-tag-images]

Click **Push images**.

In **Container Registry Type**, select **Azure Container Registry**. Select an **Azure Subscription**, then click **Authorize**. Select an **Azure Container Registry**.

![Select Docker Push images][select-push-images]

Under the **Triggers** tab, enable continuous integration by checking **Enable continuous integration**. Within **Branch filters**, click **+ Add**, and the **Branch specification** will default to **master**.

In the **Save build pipeline and queue dialog**, click **Save & queue** to manually start a build.

![Select triggers][save-and-queue]

Builds also trigger upon push or check-in. To check your build progress, switch to the **Builds** tab.  Once you verify that the build executes successfully, define a release definition that deploys your application to a cluster.

### Create a release definition

Select the **Pipelines** option on the left panel, then **Releases**, then **+ New pipeline**.  In **Select a template**, select the **Azure Service Fabric Deployment** template from the list and then **Apply**.

![Choose release template][select-release-template]

Select **Tasks**, then **Environment 1**, and then **+New** to add a new cluster connection.

![Add cluster connection][add-cluster-connection]

In the **Add new Service Fabric Connection** view select **Certificate Based** or **Azure Active Directory** authentication.  Specify a connection name of "mysftestcluster" and a cluster endpoint of "tcp://mysftestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000" (or the endpoint of the cluster you are deploying to).

For certificate based authentication, add the **Server certificate thumbprint** of the server certificate used to create the cluster.  In **Client certificate**, add the base-64 encoding of the client certificate file. See the help pop-up on that field for info on how to get that base-64 encoded representation of the certificate. Also add the **Password** for the certificate.  You can use the cluster or server certificate if you don't have a separate client certificate.

For Azure Active Directory credentials, add the **Server certificate thumbprint** of the server certificate used to create the cluster and the credentials you want to use to connect to the cluster in the **Username** and **Password** fields.

Click **Add** to save the cluster connection.



Under Agent Phase, click **Deploy Service Fabric Application**.
Click **Docker Settings** and then click **Configure Docker settings**. In **Registry Credentials Source**, select **Azure Resource Manager Service Connection**. Then select your **Azure subscription**.

![Release pipeline agent][release-pipeline-agent]

Next, add a build artifact to the pipeline so the release definition can find the output from the build. Select **Pipeline** and **Artifacts**->**+Add**.  In **Source (Build definition)**, select the build definition you created previously.  Click **Add** to save the build artifact.

![Add artifact][add-artifact]

Enable a continuous deployment trigger so that a release is automatically created when the build completes. Click the lightning icon in the artifact, enable the trigger, and click **Save** to save the release definition.

![Enable trigger][enable-trigger]

Select **+ Release** -> **Create a Release** -> **Create** to manually create a release. You can monitor the release progress in the **Releases** tab.

Verify that the deployment succeeded and the application is running in the cluster.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://mysftestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/`.  Note the application version, in this example it is "1.0.0.20170616.3".

## Commit and push changes, trigger a release

To verify that the continuous integration pipeline is functioning by checking in some code changes to Azure DevOps.

As you write your code, your changes are automatically tracked by Visual Studio. Commit changes to your local Git repository by selecting the pending changes icon (![Pending changes icon shows a pencil and a number.][pending]) from the status bar in the bottom right.

On the **Changes** view in Team Explorer, add a message describing your update and commit your changes.

![Commit all][changes]

Select the unpublished changes status bar icon (![Unpublished changes][unpublished-changes]) or the Sync view in Team Explorer. Select **Push** to update your code in Azure DevOps.

![Push changes][push]

Pushing the changes to Azure DevOps automatically triggers a build.  When the build definition successfully completes, a release is automatically created and starts upgrading the application on the cluster.

To check your build progress, switch to the **Builds** tab in **Team Explorer** in Visual Studio.  Once you verify that the build executes successfully, define a release definition that deploys your application to a cluster.

Verify that the deployment succeeded and the application is running in the cluster.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://mysftestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/`.  Note the application version, in this example it is "1.0.0.20170815.3".

## Update the application

Make code changes in the application.  Save and commit the changes, following the previous steps.

Once the upgrade of the application begins, you can watch the upgrade progress in Service Fabric Explorer:

![Screenshot of the Voting app in Service Fabric Explorer. An "Upgrade in Progress" message is highlighted and the app Status is "Upgrading".][sfx2]

The application upgrade may take several minutes. When the upgrade is complete, the application will be running the next version.  In this example "1.0.0.20170815.4".
