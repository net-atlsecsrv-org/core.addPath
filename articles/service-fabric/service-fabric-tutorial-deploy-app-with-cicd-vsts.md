# Tutorial: Deploy an application with CI/CD to a Service Fabric cluster

This tutorial is part four of a series and describes how to set up continuous integration and deployment for an Azure Service Fabric application using Azure Pipelines.  An existing Service Fabric application is needed, the application created in [Build a .NET application](service-fabric-tutorial-create-dotnet-app.md) is used as an example.

In part three of the series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add source control to your project
> * Create a build pipeline in Azure Pipelines
> * Create a release pipeline in Azure Pipelines
> * Automatically deploy and upgrade an application

In this tutorial series you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Build a .NET Service Fabric application](service-fabric-tutorial-create-dotnet-app.md)
> * [Deploy the application to a remote cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-app-to-party-cluster.md)
> * [Add an HTTPS endpoint to an ASP.NET Core front-end service](service-fabric-tutorial-dotnet-app-enable-https-endpoint.md)
> * Configure CI/CD using Azure Pipelines
> * [Set up monitoring and diagnostics for the application](service-fabric-tutorial-monitoring-aspnet.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
* [Install Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and install the **Azure development** and **ASP.NET and web development** workloads.
* [Install the Service Fabric SDK](service-fabric-get-started.md)
* Create a Windows Service Fabric cluster on Azure, for example by [following this tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md)
* Create an [Azure DevOps organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization-msa-or-work-student). This allows you to create a project in Azure DevOps and use Azure Pipelines.

## Download the Voting sample application

If you did not build the Voting sample application in [part one of this tutorial series](service-fabric-tutorial-create-dotnet-app.md), you can download it. In a command window, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your local machine.

```git
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-quickstart
```

## Prepare a publish profile

Now that you've [created an application](service-fabric-tutorial-create-dotnet-app.md) and have [deployed the application to Azure](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-app-to-party-cluster.md), you're ready to set up continuous integration.  First, prepare a publish profile within your application for use by the deployment process that executes within Azure Pipelines.  The publish profile should be configured to target the cluster that you've previously created.  Start Visual Studio and open an existing Service Fabric application project.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the application and select **Publish...**.

Choose a target profile within your application project to use for your continuous integration workflow, for example Cloud.  Specify the cluster connection endpoint.  Check the **Upgrade the Application** checkbox so that your application upgrades for each deployment in Azure DevOps.  Click the **Save** hyperlink to save the settings to the publish profile and then click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

![Push profile][publish-app-profile]

## Share your Visual Studio solution to a new Azure DevOps Git repo

Share your application source files to a project in Azure DevOps so you can generate builds.

Create a new local Git repo for your project by selecting **Add to Source Control** -> **Git** on the status bar in the lower right-hand corner of Visual Studio.

In the **Push** view in **Team Explorer**, select the **Publish Git Repo** button under **Push to Azure DevOps**.

![Push Git repo][push-git-repo]

Verify your email and select your account in the **Azure DevOps Domain** drop-down. Enter your repository name and select **Publish repository**.

![Push Git repo][publish-code]

Publishing the repo creates a new project in your account with the same name as the local repo. To create the repo in an existing project, click **Advanced** next to **Repository** name and select a project. You can view your code on the web by selecting **See it on the web**.

## Configure Continuous Delivery with Azure Pipelines

An Azure Pipelines build pipeline describes a workflow that is composed of a set of build steps that are executed sequentially. Create a build pipeline that produces a Service Fabric application package, and other artifacts, to deploy to a Service Fabric cluster. Learn more about [Azure Pipelines build pipelines](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/build/define/create). 

An Azure Pipelines release pipeline describes a workflow that deploys an application package to a cluster. When used together, the build pipeline and release pipeline execute the entire workflow starting with source files to ending with a running application in your cluster. Learn more about [Azure Pipelines release pipelines](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/release/author-release-definition/more-release-definition).

### Create a build pipeline

Open a web browser and navigate to your new project at: [https://&lt;myaccount&gt;.visualstudio.com/Voting/Voting%20Team/_git/Voting](https://myaccount.visualstudio.com/Voting/Voting%20Team/_git/Voting).

Select the **Pipelines** tab, then **Builds**, then click **New Pipeline**.

![New Pipeline][new-pipeline]

Select **Azure Repos Git** as source, **Voting** Team project, **Voting** Repository, and **master** Default branch for manual and scheduled builds.  Then click **Continue**.

![Select repo][select-repo]

In **Select a template**, select the **Azure Service Fabric application** template and click **Apply**.

![Choose build template][select-build-template]

In **Tasks**, enter "Hosted VS2017" as the **Agent pool**.

![Select tasks][save-and-queue]

Under **Triggers**, enable continuous integration by checking **Enable continuous integration**. Within **Branch filters**, the **Branch specification** defaults to **master**. Select **Save and queue** to manually start a build.

![Select triggers][save-and-queue2]

Builds also trigger upon push or check-in. To check your build progress, switch to the **Builds** tab.  Once you verify that the build executes successfully, define a release pipeline that deploys your application to a cluster.

### Create a release pipeline

Select the **Pipelines** tab, then **Releases**, then **+ New pipeline**.  In **Select a template**, select the **Azure Service Fabric Deployment** template from the list and then **Apply**.

![Choose release template][select-release-template]

Select **Tasks**->**Environment 1** and then **+New** to add a new cluster connection.

![Add cluster connection][add-cluster-connection]

In the **Add new Service Fabric Connection** view select **Certificate Based** or **Azure Active Directory** authentication.  Specify a connection name of "mysftestcluster" and a cluster endpoint of "tcp://mysftestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000" (or the endpoint of the cluster you are deploying to).

For certificate-based authentication, add the **Server certificate thumbprint** of the server certificate used to create the cluster.  In **Client certificate**, add the base-64 encoding of the client certificate file. See the help pop-up on that field for info on how to get that base-64 encoded representation of the certificate. Also add the **Password** for the certificate.  You can use the cluster or server certificate if you don't have a separate client certificate.

For Azure Active Directory credentials, add the **Server certificate thumbprint** of the server certificate used to create the cluster and the credentials you want to use to connect to the cluster in the **Username** and **Password** fields.

Click **Add** to save the cluster connection.

Next, add a build artifact to the pipeline so the release pipeline can find the output from the build. Select **Pipeline** and **Artifacts**->**+Add**.  In **Source (Build definition)**, select the build pipeline you created previously.  Click **Add** to save the build artifact.

![Add artifact][add-artifact]

Enable a continuous deployment trigger so that a release is automatically created when the build completes. Click the lightning icon in the artifact, enable the trigger, and click **Save** to save the release pipeline.

![Enable trigger][enable-trigger]

Select **+ Release** -> **Create a Release** -> **Create** to manually create a release. You can monitor the release progress in the **Releases** tab.

Verify that the deployment succeeded and the application is running in the cluster.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://mysftestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/`.  Note the application version, in this example it is "1.0.0.20170616.3".

## Commit and push changes, trigger a release

To verify that the continuous integration pipeline is functioning by checking in some code changes to Azure DevOps.

As you write your code, your changes are automatically tracked by Visual Studio. Commit changes to your local Git repository by selecting the pending changes icon (![Pending][pending]) from the status bar in the bottom right.

On the **Changes** view in Team Explorer, add a message describing your update and commit your changes.

![Commit all][changes]

Select the unpublished changes status bar icon (![Unpublished changes][unpublished-changes]) or the Sync view in Team Explorer. Select **Push** to update your code in Azure Pipelines.

![Push changes][push]

Pushing the changes to Azure Pipelines automatically triggers a build.  When the build pipeline successfully completes, a release is automatically created and starts upgrading the application on the cluster.

To check your build progress, switch to the **Builds** tab in **Team Explorer** in Visual Studio.  Once you verify that the build executes successfully, define a release pipeline that deploys your application to a cluster.

Verify that the deployment succeeded and the application is running in the cluster.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://mysftestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/`.  Note the application version, in this example it is "1.0.0.20170815.3".

## Update the application

Make code changes in the application.  Save and commit the changes, following the previous steps.

Once the upgrade of the application begins, you can watch the upgrade progress in Service Fabric Explorer:

![Service Fabric Explorer][sfx2]

The application upgrade may take several minutes. When the upgrade is complete, the application will be running the next version.  In this example "1.0.0.20170815.4".
