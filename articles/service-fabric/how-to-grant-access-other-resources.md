# Granting a Service Fabric application's managed identity access to Azure resources

Before the application can use its managed identity to access other resources, permissions must be granted to that identity on the protected Azure resource being accessed. Granting permissions is typically a management action on the 'control plane' of the Azure service owning the protected resource routed via Azure Resource Manager, which will enforce any applicable role-based access checking.

The exact sequence of steps will then depend on the type of Azure resource being accessed, as well as the language/client used to grant permissions. The remainder of the article assumes a user-assigned identity assigned to the application and includes several typical examples for your convenience, but it is in no way an exhaustive reference for this topic; consult the documentation of the respective Azure services for up-to-date instructions on granting permissions.  

## Granting access to Azure Storage
You can use the Service Fabric application's managed identity (user-assigned in this case) to retrieve the data from an Azure storage blob. Grant the identity the required permissions in the Azure portal with the following steps:

1. Navigate to the storage account
2. Click the Access control (IAM) link in the left panel.
3. (optional) Check existing access: select System- or User-assigned managed identity in the 'Find' control; select the appropriate identity from the ensuing result list
4. Click + Add role assignment on top of the page to add a new role assignment for the application's identity.
Under Role, from the dropdown, select Storage Blob Data Reader.
5. In the next dropdown, under Assign access to, choose `User assigned managed identity`.
6. Next, ensure the proper subscription is listed in Subscription dropdown and then set Resource Group to All resource groups.
7. Under Select, choose the UAI corresponding to the Service Fabric application and then click Save.

Support for system-assigned Service Fabric managed identities does not include integration in the Azure portal; if your application uses a system-assigned identity, you will have to find first the client ID of the application's identity, and then repeat the steps above but selecting the `Azure AD user, group, or service principal` option in the Find control.

## Granting access to Azure Key Vault
Similarly with accessing storage, you can leverage the managed identity of a Service Fabric application to access an Azure key vault. The steps for granting access in the Azure portal are similar to those listed above, and won't be repeated here. Refer to the image below for differences.

![Key Vault access policy](../key-vault/media/vs-secure-secret-appsettings/add-keyvault-access-policy.png)

The following example illustrates granting access to a vault via a template deployment; add the snippet(s) below as another entry under the `resources` element of the template. The sample demonstrates access granting for both user-assigned and system-assigned identity types, respectively - choose the applicable one.

```json
	# under 'variables':
  "variables": {
		"userAssignedIdentityResourceId" : "[resourceId('Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/', parameters('userAssignedIdentityName'))]",
	}
	# under 'resources':
	{
		"type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies",
		"name": "[concat(parameters('keyVaultName'), '/add')]",
		"apiVersion": "2018-02-14",
		"properties": {
			"accessPolicies": [
				{
					"tenantId": "[reference(variables('userAssignedIdentityResourceId'), '2018-11-30').tenantId]",
					"objectId": "[reference(variables('userAssignedIdentityResourceId'), '2018-11-30').principalId]",
					"dependsOn": [
						"[variables('userAssignedIdentityResourceId')]"
					],
					"permissions": {
						"keys":         ["get", "list"],
						"secrets":      ["get", "list"],
						"certificates": ["get", "list"]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	},
```
And for system-assigned managed identities:
```json
	# under 'variables':
  "variables": {
		"sfAppSystemAssignedIdentityResourceId": "[concat(resourceId('Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters/applications/', parameters('clusterName'), parameters('applicationName')), '/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/Identities/default')]"
	}
	# under 'resources':
	{
		"type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies",
		"name": "[concat(parameters('keyVaultName'), '/add')]",
		"apiVersion": "2018-02-14",
		"properties": {
			"accessPolicies": [
			{
					"name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('applicationName'))]",
					"tenantId": "[reference(variables('sfAppSystemAssignedIdentityResourceId'), '2018-11-30').tenantId]",
					"objectId": "[reference(variables('sfAppSystemAssignedIdentityResourceId'), '2018-11-30').principalId]",
					"dependsOn": [
						"[variables('sfAppSystemAssignedIdentityResourceId')]"
					],
					"permissions": {
						"secrets": [
							"get",
							"list"
						],
						"certificates": 
						[
							"get", 
							"list"
						]
					}
			},
		]
		}
	}
```
