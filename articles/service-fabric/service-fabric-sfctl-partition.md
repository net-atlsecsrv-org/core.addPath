## sfctl partition data-loss
This API will induce data loss for the specified partition.

It will trigger a call to the OnDataLossAsync API of the partition.  This API will induce data loss for the specified partition. It will trigger a call to the OnDataLoss API of the partition. Actual data loss will depend on the specified DataLossMode.
- PartialDataLoss: Only a quorum of replicas are removed and OnDataLoss is triggered for the partition but actual data loss depends on the presence of in-flight replication.  
- FullDataLoss: All replicas are removed hence all data is lost and OnDataLoss is triggered. This API should only be called with a stateful service as the target. Calling this API with a system service as the target is not advised.

> [!NOTE] 	
> Once this API has been called, it cannot be reversed. Calling CancelOperation will only stop execution and clean up internal system state. It will not restore data if the command has progressed far enough to cause data loss. Call the GetDataLossProgress API with the same OperationId to return information on the operation started with this API.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --data-loss-mode [Required] | This enum is passed to the StartDataLoss API to indicate what type of data loss to induce. |
| --operation-id   [Required] | A GUID that identifies a call of this API.  This is passed into the corresponding GetProgress API. |
| --partition-id   [Required] | The identity of the partition. |
| --service-id     [Required] | The identity of the service. This ID is typically the full name of the service without the 'fabric\:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "\~" character. For example, if the service name is "fabric\:/myapp/app1/svc1", the service identity would be "myapp\~app1\~svc1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1/svc1" in previous versions. |

Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the service based on the health state. Use ReplicasHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of ReplicaHealthState objects on the partition. If you specify a partition that does not exist in the health store, this request returns an error.

The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values, obtained using the bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  <br> - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  <br> - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  <br> - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  <br> - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning.

## sfctl partition report-health
Sends a health report on the Service Fabric partition.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric partition. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Partition, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, check that the report appears in the events section.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --health-property [Required] | The property of the health information. <br><br> An entity can have health reports for different properties. The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node. Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information. |
| --health-state    [Required] | Possible values include\: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'. |
| --partition-id    [Required] | The identity of the partition. |
| --source-id       [Required] | The source name that identifies the client/watchdog/system component that generated the health information. |
| --description | The description of the health information. <br><br> It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters. If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string. |
| --immediate | A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. <br><br> A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. |
| --remove-when-expired | Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires. <br><br> If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires. If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (e.g. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state. |
| --sequence-number | The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. <br><br> The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added. |
| --timeout -t | Default\: 60. |
| --ttl | The duration for which this health report is valid. This field uses ISO8601 format for specifying the duration. <br><br> When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite. When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value. |

| --debug | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs. |
| --help -h | Show this help message and exit. |

| --verbose | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs. |

## sfctl partition restart
This API will restart some or all replicas or instances of the specified partition.

This API is useful for testing failover. If used to target a stateless service partition, RestartPartitionMode must be AllReplicasOrInstances. Call the GetPartitionRestartProgress API using the same OperationId to get the progress.

### Arguments

For example, if the service name is "fabric\:/myapp/app1/svc1", the service identity would be "myapp\~app1\~svc1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1/svc1" in previous versions. |
| --timeout -t | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.  Default\: 60. |
