# Supported Service Fabric versions

Make sure your cluster is always running a supported Azure Service Fabric version. A minimum of 60 days after we announce the release of a new version of Service Fabric, support for the previous version ends. You'll find announcements of new releases on the [Service Fabric team blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=service-fabric).

Refer to the following documents for details on how to keep your cluster running a supported Service Fabric version:

- [Upgrade an Azure Service Fabric cluster](service-fabric-cluster-upgrade.md)
- [Upgrade the Service Fabric version that runs on your standalone Windows Server cluster](service-fabric-cluster-upgrade-windows-server.md)
