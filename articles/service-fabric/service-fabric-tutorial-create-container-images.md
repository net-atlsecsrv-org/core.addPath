# Tutorial: Create container images on a Linux Service Fabric cluster

This tutorial is part one of a tutorial series that demonstrates how to use containers in a Linux Service Fabric cluster. In this tutorial, a multi-container application is prepared for use with Service Fabric. In subsequent tutorials, these images are used as part of a Service Fabric application. In this tutorial you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Clone application source from GitHub
> * Create a container image from the application source
> * Deploy an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance
> * Tag a container image for ACR
> * Upload the image to ACR

In this tutorial series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create container images for Service Fabric
> * [Build and Run a Service Fabric Application with Containers](service-fabric-tutorial-package-containers.md)
> * [How failover and scaling are handled in Service Fabric](service-fabric-tutorial-containers-failover.md)

## Prerequisites

* Linux development environment set up for Service Fabric. Follow the instructions [here](service-fabric-get-started-linux.md) to set up your Linux environment.
* This tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* Additionally, it requires that you have an Azure subscription available. For more information on a free trial version, go [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Get application code

The sample application used in this tutorial is a voting app. The application consists of a front-end web component and a back-end Redis instance. The components are packaged into container images.

Use git to download a copy of the application to your development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-containers.git

cd service-fabric-containers/Linux/container-tutorial/
```

The solution contains two folders and a 'docker-compose.yml' file. The 'azure-vote' folder contains the Python frontend service along with the Dockerfile used to build the image. The 'Voting' directory contains the Service Fabric application package that is deployed to the cluster. These directories contain the necessary assets for this tutorial.

## Create container images

Inside the **azure-vote** directory, run the following command to build the image for the front-end web component. This command uses the Dockerfile in this directory to build the image.

```bash
docker build -t azure-vote-front .
```
> [!Note]
> If you are getting permission denied then follow [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) documentation on how to work with docker without sudo.

This command can take some time since all the necessary dependencies need to be pulled from Docker Hub. When completed, use the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command to see the created images.

```bash
docker images
```

Notice that two images have been downloaded or created. The *azure-vote-front* image contains the application. It was derived from a *python* image from Docker Hub.

```bash
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
azure-vote-front             latest              052c549a75bf        About a minute ago   708MB
tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask   python3.6           590e17342131        5 days ago           707MB

```

## Deploy Azure Container Registry

First run the **az login** command to sign in to your Azure account.

```azurecli
az login
```

Next, use the **az account** command to choose your subscription to create the Azure Container registry. You have to enter the subscription ID of your Azure subscription in place of <subscription_id>.

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
```

When deploying an Azure Container Registry, you first need a resource group. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with the **az group create** command. In this example, a resource group named *myResourceGroup* is created in the *westus* region.

```azurecli
az group create --name <myResourceGroup> --location westus
```

Create an Azure Container registry with the **az acr create** command. Replace \<acrName> with the name of the container registry you want to create under your subscription. This name must be alphanumeric and unique.

```azurecli
az acr create --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <acrName> --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
```

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we use "acrName" as a placeholder for the container registry name that you chose. Please make note of this value.

## Sign in to your container registry

Sign in to your ACR instance before pushing images to it. Use the **az acr login** command to complete the operation. Provide the unique name given to the container registry when it was created.

```azurecli
az acr login --name <acrName>
```

The command returns a 'Login Succeededâ€™ message once completed.

## Tag container images

Each container image needs to be tagged with the loginServer name of the registry. This tag is used for routing when pushing container images to an image registry.

To see a list of current images, use the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command.

```bash
docker images
```

Output:

```bash
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
azure-vote-front             latest              052c549a75bf        About a minute ago   708MB
tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask   python3.6           590e17342131        5 days ago           707MB
```

To get the loginServer name, run the following command:

```azurecli
az acr show --name <acrName> --query loginServer --output table
```

This outputs a table with the following results. This result will be used to tag your **azure-vote-front** image before pushing it to the container registry in the next step.

```output
Result
------------------
<acrName>.azurecr.io
```

Now, tag the *azure-vote-front* image with the loginServer of your container registry. Also, add `:v1` to the end of the image name. This tag indicates the image version.

```bash
docker tag azure-vote-front <acrName>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
```

Once tagged, run 'docker images' to verify the operation.

Output:

```output
REPOSITORY                             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
azure-vote-front                       latest              052c549a75bf        23 minutes ago      708MB
<acrName>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front   v1                  052c549a75bf       23 minutes ago      708MB
tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask             python3.6           590e17342131        5 days ago          707MB

```

## Push images to registry

Push the *azure-vote-front* image to the registry. 

Using the following example, replace the ACR loginServer name with the loginServer from your environment.

```bash
docker push <acrName>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
```

The docker push commands take a couple of minutes to complete.

## List images in registry

To return a list of images that have been pushed to your Azure Container registry, use the [az acr repository list](/cli/azure/acr/repository) command. Update the command with the ACR instance name.

```azurecli
az acr repository list --name <acrName> --output table
```

Output:

```output
Result
----------------
azure-vote-front
```

At tutorial completion, the container image has been stored in a private Azure Container Registry instance. This image is deployed from ACR to a Service Fabric cluster in subsequent tutorials.
