## sfctl node disable
Deactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation intent.

Deactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation intent. Once the deactivation is in progress, the deactivation intent can be increased, but not decreased (for example, a node that is deactivated with the Pause intent can be deactivated further with Restart, but not the other way around. Nodes may be reactivated using the Activate a node operation any time after they are deactivated. If the deactivation is not complete, this will cancel the deactivation. A node that goes down and comes back up while deactivated will still need to be reactivated before services will be placed on that node.

## sfctl node health
Gets the health of a Service Fabric node.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric node. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the node based on the health state. If the node that you specify by name does not exist in the health store, this returns an error.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|

| --events-health-state-filter | Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values, obtained using the bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.  <br> - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  <br> - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  <br> - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  <br> - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  <br> - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  <br> - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535. |

## sfctl node remove-state
Notifies Service Fabric that the persisted state on a node has been permanently removed or lost.

This implies that it is not possible to recover the persisted state of that node. This generally happens if a hard disk has been wiped clean, or if a hard disk crashes. The node has to be down for this operation to be successful. This operation lets Service Fabric know that the replicas on that node no longer exist, and that Service Fabric should stop waiting for those replicas to come back up. Do not run this cmdlet if the state on the node has not been removed and the node can come back up with its state intact. Starting from Service Fabric 6.5, in order to use this API for seed nodes, please change the seed nodes to regular (non-seed) nodes and then invoke this API to remove the node state. If the cluster is running on Azure, after the seed node goes down, Service Fabric will try to change it to a non-seed node automatically. To make this happen, make sure the number of non-seed nodes in the primary node type is no less than the number of Down seed nodes. If necessary, add more nodes to the primary node type to achieve this. For standalone cluster, if the Down seed node is not expected to come back up with its state intact, please remove the node from the cluster, see https\://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-windows-server-add-remove-nodes.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --node-name [Required] | The name of the node. |
| --timeout -t | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.  Default\: 60. |

### Global Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --debug | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs. |
| --help -h | Show this help message and exit. |
| --output -o | Output format.  Allowed values\: json, jsonc, table, tsv.  Default\: json. |
| --query | JMESPath query string. See http\://jmespath.org/ for more information and examples. |
| --verbose | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs. |

## sfctl node report-health
Sends a health report on the Service Fabric node.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric node. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --health-property [Required] | The property of the health information. <br><br> An entity can have health reports for different properties. The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node. Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information. |
| --health-state    [Required] | Possible values include\: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'. |
| --node-name       [Required] | The name of the node. |
| --source-id       [Required] | The source name that identifies the client/watchdog/system component that generated the health information. |
| --description | The description of the health information. <br><br> It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters. If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string. |
| --immediate | A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. <br><br> A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. |
| --remove-when-expired | Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires. <br><br> If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires. If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (e.g. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state. |
| --sequence-number | The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. <br><br> The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added. |
| --timeout -t | Default\: 60. |
| --ttl | The duration for which this health report is valid. This field uses ISO8601 format for specifying the duration. <br><br> When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite. When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value. |
