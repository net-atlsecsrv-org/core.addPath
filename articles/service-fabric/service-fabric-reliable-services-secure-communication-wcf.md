# Secure WCF-based communications for a service
Security is one of the most important aspects of communication. The Reliable Services application framework provides a few prebuilt communication stacks and tools that you can use to improve security. This article talks about how to improve security when you're using service remoting.

We are using an existing [example](service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-wcf.md) that explains how to set up a WCF-based communication stack for reliable services. To help secure a service when you're using a WCF-based communication stack, follow these steps:

1. For the service, you need to help secure the WCF communication listener (`WcfCommunicationListener`) that you create. To do this, modify the `CreateServiceReplicaListeners` method.

    ```csharp
    protected override IEnumerable<ServiceReplicaListener> CreateServiceReplicaListeners()
    {
        return new[]
        {
            new ServiceReplicaListener(
                this.CreateWcfCommunicationListener)
        };
    }

    private WcfCommunicationListener<ICalculator> CreateWcfCommunicationListener(StatefulServiceContext context)
    {
       var wcfCommunicationListener = new WcfCommunicationListener<ICalculator>(
            serviceContext:context,
            wcfServiceObject:this,
            // For this example, we will be using NetTcpBinding.
            listenerBinding: GetNetTcpBinding(),
            endpointResourceName:"WcfServiceEndpoint");

        // Add certificate details in the ServiceHost credentials.
        wcfCommunicationListener.ServiceHost.Credentials.ServiceCertificate.SetCertificate(
            StoreLocation.LocalMachine,
            StoreName.My,
            X509FindType.FindByThumbprint,
            "9DC906B169DC4FAFFD1697AC781E806790749D2F");
        return wcfCommunicationListener;
    }

    private static NetTcpBinding GetNetTcpBinding()
    {
        NetTcpBinding b = new NetTcpBinding(SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential);
        b.Security.Message.ClientCredentialType = MessageCredentialType.Certificate;
        return b;
    }
    ```
2. In the client, the `WcfCommunicationClient` class that was created in the previous [example](service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-wcf.md) remains unchanged. But you need to override the `CreateClientAsync` method of `WcfCommunicationClientFactory`:

    ```csharp
    public class SecureWcfCommunicationClientFactory<TServiceContract> : WcfCommunicationClientFactory<TServiceContract> where TServiceContract : class
    {
        private readonly Binding clientBinding;
        private readonly object callbackObject;
        public SecureWcfCommunicationClientFactory(
            Binding clientBinding,
            IEnumerable<IExceptionHandler> exceptionHandlers = null,
            IServicePartitionResolver servicePartitionResolver = null,
            string traceId = null,
            object callback = null)
            : base(clientBinding, exceptionHandlers, servicePartitionResolver,traceId,callback)
        {
            this.clientBinding = clientBinding;
            this.callbackObject = callback;
        }

        protected override Task<WcfCommunicationClient<TServiceContract>> CreateClientAsync(string endpoint, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var endpointAddress = new EndpointAddress(new Uri(endpoint));
            ChannelFactory<TServiceContract> channelFactory;
            if (this.callbackObject != null)
            {
                channelFactory = new DuplexChannelFactory<TServiceContract>(
                this.callbackObject,
                this.clientBinding,
                endpointAddress);
            }
            else
            {
                channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<TServiceContract>(this.clientBinding, endpointAddress);
            }
            // Add certificate details to the ChannelFactory credentials.
            // These credentials will be used by the clients created by
            // SecureWcfCommunicationClientFactory.  
            channelFactory.Credentials.ClientCertificate.SetCertificate(
                StoreLocation.LocalMachine,
                StoreName.My,
                X509FindType.FindByThumbprint,
                "9DC906B169DC4FAFFD1697AC781E806790749D2F");
            var channel = channelFactory.CreateChannel();
            var clientChannel = ((IClientChannel)channel);
            clientChannel.OperationTimeout = this.clientBinding.ReceiveTimeout;
            return Task.FromResult(this.CreateWcfCommunicationClient(channel));
        }
    }
    ```

    Use `SecureWcfCommunicationClientFactory` to create a WCF communication client (`WcfCommunicationClient`). Use the client to invoke service methods.

    ```csharp
    IServicePartitionResolver partitionResolver = ServicePartitionResolver.GetDefault();

    var wcfClientFactory = new SecureWcfCommunicationClientFactory<ICalculator>(clientBinding: GetNetTcpBinding(), servicePartitionResolver: partitionResolver);

    var calculatorServiceCommunicationClient =  new WcfCommunicationClient(
        wcfClientFactory,
        ServiceUri,
        ServicePartitionKey.Singleton);

    var result = calculatorServiceCommunicationClient.InvokeWithRetryAsync(
        client => client.Channel.Add(2, 3)).Result;
    ```
