# Customize Service Fabric cluster settings
This article describes the various fabric settings for your Service Fabric cluster that you can customize. For clusters hosted in Azure, you can customize settings through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or by using an Azure Resource Manager template. For more information, see [Upgrade the configuration of an Azure cluster](service-fabric-cluster-config-upgrade-azure.md). For standalone clusters, you customize settings by updating the *ClusterConfig.json* file and performing a configuration upgrade on your cluster. For more information, see [Upgrade the configuration of a standalone cluster](service-fabric-cluster-config-upgrade-windows-server.md).

There are three different upgrade policies:

- **Dynamic** – Changes to a dynamic configuration do not cause any process restarts of either Service Fabric processes or your service host processes. 
- **Static** – Changes to a static configuration will cause the Service Fabric node to restart in order to consume the change. Services on the nodes will be restarted.
- **NotAllowed** – These settings cannot be modified. Changing these settings requires that the cluster be destroyed and a new cluster created. 

The following is a list of Fabric settings that you can customize, organized by section.

Refer to config ServiceCertificateThumbprints for the comma-separated list of thumbprints of the remote certs that the reverse proxy can trust. Refer to config ServiceCommonNameAndIssuer for the subject name and issuer thumbprint of the remote certs that the reverse proxy can trust. To learn more, see [Reverse proxy secure connection](service-fabric-reverseproxy-configure-secure-communication.md#secure-connection-establishment-between-the-reverse-proxy-and-services). |
