# Containerize your Service Fabric Reliable Services and Reliable Actors on Windows

Service Fabric supports containerizing Service Fabric microservices (Reliable Services, and Reliable Actor based services). For more information, see [service fabric containers](service-fabric-containers-overview.md).

This document provides guidance to get your service running inside a Windows container.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently this feature only works for Windows. To run containers, the cluster must be running on Windows Server 2016 with Containers.

## Steps to containerize your Service Fabric Application

1. Open your Service Fabric application in Visual Studio.

2. Add class [SFBinaryLoader.cs](https://github.com/Azure/service-fabric-scripts-and-templates/blob/master/code/SFBinaryLoaderForContainers/SFBinaryLoader.cs) to your project. The code in this class is a helper to correctly load the Service Fabric runtime binaries inside your application when running inside a container.

3. For each code package you would like to containerize, initialize the loader at the program entry point. Add the static constructor shown in the following code snippet to your program entry point file.

   ```csharp
   namespace MyApplication
   {
      internal static class Program
      {
          static Program()
          {
              SFBinaryLoader.Initialize();
          }

          /// <summary>
          /// This is the entry point of the service host process.
          /// </summary>
          private static void Main()
          {
   ```

4. Build and [package](service-fabric-package-apps.md#Package-App) your project. To build and create a package, right-click the application project in Solution Explorer and choose the **Package** command.

5. For every code package you need to containerize, run the PowerShell script [CreateDockerPackage.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/service-fabric-scripts-and-templates/blob/master/scripts/CodePackageToDockerPackage/CreateDockerPackage.ps1). The usage is as follows:

    Full .NET
      ```powershell
        $codePackagePath = 'Path to the code package to containerize.'
        $dockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath = 'Output path for the generated docker folder.'
        $applicationExeName = 'Name of the Code package executable.'
        CreateDockerPackage.ps1 -CodePackageDirectoryPath $codePackagePath -DockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath $dockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath -ApplicationExeName $applicationExeName
      ```
    .NET Core
      ```powershell
        $codePackagePath = 'Path to the code package to containerize.'
        $dockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath = 'Output path for the generated docker folder.'
        $dotnetCoreDllName = 'Name of the Code package dotnet Core Dll.'
        CreateDockerPackage.ps1 -CodePackageDirectoryPath $codePackagePath -DockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath $dockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath -DotnetCoreDllName $dotnetCoreDllName
      ```
      The script creates a folder with Docker artifacts at $dockerPackageOutputDirectoryPath. Modify the generated Dockerfile to `expose` any ports, run setup scripts and so on. based on your needs.

6. Next you need to [build](service-fabric-get-started-containers.md#Build-Containers) and [push](service-fabric-get-started-containers.md#Push-Containers) your Docker container package to your repository.

7. Modify the ApplicationManifest.xml and ServiceManifest.xml to add your container image, repository information, registry authentication, and port-to-host mapping. For modifying the manifests, see [Create an Azure Service Fabric container application](service-fabric-get-started-containers.md). The code package definition in the service manifest needs to be replaced with corresponding container image. Make sure to change the EntryPoint to a ContainerHost type.

   ```xml
   <!-- Code package is your service executable. -->
   <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
   <EntryPoint>
    <!-- Follow this link for more information about deploying Windows containers to Service Fabric: https://aka.ms/sfguestcontainers -->
    <ContainerHost>
      <ImageName>myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/helloworldapp</ImageName>
    </ContainerHost>
   </EntryPoint>
   <!-- Pass environment variables to your container: -->
   </CodePackage>
   ```

8. Add the port-to-host mapping for your replicator and service endpoint. Since both these ports are assigned at runtime by Service Fabric, the ContainerPort is set to zero to use the assigned port for mapping.

   ```xml
   <Policies>
   <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
    <PortBinding ContainerPort="0" EndpointRef="ServiceEndpoint"/>
    <PortBinding ContainerPort="0" EndpointRef="ReplicatorEndpoint"/>
   </ContainerHostPolicies>
   </Policies>
   ```

9. For configuring container isolation mode, see [Configure isolation mode]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers#configure-isolation-mode). Windows supports two isolation modes for containers: process and Hyper-V. The following snippets show how the isolation mode is specified in the application manifest file.

   ```xml
   <Policies>
   <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code" Isolation="process">
   ...
   </ContainerHostPolicies>
   </Policies>
   ```
   ```xml
   <Policies>
   <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code" Isolation="hyperv">
   ...
   </ContainerHostPolicies>
   </Policies>
   ```

> [!NOTE] 
> By default, Service Fabric applications have access to the Service Fabric runtime, in the form of an endpoint accepting application-specific requests. Consider disabling this access when the application hosts untrusted code. For more information, please see [security best practices in Service Fabric](service-fabric-best-practices-security.md#platform-isolation). To disable access to the Service Fabric runtime, add the following setting in the Policies section of the application manifest corresponding to the imported service manifest, as follows:
>
```xml
  <Policies>
      <ServiceFabricRuntimeAccessPolicy RemoveServiceFabricRuntimeAccess="true"/>
  </Policies>
```
>

10. To test this application, you need to deploy it to a cluster that is running version 5.7 or higher. For runtime versions 6.1 or lower, you need to edit and update the cluster settings to enable this preview feature. Follow the steps in this [article](service-fabric-cluster-fabric-settings.md) to add the setting shown next.
    ```
      {
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "FabricContainerAppsEnabled",
            "value": "true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

11. Next [deploy](service-fabric-deploy-remove-applications.md) the edited application package to this cluster.

You should now have a containerized Service Fabric application running your cluster.
