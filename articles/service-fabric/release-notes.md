## What's new in Service Fabric

### Service Fabric 7.1
Due to the current COVID-19 crisis, and taking into consideration the challenges faced by our customers, we are making 7.1 available, but will not automatically upgrade clusters set to receive automatic upgrades. We are pausing automatic upgrades until further notice to ensure that customers can apply upgrades when most appropriate for them, to avoid unexpected disruptions.

You will be able to update to 7.1 via through the [Azure portal](./service-fabric-cluster-upgrade-version-azure.md#upgrading-to-a-new-version-on-a-cluster-that-is-set-to-manual-mode-via-portal) or via an [Azure Resource Manager deployment](./service-fabric-cluster-upgrade-version-azure.md#set-the-upgrade-mode-using-a-resource-manager-template).

Service Fabric clusters with automatic upgrades enabled will begin to receive the 7.1 update automatically once we resume the standard rollout procedure. We will provide another announcement before the standard rollout begins on the [Service Fabric Tech Community Site](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-service-fabric/bg-p/Service-Fabric).
We also have published updates to end of support date for major releases starting from 6.5 up to 7.1 [here](./service-fabric-versions.md#supported-versions). 

## What is new in-Service Fabric 7.1?
We are excited to announce the next release of Service Fabric. This release is loaded with key features and improvements. Some of the key features are highlighted below:
## Key Announcements
- **General Availability** of [**Service Fabric Managed Identities for Service Fabric applications**](./concepts-managed-identity.md)
- [**Support for Ubuntu 18.04**](./service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md)
 - [**Preview: Virtual machine scale set Ephemeral OS disk support**](./service-fabric-cluster-azure-deployment-preparation.md#use-ephemeral-os-disks-for-virtual-machine-scale-sets)**: Ephemeral OS disks are storage created on the local virtual machine, and not saved to remote Azure Storage. They are recommended for all Service Fabric node types (Primary and Secondary), because compared to traditional persistent OS disks, ephemeral OS disks:
      -  Reduce read/write latency to OS disk
      -  Enable faster reset/re-image node management operations
      -  Reduce overall costs (the disks are free and incur no additional storage cost)
- Support for declaration of [**Service Endpoint certificates of Service Fabric applications by subject common name**](./service-fabric-service-manifest-resources.md).
- [**Support for Health Probes for containerized services**](./probes-codepackage.md): Support for Liveness Probe mechanism for containerized applications. Liveness Probe help announce the liveness of the containerized application and when they do not respond in a timely fashion, it will result in a restart. 
- [**Support for Initializer Code Packages**](./initializer-codepackages.md) for [containers](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview) and [guest executable](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-guest-executables-introduction) applications. This allows executing Code Packages (e.g. containers), in a specified order, to perform Service Package initialization.
- **FabricObserver and ClusterObserver** are stateless applications that capture Service Fabric Telemetry related to different aspects of an SF cluster. Both these applications are ready for deployment to Windows production clusters to capture rich telemetry with implemented support for ApplicationInsights, EventSource and LogAnalytics.
    - [**FabricObserver (FO) 2.0**](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-observer)- runs on all nodes, generates health events, emits telemetry when user configured resource usage thresholds are reached. This release contains several enhancements across monitoring, data management, health event details, structured telemetry.
     - [**ClusterObserver (CO) 1.1**](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-observer/tree/master/ClusterObserver) - runs on one node, captures cluster level health telemetry. In this release, ClusterObserver also monitors node status and emits telemetry when node is down/disabling/disabled  for longer than user-specified time period.

### Improve Application life cycle experience

- **[Preview:Request drain](./service-fabric-application-upgrade-advanced.md#avoid-connection-drops-during-stateless-service-planned-downtime)**: During planned service maintenance, such as service upgrades or node deactivation, you would like to allow the  services to gracefully drain connections. This feature adds an instance close delay duration in the service configuration. During planned operations, SF will remove the Service's address from discovery and then wait this duration before shutting down the service.
- **[Automatic Subcluster Detection and Balancing](./cluster-resource-manager-subclustering.md)**: Subclustering happens when services with different placement constraints have a common [load metric](./service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-metrics.md). If the load on the different sets of nodes differs significantly, the Service Fabric Cluster Resource Manager believes that the cluster is imbalanced, even when it has the best possible balance because of the placement constraints. As a result, it attempts to rebalance the cluster, potentially causing unnecessary service movements (since the "imbalance" cannot be substantially improved). Starting with this release, the Cluster Resource Manager will now attempt to automatically detect these sorts of configurations and understand when the imbalance can be fixed through movement, and when instead it should leave things alone since no substantial improvement can be made.  
- [**Different Move cost for secondary replicas**](./service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-movement-cost.md): We have introduced new move cost value VeryHigh that provides additional flexibility in some scenarios to define if a separate move cost should be used for secondary replicas.
- Enabled [**Liveness Probe**](./probes-codepackage.md) mechanism for containerized    applications. Liveness Probe help announce the liveness of the containerized application and when they do not respond in a timely fashion, it will result in a restart.
- [**Run to completion/once for services**](./run-to-completion.md)**

### Image Store improvements
 - Service Fabric 7.1 uses **custom transport to secure file transfer between nodes by default**. The dependency on SMB file share is removed from the version 7.1. The secured SMB file shares are still existing on nodes that contains Image Store Service replica for customer's choice to opt out from default and for upgrade and downgrade to old version.
       
 ### Reliable Collections Improvements

- [**In memory only store support for stateful services using Reliable Collections**](./service-fabric-work-with-reliable-collections.md#volatile-reliable-collections): Volatile Reliable Collections allows data to be persisted to disk for durability against large-scale outages, can be used for workloads like replicated cache, for example, where occasional data loss can be tolerated. Based on the [limitations and restrictions of Volatile Reliable Collections](./service-fabric-reliable-services-reliable-collections-guidelines.md#volatile-reliable-collections), we recommend this for workloads that don't need persistence, for services that handle the rare occasions of Quorum Loss.
- [**Preview: Service Fabric Backup Explorer**](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-backup-explorer): To ease management of Reliable Collections backups for Service Fabric Stateful applications, Service Fabric Backup Explorer enables users to
    - Audit and review the contents of the Reliable Collections,
    - Update current state to a consistent view
    - Create Backup of the current snapshot of the Reliable Collections
    - Fix data corruption

### Service Fabric 7.0

Azure Service Fabric 7.0 is now available! You will be able to update to 7.0 through the Azure portal or via an Azure Resource Manager deployment. Due to customer feedback on releases around the holiday period we will not begin automatically updating clusters set to receive automatic upgrades until January.
   In January, we will resume the standard roll-out procedure and clusters with automatic upgrades enabled will begin to receive the 7.0 update automatically. We will provide another announcement before the roll-out begins.
We will also update our planned release dates to indicate that we take this policy into consideration. Look here for updates on our future [release schedules](https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/#service-fabric-release-schedule).
 
This is the latest release of Service Fabric and is loaded with key features and improvements.

### Key Announcements
 - [**KeyVaultReference support for application secrets (Preview)**](./service-fabric-keyvault-references.md): Service Fabric applications that have enabled [Managed Identities](./concepts-managed-identity.md) can now directly reference a Key Vault secret URL as an environment variable, application parameter, or container repository credential. Service Fabric will automatically resolve the secret using the application's managed identity. 
     
- **Improved upgrade safety for stateless services**: To guarantee availability during an application upgrade, we have introduced new 
  configurations to define the [minimum number of instances for stateless services](/dotnet/api/system.fabric.description.statelessservicedescription?view=azure-dotnet) to be considered available. Previously this value 
  was 1 for all services and was not changeable. With this new per-service safety check, you can ensure that your services retain a 
  minimum number of up instances during application upgrades, cluster upgrades, and other maintenance that relies on Service Fabric’s 
  health and safety checks.
  
- [**Resource Limits for User Services**](./service-fabric-resource-governance.md#enforcing-the-resource-limits-for-user-services): Users can set up resource limits for the user services on a node to prevent scenarios such as 
  resource exhaustion of the Service Fabric system services. 
  
- [**Very High service move cost**](./service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-movement-cost.md) for a replica type. Replicas with Very High move cost will be moved only if there is a constraint violation in the cluster that cannot be fixed in any other way. Refer to the linked document for additional information on when usage of a “Very High” move cost is reasonable and for additional considerations.
  
-  **Additional cluster safety checks**: In this release, we introduced a configurable seed node quorum safety check. This allows you to 
   customize how many seed nodes must be available during cluster life-cycle and management scenarios. Operations which would take the 
   cluster below the configured value are blocked. Today the default value is always a quorum of the seed nodes, for example, if you have 7 seed nodes, an operation that would take you below 5 seed nodes would be blocked by default. With this change, you could make 
   the minimum safe value 6, which would allow only one seed node to be down at a time.
   
- Added support for [**managing the Backup and Restore service in Service Fabric Explorer**](./service-fabric-backuprestoreservice-quickstart-azurecluster.md). This makes the following activities possible directly from within 
 SFX: discovering the backup and restore service, creating backup policy, enabling automatic backups, taking adhoc backups, triggering restore operations and browsing existing backups.

- Announcing availability of the [**ReliableCollectionsMissingTypesTool**](https://github.com/hiadusum/ReliableCollectionsMissingTypesTool): 
This tool helps validate that types used in reliable collections are forward and backward compatible during a rolling application upgrade. This helps prevent upgrade failures or data loss and data corruption due to missing or incompatible types.

- [**Enable stable reads on secondary replicas**](./service-fabric-reliable-services-configuration.md#configuration-names-1):Stable reads will restrict secondary replicas to returning values which have been quorum-acked.

In addition, this release contains other new features, bug fixes, and supportability, reliability, and performance improvements. For the full list of changes, please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/service-fabric/blob/master/release_notes/Service_Fabric_ReleaseNotes_70.md).
