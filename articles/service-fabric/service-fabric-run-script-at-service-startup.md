# Run a service startup script as a local user or system account
Before a Service Fabric service executable starts up it may be necessary to run some configuration or setup work.  For example, configuring environment variables. You can specify a script to run before the service executable starts up in the service manifest for the service. By configuring a RunAs policy for the service setup entry point you can change which account the setup executable runs under.  A separate setup entry point allows you to run high-privileged configuration for a short period of time so the service host executable doesn't need to run with high privileges for extended periods of time.

The setup entry point (**SetupEntryPoint** in the [service manifest](service-fabric-application-and-service-manifests.md)) is a privileged entry point that by default runs with the same credentials as Service Fabric (typically the *NetworkService* account) before any other entry point. The executable that is specified by **EntryPoint** is typically the long-running service host. The **EntryPoint** executable is run after the **SetupEntryPoint** executable exits successfully. The resulting process is monitored and restarted, and begins again with **SetupEntryPoint** if it ever terminates or crashes. 

## Configure the service setup entry point
The following is a simple service manifest example for a stateless service that specifies a setup script *MySetup.bat* in the service **SetupEntryPoint**.  **Arguments** is used to pass arguments to the script when it runs.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceManifest Name="MyStatelessServicePkg"
                 Version="1.0.0"
                 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric"
                 xmlns:xsd="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                 xmlns:xsi="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Description>An example service manifest.</Description>
  <ServiceTypes>
    <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="MyStatelessServiceType" />
  </ServiceTypes>

  <!-- Code package is your service executable. -->
  <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
    <SetupEntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
        <Arguments>MyValue</Arguments>
        <WorkingFolder>Work</WorkingFolder>        
      </ExeHost>
    </SetupEntryPoint>
    <EntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MyStatelessService.exe</Program>
      </ExeHost>
    </EntryPoint>
  </CodePackage>

  <ConfigPackage Name="Config" Version="1.0.0" />

  <Resources>
    <Endpoints>
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint" />
    </Endpoints>
  </Resources>
</ServiceManifest>
```
## Configure the policy for a service setup entry point
By default, the service setup entry point executable runs under the same credentials as Service Fabric (typically the *NetworkService* account).  In the application manifest, you can change the security permissions to run the startup script under a local system account or an administrator account.

### Configure the policy by using a local system account
The following application manifest example shows how to configure the service setup entry point to run under user administrator account (SetupAdminUser).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
  <Parameters>
    <Parameter Name="MyStatelessService_InstanceCount" DefaultValue="-1" />
  </Parameters>
  <ServiceManifestImport>
    <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyStatelessServicePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
    <ConfigOverrides />
    <Policies>
      <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupAdminUser" EntryPointType="Setup" />
    </Policies>
  </ServiceManifestImport>
  <DefaultServices>
    <Service Name="MyStatelessService" ServicePackageActivationMode="ExclusiveProcess">
      <StatelessService ServiceTypeName="MyStatelessServiceType" InstanceCount="[MyStatelessService_InstanceCount]">
        <SingletonPartition />
      </StatelessService>
    </Service>
  </DefaultServices>
  <Principals>
    <Users>
      <User Name="SetupAdminUser">
        <MemberOf>
          <SystemGroup Name="Administrators" />
        </MemberOf>
      </User>
    </Users>
  </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

First, create a **Principals** section with a user name, such as SetupAdminUser. The SetupAdminUser user account is a member of the Administrators system group.

Next, under the **ServiceManifestImport** section, configure a policy to apply this principal to **SetupEntryPoint**. This policy tells Service Fabric that when the **MySetup.bat** file is run it should run as SetupAdminUser ( with administrator privileges). Since you have *not* applied a policy to the main entry point, the code in **MyServiceHost.exe** runs under the system **NetworkService** account. This is the default account that all service entry points are run as.

### Configure the policy by using local system accounts
Often, it's preferable to run the startup script using a local system account rather than an administrator account. Running the RunAs policy as a member of the Administrators group typically doesnâ€™t work well because computers have User Access Control (UAC) enabled by default. In such cases, the recommendation is to run the SetupEntryPoint as LocalSystem, instead of as a local user added to Administrators group. The following example shows setting the SetupEntryPoint to run as LocalSystem:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
  <Parameters>
    <Parameter Name="MyStatelessService_InstanceCount" DefaultValue="-1" />
  </Parameters>
  <ServiceManifestImport>
    <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyStatelessServicePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
    <ConfigOverrides />
    <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupLocalSystem" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
  </ServiceManifestImport>
  <DefaultServices>
    <Service Name="MyStatelessService" ServicePackageActivationMode="ExclusiveProcess">
      <StatelessService ServiceTypeName="MyStatelessServiceType" InstanceCount="[MyStatelessService_InstanceCount]">
        <SingletonPartition />
      </StatelessService>
    </Service>
  </DefaultServices>
  <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupLocalSystem" AccountType="LocalSystem" />
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux clusters, to run a service or the setup entry point as **root**, you can specify the  **AccountType** as **LocalSystem**.

## Run a script from the setup entry point
Now add a start up script to the project to run under administrator privileges. 

In Visual Studio, right-click the service project and add a new file called *MySetup.bat*.

Next, ensure that the *MySetup.bat* file is included in the service package. By default, it is not. Select the file, right-click to get the context menu, and choose **Properties**. In the Properties dialog box, ensure that **Copy to Output Directory** is set to **Copy if newer**. See the following screenshot.

![Visual Studio CopyToOutput for SetupEntryPoint batch file][image1]

Now edit the *MySetup.bat* file and add the following commands set a system environment variable and output a text file:

```
REM Set a system environment variable. This requires administrator privilege
setx -m TestVariable %*
echo System TestVariable set to > out.txt
echo %TestVariable% >> out.txt

REM To delete this system variable us
REM REG delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v TestVariable /f
```

Next, build and deploy the solution to a local development cluster. After the service has started, as shown in [Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md), you can see that the MySetup.bat file was successful in a two ways. Open a PowerShell command prompt and type:

```
PS C:\ [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine")
MyValue
```

Then, note the name of the node where the service was deployed and started in [Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md). For example, Node 2. Next, navigate to the application instance work folder to find the out.txt file that shows the value of **TestVariable**. For example, if this service was deployed to Node 2, then you can go to this path for the **MyApplicationType**:

```
C:\SfDevCluster\Data\_App\Node.2\MyApplicationType_App\work\out.txt
```

## Run PowerShell commands from a setup entry point
To run PowerShell from the **SetupEntryPoint** point, you can run **PowerShell.exe** in a batch file that points to a PowerShell file. First, add a PowerShell file to the service project--for example, **MySetup.ps1**. Remember to set the *Copy if newer* property so that the file is also included in the service package. The following example shows a sample batch file that starts a PowerShell file called MySetup.ps1, which sets a system environment variable called **TestVariable**.

MySetup.bat to start a PowerShell file:

```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ".\MySetup.ps1"
```

In the PowerShell file, add the following to set a system environment variable:

```
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable", "MyValue", "Machine")
[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine") > out.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, when the batch file runs, it looks at the application folder called **work** for files. In this case, when MySetup.bat runs, we want this to find the MySetup.ps1 file in the same folder, which is the application **code package** folder. To change this folder, set the working folder:
> 
> 

```xml
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint>
```

## Debug a startup script locally using console redirection
Occasionally, it's useful for debugging purposes to see the console output from running a setup script. You can set a console redirection policy on the setup entry point in the service manifest, which writes the output to a file. The file output is written to the application folder called **log** on the cluster node where the application is deployed and run. 

> [!WARNING]
> Never use the console redirection policy in an application that is deployed in production because this can affect the application failover. *Only* use this for local development and debugging purposes.  
> 
> 

The following service manifest example shows setting the console redirection with a FileRetentionCount value:

```xml
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    <ConsoleRedirection FileRetentionCount="10"/>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint>
```

If you now change the MySetup.ps1 file to write an **Echo** command, this will write to the output file for debugging purposes:

```
Echo "Test console redirection which writes to the application log folder on the node that the application is deployed to"
```

> [!WARNING]
> After you debug your script, immediately remove this console redirection policy.
