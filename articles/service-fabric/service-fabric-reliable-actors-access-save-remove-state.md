# Access, save, and remove Reliable Actors state
[Reliable Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md) are single-threaded objects that can encapsulate both logic and state and maintain state reliably. Every actor instance has its own [state manager](service-fabric-reliable-actors-state-management.md): a dictionary-like data structure that reliably stores key/value pairs. The state manager is a wrapper around a state provider. You can use it to store data regardless of which [persistence setting](service-fabric-reliable-actors-state-management.md#state-persistence-and-replication) is used.

State manager keys must be strings. Values are generic and can be any type, including custom types. Values stored in the state manager must be data contract serializable because they might be transmitted over the network to other nodes during replication and might be written to disk, depending on an actor's state persistence setting.

The state manager exposes common dictionary methods for managing state, similar to those found in Reliable Dictionary.

For information, see [best practices in managing actor state](service-fabric-reliable-actors-state-management.md#best-practices).

## Access state
State is accessed through the state manager by key. State manager methods are all asynchronous because they might require disk I/O when actors have persisted state. Upon first access, state objects are cached in memory. Repeat access operations access objects directly from memory and return synchronously without incurring disk I/O or asynchronous context-switching overhead. A state object is removed from the cache in the following cases:

* An actor method throws an unhandled exception after it retrieves an object from the state manager.
* An actor is reactivated, either after being deactivated or after failure.
* The state provider pages state to disk. This behavior depends on the state provider implementation. The default state provider for the `Persisted` setting has this behavior.

You can retrieve state by using a standard *Get* operation that throws `KeyNotFoundException`(C#) or `NoSuchElementException`(Java) if an entry does not exist for the key:

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public Task<int> GetCountAsync()
    {
        return this.StateManager.GetStateAsync<int>("MyState");
    }
}
```
```Java
@StatePersistenceAttribute(statePersistence = StatePersistence.Persisted)
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture<Integer> getCountAsync()
    {
        return this.stateManager().getStateAsync("MyState");
    }
}
```

You can also retrieve state by using a *TryGet* method that does not throw if an entry does not exist for a key:

```csharp
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public async Task<int> GetCountAsync()
    {
        ConditionalValue<int> result = await this.StateManager.TryGetStateAsync<int>("MyState");
        if (result.HasValue)
        {
            return result.Value;
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```
```Java
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture<Integer> getCountAsync()
    {
        return this.stateManager().<Integer>tryGetStateAsync("MyState").thenApply(result -> {
            if (result.hasValue()) {
                return result.getValue();
            } else {
                return 0;
            });
    }
}
```

## Save state
The state manager retrieval methods return a reference to an object in local memory. Modifying this object in local memory alone does not cause it to be saved durably. When an object is retrieved from the state manager and modified, it must be reinserted into the state manager to be saved durably.

You can insert state by using an unconditional *Set*, which is the equivalent of the `dictionary["key"] = value` syntax:

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public Task SetCountAsync(int value)
    {
        return this.StateManager.SetStateAsync<int>("MyState", value);
    }
}
```
```Java
@StatePersistenceAttribute(statePersistence = StatePersistence.Persisted)
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture setCountAsync(int value)
    {
        return this.stateManager().setStateAsync("MyState", value);
    }
}
```

You can add state by using an *Add* method. This method throws `InvalidOperationException`(C#) or `IllegalStateException`(Java) when it tries to add a key that already exists.

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public Task AddCountAsync(int value)
    {
        return this.StateManager.AddStateAsync<int>("MyState", value);
    }
}
```
```Java
@StatePersistenceAttribute(statePersistence = StatePersistence.Persisted)
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture addCountAsync(int value)
    {
        return this.stateManager().addOrUpdateStateAsync("MyState", value, (key, old_value) -> old_value + value);
    }
}
```

You can also add state by using a *TryAdd* method. This method does not throw when it tries to add a key that already exists.

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public async Task AddCountAsync(int value)
    {
        bool result = await this.StateManager.TryAddStateAsync<int>("MyState", value);

        if (result)
        {
            // Added successfully!
        }
    }
}
```
```Java
@StatePersistenceAttribute(statePersistence = StatePersistence.Persisted)
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture addCountAsync(int value)
    {
        return this.stateManager().tryAddStateAsync("MyState", value).thenApply((result)->{
            if(result)
            {
                // Added successfully!
            }
        });
    }
}
```

At the end of an actor method, the state manager automatically saves any values that have been added or modified by an insert or update operation. A "save" can include persisting to disk and replication, depending on the settings used. Values that have not been modified are not persisted or replicated. If no values have been modified, the save operation does nothing. If saving fails, the modified state is discarded and the original state is reloaded.

You can also save state manually by calling the `SaveStateAsync` method on the actor base:

```csharp
async Task IMyActor.SetCountAsync(int count)
{
    await this.StateManager.AddOrUpdateStateAsync("count", count, (key, value) => count > value ? count : value);

    await this.SaveStateAsync();
}
```
```Java
interface MyActor {
    CompletableFuture setCountAsync(int count)
    {
        this.stateManager().addOrUpdateStateAsync("count", count, (key, value) -> count > value ? count : value).thenApply();

        this.stateManager().saveStateAsync().thenApply();
    }
}
```

## Remove state
You can remove state permanently from an actor's state manager by calling the *Remove* method. This method throws `KeyNotFoundException`(C#) or `NoSuchElementException`(Java) when it tries to remove a key that doesn't exist.

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public Task RemoveCountAsync()
    {
        return this.StateManager.RemoveStateAsync("MyState");
    }
}
```
```Java
@StatePersistenceAttribute(statePersistence = StatePersistence.Persisted)
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture removeCountAsync()
    {
        return this.stateManager().removeStateAsync("MyState");
    }
}
```

You can also remove state permanently by using the *TryRemove* method. This method does not throw when it tries to remove a key that does not exist.

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public MyActor(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
        : base(actorService, actorId)
    {
    }

    public async Task RemoveCountAsync()
    {
        bool result = await this.StateManager.TryRemoveStateAsync("MyState");

        if (result)
        {
            // State removed!
        }
    }
}
```
```Java
@StatePersistenceAttribute(statePersistence = StatePersistence.Persisted)
class MyActorImpl extends FabricActor implements  MyActor
{
    public MyActorImpl(ActorService actorService, ActorId actorId)
    {
        super(actorService, actorId);
    }

    public CompletableFuture removeCountAsync()
    {
        return this.stateManager().tryRemoveStateAsync("MyState").thenApply((result)->{
            if(result)
            {
                // State removed!
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Next steps

State that's stored in Reliable Actors must be serialized before its written to disk and replicated for high availability. Learn more about [Actor type serialization](service-fabric-reliable-actors-notes-on-actor-type-serialization.md).
