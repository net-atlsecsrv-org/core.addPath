# Create a Service Fabric cluster

This sample script creates a five-node Service Fabric cluster secured with an X.509 certificate.  The command creates a self-signed certificate and uploads it to a new key vault. The certificate is also copied to a local directory.  Set the *-OS* parameter to choose the version of Windows or Linux that runs on the cluster nodes.  Customize the parameters as needed.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

If needed, install the Azure PowerShell using the instruction found in the [Azure PowerShell guide](/powershell/azure/overview) and then run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure. 

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/service-fabric/create-secure-cluster/create-secure-cluster.ps1 "Create a Service Fabric cluster")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group, cluster, and all related resources.

```powershell
$groupname="mysfclustergroup"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $groupname -Force
```
