## Prerequisites

* A Service Fabric managed cluster (see [*Deploy a managed cluster*](tutorial-managed-cluster-deploy.md)).
* [Azure PowerShell 4.7.0](/powershell/azure/release-notes-azureps?preserve-view=true&view=azps-4.7.0#azservicefabric) or later (see [*Install Azure PowerShell*](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?preserve-view=true&view=azps-4.7.0)).

## Add a node type to a Service Fabric managed cluster

You can add a node type to a Service Fabric managed cluster through an Azure Resource Manager template, PowerShell, or CLI. In this tutorial, we will be adding a node type using the Azure PowerShell.

To create a new node type, you'll need to define three properties:

* **Node Type Name**: Name that is unique from any existing node types in the cluster.
* **Instance Count**: Initial number of nodes of the new node type.
* **VM Size**: VM SKU for the nodes. If not specified, the default value *Standard_D2* is used.

> [!NOTE]
> If the node type being added is the first or only node type in the cluster, the Primary property must be used.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "mysfcluster"
$nodeTypeName = "nt2"
$vmSize = "Standard_D2_v2"

New-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName -Name $nodeTypeName -InstanceCount 3 -vmSize $vmSize
```

## Remove a node type from a Service Fabric managed cluster

To remove a node type from a Service Fabric managed cluster, you must use PowerShell or CLI. In this tutorial, we will remove a node type using Azure PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to remove a primary node type if it is the only primary node type in the cluster.  

To remove a node type:

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "myCluster"
$nodeTypeName = "nt2"

Remove-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName  -Name $nodeTypeName
```
