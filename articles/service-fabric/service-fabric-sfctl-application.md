### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --app-name    [Required] | The name of the application, including the 'fabric\:' URI scheme. |
| --app-type    [Required] | The application type name found in the application manifest. |
| --app-version [Required] | The version of the application type as defined in the application manifest. |
| --max-node-count | The maximum number of nodes where Service Fabric will reserve capacity for this application. Note that this does not mean that the services of this application will be placed on all of those nodes. |

### Global Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --debug | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs. |
| --help -h | Show this help message and exit. |
| --output -o | Output format.  Allowed values\: json, jsonc, table, tsv.  Default\: json. |
| --query | JMESPath query string. See http\://jmespath.org/ for more information and examples. |
| --verbose | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs. |

## sfctl application delete
Deletes an existing Service Fabric application.

An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an application will delete all services that are part of that application. By default, Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However, if a service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of its services.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --application-id [Required] | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric\:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "\~" character. For example, if the application name is "fabric\:/myapp/app1", the application identity would be "myapp\~app1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1" in previous versions. |
| --force-remove | Remove a Service Fabric application or service forcefully without going through the graceful shutdown sequence. This parameter can be used to forcefully delete an application or service for which delete is timing out due to issues in the service code that prevents graceful close of replicas. |
| --timeout -t | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.  Default\: 60. |

### Global Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --debug | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs. |
| --help -h | Show this help message and exit. |
| --output -o | Output format.  Allowed values\: json, jsonc, table, tsv.  Default\: json. |
| --query | JMESPath query string. See http\://jmespath.org/ for more information and examples. |
| --verbose | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs. |

## sfctl application deployed
Gets the information about an application deployed on a Service Fabric node.

This query returns system application information if the application ID provided is for system application. Results encompass deployed applications in active, activating, and downloading states.

## sfctl application report-health
Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric application. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get application health and check that the report appears.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --application-id  [Required] | The identity of the application. <br><br> This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric\:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the '\~' character. For example, if the application name is 'fabric\:/myapp/app1', the application identity would be 'myapp\~app1' in 6.0+ and 'myapp/app1' in previous versions. |
| --health-property [Required] | The property of the health information. <br><br> An entity can have health reports for different properties. The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node. Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information. |
| --health-state    [Required] | Possible values include\: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'. |
| --source-id       [Required] | The source name that identifies the client/watchdog/system component that generated the health information. |
| --description | The description of the health information. <br><br> It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters. If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string. |
| --immediate | A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. <br><br> A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. |
| --remove-when-expired | Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires. <br><br> If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires. If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (e.g. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state. |
| --sequence-number | The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. <br><br> The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added. |
| --timeout -t | Default\: 60. |
| --ttl | The duration for which this health report is valid. This field uses ISO8601 format for specifying the duration. <br><br> When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite. When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value. |

## sfctl application type
Gets the list of application types in the Service Fabric cluster matching exactly the specified name.

Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. These results are of application types whose name match exactly the one specified as the parameter, and which comply with the given query parameters. All versions of the application type matching the application type name are returned, with each version returned as one application type. The response includes the name, version, status, and other details about the application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a continuation token, which can be used to get the next page. For example, if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first three application types, or if max results is set to 3, then three is returned. To access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token is returned if there are no subsequent pages.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --application-type-name [Required] | The name of the application type. |
| --application-type-version | The version of the application type. |

A continuation token with a non-empty value is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set of results. If there are no further results, then the continuation token does not contain a value. The value of this parameter should not be URL encoded. |
| --exclude-application-parameters | The flag that specifies whether application parameters will be excluded from the result. |
| --max-results | The maximum number of results to be returned as part of the paged queries. This parameter defines the upper bound on the number of results returned. The results returned can be less than the specified maximum results if they do not fit in the message as per the max message size restrictions defined in the configuration. If this parameter is zero or not specified, the paged query includes as many results as possible that fit in the return message. |
| --timeout -t | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.  Default\: 60. |
