### <a name="vnet"></a>Virtual network

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. You can use a VNets to:
- **Communicate between Azure resources**: You can deploy VMs, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. To view a complete list of Azure resources that you can deploy into a virtual network, see [Virtual network service integration](../virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services.md).
- **Communicate between each other**: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. For more information, see [Virtual network peering](../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md).
- **Communicate to the internet**: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use [Public IP addresses](../virtual-network/virtual-network-public-ip-address.md) or public [Load Balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md) to manage your outbound connections.
- **Communicate with on-premises networks**: You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using [VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) or [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

For more information, see [What is Azure Virtual Network?](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

### <a name="expressroute"></a>ExpressRoute
ExpressRoute enables you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider. This connection is private. Traffic does not go over the internet. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365.  For more information, see [What is ExpressRoute?](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/networking-overview/expressroute-connection-overview.png" alt-text="Azure ExpressRoute" border="false":::

### <a name="vpngateway"></a>VPN Gateway
VPN Gateway helps you create encrypted cross-premises connections to your virtual network from on-premises locations, or create encrypted connections between VNets. There are different configurations available for VPN Gateway connections, such as, site-to-site, point-to-site, or VNet-to-VNet.
The following diagram illustrates multiple site-to-site VPN connections to the same virtual network.

:::image type="content" source="./media/networking-overview/vpngateway-multisite-connection-diagram.png" alt-text="Site-to-Site Azure VPN Gateway connections":::

For more information about different types of VPN connections, see [VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md).

### <a name="virtualwan"></a>Virtual WAN
Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that provides optimized and automated branch connectivity to, and through, Azure. Azure regions serve as hubs that you can choose to connect your branches to. You can leverage the Azure backbone to also connect branches and enjoy branch-to-VNet connectivity. 
Azure Virtual WAN brings together many Azure cloud connectivity services such as site-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute, point-to-site user VPN into a single operational interface. Connectivity to Azure VNets is established by using virtual network connections. For more information, see [What is Azure virtual WAN?](../virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/networking-overview/architecture.png" alt-text="Azure Bastion architecture":::

### <a name="nat"></a>Virtual network NAT Gateway
Virtual Network NAT (network address translation) simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses. Outbound connectivity is possible without load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines. 
For more information, see [What is virtual network NAT gateway?](../virtual-network/nat-overview.md).

Azure WAF provides out of box protection from OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities via managed rules. Additionally customers can also configure custom rules, which are customer managed rules to provide additional protection based on source IP range, and request attributes such as headers, cookies, form data fields or query string parameters.

Customers can choose to deploy [Azure WAF with Application Gateway](../application-gateway/waf-overview.md) which provides regional protection to entities in public and private address space. Customers can also choose to deploy [Azure WAF with Front Door](../frontdoor/waf-overview.md) which provides protection at the network edge to public endpoints.

:::image type="content" source="./media/networking-overview/waf-overview.png" alt-text="Web Application Firewall":::

Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your VNet to the Azure services, over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network. For more information, see [Virtual network service endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/networking-overview/vnet-service-endpoints-overview.png" alt-text="Virtual network service endpoints":::
