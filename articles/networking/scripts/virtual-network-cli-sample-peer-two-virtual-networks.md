# Use an Azure CLI sample script to connect two virtual networks

This script creates and connects two virtual networks in the same region through the Azure network. After running the script, you will create a peering between two virtual networks.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]


## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-network/peer-two-virtual-networks/peer-two-virtual-networks.sh "Peer two networks")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
