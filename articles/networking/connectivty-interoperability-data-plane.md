# Interoperability in Azure back-end connectivity features: Data plane analysis

This article describes the data plane analysis of the [test setup][Setup]. You can also review the [test setup configuration][Configuration] and the [control plane analysis][Control-Analysis] of the test setup.

Data plane analysis examines the path taken by packets that traverse from one local network (LAN or virtual network) to another within a topology. The data path between two local networks isn't necessarily symmetrical. Therefore, in this article, we analyze a forwarding path from a local network to another network that's separate from the reverse path.

## Data path from the hub VNet

### Path to the spoke VNet

Virtual network (VNet) peering emulates network bridge functionality between the two VNets that are peered. Traceroute output from a hub VNet to a VM in the spoke VNet is shown here:

	C:\Users\rb>tracert 10.11.30.4

	Tracing route to 10.11.30.4 over a maximum of 30 hops

	  1     2 ms     1 ms     1 ms  10.11.30.4

	Trace complete.

The following figure shows the graphical connection view of the hub VNet and the spoke VNet from the perspective of Azure Network Watcher:

Network Watcher provides only an Azure-centric view. For an on-premises perspective, we use Azure Network Performance Monitor. Network Performance Monitor provides agents that you can install on servers in networks outside Azure for data path analysis.

The following figure shows the topology view of the on-premises Location 1 VM connectivity to the VM on the hub VNet via ExpressRoute:

![4][4]

As discussed earlier, the test setup uses a site-to-site VPN as backup connectivity for ExpressRoute between the on-premises Location 1 and the hub VNet. To test the backup data path, let’s induce an ExpressRoute link failure between the on-premises Location 1 primary CE router and the corresponding MSEE. To induce an ExpressRoute link failure, shut down the CE interface that faces the MSEE:

## ExpressRoute and site-to-site VPN connectivity in tandem

###  Site-to-site VPN over ExpressRoute

You can configure a site-to-site VPN by using ExpressRoute Microsoft peering to privately exchange data between your on-premises network and your Azure VNets. With this configuration, you can exchange data with confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity. The data exchange also is anti-replay. For more information about how to configure a site-to-site IPsec VPN in tunnel mode by using ExpressRoute Microsoft peering, see [Site-to-site VPN over ExpressRoute Microsoft peering][S2S-Over-ExR]. 

The primary limitation of configuring a site-to-site VPN that uses Microsoft peering is throughput. Throughput over the IPsec tunnel is limited by the VPN gateway capacity. The VPN gateway throughput is lower than ExpressRoute throughput. In this scenario, using the IPsec tunnel for highly secure traffic and using private peering for all other traffic helps optimize the ExpressRoute bandwidth utilization.

### Site-to-site VPN as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute

ExpressRoute serves as a redundant circuit pair to ensure high availability. You can configure geo-redundant ExpressRoute connectivity in different Azure regions. Also, as demonstrated in our test setup, within an Azure region, you can use a site-to-site VPN to create a failover path for your ExpressRoute connectivity. When the same prefixes are advertised over both ExpressRoute and a site-to-site VPN, Azure prioritizes ExpressRoute. To avoid asymmetrical routing between ExpressRoute and the site-to-site VPN, on-premises network configuration should also reciprocate by using ExpressRoute connectivity before it uses site-to-site VPN connectivity.

For more information about how to configure coexisting connections for ExpressRoute and a site-to-site VPN, see [ExpressRoute and site-to-site coexistence][ExR-S2S-CoEx].

## Extend back-end connectivity to spoke VNets and branch locations

### Spoke VNet connectivity by using VNet peering

Hub and spoke VNet architecture is widely used. The hub is a VNet in Azure that acts as a central point of connectivity between your spoke VNets and to your on-premises network. The spokes are VNets that peer with the hub, and which you can use to isolate workloads. Traffic flows between the on-premises datacenter and the hub through an ExpressRoute or VPN connection. For more information about the architecture, see [Implement a hub-spoke network topology in Azure][Hub-n-Spoke].

In VNet peering within a region, spoke VNets can use hub VNet gateways (both VPN and ExpressRoute gateways) to communicate with remote networks.

### Branch VNet connectivity by using site-to-site VPN

You might want branch VNets, which are in different regions, and on-premises networks to communicate with each other via a hub VNet. The native Azure solution for this configuration is site-to-site VPN connectivity by using a VPN. An alternative is to use a network virtual appliance (NVA) for routing in the hub.

For more information, see [What is VPN Gateway?][VPN] and [Deploy a highly available NVA][Deploy-NVA].
