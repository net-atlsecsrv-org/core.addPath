# About Azure Networking MSP partners

The [Azure Networking Managed Service Provider (MSP) Partner Program](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/enhancing-the-customer-experience-with-the-azure-networking-msp-partner-program/) enables network-services focused MSPs, Telcos, and Systems Integrators (SIs) to offer cloud and hybrid networking services centered around Azureâ€™s portfolio of networking products and services.

Azure Networking MSPs are a specialized set of managed service providers that address the enterprise cloud networking needs and challenges across all aspects of cloud and hybrid networking. The managed network services include one or more of the following services: network architecture, planning, deployment, operations, maintenance, and optimization.

Customers can purchase MSP-managed services offers in the Azure Marketplace, or directly from the MSP. MSPs can deploy and manage Azure networking resources in the customers' subscriptions and resource groups by using [Azure Lighthouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-lighthouse/).
