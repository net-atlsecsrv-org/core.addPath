# Azure network round trip latency statistics

Azure continuously monitors the latency (speed) of core areas of its network using internal monitoring tools as well as measurements collected by [ThousandEyes](https://thousandeyes.com), a third-party synthetic monitoring service.

## How are the measurements collected?

The latency measurements are collected from ThousandEyes agents, hosted in Azure cloud regions worldwide, that continuously send network probes between themselves in 1-minute intervals. The monthly latency statistics are derived from averaging the collected samples for the month.

## February 2020 round trip latency figures

The monthly average round-trip times between Azure regions for past 29 days (ending on February 29, 2020) are shown below. The following measurements are powered by [ThousandEyes](https://thousandeyes.com).
