Network Watcher packet capture allows you to create capture sessions to track traffic to and from a virtual machine. Filters are provided for the capture session to ensure you capture only the traffic you want. Packet capture helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactively. Other uses include gathering network statistics, gaining information on network intrusions, to debug client-server communications and much more. By being able to remotely trigger packet captures, this capability eases the burden of running a packet capture manually and on the desired machine, which saves valuable time.

To perform the steps in this article, you need to [install the Azure Command-Line Interface for Mac, Linux, and Windows (Azure CLI)](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

This article takes you through the different management tasks that are currently available for packet capture.

- [**Start a packet capture**](#start-a-packet-capture)
- [**Stop a packet capture**](#stop-a-packet-capture)
- [**Delete a packet capture**](#delete-a-packet-capture)
- [**Download a packet capture**](#download-a-packet-capture)

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have the following resources:

- An instance of Network Watcher in the region you want to create a packet capture
- A virtual machine with the packet capture extension enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Packet capture requires an agent to be running on the virtual machine. The Agent is installed as an extension. For instructions on VM extensions, visit [Virtual Machine extensions and features](../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-features.md).

## Install VM extension

### Step 1

Run the `az vm extension set` command to install the packet capture agent on the guest virtual machine.

For Windows virtual machines:

```azurecli
az vm extension set --resource-group resourceGroupName --vm-name virtualMachineName --publisher Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher --name NetworkWatcherAgentWindows --version 1.4
```

For Linux virtual machines:

```azurecli
az vm extension set --resource-group resourceGroupName --vm-name virtualMachineName --publisher Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher --name NetworkWatcherAgentLinux --version 1.4
```

### Step 2

To ensure that the agent is installed, run the `vm extension show` command and pass it the resource group and virtual machine name. Check the resulting list to ensure the agent is installed.

For Windows virtual machines:
```azurecli
az vm extension show --resource-group resourceGroupName --vm-name virtualMachineName --name NetworkWatcherAgentWindows
```

For Linux virtual machines:
```azurecli
az vm extension show --resource-group resourceGroupName --vm-name virtualMachineName --name AzureNetworkWatcherExtension
```

The following sample is an example of the response from running `az vm extension show`

```json
{
  "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
  "forceUpdateTag": null,
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}/extensions/NetworkWatcherAgentWindows",
  "instanceView": null,
  "location": "westcentralus",
  "name": "NetworkWatcherAgentWindows",
  "protectedSettings": null,
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher",
  "resourceGroup": "{resourceGroupName}",
  "settings": null,
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
  "typeHandlerVersion": "1.4",
  "virtualMachineExtensionType": "NetworkWatcherAgentWindows"
}
```

## Start a packet capture

Once the preceding steps are complete, the packet capture agent is installed on the virtual machine.


### Step 1

Retrieve a storage account. This storage account is used to store the packet capture file.

```azurecli
az storage account list
```

### Step 2

At this point, you are ready to create a packet capture.  First, let's examine the parameters you may want to configure. Filters are one such parameter that can be used to limit the data that is stored by the packet capture. The following example sets up a packet capture with several  filters.  The first three filters collect outgoing TCP traffic only from local IP 10.0.0.3 to destination ports 20, 80 and 443.  The last filter collects only UDP traffic.

```azurecli
az network watcher packet-capture create --resource-group {resourceGroupName} --vm {vmName} --name packetCaptureName --storage-account {storageAccountName} --filters "[{\"protocol\":\"TCP\", \"remoteIPAddress\":\"1.1.1.1-255.255.255\",\"localIPAddress\":\"10.0.0.3\", \"remotePort\":\"20\"},{\"protocol\":\"TCP\", \"remoteIPAddress\":\"1.1.1.1-255.255.255\",\"localIPAddress\":\"10.0.0.3\", \"remotePort\":\"80\"},{\"protocol\":\"TCP\", \"remoteIPAddress\":\"1.1.1.1-255.255.255\",\"localIPAddress\":\"10.0.0.3\", \"remotePort\":\"443\"},{\"protocol\":\"UDP\"}]"
```

The following example is the expected output from running the `az network watcher packet-capture create` command.

```json
{
  "bytesToCapturePerPacket": 0,
  "etag": "W/\"b8cf3528-2e14-45cb-a7f3-5712ffb687ac\"",
  "filters": [
    {
      "localIpAddress": "10.0.0.3",
      "localPort": "",
      "protocol": "TCP",
      "remoteIpAddress": "1.1.1.1-255.255.255",
      "remotePort": "20"
    },
    {
      "localIpAddress": "10.0.0.3",
      "localPort": "",
      "protocol": "TCP",
      "remoteIpAddress": "1.1.1.1-255.255.255",
      "remotePort": "80"
    },
    {
      "localIpAddress": "10.0.0.3",
      "localPort": "",
      "protocol": "TCP",
      "remoteIpAddress": "1.1.1.1-255.255.255",
      "remotePort": "443"
    },
    {
      "localIpAddress": "",
      "localPort": "",
      "protocol": "UDP",
      "remoteIpAddress": "",
      "remotePort": ""
    }
  ],
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/NetworkWatcherRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/NetworkWatcher_westcentralus/pa
cketCaptures/packetCaptureName",
  "name": "packetCaptureName",
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "resourceGroup": "NetworkWatcherRG",
  "storageLocation": {
    "filePath": null,

    "storagePath": "https://gwteststorage123abc.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/p

  },
  "target": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}",
  "timeLimitInSeconds": 18000,
  "totalBytesPerSession": 1073741824
}
```

## Get a packet capture

Running the `az network watcher packet-capture show-status` command, retrieves the status of a currently running, or completed packet capture.

```azurecli
az network watcher packet-capture show-status --name packetCaptureName --location {networkWatcherLocation}
```

The following example is the output from the `az network watcher packet-capture show-status` command. The following example is when the capture is Stopped, with a StopReason of TimeExceeded. 

```
{
  "additionalProperties": {
    "status": "Succeeded"
  },
  "captureStartTime": "2016-12-06T17:20:01.5671279Z",
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/NetworkWatcherRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/NetworkWatcher_westcentralus/pa
cketCaptures/packetCaptureName",
  "name": "packetCaptureName",
  "packetCaptureError": [],
  "packetCaptureStatus": "Stopped",
  "stopReason": "TimeExceeded"
}
```

## Stop a packet capture

By running the `az network watcher packet-capture stop` command, if a capture session is in progress it is stopped.

```azurecli
az network watcher packet-capture stop --name packetCaptureName --location westcentralus
```

> [!NOTE]
> The command returns no response when ran on a currently running capture session or an existing session that has already stopped.

## Delete a packet capture

```azurecli
az network watcher packet-capture delete --name packetCaptureName --location westcentralus
```

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a packet capture does not delete the file in the storage account.

## Download a packet capture

Once your packet capture session has completed, the capture file can be uploaded to blob storage or to a local file on the VM. The storage location of the packet capture is defined at creation of the session. A convenient tool to access these capture files saved to a storage account is Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, which can be downloaded here:  https://storageexplorer.com/

If a storage account is specified, packet capture files are saved to a storage account at the following location:

```
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{storageAccountResourceGroup}/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/{VMName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/packetCapture_{creationTime}.cap
```
