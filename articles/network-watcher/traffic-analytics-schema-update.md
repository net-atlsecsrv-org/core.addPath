# Sample queries with new fields in the Traffic Analytics schema (August 2019 schema update)

The [Traffic Analytics log schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics-schema) includes the following new fields: **SrcPublicIPs_s**, **DestPublicIPs_s**, **NSGRule_s**. The new fields provide information about source and destination IPs, and they simplify queries.

In the next few months, the following older fields will be deprecated: **VMIP_s**, **Subscription_g**, **Region_s**, **NSGRules_s**, **Subnet_s**, **VM_s**, **NIC_s**, **PublicIPs_s**, **FlowCount_d**.

The following three examples show how to replace the old fields with the new ones.

## Example 1: VMIP_s, Subscription_g, Region_s, Subnet_s, VM_s, NIC_s, and PublicIPs_s fields

We don't have to infer source and destination cases from the **FlowDirection_s** field for AzurePublic and ExternalPublic flows. It can also be inappropriate to use the **FlowDirection_s** field for a network virtual appliance.

```Old Kusto query
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FASchemaVersion_s == "1"
| extend isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows = FlowType_s in ("AzurePublic", "ExternalPublic")
| extend SourceAzureVM = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'O', VM_s, "N/A"), VM1_s),
SourceAzureVMIP = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'O', VM_s, "N/A"), SrcIP_s),
SourceAzureVMSubscription = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'O', Subscription_g, "N/A"), Subscription1_g),
SourceAzureRegion = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'O', Region_s, "N/A"), Region1_s),
SourceAzureSubnet = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'O', Subnet_s, "N/A"), Subnet1_s),
SourceAzureNIC = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'O', NIC_s, "N/A"), NIC1_s),
DestAzureVM = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'I', VM_s, "N/A"), VM2_s),
DestAzureVMIP = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'I', VM_s, "N/A"), DestIP_s),
DestAzureVMSubscription = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'I', Subscription_g, "N/A"), Subscription2_g),
DestAzureRegion = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'I', Region_s, "N/A"), Region2_s),
DestAzureSubnet = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'I', Subnet_s, "N/A"), Subnet2_s),
DestAzureNIC = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows, iif(FlowDirection_s == 'I', NIC_s, "N/A"), NIC2_s),
SourcePublicIPsAggregated = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows and FlowDirection_s == 'I', PublicIPs_s, "N/A"),
DestPublicIPsAggregated = iif(isAzureOrExternalPublicFlows and FlowDirection_s == 'O', PublicIPs_s, "N/A")
```


```New Kusto query
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FASchemaVersion_s == "2"
| extend SourceAzureVM = iif(isnotempty(VM1_s), VM1_s, "N/A"),
SourceAzureVMIP = iif(isnotempty(SrcIP_s), SrcIP_s, "N/A"),
SourceAzureVMSubscription = iif(isnotempty(Subscription1_g), Subscription1_g, "N/A"),
SourceAzureRegion = iif(isnotempty(Region1_s), Region1_s, "N/A"),
SourceAzureSubnet = iif(isnotempty(Subnet1_s), Subnet1_s, "N/A"),
SourceAzureNIC = iif(isnotempty(NIC1_s), NIC1_s, "N/A"),
DestAzureVM = iif(isnotempty(VM2_s), VM2_s, "N/A"),
DestAzureVMIP = iif(isnotempty(DestIP_s), DestIP_s, "N/A"),
DestAzureVMSubscription = iif(isnotempty(Subscription2_g), Subscription2_g, "N/A"),
DestAzureRegion = iif(isnotempty(Region2_s), Region2_s, "N/A"),
DestAzureSubnet = iif(isnotempty(Subnet2_s), Subnet2_s, "N/A"),
DestAzureNIC = iif(isnotempty(NIC2_s), NIC2_s, "N/A"),
SourcePublicIPsAggregated = iif(isnotempty(SrcPublicIPs_s), SrcPublicIPs_s, "N/A"),
DestPublicIPsAggregated = iif(isnotempty(DestPublicIPs_s), DestPublicIPs_s, "N/A")
```

## Example 2: NSGRules_s field

The old field used the format:

`<Index value 0)>|<NSG_ RuleName>|<Flow Direction>|<Flow Status>|<FlowCount ProcessedByRule>`

We no longer aggregate data across a network security group (NSG). In the updated schema, **NSGList_s** contains only one NSG. Also **NSGRules** contains only one rule. We removed the complicated formatting here and in other fields as shown in the example.

```Old Kusto query
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FASchemaVersion_s == "1"
| extend NSGRuleComponents = split(NSGRules_s, "|")
| extend NSGName = NSGList_s // remains same
| extend NSGRuleName = NSGRuleComponents[1],
         FlowDirection = NSGRuleComponents[2],
         FlowStatus = NSGRuleComponents[3],
         FlowCountProcessedByRule = NSGRuleComponents[4]
| project NSGName, NSGRuleName, FlowDirection, FlowStatus, FlowCountProcessedByRule
```

```New Kusto query
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FASchemaVersion_s == "2"
| extend NSGRuleComponents = split(NSGRules_s, "|")
| project NSGName = NSGList_s,
NSGRuleName = NSGRule_s ,
FlowDirection = FlowDirection_s,
FlowStatus = FlowStatus_s,
FlowCountProcessedByRule = AllowedInFlows_d + DeniedInFlows_d + AllowedOutFlows_d + DeniedOutFlows_d
```

## Example 3: FlowCount_d field

Because we do not club data across the NSG, the **FlowCount_d** is simply:

**AllowedInFlows_d** + **DeniedInFlows_d** + **AllowedOutFlows_d** + **DeniedOutFlows_d**

Only one of the four fields will be nonzero. The other three fields will be zero. The fields populate to indicate the status and count in the NIC where the flow was captured.

To illustrate these conditions:

- If the flow was allowed, one of the "Allowed" prefixed fields will be populated.
- If the flow was denied, one of the "Denied" prefixed fields will be populated.
- If the flow was inbound, one of the "InFlows_d" suffixed fields will be populated.
- If the flow was outbound, one of the "OutFlows_d" suffixed fields will be populated.

Depending on the conditions, we know which one of the four fields will be populated.
