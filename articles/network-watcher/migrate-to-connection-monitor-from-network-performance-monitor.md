# Migrate to Connection Monitor from Network Performance Monitor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting 1 July 2021, you will not be able to add new tests in an existing workspace or enable a new workspace with Network Performance Monitor. You can continue to use the tests created prior to 1 July 2021. To minimize service disruption to your current workloads, migrate your tests from Network Performance Monitor to the new Connection Monitor in Azure Network Watcher before 29 February 2024.

You can migrate tests from Network Performance Monitor (NPM) to new, improved Connection Monitor with a single click and with zero downtime. To learn more about the benefits, see [Connection Monitor](./connection-monitor-overview.md).


## Key points to note

The migration helps produce the following results:

* On-premises agents and firewall settings work as is. No changes are required. Log Analytics agents that are installed on Azure virtual machines need to be replaced with the [Network Watcher extension](../virtual-machines/extensions/network-watcher-windows.md).
* Existing tests are mapped to Connection Monitor > Test Group > Test format. By selecting **Edit**, you can view and modify the properties of the new Connection Monitor, download a template to make changes to it, and submit the template via Azure Resource Manager.
* Agents send data to both the Log Analytics workspace and the metrics.
* Data monitoring:
   * **Data in Log Analytics**: Before migration, the data remains in the workspace in which NPM is configured in the NetworkMonitoring table. After the migration, the data goes to the NetworkMonitoring table, NWConnectionMonitorTestResult table and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult table in the same workspace. After the tests are disabled in NPM, the data is stored only in the NWConnectionMonitorTestResult table and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult table.
   * **Log-based alerts, dashboards, and integrations**: You must manually edit the queries based on the new NWConnectionMonitorTestResult table and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult table. To re-create the alerts in metrics, see [Network connectivity monitoring with Connection Monitor](./connection-monitor-overview.md#metrics-in-azure-monitor).
* For ExpressRoute Monitoring:
	* **End to end loss and latency**:  Connection Monitor will power this, and it will easier than NPM as users do not need to configure which circuits and peerings to monitor. Circuits in the path will automatically be discovered , data will be available in metrics (faster than LA which was where NPM stored the results). Topology will work as is as well.
	* **Bandwidth measurements**: With the launch of bandwidth related metrics, NPMâ€™s log analytics based approach was not effective in bandwidth monitoring for ExpressRoute customers. This capability is now not available in Connection Monitor.
	
## Prerequisites

* Ensure that Network Watcher is enabled in your subscription and the region of the Log Analytics workspace. 
* In case Azure VM belonging to a different region/subscription than that of Log Analytics workspace is used as an endpoint, make sure Network Watcher is enabled for that subscription and region.   
* Azure virtual machines with Log Analytics agents installed must be enabled with the Network Watcher extension.

## Migrate the tests

To migrate the tests from Network Performance Monitor to Connection Monitor, do the following:

1. In Network Watcher, select **Connection Monitor**, and then select the **Migrate tests from NPM** tab. 

	:::image type="content" source="./media/connection-monitor-2-preview/migrate-npm-to-cm-preview.png" alt-text="Migrate tests from Network Performance Monitor to Connection Monitor" lightbox="./media/connection-monitor-2-preview/migrate-npm-to-cm-preview.png":::
	
1. In the drop-down lists, select your subscription and workspace, and then select the NPM feature you want to migrate. 
1. Select **Import** to migrate the tests.

After the migration begins, the following changes take place: 
* A new connection monitor resource is created.
   * One connection monitor per region and subscription is created. For tests with on-premises agents, the new connection monitor name is formatted as `<workspaceName>_"workspace_region_name"`. For tests with Azure agents, the new connection monitor name is formatted as `<workspaceName>_<Azure_region_name>`.
   * Monitoring data is now stored in the same Log Analytics workspace in which NPM is enabled, in new tables called NWConnectionMonitorTestResult table and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult table. 
   * The test name is carried forward as the test group name. The test description isn't migrated.
   * Source and destination endpoints are created and used in the new test group. For on-premises agents, the endpoints are formatted as `<workspaceName>_<FQDN of on-premises machine>`.The Agent description isn't migrated.
   * Destination port and probing interval are moved to a test configuration called `TC_<protocol>_<port>` and `TC_<protocol>_<port>_AppThresholds`. The protocol is set based on the port values. For ICMP, the test configurations are named as `TC_<protocol>` and `TC_<protocol>_AppThresholds`. Success thresholds and other optional properties if set are migrated, otherwise are left blank.
   * If the migrating tests contain agents that aren't running, you need to enable the agents and migrate again.
* NPM isn't disabled, so the migrated tests can continue to send data to the NetworkMonitoring table, NWConnectionMonitorTestResult table and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult table. This approach ensures that existing log-based alerts and integrations are unaffected.
* The newly created connection monitor is visible in Connection Monitor.

After the migration, be sure to:
* Manually disable the tests in NPM. Until you do so, you'll continue to be charged for them. 
* While you're disabling NPM, re-create your alerts on the NWConnectionMonitorTestResult and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult tables or use metrics. 
* Migrate any external integrations to the NWConnectionMonitorTestResult and NWConnectionMonitorPathResult tables. Examples of external integrations are dashboards in Power BI and Grafana, and integrations with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
