# Role-based access control permissions required to use Network Watcher capabilities

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) enables you to assign only the specific actions to members of your organization that they require to complete their assigned responsibilities. To use Network Watcher capabilities, the account you log into Azure with, must be assigned to the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json#owner), [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json#contributor), or [Network contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) built-in roles, or assigned to a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json) that is assigned the actions listed for each Network Watcher capability in the sections that follow. To learn more about Network Watcher's capabilities, see [What is Network Watcher?](network-watcher-monitoring-overview.md).
