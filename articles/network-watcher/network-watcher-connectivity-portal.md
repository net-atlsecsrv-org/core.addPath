# Troubleshoot connections with Azure Network Watcher using the Azure portal

Learn how to use connection troubleshoot to verify whether a direct TCP connection from a virtual machine to a given endpoint can be established.

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have the following resources:

* An instance of Network Watcher in the region you want to troubleshoot a connection.
* Virtual machines to troubleshoot connections with.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connection troubleshoot requires that the VM you troubleshoot from has the `AzureNetworkWatcherExtension` VM extension installed. For installing the extension on a Windows VM visit [Azure Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension for Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-nwa.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json) and for Linux VM visit [Azure Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension for Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/extensions-nwa.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json). The extension is not required on the destination endpoint.

## Check connectivity to a virtual machine

This example checks connectivity to a destination virtual machine over port 80.

Navigate to your Network Watcher and click **Connection troubleshoot**. Select the virtual machine to check connectivity from. In the **Destination** section choose **Select a virtual machine** and choose the correct virtual machine and port to test.

Once you click **Check**, connectivity between the virtual machines on the port specified is checked. In the example, the destination VM is unreachable, a listing of hops are shown.

## Check remote endpoint connectivity

To check the connectivity and latency to a remote endpoint, choose the **Specify manually** radio button in the **Destination** section, input the url and the port and click **Check**.  This is used for remote endpoints like websites and storage endpoints.
