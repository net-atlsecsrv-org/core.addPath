# Azure security baseline for Network Watcher

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Network Watcher. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Network Watcher. **Controls** not applicable to Network Watcher, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Network Watcher completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Network Watcher security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor configurations and detect changes for your Azure Network Watcher instances. Other than at the control plane (e.g. Azure portal), Network Watcher itself does not generate logs related to network traffic. Network Watcher provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to the control plane (e.g. Azure portal) of Azure Network Watcher. To use Network Watcher capabilities, the account you log into Azure with, must be assigned to the Owner, Contributor, or Network contributor built-in roles, or assigned to a custom role that is assigned the actions listed for specific Network Watcher capabilities.

You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory.

- [Understand Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md)

- [Role-based access control permissions required to use Network Watcher capabilities](required-rbac-permissions.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Keep track of dedicated administrative accounts and use recommendations from Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription

- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

For more information, see the following references:

- [How to use Azure Identity Access Reviews](../active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system for Azure Network Watcher. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

You have access to Azure AD sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.
