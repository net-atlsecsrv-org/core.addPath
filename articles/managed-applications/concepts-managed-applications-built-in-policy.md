# Deploy associations for a managed application using Azure Policy

Azure policies can be used to deploy associations to associate resources to a managed application. In this article, we describe a built-in policy that deploys associations and how you can use that policy.

## Built-in policy to deploy associations

Deploy associations for a managed application is a built-in policy that can be used to deploy association to associate a resource to a managed application. The policy accepts three parameters:

- Managed application Id - This ID is the resource ID of the managed application to which the resources need to be associated.
- Resource types to associate - These resource types are the list of resource types to be associated to the managed application. You can associate multiple resource types to a managed application using the same policy.
- Association name prefix - This string is the prefix to be added to the name of the association resource being created. The default value is "DeployedByPolicy".

The policy uses DeployIfNotExists evaluation. It runs after a Resource Provider has handled a create or update resource request of the selected resource type(s) and the evaluation has returned a success status code. After that, the association resource gets deployed using a template deployment.
For more information on associations, see [Azure Custom Providers resource onboarding](./concepts-custom-providers-resourceonboarding.md)

## How to use the deploy associations built-in policy 

### Prerequisites
If the managed application needs permissions to the subscription to perform an action, the policy deployment of association resource wouldn't work without granting the permissions.

### Policy assignment
To use the built-in policy, create a policy assignment and assign the Deploy associations for a managed application policy. Once the policy has been assigned successfully, 
the policy will identify non-compliant resources and deploy association for those resources.
