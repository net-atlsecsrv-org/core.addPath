# Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints

This document lists some of the most common Microsoft Azure limits, which are also sometimes called quotas.

To learn more about Azure pricing, see [Azure pricing overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/). There, you can estimate your costs by using the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/). You also can go to the pricing details page for a particular service, for example, [Windows VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/#Windows). For tips to help manage your costs, see [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](../../billing/billing-getting-started.md).

## Managing limits

> [!NOTE]
> Some services have adjustable limits.
>
> When a service doesn't have adjustable limits, the following tables use the header **Limit**. In those cases, the default and the maximum limits are the same.
>
> When the limit can be adjusted, the tables include **Default limit** and **Maximum limit** headers. The limit can be raised above the default limit but not above the maximum limit.
>
> If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, [open an online customer support request at no charge](../templates/error-resource-quota.md).

[Free Trial subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p) aren't eligible for limit or quota increases. If you have a [Free Trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p), you can upgrade to a [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) subscription. For more information, see [Upgrade your Azure Free Trial subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](../../billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription.md) and the [Free Trial subscription FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq).

Some limits are managed at a regional level.

Let's use vCPU quotas as an example. To request a quota increase with support for vCPUs, you must decide how many vCPUs you want to use in which regions. You then make a specific request for Azure resource group vCPU quotas for the amounts and regions that you want. If you need to use 30 vCPUs in West Europe to run your application there, you specifically request 30 vCPUs in West Europe. Your vCPU quota isn't increased in any other region--only West Europe has the 30-vCPU quota.

As a result, decide what your Azure resource group quotas must be for your workload in any one region. Then request that amount in each region into which you want to deploy. For help in how to determine your current quotas for specific regions, see [Resolve errors for resource quotas](../templates/error-resource-quota.md).

## General limits

## Azure Cognitive Search limits

Pricing tiers determine the capacity and limits of your search service. Tiers include:

* **Free** multi-tenant service, shared with other Azure subscribers, is intended for evaluation and small development projects.
* **Basic** provides dedicated computing resources for production workloads at a smaller scale, with up to three replicas for highly available query workloads.
* **Standard**, which includes S1, S2, S3, and S3 High Density, is for larger production workloads. Multiple levels exist within the Standard tier so that you can choose a resource configuration that best matches your workload profile.
