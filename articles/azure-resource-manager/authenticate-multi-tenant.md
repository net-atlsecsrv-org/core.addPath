# Authenticate requests across tenants

When creating a multi-tenant application, you may need to handle authentication requests for resources that are in different tenants. A common scenario is when a virtual machine in one tenant must join a virtual network in another tenant. Azure Resource Manager provides a header value for storing auxiliary tokens to authenticate the requests to different tenants.

## Header values for authentication

The request has the following authentication header values:

| Header name | Description | Example value |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Authorization | Primary token | Bearer &lt;primary-token&gt; |
| x-ms-authorization-auxiliary | Auxiliary tokens | Bearer &lt;auxiliary-token1&gt;, EncryptedBearer &lt;auxiliary-token2&gt;, Bearer &lt;auxiliary-token3&gt; |

The auxiliary header can hold up to three auxiliary tokens. 

In the code of your multi-tenant app, get the authentication token for other tenants and store them in the auxiliary headers. All the tokens must be from the same user or application. The user or application must have been invited as a guest to the other tenants.

## Processing the request

When your app sends a request to Resource Manager, the request is run under the identity from the primary token. The primary token must be valid and unexpired. This token must be from a tenant that can manage the subscription.

When the request references a resource from different tenant, Resource Manager checks the auxiliary tokens to determine if the request can be processed. All auxiliary tokens in the header must be valid and unexpired. If any token is expired, Resource Manager returns a 401 response code. The response includes the client ID and tenant ID from the token that isn't valid. If the auxiliary header contains a valid token for the tenant, the cross tenant request is processed.
