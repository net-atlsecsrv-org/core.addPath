# Conditional deployment in Resource Manager templates

Sometimes you need to optionally deploy a resource in a template. Use the `condition` element to specify whether the resource is deployed. The value for this element resolves to true or false. When the value is true, the resource is created. When the value is false, the resource isn't created. The value can only be applied to the whole resource.

## New or existing resource

You can use conditional deployment to create a new resource or use an existing one. The following example shows how to use condition to deploy a new storage account or use an existing storage account.

```json
{
    "condition": "[equals(parameters('newOrExisting'),'new')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
    "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
    "apiVersion": "2017-06-01",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "sku": {
        "name": "[variables('storageAccountType')]"
    },
    "kind": "Storage",
    "properties": {}
}
```

When the parameter **newOrExisting** is set to **new**, the condition evaluates to true. The storage account is deployed. However, when **newOrExisting** is set to **existing**, the condition evaluates to false and the storage account isn't deployed.

For a complete example template that uses the `condition` element, see [VM with a new or existing Virtual Network, Storage, and Public IP](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-vm-new-or-existing-conditions).

## Allow condition

You can pass in a parameter value that indicates whether a condition is allowed. The following example deploys a SQL server and optionally allows Azure IPs.

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
    "name": "[parameters('serverName')]",
    "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "properties": {
        "administratorLogin": "[parameters('administratorLogin')]",
        "administratorLoginPassword": "[parameters('administratorLoginPassword')]",
        "version": "12.0"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "condition": "[parameters('allowAzureIPs')]",
            "type": "firewallRules",
            "name": "AllowAllWindowsAzureIps",
            "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
            "location": "[parameters('location')]",
            "dependsOn": [
                "[resourceId('Microsoft.Sql/servers/', parameters('serverName'))]"
            ],
            "properties": {
                "endIpAddress": "0.0.0.0",
                "startIpAddress": "0.0.0.0"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

For the complete template, see [Azure SQL logical server](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-sql-logical-server).

## Runtime functions

If you use a [reference](resource-group-template-functions-resource.md#reference) or [list](resource-group-template-functions-resource.md#list) function with a resource that is conditionally deployed, the function is evaluated even if the resource isn't deployed. You get an error if the function refers to a resource that doesn't exist.

Use the [if](resource-group-template-functions-logical.md#if) function to make sure the function is only evaluated for conditions when the resource is deployed. See the [if function](resource-group-template-functions-logical.md#if) for a sample template that uses if and reference with a conditionally deployed resource.

## Condition with complete mode

If you deploy a template with [complete mode](deployment-modes.md) and a resource isn't deployed because condition evaluates to false, the result depends on which REST API version you use to deploy the template. If you use a version earlier than 2019-05-10, the resource **isn't deleted**. With 2019-05-10 or later, the resource **is deleted**. The latest versions of Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI delete the resource when condition is false.
