# Quickstart: Create and publish a managed application definition

This quickstart provides an introduction to working with [Azure Managed Applications](overview.md). You can create and publish a managed application that is intended for members of your organization.

To publish a managed application to your service catalog, you must:

* Create a template that defines the resources to deploy with the managed application.
* Define the user interface elements for the portal when deploying the managed application.
* Create a _.zip_ package that contains the required template files.
* Decide which user, group, or application needs access to the resource group in the user's subscription.
* Create the managed application definition that points to the _.zip_ package and requests access for the identity.

## Create the ARM template

Every managed application definition includes a file named _mainTemplate.json_. In it, you define the Azure resources to deploy. The template is no different than a regular ARM template.

Create a file named _mainTemplate.json_. The name is case-sensitive.

Add the following JSON to your file. It defines the parameters for creating a storage account, and specifies the properties for the storage account.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "storageAccountNamePrefix": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "storageAccountType": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
        }
    },
    "variables": {
        "storageAccountName": "[concat(parameters('storageAccountNamePrefix'), uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
            "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
            "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
            "location": "[parameters('location')]",
            "sku": {
                "name": "[parameters('storageAccountType')]"
            },
            "kind": "StorageV2",
            "properties": {}
        }
    ],
    "outputs": {
        "storageEndpoint": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": "[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName')), '2019-06-01').primaryEndpoints.blob]"
        }
    }
}
```

Save the _mainTemplate.json_ file.

## Define your create experience

As a publisher, you define the portal experience for creating the managed application. The _createUiDefinition.json_ file generates the portal interface. You define how users provide input for each parameter using [control elements](create-uidefinition-elements.md) including drop-downs, text boxes, and password boxes.

Create a file named _createUiDefinition.json_ (This name is case-sensitive)

Add the following starter JSON to the file and save it.

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/0.1.2-preview/CreateUIDefinition.MultiVm.json#",
   "handler": "Microsoft.Azure.CreateUIDef",
   "version": "0.1.2-preview",
   "parameters": {
        "basics": [
            {}
        ],
        "steps": [
            {
                "name": "storageConfig",
                "label": "Storage settings",
                "subLabel": {
                    "preValidation": "Configure the infrastructure settings",
                    "postValidation": "Done"
                },
                "bladeTitle": "Storage settings",
                "elements": [
                    {
                        "name": "storageAccounts",
                        "type": "Microsoft.Storage.MultiStorageAccountCombo",
                        "label": {
                            "prefix": "Storage account name prefix",
                            "type": "Storage account type"
                        },
                        "defaultValue": {
                            "type": "Standard_LRS"
                        },
                        "constraints": {
                            "allowedTypes": [
                                "Premium_LRS",
                                "Standard_LRS",
                                "Standard_GRS"
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "outputs": {
            "storageAccountNamePrefix": "[steps('storageConfig').storageAccounts.prefix]",
            "storageAccountType": "[steps('storageConfig').storageAccounts.type]",
            "location": "[location()]"
        }
    }
}
```

## Package the files

Add the two files to a _.zip_ file named _app.zip_. The two files must be at the root level of the _.zip_ file. If you put them in a folder, you receive an error when creating the managed application definition that states the required files aren't present.

Upload the package to an accessible location from where it can be consumed. You'll need to provide a unique name for the storage account.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name storageGroup -Location eastus

$storageAccount = New-AzStorageAccount `
  -ResourceGroupName storageGroup `
  -Name "mystorageaccount" `
  -Location eastus `
  -SkuName Standard_LRS `
  -Kind StorageV2

$ctx = $storageAccount.Context

New-AzStorageContainer -Name appcontainer -Context $ctx -Permission blob

Set-AzStorageBlobContent `
  -File "D:\myapplications\app.zip" `
  -Container appcontainer `
  -Blob "app.zip" `
  -Context $ctx 
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name storageGroup --location eastus

az storage account create \
    --name mystorageaccount \
    --resource-group storageGroup \
    --location eastus \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --kind StorageV2

az storage container create \
    --account-name mystorageaccount \
    --name appcontainer \
    --public-access blob

az storage blob upload \
    --account-name mystorageaccount \
    --container-name appcontainer \
    --name "app.zip" \
    --file "D:\myapplications\app.zip"

```

## Create the managed application definition

### Create an Azure Active Directory user group or application

The next step is to select a user group, user, or application for managing the resources for the customer. This identity has permissions on the managed resource group according to the role that is assigned. The role can be any Azure built-in role like Owner or Contributor. To create a new Active Directory user group, see [Create a group and add members in Azure Active Directory](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md).

You need the object ID of the user group to use for managing the resources. 

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$groupID=(Get-AzADGroup -DisplayName mygroup).Id
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
groupid=$(az ad group show --group mygroup --query objectId --output tsv)
```

---

### Get the role definition ID

Next, you need the role definition ID of the RBAC built-in role you want to grant access to the user, user group, or application. Typically, you use the Owner or Contributor or Reader role. The following command shows how to get the role definition ID for the Owner role:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$ownerID=(Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name Owner).Id
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
ownerid=$(az role definition list --name Owner --query [].name --output tsv)
```

---

### Create the managed application definition

If you don't already have a resource group for storing your managed application definition, create one now:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name appDefinitionGroup -Location westcentralus
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name appDefinitionGroup --location westcentralus
```

---

Now, create the managed application definition resource.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$blob = Get-AzStorageBlob -Container appcontainer -Blob app.zip -Context $ctx

New-AzManagedApplicationDefinition `
  -Name "ManagedStorage" `
  -Location "westcentralus" `
  -ResourceGroupName appDefinitionGroup `
  -LockLevel ReadOnly `
  -DisplayName "Managed Storage Account" `
  -Description "Managed Azure Storage Account" `
  -Authorization "${groupID}:$ownerID" `
  -PackageFileUri $blob.ICloudBlob.StorageUri.PrimaryUri.AbsoluteUri
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
blob=$(az storage blob url --account-name mystorageaccount --container-name appcontainer --name app.zip --output tsv)

az managedapp definition create \
  --name "ManagedStorage" \
  --location "westcentralus" \
  --resource-group appDefinitionGroup \
  --lock-level ReadOnly \
  --display-name "Managed Storage Account" \
  --description "Managed Azure Storage Account" \
  --authorizations "$groupid:$ownerid" \
  --package-file-uri "$blob"
```

---

When the command completes, you have a managed application definition in your resource group.

Some of the parameters used in the preceding example are:

* **resource group**: The name of the resource group where the managed application definition is created.
* **lock level**: The type of lock placed on the managed resource group. It prevents the customer from performing undesirable operations on this resource group. Currently, ReadOnly is the only supported lock level. When ReadOnly is specified, the customer can only read the resources present in the managed resource group. The publisher identities that are granted access to the managed resource group are exempt from the lock.
* **authorizations**: Describes the principal ID and the role definition ID that are used to grant permission to the managed resource group. It's specified in the format of `<principalId>:<roleDefinitionId>`. If more than one value is needed, specify them in the form `<principalId1>:<roleDefinitionId1>,<principalId2>:<roleDefinitionId2>`. The values are separated by a comma.
* **package file URI**: The location of a _.zip_ package that contains the required files.

## Bring your own storage for the managed application definition

You can choose to store your managed application definition within a storage account provided by you during creation so that its location and access can be fully managed by you for your regulatory needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Bring your own storage is only supported with ARM template or REST API deployments of the managed application definition.

### Select your storage account

You must [create a storage account](../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md) to contain your managed application definition for use with Service Catalog.

Copy the storage account's resource ID. It will be used later when deploying the definition.

### Set the role assignment for "Appliance Resource Provider" in your storage account

Before your managed application definition can be deployed to your storage account, you must give contributor permissions to the **Appliance Resource Provider** role so that it can write the definition files to your storage account's container.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your storage account.
1. Select **Access control (IAM)** to display the access control settings for the storage account. Select the **Role assignments** tab to see the list of role assignments.
1. In the **Add role assignment** window, select the **Contributor** role. 
1. From the **Assign access to** field, select **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**.
1. Under **Select**, search for **Appliance Resource Provider** role and select it.
1. Save the role assignment.

### Deploy the managed application definition with an ARM template

Use the following ARM template to deploy your packaged managed application as a new managed application definition in Service Catalog whose definition files are stored and maintained in your own storage account:
   
```json
    {
    "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
        },
        "applicationName": {
            "type": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "description": "Managed Application name"
            }
        },
        "storageAccountType": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "Standard_LRS",
      "allowedValues": [
        "Standard_LRS",
        "Standard_GRS",
        "Standard_ZRS",
        "Premium_LRS"
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Storage Account type"
      }
    },
        "definitionStorageResourceID": {
            "type": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "description": "Storage account resource ID for where you're storing your definition"
            }
        },
        "_artifactsLocation": {
            "type": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "description": "The base URI where artifacts required by this template are located."
            }
        }
    },
    "variables": {
        "lockLevel": "None",
        "description": "Sample Managed application definition",
        "displayName": "Sample Managed application definition",
        "managedApplicationDefinitionName": "[parameters('applicationName')]",
        "packageFileUri": "[parameters('_artifactsLocation')]",
        "defLocation": "[parameters('definitionStorageResourceID')]",
        "managedResourceGroupId": "[concat(subscription().id,'/resourceGroups/', concat(parameters('applicationName'),'_managed'))]",
        "applicationDefinitionResourceId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Solutions/applicationDefinitions',variables('managedApplicationDefinitionName'))]"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Solutions/applicationDefinitions",
            "apiVersion": "2019-07-01",
            "name": "[variables('managedApplicationDefinitionName')]",
            "location": "[parameters('location')]",
            "properties": {
                "lockLevel": "[variables('lockLevel')]",
                "description": "[variables('description')]",
                "displayName": "[variables('displayName')]",
                "packageFileUri": "[variables('packageFileUri')]",
                "storageAccountId": "[variables('defLocation')]"
            }
        }
    ],
    "outputs": {}
}
```

We have added a new property named `storageAccountId` to your `applicationDefinitions` properties and provide storage account ID you wish to store your definition in as its value:

You can verify that the application definition files are saved in your provided storage account in a container titled `applicationDefinitions`.

> [!NOTE]
> For added security, you can create a managed applications definition store it in an [Azure storage account blob where encryption is enabled](../../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md). The definition contents are encrypted through the storage account's encryption options. Only users with permissions to the file can see the definition in Service Catalog.

## Make sure users can see your definition

You have access to the managed application definition, but you want to make sure other users in your organization can access it. Grant them at least the Reader role on the definition. They may have inherited this level of access from the subscription or resource group. To check who has access to the definition and add users or groups, see [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

## Next steps

You've published the managed application definition. Now, learn how to deploy an instance of that definition.
