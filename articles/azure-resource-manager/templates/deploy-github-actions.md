# Deploy Azure Resource Manager templates by using GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions) is a suite of features in GitHub to automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues.

Use the [Deploy Azure Resource Manager Template Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-azure-resource-manager-arm-template) to automate deploying a Resource Manager template to Azure. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up for [free](https://github.com/join).  
    - A GitHub repository to store your Resource Manager templates and your workflow files. To create one, see [Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/creating-a-new-repository).


## Workflow file overview

A workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

The file has two sections:

|Section  |Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|**Authentication** | 1. Define a service principal. <br /> 2. Create a GitHub secret. |
|**Deploy** | 1. Deploy the Resource Manager template. |

## Generate deployment credentials


You can create a [service principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md#service-principal-object) with the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac&preserve-view=true) command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/). Run this command with [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in the Azure portal or by selecting the **Try it** button.

Create a resource group if you do not already have one. 

```azurecli-interactive
    az group create -n {MyResourceGroup}
```

Replace the placeholder `myApp` with the name of your application. 

```azurecli-interactive
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name {myApp} --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{MyResourceGroup} --sdk-auth
```

In the example above, replace the placeholders with your subscription ID and resource group name. The output is a JSON object with the role assignment credentials that provide access to your App Service app similar to below. Copy this JSON object for later. You will only need the sections with the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `subscriptionId`, and `tenantId` values. 

```output 
  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is always a good practice to grant minimum access. The scope in the previous example is limited to the resource group.



## Configure the GitHub secrets

You need to create secrets for your Azure credentials, resource group, and subscriptions. 

1. In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse your repository.

1. Select **Settings > Secrets > New secret**.

1. Paste the entire JSON output from the Azure CLI command into the secret's value field. Give the secret the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

1. Create another secret named `AZURE_RG`. Add the name of your resource group to the secret's value field (example: `myResourceGroup`). 

1. Create an additional secret named `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION`. Add your subscription ID to the secret's value field (example: `90fd3f9d-4c61-432d-99ba-1273f236afa2`). 

## Add Resource Manager template

Add a Resource Manager template to your GitHub repository. This template creates a storage account.

```url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json
```

You can put the file anywhere in the repository. The workflow sample in the next section assumes the template file is named **azuredeploy.json**, and it is stored at the root of your repository.

## Create workflow

The workflow file must be stored in the **.github/workflows** folder at the root of your repository. The workflow file extension can be either **.yml** or **.yaml**.

1. From your GitHub repository, select **Actions** from the top menu.
1. Select **New workflow**.
1. Select **set up a workflow yourself**.
1. Rename the workflow file if you prefer a different name other than **main.yml**. For example: **deployStorageAccount.yml**.
1. Replace the content of the yml file with the following:

    ```yml
    on: [push]
    name: Azure ARM
    jobs:
      build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:

          # Checkout code
        - uses: actions/checkout@master

          # Log into Azure
        - uses: azure/login@v1
          with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
     
          # Deploy ARM template
        - name: Run ARM deploy
          uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
          with:
            subscriptionId: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
            resourceGroupName: ${{ secrets.AZURE_RG }}
            template: ./azuredeploy.json
            parameters: storageAccountType=Standard_LRS 
        
          # output containerName variable from template
        - run: echo ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.containerName }}
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can specify a JSON format parameters file instead in the ARM Deploy action (example: `.azuredeploy.parameters.json`).  

    The first section of the workflow file includes:

    - **name**: The name of the workflow.
    - **on**: The name of the GitHub events that triggers the workflow. The workflow is trigger when there is a push event on the master branch, which modifies at least one of the two files specified. The two files are the workflow file and the template file.

1. Select **Start commit**.
1. Select **Commit directly to the master branch**.
1. Select **Commit new file** (or **Commit changes**).

Because the workflow is configured to be triggered by either the workflow file or the template file being updated, the workflow starts right after you commit the changes.

## Check workflow status

1. Select the **Actions** tab. You will see a **Create deployStorageAccount.yml** workflow listed. It takes 1-2 minutes to run the workflow.
1. Select the workflow to open it.
1. Select **Run ARM deploy** from the menu to verify the deployment.

## Clean up resources

When your resource group and repository are no longer needed, clean up the resources you deployed by deleting the resource group and your GitHub repository.
