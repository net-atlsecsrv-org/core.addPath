# Deploy resources with ARM templates and Azure CLI

This article explains how to use Azure CLI with Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) to deploy your resources to Azure. If you aren't familiar with the concepts of deploying and managing your Azure solutions, see [template deployment overview](overview.md).

The deployment commands changed in Azure CLI version 2.2.0. The examples in this article require Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

If you don't have Azure CLI installed, you can use the [Cloud Shell](#deploy-template-from-cloud-shell).

## Deployment scope

You can target your deployment to a resource group, subscription, management group, or tenant. In most cases, you'll target deployment to a resource group. To apply policies and role assignments across a larger scope, use subscription, management group, or tenant deployments. When deploying to a subscription, you can create a resource group and deploy resources to it.

Depending on the scope of the deployment, you use different commands.

* To deploy to a **resource group**, use [az deployment group create](/cli/azure/deployment/group#az-deployment-group-create):

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file <path-to-template>
  ```

* To deploy to a **subscription**, use [az deployment sub create](/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-create):

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az deployment sub create --location <location> --template-file <path-to-template>
  ```

  For more information about subscription level deployments, see [Create resource groups and resources at the subscription level](deploy-to-subscription.md).

* To deploy to a **management group**, use [az deployment mg create](/cli/azure/deployment/mg#az-deployment-mg-create):

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az deployment mg create --location <location> --template-file <path-to-template>
  ```

  For more information about management group level deployments, see [Create resources at the management group level](deploy-to-management-group.md).

* To deploy to a **tenant**, use [az deployment tenant create](/cli/azure/deployment/tenant#az-deployment-tenant-create):

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az deployment tenant create --location <location> --template-file <path-to-template>
  ```

  For more information about tenant level deployments, see [Create resources at the tenant level](deploy-to-tenant.md).

The examples in this article use resource group deployments.

## Deploy local template

When deploying resources to Azure, you:

1. Sign in to your Azure account
2. Create a resource group that serves as the container for the deployed resources. The name of the resource group can only include alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, hyphens, and parenthesis. It can be up to 90 characters. It can't end in a period.
3. Deploy to the resource group the template that defines the resources to create.

A template can include parameters that enable you to customize the deployment. For example, you can provide values that are tailored for a particular environment (such as dev, test, and production). The sample template defines a parameter for the storage account SKU.

The following example creates a resource group, and deploys a template from your local machine:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name ExampleGroup --location "Central US"
az deployment group create \
  --name ExampleDeployment \
  --resource-group ExampleGroup \
  --template-file storage.json \
  --parameters storageAccountType=Standard_GRS
```

The deployment can take a few minutes to complete. When it finishes, you see a message that includes the result:

```output
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
```

## Deployment name

In the preceding example, you named the deployment `ExampleDeployment`. If you don't provide a name for the deployment, the name of the template file is used. For example, if you deploy a template named `azuredeploy.json` and don't specify a deployment name, the deployment is named `azuredeploy`.

Every time you run a deployment, an entry is added to the resource group's deployment history with the deployment name. If you run another deployment and give it the same name, the earlier entry is replaced with the current deployment. If you want to maintain unique entries in the deployment history, give each deployment a unique name.

To create a unique name, you can assign a random number.

```azurecli-interactive
deploymentName='ExampleDeployment'$RANDOM
```

Or, add a date value.

```azurecli-interactive
deploymentName='ExampleDeployment'$(date +"%d-%b-%Y")
```

If you run concurrent deployments to the same resource group with the same deployment name, only the last deployment is completed. Any deployments with the same name that haven't finished are replaced by the last deployment. For example, if you run a deployment named `newStorage` that deploys a storage account named `storage1`, and at the same time run another deployment named `newStorage` that deploys a storage account named `storage2`, you deploy only one storage account. The resulting storage account is named `storage2`.

However, if you run a deployment named `newStorage` that deploys a storage account named `storage1`, and immediately after it completes you run another deployment named `newStorage` that deploys a storage account named `storage2`, then you have two storage accounts. One is named `storage1`, and the other is named `storage2`. But, you only have one entry in the deployment history.

When you specify a unique name for each deployment, you can run them concurrently without conflict. If you run a deployment named `newStorage1` that deploys a storage account named `storage1`, and at the same time run another deployment named `newStorage2` that deploys a storage account named `storage2`, then you have two storage accounts and two entries in the deployment history.

To avoid conflicts with concurrent deployments and to ensure unique entries in the deployment history, give each deployment a unique name.

## Deploy remote template

Instead of storing ARM templates on your local machine, you may prefer to store them in an external location. You can store templates in a source control repository (such as GitHub). Or, you can store them in an Azure storage account for shared access in your organization.

To deploy an external template, use the **template-uri** parameter. Use the URI in the example to deploy the sample template from GitHub.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name ExampleGroup --location "Central US"
az deployment group create \
  --name ExampleDeployment \
  --resource-group ExampleGroup \
  --template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json" \
  --parameters storageAccountType=Standard_GRS
```

The preceding example requires a publicly accessible URI for the template, which works for most scenarios because your template shouldn't include sensitive data. If you need to specify sensitive data (like an admin password), pass that value as a secure parameter. However, if you don't want your template to be publicly accessible, you can protect it by storing it in a private storage container. For information about deploying a template that requires a shared access signature (SAS) token, see [Deploy private template with SAS token](secure-template-with-sas-token.md).

## Deploy template spec

Instead of deploying a local or remote template, you can create a [template spec](template-specs.md). The template spec is a resource in your Azure subscription that contains an ARM template. It makes it easy to securely share the template with users in your organization. You use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to grant access to the template spec. This feature is currently in preview.

The following examples show how to create and deploy a template spec. These commands are only available if you've [signed up for the preview](https://aka.ms/templateSpecOnboarding).

First, you create the template spec by providing the ARM template.

```azurecli
az ts create \
  --name storageSpec \
  --version "1.0" \
  --resource-group templateSpecRG \
  --location "westus2" \
  --template-file "./mainTemplate.json"
```

Then, you get the ID for template spec and deploy it.

```azurecli
id = $(az ts show --name storageSpec --resource-group templateSpecRG --version "1.0" --query "id")

az deployment group create \
  --resource-group demoRG \
  --template-spec $id
```

For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager template specs (Preview)](template-specs.md).

## Preview changes

Before deploying your template, you can preview the changes the template will make to your environment. Use the [what-if operation](template-deploy-what-if.md) to verify that the template makes the changes that you expect. What-if also validates the template for errors.

[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-cloud-shell-deploy.md](../../../includes/resource-manager-cloud-shell-deploy.md)]

In the Cloud Shell, use the following commands:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name examplegroup --location "South Central US"
az deployment group create --resource-group examplegroup \
  --template-uri <copied URL> \
  --parameters storageAccountType=Standard_GRS
```

## Parameters

To pass parameter values, you can use either inline parameters or a parameter file.

### Inline parameters

To pass inline parameters, provide the values in `parameters`. For example, to pass a string and array to a template is a Bash shell, use:

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group testgroup \
  --template-file demotemplate.json \
  --parameters exampleString='inline string' exampleArray='("value1", "value2")'
```

If you're using Azure CLI with Windows Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell, pass the array in the format: `exampleArray="['value1','value2']"`.

You can also get the contents of file and provide that content as an inline parameter.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group testgroup \
  --template-file demotemplate.json \
  --parameters exampleString=@stringContent.txt exampleArray=@arrayContent.json
```

Getting a parameter value from a file is helpful when you need to provide configuration values. For example, you can provide [cloud-init values for a Linux virtual machine](../../virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init.md).

The arrayContent.json format is:

```json
[
    "value1",
    "value2"
]
```

To pass in an object, for example, to set tags, use JSON. For example, your template might include a parameter like this one:

```json
    "resourceTags": {
      "type": "object",
      "defaultValue": {
        "Cost Center": "IT Department"
      }
    }
```

In this case, you can pass in a JSON string to set the parameter as shown in the following Bash script:

```bash
tags='{"Owner":"Contoso","Cost Center":"2345-324"}'
az deployment group create --name addstorage  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--template-file $templateFile \
--parameters resourceName=abcdef4556 resourceTags="$tags"
```

Use double quotes around the JSON that you want to pass into the object.

### Parameter files

Rather than passing parameters as inline values in your script, you may find it easier to use a JSON file that contains the parameter values. The parameter file must be a local file. External parameter files aren't supported with Azure CLI.

For more information about the parameter file, see [Create Resource Manager parameter file](parameter-files.md).

To pass a local parameter file, use `@` to specify a local file named storage.parameters.json.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
  --name ExampleDeployment \
  --resource-group ExampleGroup \
  --template-file storage.json \
  --parameters @storage.parameters.json
```

## Handle extended JSON format

To deploy a template with multi-line strings or comments using Azure CLI with version 2.3.0 or older, you must use the `--handle-extended-json-format` switch.  For example:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
  "apiVersion": "2018-10-01",
  "name": "[variables('vmName')]", // to customize name, change it in variables
  "location": "[
    parameters('location')
    ]", //defaults to resource group location
  /*
    storage account and network interface
    must be deployed first
  */
  "dependsOn": [
    "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName'))]",
    "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/', variables('nicName'))]"
  ],
```
