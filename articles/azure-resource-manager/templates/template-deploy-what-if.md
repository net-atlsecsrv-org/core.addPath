# ARM template deployment what-if operation (Preview)

Before deploying an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, you might want to preview the changes that will happen. Azure Resource Manager provides the what-if operation to let you see how resources will change if you deploy the template. The what-if operation doesn't make any changes to existing resources. Instead, it predicts the changes if the specified template is deployed.

> [!NOTE]
> The what-if operation is currently in preview. To use it, you must [sign up for the preview](https://aka.ms/armtemplatepreviews). As a preview release, the results may sometimes show that a resource will change when actually no change will happen. We're working to reduce these issues, but we need your help. Please report these issues at [https://aka.ms/whatifissues](https://aka.ms/whatifissues).

You can use the what-if operation with the PowerShell commands or REST API operations.

In PowerShell, the output includes color-coded results that help you see the different types of changes.

![Resource Manager template deployment what-if operation fullresourcepayload and change types](./media/template-deploy-what-if/resource-manager-deployment-whatif-change-types.png)

The text ouptput is:

```powershell
Resource and property changes are indicated with these symbols:
  - Delete
  + Create
  ~ Modify

The deployment will update the following scope:

Scope: /subscriptions/./resourceGroups/ExampleGroup

  ~ Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-001 [2018-10-01]
    - tags.Owner: "Team A"
    ~ properties.addressSpace.addressPrefixes: [
      - 0: "10.0.0.0/16"
      + 0: "10.0.0.0/15"
      ]
    ~ properties.subnets: [
      - 0:

          name:                     "subnet001"
          properties.addressPrefix: "10.0.0.0/24"

      ]

Resource changes: 1 to modify.
```

## What-if commands

You can use either Azure PowerShell or Azure REST API for the what-if operation.

### Azure PowerShell

To see a preview of the changes before deploying a template, add the `-Whatif` switch parameter to the deployment command.

* `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Whatif` for resource group deployments
* `New-AzSubscriptionDeployment -Whatif` and `New-AzDeployment -Whatif` for subscription level deployments

Or, you can use the `-Confirm` switch parameter to preview the changes and get prompted to continue with the deployment.

* `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Confirm` for resource group deployments
* `New-AzSubscriptionDeployment -Confirm` and `New-AzDeployment -Confirm` for subscription level deployments

The preceding commands return a text summary that you can manually inspect. To get an object that you can programmatically inspect for changes, use:

* `$results = Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentWhatIf` for resource group deployments
* `$results = Get-AzSubscriptionDeploymentWhatIf` or `$results = Get-AzDeploymentWhatIf` for subscription level deployments

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to the release of version 2.0.1-alpha5, you used the `New-AzDeploymentWhatIf` command. This command has been replaced by the `Get-AzDeploymentWhatIf`, `Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentWhatIf`, and `Get-AzSubscriptionDeploymentWhatIf` commands. If you've used an earlier version, you need to update that syntax. The `-ScopeType` parameter has been removed.

### Azure REST API

For REST API, use:

* [Deployments - What If](/rest/api/resources/deployments/whatif) for resource group deployments
* [Deployments - What If At Subscription Scope](/rest/api/resources/deployments/whatifatsubscriptionscope) for subscription level deployments

## Change types

The what-if operation lists six different types of changes:

- **Create**: The resource doesn't currently exist but is defined in the template. The resource will be created.

- **Delete**: This change type only applies when using [complete mode](deployment-modes.md) for deployment. The resource exists, but isn't defined in the template. With complete mode, the resource will be deleted. Only resources that [support complete mode deletion](complete-mode-deletion.md) are included in this change type.

- **Ignore**: The resource exists, but isn't defined in the template. The resource won't be deployed or modified.

- **NoChange**: The resource exists, and is defined in the template. The resource will be redeployed, but the properties of the resource won't change. This change type is returned when [ResultFormat](#result-format) is set to `FullResourcePayloads`, which is the default value.

- **Modify**: The resource exists, and is defined in the template. The resource will be redeployed, and the properties of the resource will change. This change type is returned when [ResultFormat](#result-format) is set to `FullResourcePayloads`, which is the default value.

- **Deploy**: The resource exists, and is defined in the template. The resource will be redeployed. The properties of the resource may or may not change. The operation returns this change type when it doesn't have enough information to determine if any properties will change. You only see this condition when [ResultFormat](#result-format) is set to `ResourceIdOnly`.

## Result format

You can control the level of detail that is returned about the predicted changes. In the deployment commands (`New-Az*Deployment`), use the **-WhatIfResultFormat** parameter. In the programmatic object commands (`Get-Az*DeploymentWhatIf`), use the **ResultFormat** parameter.

Set the format parameter to **FullResourcePayloads** to get a list of resources that will change and details about the properties that will change. Set the format parameter to **ResourceIdOnly** to get a list of resources that will change. The default value is **FullResourcePayloads**.  

The following results show the two different output formats:

- Full resource payloads

  ```powershell
  Resource and property changes are indicated with these symbols:
    - Delete
    + Create
    ~ Modify

  The deployment will update the following scope:

  Scope: /subscriptions/./resourceGroups/ExampleGroup

    ~ Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-001 [2018-10-01]
      - tags.Owner: "Team A"
      ~ properties.addressSpace.addressPrefixes: [
        - 0: "10.0.0.0/16"
        + 0: "10.0.0.0/15"
        ]
      ~ properties.subnets: [
        - 0:

          name:                     "subnet001"
          properties.addressPrefix: "10.0.0.0/24"

        ]

  Resource changes: 1 to modify.
  ```

- Resource ID only

  ```powershell
  Resource and property changes are indicated with this symbol:
    ! Deploy

  The deployment will update the following scope:

  Scope: /subscriptions/./resourceGroups/ExampleGroup

    ! Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-001

  Resource changes: 1 to deploy.
  ```

## Run what-if operation

### Set up environment

To see how what-if works, let's runs some tests. First, deploy a [template that creates a virtual network](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/blob/master/azure-resource-manager/what-if/what-if-before.json). You'll use this virtual network to test how changes are reported by what-if.

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroup `
  -Name ExampleGroup `
  -Location centralus
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup `
  -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/master/azure-resource-manager/what-if/what-if-before.json"
```

### Test modification

After the deployment completes, you're ready to test the what-if operation. This time deploy a [template that changes the virtual network](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/blob/master/azure-resource-manager/what-if/what-if-after.json). It is missing one the original tags, a subnet has been removed, and the address prefix has changed.

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Whatif `
  -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup `
  -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/master/azure-resource-manager/what-if/what-if-after.json"
```

The what-if output appears similar to:

![Resource Manager template deployment what-if operation output](./media/template-deploy-what-if/resource-manager-deployment-whatif-change-types.png)

The text output is:

```powershell
Resource and property changes are indicated with these symbols:
  - Delete
  + Create
  ~ Modify

The deployment will update the following scope:

Scope: /subscriptions/./resourceGroups/ExampleGroup

  ~ Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-001 [2018-10-01]
    - tags.Owner: "Team A"
    ~ properties.addressSpace.addressPrefixes: [
      - 0: "10.0.0.0/16"
      + 0: "10.0.0.0/15"
      ]
    ~ properties.subnets: [
      - 0:

        name:                     "subnet001"
        properties.addressPrefix: "10.0.0.0/24"

      ]

Resource changes: 1 to modify.
```

Notice at the top of the output that colors are defined to indicate the type of changes.

At the bottom of the output, it shows the tag Owner was deleted. The address prefix changed from 10.0.0.0/16 to 10.0.0.0/15. The subnet named subnet001 was deleted. Remember this changes weren't actually deployed. You see a preview of the changes that will happen if you deploy the template.

Some of the properties that are listed as deleted won't actually change. Properties can be incorrectly reported as deleted when they aren't in the template, but are automatically set during deployment as default values. This result is considered "noise" in the what-if response. The final deployed resource will have the values set for the properties. As the what-if operation matures, these properties will be filtered out of the result.

## Programmatically evaluate what-if results

Now, let's programmatically evaluate the what-if results by setting the command to a variable.

```azurepowershell
$results = Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentWhatIf `
  -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup `
  -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/master/azure-resource-manager/what-if/what-if-after.json"
```

You can see a summary of each change.

```azurepowershell
foreach ($change in $results.Changes)
{
  $change.Delta
}
```

## Confirm deletion

The what-if operation supports using [deployment mode](deployment-modes.md). When set to complete mode, resources not in the template are deleted. The following example deploys a [template that has no resources defined](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/blob/master/empty-template/azuredeploy.json) in complete mode.

To preview changes before deploying a template, use the `-Confirm` switch parameter with the deployment command. If the changes are as you expected, confirm that you want the deployment to complete.

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Confirm `
  -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup `
  -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/master/empty-template/azuredeploy.json" `
  -Mode Complete
```

Because no resources are defined in the template and the deployment mode is set to complete, the virtual network will be deleted.

![Resource Manager template deployment what-if operation output deployment mode complete](./media/template-deploy-what-if/resource-manager-deployment-whatif-output-mode-complete.png)

The text output is:

```powershell
Resource and property changes are indicated with this symbol:
  - Delete

The deployment will update the following scope:

Scope: /subscriptions/./resourceGroups/ExampleGroup

  - Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-001

      id:
"/subscriptions/./resourceGroups/ExampleGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNet
works/vnet-001"
      location:        "centralus"
      name:            "vnet-001"
      tags.CostCenter: "12345"
      tags.Owner:      "Team A"
      type:            "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks"

Resource changes: 1 to delete.

Are you sure you want to execute the deployment?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

You see the expected changes and can confirm that you want the deployment to run.
