# Define the order for deploying resources in Azure Resource Manager templates

When deploying a resource, you may need to make sure other resources exist before it's deployed. For example, you need a SQL server before deploying a SQL database. You define this relationship by marking one resource as dependent on the other resource. You define a dependency with the **dependsOn** element, or by using the **reference** function.

Resource Manager evaluates the dependencies between resources, and deploys them in their dependent order. When resources aren't dependent on each other, Resource Manager deploys them in parallel. You only need to define dependencies for resources that are deployed in the same template.

## dependsOn

Within your template, the dependsOn element enables you to define one resource as a dependent on one or more resources. Its value is a comma-separated list of resource names. The list can include resources that are [conditionally deployed](conditional-resource-deployment.md). When a conditional resource isn't deployed, Azure Resource Manager automatically removes it from the required dependencies.

The following example shows a virtual machine scale set that depends on a load balancer, virtual network, and a loop that creates multiple storage accounts. These other resources aren't shown in the following example, but they would need to exist elsewhere in the template.

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
  "name": "[variables('namingInfix')]",
  "location": "[variables('location')]",
  "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
  "tags": {
    "displayName": "VMScaleSet"
  },
  "dependsOn": [
    "[variables('loadBalancerName')]",
    "[variables('virtualNetworkName')]",
    "storageLoop",
  ],
  ...
}
```

In the preceding example, a dependency is included on the resources that are created through a copy loop named **storageLoop**. For an example, see [Create multiple instances of resources in Azure Resource Manager](create-multiple-instances.md).

When defining dependencies, you can include the resource provider namespace and resource type to avoid ambiguity. For example, to clarify a load balancer and virtual network that may have the same names as other resources, use the following format:

```json
"dependsOn": [
  "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers', variables('loadBalancerName'))]",
  "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks', variables('virtualNetworkName'))]"
]
```

While you may be inclined to use dependsOn to map relationships between your resources, it's important to understand why you're doing it. For example, to document how resources are interconnected, dependsOn isn't the right approach. You can't query which resources were defined in the dependsOn element after deployment. By using dependsOn, you potentially impact deployment time because Resource Manager doesn't deploy in parallel two resources that have a dependency.

## Child resources

The resources property allows you to specify child resources that are related to the resource being defined. Child resources can only be defined five levels deep. It's important to note that an implicit deployment dependency isn't created between a child resource and the parent resource. If you need the child resource to be deployed after the parent resource, you must explicitly state that dependency with the dependsOn property.

Each parent resource accepts only certain resource types as child resources. The accepted resource types are specified in the [template schema](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-schemas) of the parent resource. The name of child resource type includes the name of the parent resource type, such as **Microsoft.Web/sites/config** and **Microsoft.Web/sites/extensions** are both child resources of the **Microsoft.Web/sites**.

The following example shows a SQL server and SQL database. Notice that an explicit dependency is defined between the SQL database and SQL server, even though the database is a child of the server.

```json
"resources": [
  {
    "name": "[variables('sqlserverName')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "tags": {
      "displayName": "SqlServer"
    },
    "apiVersion": "2014-04-01-preview",
    "properties": {
      "administratorLogin": "[parameters('administratorLogin')]",
      "administratorLoginPassword": "[parameters('administratorLoginPassword')]"
    },
    "resources": [
      {
        "name": "[parameters('databaseName')]",
        "type": "databases",
        "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
        "tags": {
          "displayName": "Database"
        },
        "apiVersion": "2014-04-01-preview",
        "dependsOn": [
          "[variables('sqlserverName')]"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "edition": "[parameters('edition')]",
          "collation": "[parameters('collation')]",
          "maxSizeBytes": "[parameters('maxSizeBytes')]",
          "requestedServiceObjectiveName": "[parameters('requestedServiceObjectiveName')]"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## reference and list functions

The [reference function](template-functions-resource.md#reference) enables an expression to derive its value from other JSON name and value pairs or runtime resources. The [list* functions](template-functions-resource.md#list) return values for a resource from a list operation.  Reference and list expressions implicitly declare that one resource depends on another, when the referenced resource is deployed in the same template and referred to by its name (not resource ID). If you pass the resource ID into the reference or list functions, an implicit reference isn't created.

The general format of the reference function is:

```json
reference('resourceName').propertyPath
```

The general format of the listKeys function is:

```json
listKeys('resourceName', 'yyyy-mm-dd')
```

In the following example, a CDN endpoint explicitly depends on the CDN profile, and implicitly depends on a web app.

```json
{
    "name": "[variables('endpointName')]",
    "type": "endpoints",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "apiVersion": "2016-04-02",
    "dependsOn": [
            "[variables('profileName')]"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "originHostHeader": "[reference(variables('webAppName')).hostNames[0]]",
        ...
    }
```

You can use either this element or the dependsOn element to specify dependencies, but you don't need to use both for the same dependent resource. Whenever possible, use an implicit reference to avoid adding an unnecessary dependency.

To learn more, see [reference function](template-functions-resource.md#reference).

## Circular dependencies

Resource Manager identifies circular dependencies during template validation. If you receive an error stating that a circular dependency exists, evaluate your template to see if any dependencies aren't needed and can be removed. If removing dependencies doesn't work, you can avoid circular dependencies by moving some deployment operations into child resources that are deployed after the resources that have the circular dependency. For example, suppose you're deploying two virtual machines but you must set properties on each one that refer to the other. You can deploy them in the following order:

1. vm1
2. vm2
3. Extension on vm1 depends on vm1 and vm2. The extension sets values on vm1 that it gets from vm2.
4. Extension on vm2 depends on vm1 and vm2. The extension sets values on vm2 that it gets from vm1.
