# Register and scan Azure Data Explorer

This article outlines how to register an Azure Data Explorer account in Azure Purview and set up a scan.

## Supported capabilities

Azure Data Explorer supports full and incremental scans to capture the metadata and schema. Scans also classify the data automatically based on system and custom classification rules.

## Prerequisites

- Before registering data sources, create an Azure Purview account. For more information on creating a Purview account, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
- You need to be an Azure Purview Data Source Admin

## Setting up authentication for a scan

There is only one way to set up authentication for Azure data explorer:

- Service Principal

### Service principal

To use service principal authentication for scans, you can use an existing one or create a new one. 

> [!Note]
> If you have to create a new Service Principal, please follow these steps:
> 1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
> 1. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand side menu.
> 1. Select **App registrations**.
> 1. Select **+ New application registration**.
> 1. Enter a name for the **application** (the service principal name).
> 1. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
> 1. For Redirect URI select **Web** and enter any URL you want; it doesn't have to be real or work.
> 1. Then select **Register**.

It is required to get the Service Principal's application ID and secret:

1. Navigate to your Service Principal in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Copy the values the **Application (client) ID** from **Overview** and **Client secret** from **Certificates & secrets**.
1. Navigate to your key vault
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** of your choice and **Value** as the **Client secret** from your Service Principal
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the Service Principal to setup your scan

#### Granting the Service Principal access to your Azure data explorer instance

1. Navigate to the Azure portal. Then navigate to your Azure data explorer instance.

1. Add the service principal to the **AllDatabasesViewer** role in the **Permissions** tab, as shown in the following screenshot.
