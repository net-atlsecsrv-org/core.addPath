# Azure Purview connector for Amazon S3

This how-to guide provides an explanation of how to use Azure Purview to scan your unstructured data currently stored in Amazon S3 standard buckets and discover what types of sensitive information exists in your data. This how-to guide also describes how to identify the Amazon S3 Buckets where the data is currently stored for easy information protection and data compliance.

For this service, use Purview to provide a Microsoft account with secure access to AWS, where the Purview scanner will run. The Purview scanner uses this access to your Amazon S3 buckets to read your data, and then reports the scanning results, including only the metadata and classification, back to Azure. Use the Purview classification and labeling reports to analyze and review your data scan results.

In this how-to guide, you'll learn about how to add Amazon S3 buckets as Purview resources and create a scan for your Amazon S3 data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you've performed the following prerequisites before adding your Amazon S3 buckets as Purview data sources and scanning your S3 data.

- You need to be an Azure Purview Data Source Admin.

- When adding your buckets as Purview resources, you'll need the values of your [AWS ARN](#retrieve-your-new-role-arn), [bucket name](#retrieve-your-amazon-s3-bucket-name), and sometimes your [AWS account ID](#locate-your-aws-account-id).

### Create a Purview account

- **If you already have a Purview account,** you can continue with the configurations required for AWS S3 support. Start with [Create a Purview credential for your AWS bucket scan](#create-a-purview-credential-for-your-aws-bucket-scan).

- **If you need to create a Purview account,** follow the instructions in [Create an Azure Purview account instance](create-catalog-portal.md). After creating your account, return here to complete configuration and begin using Purview connector for Amazon S3.

### Create a Purview credential for your AWS bucket scan

This procedure describes how to create a new Purview credential to use when scanning your AWS buckets.

> [!TIP]
> You can also create a new credential in the middle of the process, while [configuring your scan](#create-a-scan-for-your-amazon-s3-bucket). In that case, in the **Credential** field, select **New**.
>

1. In Purview, navigate to the **Management Center**, and under **Security and access**, select **Credentials**.

1. Select **New**, and in the **New credential** pane that appears on the right, use the following fields to create your Purview credential:

    |Field |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Name**     |Enter a meaningful name for this credential, or use the default.        |
    |**Description**     |Enter a optional description for this credential, such as `Used to scan the tutorial S3 buckets`         |
    |**Authentication method**     |Select **Role ARN**, since you're using a role ARN to access your bucket.         |
    |**Microsoft account ID**     |Click to copy this value to the clipboard. Use this value as the **Microsoft account ID** when [creating your Role ARN in AWS](#create-a-new-aws-role-for-purview).           |
    |**External ID**     |Click to copy this value to the clipboard. Use this value as the **External ID** when [creating your Role ARN in AWS.](#create-a-new-aws-role-for-purview)        |
    |**Role ARN**     | Once you've [created your Amazon IAM role](#create-a-new-aws-role-for-purview), navigate to your role in the IAM area, copy the **Role ARN** value, and enter it here. For example: `arn:aws:iam::284759281674:role/S3Role`. <br><br>For more information, see [Retrieve your new Role ARN](#retrieve-your-new-role-arn). |
    | | |

    Select **Create** when you're done to finish creating the credential.

For more information about Purview credentials, see the [Azure Purview public preview documentation](manage-credentials.md).

### Create a new AWS role for Purview

1.	Open your **Amazon Web Services** console, and under **Security, Identity, and Compliance**, select **IAM**.

1. Select **Roles** and then **Create role**.

1. Select **Another AWS account**, and then enter the following values:

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Account ID**     |    Enter your Microsoft Account ID. For example: `615019938638`     |
    |**External ID**     |   Under options, select **Require external ID...**, and then enter your External ID in the designated field. <br>For example: `e7e2b8a3-0a9f-414f-a065-afaf4ac6d994`    <br><br>You can find this external ID when you .  |
    | | |

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can find the values for both the **Microsoft Account ID** and **External ID** in the Purview **Management Center** > **Credentials** area, where you [created your Purview credentials](#create-a-purview-credential-for-your-aws-bucket-scan).
    >

    For example:

    ![Add the Microsoft Account ID to your AWS account.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/aws-create-role-amazon-s3.png)

1. In the **Create role > Attach permissions policies** area, filter the permissions displayed to **S3**. Select **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**, and then select **Next: Tags**.

    ![Select the ReadOnlyAccess policy for the new Amazon S3 scanning role.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/aws-permission-role-amazon-s3.png)

1. In the **Add tags (optional)** area, you can optionally choose to create a meaningful tag for this new role. Useful tags enable you to organize, track, and control access for each role you create.

    Enter a new key and value for your tag as needed. When you're done, or if you want to skip this step, select **Next: Review** to review the role details and complete the role creation.

    ![Add a meaningful tag to organize, track, or control access for your new role.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/add-tag-new-role.png)

1. In the **Review** area, do the following:

    - In the **Role name** field, enter a meaningful name for your role
    - In the **Role description** box, enter an optional description to identify the role's purpose
    - In the **Policies** section, confirm that the correct policy (**AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**) is attached to the role.

    Then select **Create role** to complete the process.

    For example:

    ![Review details before creating your role.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/review-role.png)


### Configure scanning for encrypted Amazon S3 buckets

AWS buckets support multiple encryption types. For buckets that use **AWS-KMS** encryption, special configuration is required to enable scanning.

> [!NOTE]
> For buckets that use no encryption, AES-256 or AWS-KMS S3 encryption, skip this section and continue to [Retrieve your Amazon S3 bucket name](#retrieve-your-amazon-s3-bucket-name).
>

**To check the type of encryption used in your Amazon S3 buckets:**

1. In AWS, navigate to **Storage** > **S3** > and select **Buckets** from the menu on the left.

    ![Select the Amazon S3 Buckets tab.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/check-encryption-type-buckets.png)

1. Select the bucket you want to check. On the bucket's details page, select the **Properties** tab and scroll down to the **Default encryption** area.

    - If the bucket you selected is configured for anything but **AWS-KMS** encryption, including if default encryption for your bucket is **Disabled**, skip the rest of this procedure and continue with [Retrieve your Amazon S3 bucket name](#retrieve-your-amazon-s3-bucket-name).

    - If the bucket you selected is configured for **AWS-KMS** encryption, continue as described below to add a new policy that allows for scanning a bucket with custom **AWS-KMS** encryption.

    For example:

    ![View an Amazon S3 bucket configured with AWS-KMS encryption](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/default-encryption-buckets.png)

**To add a new policy to allow for scanning a bucket with custom AWS-KMS encryption:**

1. In AWS, navigate to **Services** >  **IAM** >  **Policies**, and select **Create policy**.

1. On the **Create policy** > **Visual editor** tab, define your policy with the following values:

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Service**     |  Enter and select **KMS**.       |
    |**Actions**     | Under **Access level**, select **Write** to expand the **Write** section.<br>Once expanded, select only the **Decrypt** option.        |
    |**Resources**     |Select a specific resource or **All resources**.         |
    | | |

    When you're done, select **Review policy** to continue.

    ![Create a policy for scanning a bucket with AWS-KMS encryption.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/create-policy-kms.png)

1. On the **Review policy** page, enter a meaningful name for your policy and an optional description, and then select **Create policy**.

    The newly created policy is added to your list of policies.

1. Attach your new policy to the role you added for scanning.

    1. Navigate back to the **IAM** > **Roles** page, and select the role you added [earlier](#create-a-new-aws-role-for-purview).

    1. On the **Permissions** tab, select **Attach policies**.

        ![On your role's Permissions tab, select Attach policies.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/iam-attach-policies.png)

    1. On the **Attach Permissions** page, search for and select the new policy you created above. Select **Attach policy** to attach your policy to the role.

        The **Summary** page is updated, with your new policy attached to your role.

        ![View an updated Summary page with the new policy attached to your role.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/attach-policy-role.png)

### Retrieve your new Role ARN

You'll need to record your AWS Role ARN and copy it in to Purview when [creating a scan for your Amazon S3 bucket](#create-a-scan-for-your-amazon-s3-bucket).

**To retrieve your role ARN:**

1. In the AWS **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** > **Roles** area, search for and select the new role you [created for Purview](#create-a-purview-credential-for-your-aws-bucket-scan).

1. On the role's **Summary** page, select the **Copy to clipboard** button to the right of the **Role ARN** value.

    ![Copy the role ARN value to the clipboard.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/aws-copy-role-purview.png)

1. Paste this value in a secure location, ready to use when [creating a scan for your Amazon S3 bucket](#create-a-scan-for-your-amazon-s3-bucket).

### Retrieve your Amazon S3 bucket name

You'll need the name of your Amazon S3 bucket to copy it in to Purview when [creating a scan for your Amazon S3 bucket](#create-a-scan-for-your-amazon-s3-bucket)

**To retrieve your bucket name:**

1. In AWS, navigate to **Storage** > **S3** > and select **Buckets** from the menu on the left.

    ![View the Amazon S3 Buckets tab.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/check-encryption-type-buckets.png)

1. Search for and select your bucket to view the bucket details page, and then copy the bucket name to the clipboard.

    For example:

    ![Retrieve and copy the S3 bucket URL.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/retrieve-bucket-url-amazon.png)

    Paste your bucket name in a secure file, and add an `s3://` prefix to it to create the value you'll need to enter when configuring your bucket as a Purview resource.

    For example: `s3://purview-tutorial-bucket`

> [!NOTE]
> Only the root level of your bucket is supported as a Purview data source. For example, the following URL, which includes a sub-folder is *not* supported: `s3://purview-tutorial-bucket/view-data`
>

### Locate your AWS account ID

You'll need your AWS account ID to register your AWS account as a Purview data source, together with all of its buckets.

Your AWS account ID is the ID you use to log in to the AWS console. You can also find it once you're logged in on the IAM dashboard, on the left under the navigation options, and at the top, as the numerical part of your sign-in URL:

For example:

![Retrieve your AWS account ID.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/aws-locate-account-id.png)


## Add a single Amazon S3 bucket as a Purview resource

Use this procedure if you only have a single S3 bucket that you want to register to Purview as a data source, or if you have multiple buckets in your AWS account, but do not want to register all of them to Purview.

1. Launch the Purview portal using the dedicated Purview connector for Amazon S3 URL. This URL was provided to you by the Amazon S3 Purview connector product management team.

    Select **Create** when you're done to create your rule set.

1. On the **Set a scan trigger** pane, select one of the following, and then select **Continue**:

    - **Recurring** to configure a schedule for a recurring scan
    - **Once** to configure a scan that starts immediately

1. On the **Review your scan** pane, check your scanning details to confirm that they're correct, and then select **Save** or **Save and Run** if you selected **Once** in the previous pane.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once started, scanning can take up to 24 hours to complete. You'll be able to review your **Insight Reports** and search the catalog 24 hours after you started each scan.
    >

For more information, see [Explore Purview scanning results](#explore-purview-scanning-results).

## Explore Purview scanning results

Once a Purview scan is complete on your Amazon S3 buckets, drill down in the Purview **Sources** area to view the scan history.

Select a data source to view its details, and then select the **Scans** tab to view any currently running or completed scans.
If you've added an AWS account with multiple buckets, the scan history for each bucket is shown under the account.

For example:

![Show the AWS S3 bucket scans under your AWS account source.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/account-scan-history.png)

Use the other areas of Purview to find out details about the content in your data estate, including your Amazon S3 buckets:

- **Search the Purview data catalog,** and filter for a specific bucket. For example:

    ![Search the catalog for AWS S3 assets.](./media/register-scan-amazon-s3/search-catalog-screen-aws.png)

- **View Insight reports** to view statistics for the classification, sensitivity labels, file types, and more details about your content.

    All Purview Insight reports include the Amazon S3 scanning results, along with the rest of the results from your Azure data sources. When relevant, an additional **Amazon S3** asset type was added to the report filtering options.
