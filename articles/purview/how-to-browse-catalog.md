# Browse the Azure Purview Data catalog

This article describes how to discover data in your Azure Purview Data Catalog using the data source hierarchical namespace.

## Browse experience

A data consumer can discover data using the familiar hierarchical namespace for each of the data sources using an explorer view. Once the data source is registered and scanned, the Data map extracts information about the structure (hierarchical namespace) of the data source. This information is used to build the browsing experience for data discovery.

For example, you can easily find a dataset called *DateDimension* under a folder called *Dimensions* in Azure Data lake Storage Gen 2. You can use the 'Browse by Asset Type' experience to navigate to the ADLS Gen 2 storage account, then browse to the service > container > folder(s) to reach the specific *Dimensions* folder and then see the *DateDimension* table.

A native browsing experience with hierarchical namespace is provided for each of the corresponding data source.

## Browse the Data Catalog by asset type

1. You can browse data assets, by selecting the **Browse by asset type** on the homepage.

## View related data assets

Once you are on the asset detail page, you can also view other related data assets. For example, you can navigate to the parent folder of *DateDimension* to see the *Dimensions* folder or even navigate to the container to see the assets under the specific hierarchy.

1. From the asset detail page, select the **Related** tab to see other related assets.
