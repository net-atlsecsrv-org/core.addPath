## Use Purview Glossary Insights

In Azure Purview, you can create glossary terms and attach them to assets. Later, you can view the glossary distribution in Glossary Insights. This tells you the state of your glossary by terms attached to assets. It also tells you terms by status and distribution of roles by number of users.

**To view Glossary Insights:**

1. Go to the **Azure Purview** [instance screen in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/purviewportal) and select your Purview account.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Launch Purview** account tile.

The **Glossary Insights** page displays the following areas:
1. **High level KPIs** to show glossary terms and catalog users

2. **Top glossary terms and count of assets** shows the tops 5 glossary terms with assets attached to them. All other assets are accounted in "Other" category in the graph.

3. **Glossary terms by term status** shows distribution of glossary terms by status such as "Draft", "Approved", "Alert" and "Expired". 

1. Hover or click on the slice of the graph with a status and note the count of terms with that status.

1. **Distribution of roles by number of users** shows distribution of roles by number of users per role in Purview.
