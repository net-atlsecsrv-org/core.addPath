# Register and scan Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

This article outlines how to register Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as data source in Azure Purview and set up a scan.

## Supported capabilities

The Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 data source supports the following functionality:

- **Full and incremental scans** to capture metadata and classification in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

- **Lineage** between data assets for ADF copy/dataflow activities

## Prerequisites

Before registering data sources, create an Azure Purview account. For more information on creating a Purview account, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

### Setting up authentication for a scan

The following authentication methods are supported for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:

- Managed Identity
- Service principal
- Account Key

#### Managed Identity (Recommended)

When you choose **Managed Identity**, to set up the connection, you must first give your Purview account the permission to scan the data source:

1. Navigate to your ADLS Gen2 storage account.
1. Select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left navigation menu. 
1. Select **+ Add**.
1. Set the **Role** to **Storage Blob Data Reader** and enter your Azure Purview account name under **Select** input box. Then, select **Save** to give this role assignment to your Purview account.

> [!Note]
> For more details, please see steps in [Authorize access to blobs and queues using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad)

#### Account Key

When authentication method selected is **Account Key**, you need to get your access key and store in the key vault:

1. Navigate to your ADLS Gne2 storage account
1. Select **Settings > Access keys**
1. Copy your *key* and save it somewhere for the next steps
1. Navigate to your key vault
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *key* from your storage account
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the key to setup your scan

#### Service principal

To use a service principal, you can use an existing one or create a new one. 

> [!Note]
> If you have to create a new Service Principal, please follow these steps:
> 1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
> 1. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand side menu.
> 1. Select **App registrations**.
> 1. Select **+ New application registration**.
> 1. Enter a name for the **application** (the service principal name).
> 1. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
> 1. For Redirect URI select **Web** and enter any URL you want; it doesn't have to be real or work.
> 1. Then select **Register**.

It is required to get the Service Principal's application ID and secret:

1. Navigate to your Service Principal in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Copy the values the **Application (client) ID** from **Overview** and **Client secret** from **Certificates & secrets**.
1. Navigate to your key vault
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** of your choice and **Value** as the **Client secret** from your Service Principal
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the Service Principal to setup your scan

##### Granting the Service Principal access to your ADLS gen2 account

1. Navigate to your storage account.
1. Select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left navigation menu. 
1. Select **+ Add**.
1. Set the **Role** to **Storage Blob Data Reader** and enter your service principal name or object ID under **Select** input box. Then, select **Save** to give this role assignment to your service principal.
### Firewall settings
