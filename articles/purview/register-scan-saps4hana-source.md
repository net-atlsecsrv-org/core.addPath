# Register and Scan a SAP S/4HANA source (preview)

This article outlines how to register an SAP S/4HANA source in Purview
and set up a scan.

## Supported capabilities

The SAP S/4HANA source supports **Full scan** to extract metadata from a SAP S/4HANA instance and fetches **Lineage** between data assets.

## Prerequisites

1.  Set up the latest [self-hosted integration
    runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717).
    For more information, see [Create and configure a self-hosted
    integration
    runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime).

2.  Make sure the [JDK
    11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
    is installed on your virtual machine where self-hosted integration
    runtime is installed.

3.  Make sure \"Visual C++ Redistributable 2012 Update 4\" is installed
    on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don\'t yet
    have it installed, download it from
    [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

4.  Download the 64-bit [SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET
    3.0](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html) from
    SAP\'s website and install it on the self-hosted integration runtime
    machine. During installation, make sure you select the **Install Assemblies to GAC** option in the **Optional setup steps** window.

5.  The connector reads metadata from SAP using the Java Connector (JCo)
    3.0 API. Hence make sure the Java Connector is available on your
    virtual machine where self-hosted integration runtime is installed.
    Make sure that you are using the correct JCo distribution for your
    environment. For example, on a Microsoft Windows machine, make sure
    the sapjco3.jar and sapjco3.dll files are available.

    > [!Note] 
    >The driver should be accessible to all accounts in the VM. Do not install it in a user account.

6.  Deploy the metadata extraction ABAP function module on the SAP
    server by following the steps mentioned in [ABAP functions deployment guide](abap-functions-deployment-guide.md). You will need an ABAP developer account to create the RFC function module on the SAP server. The user account requires sufficient permissions to connect to the SAP server and execute the following RFC function modules:
    -	STFC_CONNECTION (check connectivity)
    -	RFC_SYSTEM_INFO (check system information)

## Setting up authentication for a scan

The only supported authentication for SAP S/4HANA source is **Basic authentication**

## Register SAP S/4HANA source

To register a new SAP S/4HANA source in your data catalog, do the
following:

1.  Navigate to your Purview account.
2.  Select **Sources** on the left navigation.
3.  Select **Register**
4.  On Register sources, select **SAP S/4HANA.** Select **Continue**

On the **Register sources (SAP S/4HANA)** screen, do the following:

1.  Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the
    Catalog.

2.  Enter the **Application server** name to connect to SAP S/4HANA
    source. It can also be an IP address of the SAP application server
    host.

3.  Enter the SAP **System number**. This is a two-digit integer between
    00 and 99.

4.  Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

5.  Finish to register the data source.

## Creating and running a scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1.  In the Management Center, click on Integration runtimes. Make sure a
    self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it is not set up, use
    the steps mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/purview/manage-integration-runtimes) to create a self-hosted integration runtime

2.  Navigate to **Sources.**

3.  Select the registered SAP S/4HANA source.

4.  Select **+ New scan**

5.  Provide the below details:

    a.  **Name**: The name of the scan

    b.  **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured
        self-hosted integration runtime.

    c.  **Credential**: Select the credential to connect to your data
        source. Make sure to:

    -   Select Basic Authentication while creating a credential.
    -   Provide a user ID to connect to SAP server in the User name input field.
    -   Store the user password used to connect to SAP server in the secret key.

    d.  **Client ID:** Enter here the SAP system client ID. The client
        is identified with three-digit numeric number from 000 to 999.

    e.  **JCo library path**: Specify the path to the folder where the
        JCo libraries are located.

    f.  **Maximum memory available:** Maximum memory (in GB) available
        on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is
        dependent on the size of SAP S/4HANA source to be scanned.

It will also display whether your scan was scheduled or manual, how many assets had classifications applied, how many total assets were discovered, the start and end time of the scan, and the total scan duration.

## Manage your scans

To manage or delete a scan, do the following:

1. Navigate to the management center. Select **Data sources** under the **Sources and scanning** section then select on the desired data source.

2. Select the scan you would like to manage. You can edit the scan by selecting **Edit**.

3. You can delete your scan by selecting **Delete**.
