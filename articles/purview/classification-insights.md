## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Purview insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

- Set up your Azure resources and populated the relevant accounts with test data

- Set up and completed a scan on the test data in each data source 

For more information, see [Manage data sources in Azure Purview (Preview)](manage-data-sources.md).

## Use Purview classification insights

In Azure Purview, classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify data of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning.

Purview uses the same sensitive information types as Microsoft 365, allowing you to stretch your existing security policies and protection across your entire data estate.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have scanned your source types, give **Classification** Insights a couple of hours to reflect the new assets.

**To view classification insights:**

1. Go to the **Azure Purview** [instance screen in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/purviewportal) and select your Purview account.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Launch Purview account** tile.

1. In Purview, select the **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: menu item on the left to access your **Insights** area.

1. In the **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: area, select **Classification** to display the Purview **Classification insights** report.
