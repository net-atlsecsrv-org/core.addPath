# Create and manage a self-hosted integration runtime

This article describes how to create and manage a self-hosted integration runtime (SHIR) to assist in scanning data sources.

## Create a self-hosted integration runtime

1. On the home page of Purview Studio, select **Management Center** from the left navigation pane.

2. Under **Sources and scanning** on the left pane, select **Integration runtimes**, and then select **+ New**.

3. On the **Integration runtime setup** page, select **Self-Hosted** to create a Self-Hosted IR, and then select **Continue**.

4. Enter a name for your IR, and select Create.

5. On the **Integration Runtime settings** page, follow the steps under the **Manual setup** section. You will have to download the integration runtime from the download site onto a VM or machine where you intend to run it.

    a. Copy and paste the authentication key.
        
    b. Download the self-hosted integration runtime from [Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717) on a local Windows machine. Run the installer.
        
    c. On the **Register Integration Runtime (Self-hosted)** page, paste one of the 2 keys you saved earlier, and select **Register**.

    d. On the **New Integration Runtime (Self-hosted) Node** page, select **Finish**.

6. After the Self-hosted integration runtime is registered successfully, you see the following window:

## Manage a self-hosted integration runtime

You can edit a self-hosted integration runtime by navigating to **Integration runtimes** in the **Management center**, selecting the IR and then clicking on edit. You can now update the description, copy the key or regenerate new keys.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-integration-runtimes/edit-integration-runtime-settings.png" alt-text="edit IR details.":::

You can delete a self-hosted integration runtime by navigating to **Integration runtimes** in the Management center, selecting the IR and then clicking on **Delete**. Once an IR is deleted, any ongoing scans relying on it will fail.
