# Register and scan an on-premises SQL server

This article outlines how to register a SQL server data source in Purview and set up a scan on it.

## Supported Capabilities

The SQL server on-premises data source supports the following functionality:

- **Full and incremental scans** to capture metadata and classification in an on-premises network or a SQL server installed on an Azure VM.

- **Lineage** between data assets for ADF copy/dataflow activities

SQL server on-premises data source supports:

- every version of SQL from SQL server 2019 back to SQL server 2000

- Authentication method: SQL authentication

### Known limitations

Azure Purview doesn't support scanning of [views](/sql/relational-databases/views/views) in SQL Server.

## Prerequisites

- Before registering data sources, create an Azure Purview account. For more information on creating a Purview account, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

- Set up a [self-hosted integration runtime](manage-integration-runtimes.md) to scan the data source.

## Setting up authentication for a scan

There is only one way to set up authentication for SQL server on-premises:

- SQL Authentication

### SQL authentication

The SQL account must have access to the **master** database. This is because the `sys.databases` is in the master database. The Purview scanner needs to enumerate `sys.databases` in order to find all the SQL databases on the server.

#### Using an existing server administrator

If you plan to use an existing server admin (sa) user to scan your on-premises SQL server, ensure the following:

1. `sa` is not a Windows authentication account.

2. The server level login that you are planning to use must have server roles of public and sysadmin. You can verify this by connecting to the server, navigating to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), navigating to security, selecting the login you are planning to use, right-clicking **Properties** and then selecting **Server roles**.

#### Creating a new login and user

If you would like to create a new login and user to be able to scan your SQL server, follow the steps below:

> [!Note]
   > All the steps below can be executed using the code provided [here](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/blob/master/TSQL-Code-Permissions/grant-access-to-on-prem-sql-databases.sql)

1. Navigate to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), connect to the server, navigate to security, right-click on login and create New login. Make sure to select SQL authentication.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/create-new-login-user.png" alt-text="Create new login and user.":::

2. Select Server roles on the left navigation and ensure that public role is assigned.

3. Select User mapping on the left navigation, select all the databases in the map and select the Database role: **db_datareader**.

4. Click OK to save.

5. Navigate again to the user you created, by right clicking and selecting **Properties**. Enter a new password and confirm it. Select the 'Specify old password' and enter the old password. **It is required to change your password as soon as you create a new login.**

#### Storing your SQL login password in a key vault and creating a credential in Purview

1. Navigate to your key vault in the Azure portal1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *password* from your SQL server login
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the **username** and **password** to setup your scan

## Register a SQL server data source

1. Navigate to your Purview account

1. Under Sources and scanning in the left navigation, select **Integration runtimes**. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it is not set up, follow the steps mentioned [here](manage-integration-runtimes.md) to create a self-hosted integration runtime for scanning on an on-premises or Azure VM that has access to your on-premises network.

1. Select **Sources** on the left navigation

1. Select **Register**

1. Select **SQL server** and then **Continue**

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/set-up-sql-data-source.png" alt-text="Set up the SQL data source.":::

5. Provide a friendly name and server endpoint and then select **Finish** to register the data source. If, for example, your SQL server FQDN is **foobar.database.windows.net**, then enter *foobar* as the server endpoint.
