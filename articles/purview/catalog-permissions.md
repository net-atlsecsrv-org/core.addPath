# Role-based access control in Azure Purview's Data Plane

This article describes how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented in Azure Purview's [Data Plane](../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md#data-plane).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The principal who created a Purview account is automatically given all data plane permissions regardless of what data plane roles they may or may not be in. For any other user to do anything in Azure Purview they have to be in at least one of the pre-defined Data Plane roles.

## Azure Purview's pre-defined Data Plane roles

Azure Purview defines a set of pre-defined Data Plane roles that can be used to control who can access what, in Azure Purview. These roles are:

* **Purview Data Reader Role** - Has access to the Purview portal and can read all content in Azure Purview except for scan bindings
* **Purview Data Curator Role** - Has access to the Purview portal and can read all content in Azure Purview except for scan bindings, can edit information about assets, can edit classification definitions and glossary terms, and can apply classifications and glossary terms to assets.
* **Purview Data Source Administrator Role** - Does not have access to the Purview Portal (the user needs to also be in the Data Reader or Data Curator roles) and can manage all aspects of scanning data into Azure Purview but does not have read or write access to content in Azure Purview beyond those related to scanning.

## Understanding how to use Azure Purview's Data Plane roles

When an Azure Purview Account is created, the creator will be treated as if they are in both the Purview Data Curator and Purview Data Source Administrator Roles. But the account creator is not assigned to these roles in the role store. Azure Purview recognizes that the principal is the creator of the account and extends these capabilities to them based on their identity.

All other users can only use the Azure Purview Account if they are placed in at least one of these roles. This means that when an Azure Purview Account is created, no one but the creator can access the account or use its APIs until they are put in one or more of the previous defined roles.

Please note that the Purview Data Source Administrator role has two supported scenarios. The first scenario is for users who are already Purview Data Readers or Purview Data Curators that also need to be able to create scans. Those users need to be in two roles, at least one of Purview Data Reader or Purview Data Curator as well as being placed in the Purview Data Source Administrator Role.

The other scenario for Purview Data Source Administrator is for programmatic processes, such as service principals, that need to be able to set up and monitor scans but should not have access to any of the catalog's data.

This scenario can be implemented by putting the service principal in the Purview Data Source Administrator Role without being placed in any of the other two roles. The principal won't have access to the Purview Portal but that is o.k. because it's a programmatic principal and only communicates via APIs.

## Putting users into roles

So the first order of business after creating an Azure Purview account is to assign people into these roles.

The role assignment is managed via [Azure's RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md).

Only two built-in control plane roles in Azure can assign users roles, those are either Owners or User Access Administrators. So to put people into these roles for Azure Purview one must either find someone who is an Owner or User Access Administrator or become one oneself.

### An example of assigning someone to a role

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com and navigate to your Azure Purview Account
1. On the left-hand side click on "Access control (IAM)"
1. Then follow the general instructions given [here](../role-based-access-control/quickstart-assign-role-user-portal.md#create-a-resource-group)

## Role definitions and actions

A role is defined as a collection of actions. See [here](../role-based-access-control/role-definitions.md) for more information on how roles are defined. And see [here](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) for the Role Definitions for Azure Purview's roles.

## Getting added to a Data Plane Role in an Azure Purview Account

If you want to be given access to an Azure Purview Account so you can use its studio or call its APIs you need to be added into an Azure Purview Data Plane Role. The only people who can do this are those who are Owners or User Access Administrators on the Azure Purview Account. For most users the next step is to find a local administrator who can help you find the right people who can give you access.

For users who have access to their company's [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) they can look up the particular Azure Purview Account they want to join, click on its "Access control (IAM)" tab and see who the Owners or User Access Administrators (UAAs) are. But note that in some cases Azure Active Directory groups or Service Principals might be used as Owners or UAAs, in which case it might not be possible to contact them directly. Instead one has to find an administrator to help.

## Who should be assigned to what role?

|User Scenario|Appropriate Role(s)|
|-------------|-----------------|
|I just need to find assets, I don't want to edit anything|Purview Data Reader Role|
|I need to edit information about assets, put classifications on them, associate them with glossary entries, etc.|Purview Data Curator Role|
|I need to edit the glossary or set up new classification definitions|Purview Data Curator Role|
|My application's Service Principal needs to push data to Azure Purview|Purview Data Curator Role|
|I need to set up scans via the Purview Studio|Purview Data Source Administrator Role plus at least one of Purview Data Reader Role or Purview Data Curator Role|
|I need to enable a Service Principal or other programmatic identity to set up and monitor scans in Azure Purview without allowing the programmatic identity to access the catalog's information |Purview Data Source Administrator Role|
|I need to put users into roles in Azure Purview | Owner or User Access Administrator |
