## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Purview insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

For more information, see [Manage data sources in Azure Purview (Preview)](manage-data-sources.md).

## Use Purview Scan Insights

In Azure Purview, you can register and scan source types. You can view the scan status over time in Scan Insights. The insights tell you how many scans failed, succeeded, or get canceled within a certain time period.

### View scan insights

1. Go to the **Azure Purview** instance screen in the Azure portal and select your Purview account.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Open Purview Studio** tile.

1. In the **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/scan-insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: area, select **Scans** to display the Purview **Scan insights** report.

### View high-level KPIs to show count of scans by status and deep-dive into each scan
 
1. The high-level KPIs show total scans run within a period. The time period is defaulted at last 30 days. However, you can select last seven days, as well. Based on the time filter, the KPI values reflect the count of scans appropriately.


1. Based on the time filter value selected, you can see the distribution of successful, failed, and canceled scans by week or by the day in the graph.

1. At the bottom of the graph, there is a **View more** link for you to explore further. The link opens the  **Scan Status** page within Scan Insights experience. Here you can see a scan name and the number of times it has succeeded, failed, or been canceled in the last 30 days.

4. You can explore a specific scan further, by clicking on the **scan name** that will connect you to the scan history within the **Sources** experience of Azure Purview. From the run history page, you can get the run ID that will help in further failure investigation.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/scan-insights/scan-status.png" alt-text="View Scan details":::

5. Finally, you can come back to Scan Insights **Scan Status** page by following the bread crumbs on the top left corner of the run history page.
