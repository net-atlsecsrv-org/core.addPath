# Asset insights on your data in Azure Purview

This how-to guide describes how to access, view, and filter Purview Asset insight reports for your data.

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * View insights from your Purview account.
> * Get a bird's eye view of your data.
> * Drill down for more asset count details.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Purview insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

* Set up your Azure resources and populate the account with data.

* Set up and complete a scan on the source type.

For more information, see [Manage data sources in Azure Purview (Preview)](manage-data-sources.md).

## Use Purview Asset Insights

In Azure Purview, you can register and scan source types. Once the scan is complete, you can view the asset distribution in Asset Insights, which tells you the state of your data estate by classification and resource sets. It also tells you if there is any change in data size.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have scanned your source types, give Asset Insights up to an hour to reflect the new assets.

1. Navigate to your Azure Purview resource in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Open Purview Studio** tile.

1. On the Purview **Home** page, select the **View insights** tile to access your **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/asset-insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: area.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/view-insights.png" alt-text="View your insights in the Azure portal":::

1. In the **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/asset-insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: area, select **Assets** to display the Purview **Asset insights** report.

### View Asset Insights

1. The main **Asset Insights** page displays the following areas:

2. High level KPI's to show source types, classified assets, and discovered assets
 
3. The first graph shows **assets per source type**.

4. View your asset distribution by source type. Pick a classification or an entire classification category to see asset distribution by source type. 
 
5. To view more, select **View more**, which displays a tabular form of the source types and asset counts. The classification filters are carried to this page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/highlight-kpis.png" alt-text="View KPIs and graph in Asset Insights":::
 
6. Select a specific source for which you'd like to see top folders with asset counts. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/select-data-source.png" alt-text="Select source type":::
 
7. Select the total assets against the top folder within the source type you selected above.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/file-path.png" alt-text="View file paths":::

8. View the list of files within the folder. Navigate back to Insights using the bread crumbs.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/list-page.png" alt-text="View list of assets":::  

### File-based source types
The next couple of graphs in Asset Insights show a distribution of file based source types. The first graph, called **Size trend (GB) of file type within source types**, shows top file type size trend over the last 30 days. 
 
1. Pick your source type to view the file type within the source. 
 
1. Select **View more** to see the current data size, change in size, current asset count and change in asset count.
 
   > [!NOTE]
   > If the scan has run only once in last 30 days or any catalog change like classification addition/removed happened only once in 30 days, then the change information above appears blank.

1. See the top folders with change top asset counts when you click on source type.

1. Select the path to see the asset list.

The second graph in file-based source types is ***Files not associated with a resource set***. If you expect that all files should roll up into a resource set, this graph can help you understand which assets have not been rolled up. Missing assets can be an indication of the wrong file-pattern in the folder. Follow the same steps as in other graphs to view more details on the files.
