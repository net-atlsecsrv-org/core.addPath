# Manage a graph of digital twins using relationships

The heart of Azure Digital Twins is the [twin graph](concepts-twins-graph.md) representing your whole environment. The twin graph is made  of individual digital twins connected via **relationships**. 

Once you have a working [Azure Digital Twins instance](how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md) and have set up [authentication](how-to-authenticate-client.md) code in your client app, you can use the [**DigitalTwins APIs**](/rest/api/digital-twins/dataplane/twins) to create, modify, and delete digital twins and their relationships in an Azure Digital Twins instance. You can also use the [.NET (C#) SDK](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/digitaltwins/client), or the [Azure Digital Twins CLI](how-to-use-cli.md).

This article focuses on managing relationships and the graph as a whole; to work with individual digital twins, see [*How-to: Manage digital twins*](how-to-manage-twin.md).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-prereq-instance.md](../../includes/digital-twins-prereq-instance.md)]

## Ways to manage graph

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-ways-to-manage.md](../../includes/digital-twins-ways-to-manage.md)]

You can also make changes to your graph using the Azure Digital Twins Explorer sample, which allows you to visualize your twins and graph, and makes use of the SDK behind the scenes. The next section describes this sample in detail.

[!INCLUDE [visualizing with Azure Digital Twins explorer](../../includes/digital-twins-visualization.md)]

## Create relationships

Relationships describe how different digital twins are connected to each other, which forms the basis of the twin graph.

Relationships are created using the `CreateOrReplaceRelationshipAsync()` call. 

To create a relationship, you need to specify:
* The source twin ID (`srcId` in the code sample below): The ID of the twin where the relationship originates.
* The target twin ID (`targetId` in the code sample below): The ID of the twin where the relationship arrives.
* A relationship name (`relName` in the code sample below): The generic type of relationship, something like _contains_.
* A relationship ID (`relId` in the code sample below): The specific name for this relationship, something like _Relationship1_.

The relationship ID must be unique within the given source twin. It doesn't need to be globally unique.
For example, for the twin *foo*, each specific relationship ID must be unique. However, another twin *bar* can have an outgoing relationship that matches the same ID of a *foo* relationship.

The following code sample illustrates how to create a relationship in your Azure Digital Twins instance. It uses the SDK call (highlighted) inside a custom method that might appear in the context of a larger program.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="CreateRelationshipMethod" highlight="13":::

This custom function can now be called to create a _contains_ relationship like this: 

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UseCreateRelationship":::

If you wish to create multiple relationships, you can repeat calls to the same method, passing different relationship types into the argument. 

For more information on the helper class `BasicRelationship`, see [*How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs*](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md#serialization-helpers).

### Create multiple relationships between twins

Relationships can be classified as either: 

* Outgoing relationships: Relationships belonging to this twin that point outward to connect it to other twins. The `GetRelationshipsAsync()` method is used to get outgoing relationships of a twin.
* Incoming relationships: Relationships belonging to other twins that point towards this twin to create an "incoming" link. The `GetIncomingRelationshipsAsync()` method is used to get incoming relationships of a twin.

There is no restriction on the number of relationships that you can have between two twinsâ€”you can have as many relationships between twins as you like. 

This means that you can express several different types of relationships between two twins at once. For example, *Twin A* can have both a *stored* relationship and *manufactured* relationship with *Twin B*.

You can even create multiple instances of the same type of relationship between the same two twins, if desired. In this example, *Twin A* could have two different *stored* relationships with *Twin B*, as long as the relationships have different relationship IDs.

## List relationships

To access the list of **outgoing** relationships for a given twin in the graph, you can use the `GetRelationships()` method like this:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="GetRelationshipsCall":::

This returns an `Azure.Pageable<T>` or `Azure.AsyncPageable<T>`, depending on whether you use the synchronous or asynchronous version of the call.

Here is an example that retrieves a list of relationships. It uses the SDK call (highlighted) inside a custom method that might appear in the context of a larger program.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="FindOutgoingRelationshipsMethod" highlight="8":::

You can now call this custom method to see the outgoing relationships of the twins like this:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UseFindOutgoingRelationships":::

You can use the retrieved relationships to navigate to other twins in your graph. To do this, read the `target` field from the relationship that is returned, and use it as the ID for your next call to `GetDigitalTwin()`.

### Find incoming relationships to a digital twin

Azure Digital Twins also has an API to find all **incoming** relationships to a given twin. This is often useful for reverse navigation, or when deleting a twin.

>[!NOTE]
> `IncomingRelationship` calls don't return the full body of the relationship. For more information on the `IncomingRelationship` class, see its [reference documentation](/dotnet/api/azure.digitaltwins.core.incomingrelationship).

The code sample in the previous section focused on finding outgoing relationships from a twin. The following example is structured similarly, but finds *incoming* relationships to the twin instead. This example also uses the SDK call (highlighted) inside a custom method that might appear in the context of a larger program.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="FindIncomingRelationshipsMethod" highlight="8":::

You can now call this custom method to see the incoming relationships of the twins like this:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UseFindIncomingRelationships":::

### List all twin properties and relationships

Using the above methods for listing outgoing and incoming relationships to a twin, you can create a method that prints full twin information, including the twin's properties and both types of its relationships. Here is an example custom method showing how to combine the above custom methods for this purpose.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="FetchAndPrintMethod":::

You can now call this custom function like this: 

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UseFetchAndPrint":::

## Update relationships

Relationships are updated using the `UpdateRelationship` method. 

>[!NOTE]
>This method is for updating the **properties** of a relationship. If you need to change the source twin or target twin of the relationship, you'll need to [delete the relationship](#delete-relationships) and [re-create one](#create-relationships) using the new twins.

The required parameters for the client call are the ID of the source twin (the twin where the relationship originates), the ID of the relationship to update, and a [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) document containing the properties and new values you'd like to update.

Here is sample code showing how to use this method. This example uses the SDK call (highlighted) inside a custom method that might appear in the context of a larger program.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UpdateRelationshipMethod" highlight="6":::

Here is an example of a call to this custom method, passing in a JSON Patch document with the information to update a property.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UseUpdateRelationship":::

## Delete relationships

The first parameter specifies the source twin (the twin where the relationship originates). The other parameter is the relationship ID. You need both the twin ID and the relationship ID, because relationship IDs are only unique within the scope of a twin.

Here is sample code showing how to use this method. This example uses the SDK call (highlighted) inside a custom method that might appear in the context of a larger program.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="DeleteRelationshipMethod" highlight="5":::

You can now call this custom method to delete a relationship like this:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs" id="UseDeleteRelationship":::

## Runnable twin graph sample

The following runnable code snippet uses the relationship operations from this article to create a twin graph out of digital twins and relationships.

### Set up the runnable sample

The snippet uses the [*Room.json*](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/master/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Room.json) and [*Floor.json*](https://github.com/azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/master/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Floor.json) model definitions from [*Tutorial: Explore Azure Digital Twins with a sample client app*](tutorial-command-line-app.md). You can use these links to go directly to the files, or download them as part of the full end-to-end sample project [here](/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/digital-twins-samples/). 

Before you run the sample, do the following:
1. Download the model files, place them in your project, and replace the `<path-to>` placeholders in the code below to tell your program where to find them.
2. Replace the placeholder `<your-instance-hostname>` with your Azure Digital Twins instance's hostname.
3. Add two dependencies to your project that will be needed to work with Azure Digital Twins. The first is the package for the [Azure Digital Twins SDK for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/digitaltwins/client), the second provides tools to help with authentication against Azure.

      ```cmd/sh
      dotnet add package Azure.DigitalTwins.Core
      dotnet add package Azure.Identity
      ```

You'll also need to set up local credentials if you want to run the sample directly. The next section walks through this.
[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins: local credentials prereq (outer)](../../includes/digital-twins-local-credentials-outer.md)]

### Run the sample

After completing the above steps, you can directly run the following sample code.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples/sdks/csharp/graph_operations_sample.cs":::

Here is the console output of the above program:

## CreateÂ graphÂ fromÂ aÂ CSV file

In practical use cases, twin hierarchies will often be created from data stored in a different database, or perhaps in a spreadsheet or a CSV file. This section illustrates how to read data from a CSV file and create a twin graph out of it.

ConsiderÂ theÂ followingÂ dataÂ table,Â describingÂ aÂ setÂ ofÂ digitalÂ twinsÂ andÂ relationships.

| Â ModelÂ ID    | TwinÂ IDÂ (mustÂ beÂ unique) | RelationshipÂ nameÂ  | TargetÂ twinÂ IDÂ  | TwinÂ initÂ data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dtmi:example:Floor;1    | Floor1 | contains | Room1 | |
| dtmi:example:Floor;1    | Floor0 | contains | Room0 | |
| dtmi:example:Room;1    | Room1 | | | {"Temperature":Â 80} |
| dtmi:example:Room;1    | Room0 | | | {"Temperature":Â 70} |

One way to get this data into Azure Digital Twins is to convert the table to a CSV file and write code to interpret the file into commands to create twins and relationships. The following code sample illustrates reading the data from the CSV file and creating a twin graph in Azure Digital Twins.

In the code below, the CSV file is called *data.csv*, and there is a placeholder representing the **hostname** of your Azure Digital Twins instance. The sample also makes use of several packages that you can add to your project to help with this process.
