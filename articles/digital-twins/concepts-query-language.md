# About the query language for Azure Digital Twins

Recall that the center of Azure Digital Twins is the [**twin graph**](concepts-twins-graph.md), constructed from **digital twins** and **relationships**. This graph can be queried to get information about the digital twins and relationships it contains. These queries are written in a custom SQL-like query language, referred to as the **Azure Digital Twins query language**.

To submit a query to the service from a client app, you will use the Azure Digital Twins [**Query API**](/dotnet/api/azure.digitaltwins.core.digitaltwinsclient.query?view=azure-dotnet-preview). This lets developers write queries and apply filters to find sets of digital twins in the twin graph, and other information about the Azure Digital Twins scenario.
