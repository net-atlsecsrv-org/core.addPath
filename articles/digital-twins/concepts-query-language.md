# About the query language for Azure Digital Twins

Recall that the center of Azure Digital Twins is the [**twin graph**](concepts-twins-graph.md), constructed from **digital twins** and **relationships**. This graph can be queried to get information about the digital twins and relationships it contains. These queries are written in a custom SQL-like query language called **Azure Digital Twins Query Store language**.

To submit a query to the service from a client app, you will use the Azure Digital Twins [**Query API**](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.digitaltwins.core.digitaltwinsclient.query?view=azure-dotnet-preview). This lets developers write queries and apply filters to find sets of digital twins in the twin graph, and other information about the Azure Digital Twins scenario.

## Query language features

Azure Digital Twins provides extensive query capabilities against the twin graph. Queries are described using SQL-like syntax, in a query language similar to the [IoT Hub query language](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-query-language.md) with many comparable features.

> [!NOTE]
> All Azure Digital Twins query operations are case-sensitive.

Here are the operations available in Azure Digital Twins Query Store language:
* Get twins by digital twins' properties.
* Get twins by digital twins' interfaces.
* Get twins by relationship properties.
* Get twins over multiple relationship types (`JOIN` queries). There are limitations on the number of `JOIN`s allowed (one level for public preview).
* Use custom function `IS_OF_MODEL(twinCollection, twinTypeName)`, which allows filtering based on the twin's [model](concepts-models.md). It supports inheritance.
* Use scalar functions: `IS_BOOL`, `IS_DEFINED`, `IS_NULL`, `IS_NUMBER`, `IS_OBJECT`, `IS_PRIMITIVE`, `IS_STRING`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`.
* Use query comparison operators: `IN`/`NIN`, `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
* Use any combination (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operator) of the above.
* Use continuation: The query object is instantiated with a page size (up to 100). You can retrieve the digital twins one page at a time by providing the continuation token in subsequent calls to the API.
