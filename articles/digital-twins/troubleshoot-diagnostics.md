# Troubleshooting Azure Digital Twins: Diagnostics logging

Azure Digital Twins collects [metrics](troubleshoot-metrics.md) for your service instance that give information about the state of your resources. You can use these metrics to assess the overall health of Azure Digital Twins service and the resources connected to it. These user-facing statistics help you see what is going on with your Azure Digital Twins and help perform root-cause analysis on issues without needing to contact Azure support.

This article shows you how to turn on **diagnostics logging** for your metrics data from your Azure Digital Twins instance. You can use these logs to help you troubleshoot service issues.

## Turn on diagnostic settings with the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your Azure Digital Twins instance. You can find it by typing its name into the portal search bar. 

2. Select **Diagnostic settings** from the menu, then **Add diagnostic setting**.

3. On the page that follows, fill in the following values:
     * **Diagnostic setting name**: Give the diagnostic settings a name.
     * **Category details**: Choose which operations you want to monitor, and check the boxes to enable diagnostics for those operations. The operations that diagnostic settings can report on are:
        - DigitalTwinsOperation
        - EventRoutesOperation
        - ModelsOperation
        - QueryOperation
        - AllMetrics
     * **Destination details**: Choose where you want to send the logs. You can select any combination of the three options:
        - Send to Log Analytics
        - Archive to a storage account
        - Stream to an event hub

        You may be asked to fill in additional details if they are necessary for your destination selection.  
    
4. Save the new settings.

New settings take effect in about 10 minutes. After that, logs appear in the configured target back on the **Diagnostic settings** page for your instance.
