# Integrate industry-standard models with DTDL for Azure Digital Twins

Using models that are based on industry standards or use standard ontology representation, such as RDF or OWL, provides a rich starting point when designing your Azure Digital Twins models. Using industry models also helps with standardization and information sharing.

To be used with Azure Digital Twins, a model must be represented in the JSON-LD-based [**Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)**](concepts-models.md). Therefore, this article describes how to represent your industry-standard models in DTDL, integrating the existing industry concepts with DTDL semantics so that Azure Digital Twins can use them. The DTDL model then serves as the source of truth for the model within Azure Digital Twins.

There are three possible paths to integrating industry-standard models with DTDL:
* **Adopt**: You can start your solution with an open-source DTDL ontology that has been built on widely adopted industry standards. 
* **Convert**: If you already have existing models, you'll need to convert them to DTDL.
* **Author**: You can always develop your own custom DTDL models from scratch, as described in [*How-to: Manage custom models*](how-to-manage-model.md).

## Adopt an open-source DTDL ontology

It is often easier to start with an open-source DTDL ontology than starting from a blank page. 

For example, Smart Buildings solutions can leverage the open-source [**DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology**](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building), which provides common ground for modeling smart buildings while leveraging industry standards to prevent reinvention. 

These open-source DTDL ontologies also provide best practices for how to consume and properly extend the models. 

## Convert existing models to DTDL

Most industry models (also referred to as **ontologies**) are based on semantic web standards such as [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/), [RDF](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF), and [RDFS](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDFS). 

To use a model with Azure Digital Twins, it must be in DTDL format. This section describes general design guidance in the form of a **conversion pattern** for converting RDF-based models to DTDL so that they can be used with Azure Digital Twins. 

It also contains [**sample converter code** for an RDF converter](#sample-converter-application), which has been validated for the [Brick](https://brickschema.org/ontology/) schema and can be extended for other schemas in the building industry.

### Conversion pattern

There are several third-party libraries that can be used when converting RDF-based models to DTDL. Some of these libraries allow you to load your model file into a graph. You can loop through the graph looking for specific RDFS and OWL constructs, and convert these to DTDL.   

The following table is an example of how RDFS and OWL constructs can be mapped to DTDL. 

| RDFS/OWL concept | RDFS/OWL construct | DTDL concept | DTDL construct |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classes | `owl:Class`<br>IRI suffix<br>``rdfs:label``<br>``rdfs:comment`` | Interface | `@type:Interface`<br>`@id`<br>`displayName`<br>`comment` 
| Subclasses | `owl:Class`<br>IRI suffix<br>`rdfs:label`<br>`rdfs:comment`<br>`rdfs:subClassOf` | Interface | `@type:Interface`<br>`@id`<br>`displayName`<br>`comment`<br>`extends` 
| Datatype Properties | `owl:DatatypeProperty`<br>`rdfs:label` or `INode`<br>`rdfs:label`<br>`rdfs:range` | Interface Properties | `@type:Property`<br>`name`<br>`displayName`<br>`schema` 
| Object Properties | `owl:ObjectProperty`<br>`rdfs:label` or `INode`<br>`rdfs:range`<br>`rdfs:comment`<br>`rdfs:label` | Relationship | `type:Relationship`<br>`name`<br>`target` (or omitted if no `rdfs:range`)<br>`comment`<br>`displayName`<br>

The following C# code snippet shows how an RDF model file is loaded into a graph and converted to DTDL, using the [**dotNetRDF**](https://www.dotnetrdf.org/) library. 

```csharp
using VDS.RDF.Ontology; 
using VDS.RDF.Parsing; 
using Microsoft.Azure.DigitalTwins.Parser; 

//...

Console.WriteLine("Reading file..."); 

FileLoader.Load(_ontologyGraph, rdfFile.FullName); 

// Start looping through for each owl:Class 
foreach (OntologyClass owlClass in _ontologyGraph.OwlClasses) 
{ 

    // Generate a DTMI for the owl:Class 
    string Id = GenerateDTMI(owlClass); 

    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Id)) 
    { 

        Console.WriteLine($"{owlClass.ToString()} -> {Id}"); 

        // Create Interface
        DtdlInterface dtdlInterface = new DtdlInterface 
        { 
            Id = Id, 
            Type = "Interface", 
            DisplayName = GetInterfaceDisplayName(owlClass), 
            Comment = GetInterfaceComment(owlClass), 
            Contents = new List<DtdlContents>() 
        }; 

        // Use DTDL 'extends' for super classes 
        IEnumerable<OntologyClass> foundSuperClasses = owlClass.DirectSuperClasses; 

        //... 
     }

     // Add interface to the list of interfaces 
     _interfaceList.Add(dtdlInterface); 
} 

// Serialize to JSON 
var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(_interfaceList); 

//...
``` 

### Sample converter application 

There is a sample application available that converts an RDF-based model file to [DTDL (version 2)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) for use by the Azure Digital Twins service. It has been validated for the [Brick](https://brickschema.org/ontology/) schema, and can be extended for other schemas in the building industry (such as [Building Topology Ontology (BOT)](https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/bot/), [Semantic Sensor Network](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/), or [buildingSmart Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/ifc-schema-specifications/)).

The sample is a .NET Core command-line application called **RdfToDtdlConverter**.

You can get the sample here: [**RdfToDtdlConverter**](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/rdftodtdlconverter/digital-twins-model-conversion-samples/). 

To download the code to your machine, hit the *Download ZIP* button underneath the title on the sample landing page. This will download a *ZIP* file under the name *RdfToDtdlConverter_sample_application_to_convert_RDF_to_DTDL.zip*, which you can then unzip and explore.

You can use this sample to see the conversion patterns in context, and to have as a building block for your own applications performing model conversions according to your own specific needs.

## Validate and upload DTDL models

[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins: validate models info](../../includes/digital-twins-validate.md)]

Once a model is converted and validated, you can **upload it to your Azure Digital Twins instance**. For more information on this process, see the [*Upload models*](how-to-manage-model.md#upload-models) section of *How-to: Manage custom models*.
