# Ingest IoT Hub telemetry into Azure Digital Twins

Azure Digital Twins is driven with data from IoT devices and other sources. A common source for device data to use in Azure Digital Twins is [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md).

The process for ingesting data into Azure Digital Twins is to set up an external compute resource, such as an [Azure function](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md), that receives the data and uses the [DigitalTwins APIs](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md) to set properties or fire telemetry events on [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) accordingly. 

This how-to document walks through the process for writing an Azure function that can ingest telemetry from IoT Hub.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with this example, you'll need to set up the following resources as prerequisites:
* **An IoT hub**. For instructions, see the *Create an IoT Hub* section of [this IoT Hub quickstart](../iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-cli.md).
* **An Azure Function** with the correct permissions to call your digital twin instance. For instructions, see [*How-to: Set up an Azure function for processing data*](how-to-create-azure-function.md). 
* **An Azure Digital Twins instance** that will receive your device telemetry. For instructions, see [*How-to: Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance and authentication*](./how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md).

### Example telemetry scenario

This how-to outlines how to send messages from IoT Hub to Azure Digital Twins, using an Azure function. There are many possible configurations and matching strategies you can use for this, but the example for this article contains the following parts:
* A thermometer device in IoT Hub, with a known device ID.
* A digital twin to represent the device, with a matching ID

> [!NOTE]
> This example uses a straightforward ID match between the device ID and a corresponding digital twin's ID, but it is possible to provide more sophisticated mappings from the device to its twin (such as with a mapping table).

Whenever a temperature telemetry event is sent by the thermometer device, the *temperature* property of the digital twin should update. This scenario is outlined in a diagram below:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data/events.png" alt-text="A diagram showing a flow chart. In the chart an IoT Hub device sends Temperature telemetry through IoT Hub to an Azure Function, which updates a temperature property on a twin in Azure Digital Twins." border="false":::

## Add a model and twin

You'll need a twin to update with IoT hub information.

The model looks like this:
```JSON
{
  "@id": "dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "Temperature",
      "schema": "double"
    }
  ]
}
```

To **upload this model to your twins instance**, open the Azure CLI and run the following command:

```azurecli
az dt model create --models '{  "@id": "dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1",  "@type": "Interface",  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",  "contents": [    {      "@type": "Property",      "name": "Temperature",      "schema": "double"    }  ]}' -n {digital_twins_instance_name}
```

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-known-issue-cloud-shell](../../includes/digital-twins-known-issue-cloud-shell.md)]

You'll then need to **create one twin using this model**. Use the following command to create a twin and set 0.0 as an initial temperature value.

```azurecli
az dt twin create --dtmi "dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1" --twin-id thermostat67 --properties '{"Temperature": 0.0,}' --dt-name {digital_twins_instance_name}
```

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-known-issue-cloud-shell](../../includes/digital-twins-known-issue-cloud-shell.md)]

Output of a successful twin create command should look like this:
```json
{
  "$dtId": "thermostat67",
  "$etag": "W/\"0000000-9735-4f41-98d5-90d68e673e15\"",
  "$metadata": {
    "$model": "dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1",
    "Temperature": {
      "ackCode": 200,
      "ackDescription": "Auto-Sync",
      "ackVersion": 1,
      "desiredValue": 0.0,
      "desiredVersion": 1
    }
  },
  "Temperature": 0.0
}
```

## Create an Azure function

This section uses the same Visual Studio startup steps and Azure function skeleton from [*How-to: Set up an Azure function for processing data*](how-to-create-azure-function.md). The skeleton handles authentication and creates a service client, ready for you to process data and call Azure Digital Twins APIs in response. 

In the steps that follow, you'll add specific code to it for processing IoT telemetry events from IoT Hub.  

### Add telemetry processing
    
Telemetry events come in the form of messages from the device. The first step in adding telemetry-processing code is extracting the relevant part of this device message from the Event Grid event. 

Different devices may structure their messages differently, so the code for **this step depends on the connected device.** 

The following code shows an example for a simple device that sends telemetry as JSON. This sample is fully explored in [*Tutorial: Connect an end-to-end solution*](./tutorial-end-to-end.md). The following code finds the device ID of the device that sent the message, as well as the temperature value.

```csharp
JObject deviceMessage = (JObject)JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(eventGridEvent.Data.ToString());
string deviceId = (string)deviceMessage["systemProperties"]["iothub-connection-device-id"];
var temperature = deviceMessage["body"]["Temperature"];
```

The next code sample takes the ID and temperature value and uses them to "patch" (make updates to) that twin.

```csharp
//Update twin using device temperature
var uou = new UpdateOperationsUtility();
uou.AppendReplaceOp("/Temperature", temperature.Value<double>());
await client.UpdateDigitalTwinAsync(deviceId, uou.Serialize());
...
```

### Update your Azure function code

Now that you understand the code from the earlier samples, open Visual Studio and replace your Azure function's code with this sample code.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using Azure.Core.Pipeline;
using Azure.DigitalTwins.Core;
using Azure.DigitalTwins.Core.Serialization;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid.Models;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventGrid;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

namespace IotHubtoTwins
{
    public class IoTHubtoTwins
    {
        private static readonly string adtInstanceUrl = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ADT_SERVICE_URL");
        private static readonly HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();

        [FunctionName("IoTHubtoTwins")]
        public async void Run([EventGridTrigger] EventGridEvent eventGridEvent, ILogger log)
        {
            if (adtInstanceUrl == null) log.LogError("Application setting \"ADT_SERVICE_URL\" not set");

            try
            {
                //Authenticate with Digital Twins
                ManagedIdentityCredential cred = new ManagedIdentityCredential("https://digitaltwins.azure.net");
                DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient(
                    new Uri(adtInstanceUrl), cred, new DigitalTwinsClientOptions 
                    { Transport = new HttpClientTransport(httpClient) });
                log.LogInformation($"ADT service client connection created.");
            
                if (eventGridEvent != null && eventGridEvent.Data != null)
                {
                    log.LogInformation(eventGridEvent.Data.ToString());

                    // Reading deviceId and temperature for IoT Hub JSON
                    JObject deviceMessage = (JObject)JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(eventGridEvent.Data.ToString());
                    string deviceId = (string)deviceMessage["systemProperties"]["iothub-connection-device-id"];
                    var temperature = deviceMessage["body"]["Temperature"];
                    
                    log.LogInformation($"Device:{deviceId} Temperature is:{temperature}");

                    //Update twin using device temperature
                    var uou = new UpdateOperationsUtility();
                    uou.AppendReplaceOp("/Temperature", temperature.Value<double>());
                    await client.UpdateDigitalTwinAsync(deviceId, uou.Serialize());
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                log.LogError($"Error in ingest function: {e.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Connect your function to IoT Hub

1. Set up an event destination for hub data. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your IoT Hub instance. Under **Events**, create a subscription for your Azure function. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data/add-event-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows Adding an event subscription.":::

2. In the **Create Event Subscription** page, fill the fields as follows:
    1. Under **Name**, name the subscription what you would like.
    2. Under **Event Schema**, choose **Event Grid Schema**.
    3. Under **System Topic Name**, choose a unique name.
    4. Under **Event Types**, choose **Device Telemetry** as the event type to filter to.
    5. Under **Endpoint Details**, select your Azure function as an endpoint.

## Send simulated IoT data

To test your new ingress function, use the device simulator from [*Tutorial: Connect an end-to-end solution*](./tutorial-end-to-end.md). That tutorial is driven by a sample project written in C#. The sample code is located here: [Azure Digital Twins samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/digital-twins-samples). You'll be using the **DeviceSimulator** project in that repository.

In the end-to-end tutorial, complete the following steps:
1. [*Register the simulated device with IoT Hub*](./tutorial-end-to-end.md#register-the-simulated-device-with-iot-hub)
2. [*Configure and run the simulation*](./tutorial-end-to-end.md#configure-and-run-the-simulation)

## Validate your results

While running the device simulator above, the temperature value of your digital twin will be changing. In the Azure CLI, run the following command to see the temperature value.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-known-issue-cloud-shell](../../includes/digital-twins-known-issue-cloud-shell.md)]

```azurecli
az dt twin query -q "select * from digitaltwins" -n {digital_twins_instance_name}
```

Your output should contain a temperature value like this:

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "$dtId": "thermostat67",
      "$etag": "W/\"0000000-1e83-4f7f-b448-524371f64691\"",
      "$metadata": {
        "$model": "dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1",
        "Temperature": {
          "ackCode": 200,
          "ackDescription": "Auto-Sync",
          "ackVersion": 1,
          "desiredValue": 69.75806974934324,
          "desiredVersion": 1
        }
      },
      "Temperature": 69.75806974934324
    }
  ]
}
```

To see the value change, repeatedly run the query command above.
