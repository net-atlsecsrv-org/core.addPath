# Create custom SDKs for Azure Digital Twins using AutoRest

Right now, the only published data plane SDKs for interacting with the Azure Digital Twins APIs are for .NET (C#), JavaScript, and Java. You can read about these SDKs, and the APIs in general, in [*How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs*](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md). If you are working in another language, this article will show you how to generate your own data plane SDK in the language of your choice, using AutoRest.

>[!NOTE]
> You can also use AutoRest to generate a control plane SDK if you would like. To do this, complete the steps in this article using the latest **control plane Swagger** (OpenAPI) file from the [control plane Swagger folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/digitaltwins/resource-manager/Microsoft.DigitalTwins/) instead of the data plane one.

## Set up your machine

To generate an SDK, you will need:
* [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest), version 2.0.4413 (version 3 isn't currently supported)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as a pre-requisite to AutoRest
* The latest Azure Digital Twins **data plane Swagger** (OpenAPI) file from the [data plane Swagger folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/digitaltwins/data-plane/Microsoft.DigitalTwins), and its accompanying folder of examples.  Download the Swagger file *digitaltwins.json* and its folder of examples to your local machine.

Once your machine is equipped with everything from the list above, you're ready to use AutoRest to create the SDK.

## Create the SDK with AutoRest 

If you have Node.js installed, you can run this command to make sure you have the right version of AutoRest installed:
```cmd/sh
npm install -g autorest@2.0.4413
```

To run AutoRest against the Azure Digital Twins Swagger file, follow these steps:
1. Copy the Azure Digital Twins Swagger file and its accompanying folder of examples into a working directory.
2. Use a command prompt window to switch to that working directory.
3. Run AutoRest with the following command. Replace the `<language>` placeholder with your language of choice: `python`, `java`, `go`, and so on. (You can find the full list of options in the [AutoRest README](https://github.com/Azure/autorest).)

```cmd/sh
autorest --input-file=digitaltwins.json --<language> --output-folder=ADTApi --add-credentials --azure-arm --namespace=ADTApi
```

As a result, you'll see a new folder named *ADTApi* in your working directory. The generated SDK files will have the namespace *ADTApi*. You'll continue to use that namespace through the rest of the usage examples in this article.

AutoRest supports a wide range of language code generators.

## Add the SDK to a Visual Studio project

You can include the files generated by AutoRest directly into a .NET solution. However, it's likely that you'll want to include the Azure Digital Twins SDK in several separate projects (your client apps, Azure Functions apps, and so on). For this reason, it can be useful to build a separate project (a .NET class library) from the generated files. Then, you can include this class library project into several solutions as a project reference.

This section gives instructions on how to build the SDK as a class library, which is its own project and can be included into other projects. These steps rely on **Visual Studio** (you can install the latest version from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)).

Here are the steps:

1. Create a new Visual Studio solution for a class library
2. Use *ADTApi* as the project name
3. In Solutions Explorer, right-select the *ADTApi* project of the generated solution and choose *Add > Existing Item...*
4. Find the folder where you generated the SDK, and select the files at the root level
5. Press "Ok"
6. Add a folder to the project (right-select the project in Solution Explorer, and choose *Add > New Folder*)
7. Name the folder *Models*
8. Right-select the *Models* folder in Solutions Explorer and select *Add > Existing Item...*
9. Select the files in the *Models* folder of the generated SDK and press "Ok"

To build the SDK successfully, your project will need these references:
* `Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime`
* `Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure`

To add these, open *Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...*.

1. In the panel, make sure the *Browse* tab is selected
2. Search for *Microsoft.Rest*
3. Select the `ClientRuntime` and `ClientRuntime.Azure` packages, and add them to your solution

You can now build the project, and include it as a project reference in any Azure Digital Twins application you write.

## General guidelines for generated SDKs

This section contains general information and guidelines for using the generated SDK.

### Synchronous and asynchronous calls

All SDK functions come in synchronous and asynchronous versions.

### Typed and untyped data

REST API calls generally return strongly typed objects. However, because Azure Digital Twins lets users define their own custom types for twins, there is no way to pre-define static return data for many Azure Digital Twins calls. 
Instead, the APIs return strongly typed wrapper types where applicable, and the custom-typed twin data is in Json.NET objects (used wherever the data type "object" appears in the API signatures). You can cast these objects appropriately in your code.

### Error handling

Whenever an error occurs in the SDK (including HTTP errors such as 404), the SDK will throw an exception. For this reason, it's important to encapsulate all API calls within try/catch blocks.

Here is a code snippet that tries to add a twin and catches any errors in this process:

```csharp
try
{
    await client.CreateOrReplaceDigitalTwinAsync<BasicDigitalTwin>(id, initData);
    Console.WriteLine($"Created a twin successfully: {id}");
}
catch (ErrorResponseException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"*** Error creating twin {id}: {e.Response.StatusCode}"); 
}
```

### Paging

AutoRest generates two types of paging patterns for the SDK:
* One for all APIs except the Query API
* One for the Query API

In the non-query paging pattern, here is a code snippet showing how to retrieve a paged list of outgoing relationships from Azure Digital Twins:

```csharp
 try 
 {
     // List the relationships.
    AsyncPageable<BasicRelationship> results = client.GetRelationshipsAsync<BasicRelationship>(srcId);
    Console.WriteLine($"Twin {srcId} is connected to:");
    // Iterate through the relationships found.
    int numberOfRelationships = 0;
    await foreach (string rel in results)
    {
         ++numberOfRelationships;
         // Do something with each relationship found
         Console.WriteLine($"Found relationship-{rel.Name}->{rel.TargetId}");
    }
    Console.WriteLine($"Found {numberOfRelationships} relationships on {srcId}");
} catch (RequestFailedException rex) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Relationship retrieval error: {rex.Status}:{rex.Message}");   
}
```

The second pattern is only generated for the Query API. It uses a `continuationToken` explicitly.

Here is an example with this pattern:

```csharp
string query = "SELECT * FROM digitaltwins";
string conToken = null; // continuation token from the query
int page = 0;
try
{
    // Repeat the query while there are pages
    do
    {
        QuerySpecification spec = new QuerySpecification(query, conToken);
        QueryResult qr = await client.Query.QueryTwinsAsync(spec);
        page++;
        Console.WriteLine($"== Query results page {page}:");
        if (qr.Items != null)
        {
            // Query returns are JObjects
            foreach(JObject o in qr.Items)
            {
                string twinId = o.Value<string>("$dtId");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Found {twinId}");
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"== End query results page {page}");
        conToken = qr.ContinuationToken;
    } while (conToken != null);
} catch (ErrorResponseException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"*** Error in twin query: ${e.Response.StatusCode}");
}
```
