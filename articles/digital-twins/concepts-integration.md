# Integrate Azure Digital Twins with other services

Azure Digital Twins is typically used together with other services. Using [**event routes**](concepts-route-events.md), Azure Digital Twins receives data from upstream services such as [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md), which is used to deliver telemetry and notifications. Azure Digital Twins can also route data to downstream services for storage, workflow integration, analytics, and other uses. 

## Data ingress

Azure Digital Twins can be driven with data and events from any serviceâ€”IoT Hub, Logic Apps, your own custom service, and more. This allows you to collect telemetry from physical devices in your environment, and process this data using the Azure Digital Twins graph in the cloud.

Azure Digital Twins does not have a built-in IoT Hub. You can use an existing IoT Hub you currently have in production, or deploy a new one. This gives you full access to all of the device management capabilities of IoT Hub.

To ingest data from any source into Azure Digital Twins, use an [Azure function](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). Learn more about this pattern in [*How-to: Ingest telemetry from IoT Hub*](how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data.md), or try it out yourself in the Azure Digital Twins [*Tutorial: Connect an end-to-end solution*](tutorial-end-to-end.md).

## Data egress services

Azure Digital Twins can send data to connected **endpoints**. Supported endpoints can be:
* [Event Hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md)
* [Event Grid](../event-grid/overview.md)
* [Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md)

Endpoints are attached to Azure Digital Twins using management APIs or the Azure portal. Learn more about how to attach an endpoint to Azure Digital Twins in [*How-to: Manage endpoints and routes*](how-to-manage-routes-apis-cli.md).

There are many other services where you may want to ultimately direct your data, such as [Azure Storage](../storage/common/storage-introduction.md) or [Time Series Insights](../time-series-insights/time-series-insights-update-overview.md). To send your data to services like these, attach the destination service to an endpoint.

For example, if you are also using [Azure Maps](../azure-maps/about-azure-maps.md) and want to correlate location with your Azure Digital Twins [twin graph](concepts-twins-graph.md), you can use Azure Functions with Event Grid to establish communication between all the services in your deployment.
