# Use the Azure Digital Twins CLI

In addition to managing your Azure Digital Twins instance in the Azure portal, Azure Digital Twins has a **command-line interface (CLI)** that you can use to perform most major actions with the service, including:
* Managing an Azure Digital Twins instance
* Managing models
* Managing digital twins
* Managing twin relationships
* Configuring endpoints
* Managing [routes](concepts-route-events.md)
* Configuring [security](concepts-security.md) via role-based access control (RBAC)

The Azure Digital Twins commands are part of the [Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension). You can view the reference documentation for these commands as part of the `az iot` command set: [az dt](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/dt?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Deploy and validate

In addition to generally managing your instance, the CLI is also a useful tool for deployment and validation.
* The control plane commands can be used to make the deployment of a new instance repeatable or automated.
* The data plane commands can be used to quickly check values in your instance, and verify that operations completed as expected.
