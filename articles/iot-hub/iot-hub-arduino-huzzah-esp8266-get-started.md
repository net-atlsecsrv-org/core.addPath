### Add serial port permissions (Ubuntu only)

If you use Ubuntu, make sure you have the permissions to operate on the USB port of Feather HUZZAH ESP8266. To add serial port permissions, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands at a terminal:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
   ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
   ```

   You get one of the following outputs:

   * crw-rw---- 1 root uucp xxxxxxxx
   * crw-rw---- 1 root dialout xxxxxxxx

   In the output, notice that `uucp` or `dialout` is the group owner name of the USB port.

2. Add the user to the group by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G <group-owner-name> <username>
   ```

   `<group-owner-name>` is the group owner name you obtained in the previous step. `<username>` is your Ubuntu user name.

3. Sign out of Ubuntu, and then sign in again for the change to appear.

## Collect sensor data and send it to your IoT hub
