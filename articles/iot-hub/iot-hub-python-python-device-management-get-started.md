# Get started with device management (Python)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-dm-getstarted](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-dm-getstarted.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Use the Azure portal to create an IoT Hub and create a device identity in your IoT hub.

* Create a simulated device app that contains a direct method that reboots that device. Direct methods are invoked from the cloud.

* Create a Python console app that calls the reboot direct method in the simulated device app through your IoT hub.

At the end of this tutorial, you have two Python console apps:

* **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.py**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, receives a reboot direct method, simulates a physical reboot, and reports the time for the last reboot.

* **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py**, which calls a direct method in the simulated device app, displays the response, and displays the updated reported properties.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-python-sdk-note](../../includes/iot-hub-include-python-sdk-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-python-installation-notes](../../includes/iot-hub-include-python-v2-installation-notes.md)]

* Make sure that port 8883 is open in your firewall. The device sample in this article uses MQTT protocol, which communicates over port 8883. This port may be blocked in some corporate and educational network environments. For more information and ways to work around this issue, see [Connecting to IoT Hub (MQTT)](iot-hub-mqtt-support.md#connecting-to-iot-hub).

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

## Register a new device in the IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity.md)]

## Create a simulated device app

In this section, you:

* Create a Python console app that responds to a direct method called by the cloud

* Simulate a device reboot

* Use the reported properties to enable device twin queries to identify devices and when they last rebooted

1. At your command prompt, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device** package:

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install azure-iot-device
    ```

2. Using a text editor, create a file named **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.py** in your working directory.

3. Add the following `import` statements at the start of the **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.py** file.

    ```python
    import threading
    import time
    import datetime
    from azure.iot.device import IoTHubDeviceClient, MethodResponse
    ```

4. Add the **CONNECTION_STRING** variable. Replace the `{deviceConnectionString}` placeholder value with your device connection string. You copied this connection string previously in [Register a new device in the IoT hub](#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub).  

    ```python
    CONNECTION_STRING = "{deviceConnectionString}"
    ```

5. Add the following function callbacks to implement the direct method on the device.

    ```python
    def reboot_listener(client):
        while True:
            # Receive the direct method request
            method_request = client.receive_method_request("rebootDevice")  # blocking call

            # Act on the method by rebooting the device...
            print( "Rebooting device" )
            time.sleep(20)
            print( "Device rebooted")

            # ...and patching the reported properties
            current_time = str(datetime.datetime.now())
            reported_props = {"rebootTime": current_time}
            client.patch_twin_reported_properties(reported_props)
            print( "Device twins updated with latest rebootTime")

            # Send a method response indicating the method request was resolved
            resp_status = 200
            resp_payload = {"Response": "This is the response from the device"}
            method_response = MethodResponse(method_request.request_id, resp_status, resp_payload)
            client.send_method_response(method_response)
    ```

6. Start the direct method listener and wait.

    ```python
    def iothub_client_init():
        client = IoTHubDeviceClient.create_from_connection_string(CONNECTION_STRING)
        return client

    def iothub_client_sample_run():
        try:
            client = iothub_client_init()

            # Start a thread listening for "rebootDevice" direct method invocations
            reboot_listener_thread = threading.Thread(target=reboot_listener, args=(client,))
            reboot_listener_thread.daemon = True
            reboot_listener_thread.start()

            while True:
                time.sleep(1000)

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "IoTHubDeviceClient sample stopped" )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Python sample..." )
        print ( "IoTHubDeviceClient waiting for commands, press Ctrl-C to exit" )

        iothub_client_sample_run()
    ```

7. Save and close the **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.py** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the article, [Transient Fault Handling](/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults).

## Get the IoT hub connection string

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-howto-device-management-shared-access-policy-text](../../includes/iot-hub-howto-device-management-shared-access-policy-text.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-service-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-service-connection-string.md)]

## Trigger a remote reboot on the device using a direct method

In this section, you create a Python console app that initiates a remote reboot on a device using a direct method. The app uses device twin queries to discover the last reboot time for that device.

1. At your command prompt, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-hub** package:

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install azure-iot-hub
    ```

2. Using a text editor, create a file named **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py** in your working directory.

3. Add the following `import` statements at the start of the **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py** file.

    ```python
    import sys, time

    from azure.iot.hub import IoTHubRegistryManager
    from azure.iot.hub.models import CloudToDeviceMethod, CloudToDeviceMethodResult, Twin
    ```

4. Add the following variable declarations. Replace the `{IoTHubConnectionString}` placeholder value with the IoT hub connection string you copied previously in [Get the IoT hub connection string](#get-the-iot-hub-connection-string). Replace the `{deviceId}` placeholder value with the device ID you registered in [Register a new device in the IoT hub](#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub).

    ```python
    CONNECTION_STRING = "{IoTHubConnectionString}"
    DEVICE_ID = "{deviceId}"

    METHOD_NAME = "rebootDevice"
    METHOD_PAYLOAD = "{\"method_number\":\"42\"}"
    TIMEOUT = 60
    WAIT_COUNT = 10
    ```

5. Add the following function to invoke the device method to reboot the target device, then query for the device twins and get the last reboot time.

    ```python
    def iothub_devicemethod_sample_run():
        try:
            # Create IoTHubRegistryManager
            registry_manager = IoTHubRegistryManager(CONNECTION_STRING)

            print ( "" )
            print ( "Invoking device to reboot..." )

            # Call the direct method.
            deviceMethod = CloudToDeviceMethod(method_name=METHOD_NAME, payload=METHOD_PAYLOAD)
            response = registry_manager.invoke_device_method(DEVICE_ID, deviceMethod)

            print ( "" )
            print ( "Successfully invoked the device to reboot." )

            print ( "" )
            print ( response.payload )

            while True:
                print ( "" )
                print ( "IoTHubClient waiting for commands, press Ctrl-C to exit" )

                status_counter = 0
                while status_counter <= WAIT_COUNT:
                    twin_info = registry_manager.get_twin(DEVICE_ID)

                    if twin_info.properties.reported.get("rebootTime") != None :
                        print ("Last reboot time: " + twin_info.properties.reported.get("rebootTime"))
                    else:
                        print ("Waiting for device to report last reboot time...")

                    time.sleep(5)
                    status_counter += 1

        except Exception as ex:
            print ( "" )
            print ( "Unexpected error {0}".format(ex) )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "" )
            print ( "IoTHubDeviceMethod sample stopped" )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Service Client DeviceManagement Python sample..." )
        print ( "    Connection string = {0}".format(CONNECTION_STRING) )
        print ( "    Device ID         = {0}".format(DEVICE_ID) )

        iothub_devicemethod_sample_run()
    ```

6. Save and close the **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py** file.

## Run the apps

You're now ready to run the apps.

1. At the command prompt, run the following command to begin listening for the reboot direct method.

    ```cmd/sh
    python dmpatterns_getstarted_device.py
    ```

2. At another command prompt, run the following command to trigger the remote reboot and query for the device twin to find the last reboot time.

    ```cmd/sh
    python dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py
    ```

3. You see the device response to the direct method in the console.

   The following shows the device response to the reboot direct method:
