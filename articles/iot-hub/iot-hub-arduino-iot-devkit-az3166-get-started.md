## Quickstart: Send telemetry from DevKit to an IoT Hub

The quickstart uses pre-compiled DevKit firmware to send the telemetry to the IoT Hub. Before you run it, you create an IoT hub and register a device with the hub.

### Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

### Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect. In this quickstart, you use the Azure Cloud Shell to register a simulated device.

1. Run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to create the device identity.

   **YourIoTHubName**: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

   **MyNodeDevice**: The name of the device you're registering. Use **MyNodeDevice** as shown. If you choose a different name for your device, you need to use that name throughout this article, and update the device name in the sample applications before you run them.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyNodeDevice
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you get an error running `device-identity`, install the [Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/blob/dev/README.md).
   > Run the following command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your Cloud Shell instance. The IoT Extension adds commands that are specific to IoT Hub, IoT Edge, and IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to Azure CLI.
   > 
   > ```azurecli-interactive
   > az extension add --name azure-iot
   >  ```
   >
  
1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to get the _device connection string_ for the device you just registered:

   **YourIoTHubName**: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyNodeDevice --output table
    ```

    Make a note of the device connection string, which looks like:

   `HostName={YourIoTHubName}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyNodeDevice;SharedAccessKey={YourSharedAccessKey}`

    You use this value later in the quickstart.

### Send DevKit telemetry

The DevKit connects to a device-specific endpoint on your IoT hub and sends temperature and humidity telemetry.

1. Download the latest version of [GetStarted firmware](https://aka.ms/devkit/prod/getstarted/latest) for IoT DevKit.

1. Make sure IoT DevKit connect to your computer via USB. Open File Explorer there is a USB mass storage device called **AZ3166**.

    ![Open Windows Explorer](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/az3166-usb.png)

1. Drag and drop the firmware just downloaded into the mass storage device and it will flash automatically.

    ![Copy firmware](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/copy-firmware.png)

1. On the DevKit, Hold down button **B**, push and release the **Reset** button, and then release button **B**. Your DevKit enters AP mode. To confirm, the screen displays the service set identifier (SSID) of the DevKit and the configuration portal IP address.

    ![Reset button, button B, and SSID](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/wifi-ap.jpg)

    ![Set AP Mode](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/set-ap-mode.gif)

1. Use a Web browser on a different Wi-Fi enabled device (computer or mobile phone) to connect to the IoT DevKit SSID displayed in the previous step. If it asks for a password, leave it empty.

    ![Connect SSID](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/connect-ssid.png)

1. Open **192.168.0.1** in the browser. Select the Wi-Fi that you want the IoT DevKit connect to, type the Wi-Fi password, then paste the device connection string you made note of previously. Then click Save.

    ![Configuration UI](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/configuration-ui.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The IoT DevKit only supports 2.4GHz network. Check [FAQ](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/faq/#wi-fi-configuration) for more details.

1. The WiFi information and device connection string will be stored into the IoT DevKit when you see the result page.

    ![Configuration result](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/configuration-ui-result.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > After Wi-Fi is configured, your credentials will persist on the device for that connection, even if the device is unplugged.

1. The IoT DevKit reboots in a few seconds. On the DevKit screen, you see the IP address for the DevKit follows by the telemetry data including temperature and humidity value with message count send to Azure IoT Hub.

    ![WiFi IP](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/wifi-ip.jpg)

    ![Sending data](media/iot-hub-arduino-devkit-az3166-get-started/quickstarts/sending-data.jpg)

1. To verify the telemetry data sent to Azure, run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell:

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub monitor-events --hub-name YourIoTHubName --output table
    ```

## Prepare the development environment

Follow these steps to prepare the development environment for the DevKit:
