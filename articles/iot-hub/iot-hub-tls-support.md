# TLS support in IoT Hub

IoT Hub uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure connections from IoT devices and services. Three versions of the TLS protocol are currently supported, namely versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are considered legacy and are planned for deprecation. For more information, see [Deprecating TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for IoT Hub](iot-hub-tls-deprecating-1-0-and-1-1.md). It is strongly recommended that you use TLS 1.2 as the preferred TLS version when connecting to IoT Hub.

## TLS 1.2 enforcement available in select regions

For added security, configure your IoT Hubs to *only* allow client connections that use TLS version 1.2 and to enforce the use of [recommended ciphers](#recommended-ciphers). This feature is only supported in these regions:

* East US
* South Central US
* West US 2
* US Gov Arizona
* US Gov Virginia

For this purpose, provision a new IoT Hub in any of the supported regions and set the `minTlsVersion` property to `1.2` in your Azure Resource Manager template's IoT hub resource specification:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs",
            "apiVersion": "2020-01-01",
            "name": "<provide-a-valid-resource-name>",
            "location": "<any-of-supported-regions-below>",
            "properties": {
                "minTlsVersion": "1.2"
            },
            "sku": {
                "name": "<your-hubs-SKU-name>",
                "tier": "<your-hubs-SKU-tier>",
                "capacity": 1
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The created IoT Hub resource using this configuration will refuse device and service clients that attempt to connect using TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. Similarly, the TLS handshake will be refused if the client HELLO message does not list any of the [recommended ciphers](#recommended-ciphers).

> [!NOTE]
> The `minTlsVersion` property is read-only and cannot be changed once your IoT Hub resource is created. It is therefore essential that you properly test and validate that *all* your IoT devices and services are compatible with TLS 1.2 and the [recommended ciphers](#recommended-ciphers) in advance.
> 
> Upon failovers, the `minTlsVersion` property of your IoT Hub will remain effective in the geo-paired region post-failover.

## Recommended ciphers

IoT Hubs that are configured to accept only TLS 1.2 will also enforce the use of the following recommended ciphers:

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`

For IoT Hubs not configured for TLS 1.2 enforcement, TLS 1.2 still works with the following ciphers:

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`

## Use TLS 1.2 in your IoT Edge setup

IoT Edge devices can be configured to use TLS 1.2 when communicating with IoT Hub. For this purpose, use the [IoT Edge documentation page](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/master/edge-modules/edgehub-proxy/README.md).
