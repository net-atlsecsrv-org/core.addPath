# TLS support in IoT Hub

IoT Hub uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure connections from IoT devices and services. Three versions of the TLS protocol are currently supported, namely versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are considered legacy and are planned for deprecation. For more information, see [Deprecating TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for IoT Hub](iot-hub-tls-deprecating-1-0-and-1-1.md). It is strongly recommended that you use TLS 1.2 as the preferred TLS version when connecting to IoT Hub.

## TLS 1.2 enforcement available in select regions

For added security, configure your IoT Hubs to *only* allow client connections that use TLS version 1.2 and to enforce the use of [cipher suites](#cipher-suites). This feature is only supported in these regions:

* East US
* South Central US
* West US 2
* US Gov Arizona
* US Gov Virginia

For this purpose, provision a new IoT Hub in any of the supported regions and set the `minTlsVersion` property to `1.2` in your Azure Resource Manager template's IoT hub resource specification:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs",
            "apiVersion": "2020-01-01",
            "name": "<provide-a-valid-resource-name>",
            "location": "<any-of-supported-regions-below>",
            "properties": {
                "minTlsVersion": "1.2"
            },
            "sku": {
                "name": "<your-hubs-SKU-name>",
                "tier": "<your-hubs-SKU-tier>",
                "capacity": 1
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The created IoT Hub resource using this configuration will refuse device and service clients that attempt to connect using TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. Similarly, the TLS handshake will be refused if the `ClientHello` message does not list any of the [recommended ciphers](#cipher-suites).

> [!NOTE]
> The `minTlsVersion` property is read-only and cannot be changed once your IoT Hub resource is created. It is therefore essential that you properly test and validate that *all* your IoT devices and services are compatible with TLS 1.2 and the [recommended ciphers](#cipher-suites) in advance.
> 
> Upon failovers, the `minTlsVersion` property of your IoT Hub will remain effective in the geo-paired region post-failover.

## Cipher suites

IoT Hubs that are configured to accept only TLS 1.2 will also enforce the use of the following recommended cipher suites:

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`

For IoT Hubs not configured for TLS 1.2 enforcement, TLS 1.2 still works with the following cipher suites:

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`

A client can suggest a list of higher cipher suites to use during `ClientHello`. However, some of them might not be supported by IoT Hub (for example, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`). In this case, IoT Hub will try to follow the preference of the client, but eventually negotiate down the cipher suite with `ServerHello`.

## Use TLS 1.2 in your IoT Edge setup

IoT Edge devices can be configured to use TLS 1.2 when communicating with IoT Hub. For this purpose, use the [IoT Edge documentation page](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/master/edge-modules/edgehub-proxy/README.md).

## Device authentication

After a successful TLS handshake, IoT Hub can authenticate a device using a symmetric key or a X.509 certificate. For certificate based authentication, this can be any X.509 certificate, including ECC. IoT Hub validates the certificate against the thumbprint or certificate authority (CA) you provide. IoT Hub doesnâ€™t support X.509 based mutual authentication yet (mTLS). To learn more, see [Supported X.509 certificates](iot-hub-devguide-security.md#supported-x509-certificates).
