# Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference

See [Monitor Azure IoT Hub](monitor-iot-hub.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for Azure IoT Hub.

## Metrics

This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for Azure IoT Hub. The resource provider namespace for IoT Hub metrics is **Microsoft.Devices** and the type Namespace is **IoTHubs**.

The following subsections break out the IoT Hub platform metrics by general category and list them by the display name that they appear in the Azure portal with. Information is also provided relevant to the metrics that appear in each subsection.

You can also find a single table that lists all of the IoT Hub platform metrics by metric name under [Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs](../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported.md#microsoftdevicesiothubs) in the Azure Monitor documentation. Be aware that this table does not provide some of the information, like [supported aggregations](#supported-aggregations) for some metrics, available in this article.

To learn about metrics supported by other Azure services, see [Supported metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported.md).

### Supported aggregations

The **Aggregation Type** column in each table corresponds to the default aggregation that is used when the metric is selected for a chart or alert.

   ![Screenshot showing aggregation for metrics](./media/monitor-iot-hub-reference/aggregation-type.png)

For most metrics, all aggregation types are valid; however, for count metrics, those with a **Unit** column value of **Count**, only some aggregations are valid. Count metrics can be one of two types:

* For **Single-point** count metrics, IoT Hub registers a single data point -- essentially a 1 -- every time the measured operation occurs. Azure Monitor then sums these data points over the specified granularity. Examples of **Single-point** metrics are *Telemetry messages sent* and *C2D message deliveries completed*. For these metrics, the only relevant aggregation type is Total (Sum). The portal allows you to choose minimum, maximum, and average; however, these values will always be 1.

* For **Snapshot** count metrics, IoT Hub registers a total count when the measured operation occurs. Currently, there are three **Snapshot** metrics emitted by IoT Hub: *Total number of messages used*, *Total devices (preview)*, and *Connected devices (preview)*. Because these metrics present a "total" quantity every time they are emitted, summing them over the specified granularity makes no sense. Azure Monitor limits you to selecting average, minimum, and maximum for the aggregation type for these metrics.

### Connections

The connections category tracks device connect and disconnect events from an IoT hub as well as errors. This category is useful for identifying unauthorized connection attempts and or alerting when you lose connection to devices.

> [!NOTE]
> For reliable connection status of devices check [Device heartbeat](iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry.md#device-heartbeat).

```json
{
   "records":
   [
        {
            "time": " UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "deviceConnect",
            "category": "Connections",
            "level": "Information",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\",\"sdkVersion\":\"<sdkVersion>\",\"protocol\":\"<protocol>\",\"authType\":\"{\\\"scope\\\":\\\"device\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"sas\\\",\\\"issuer\\\":\\\"iothub\\\",\\\"acceptingIpFilterRule\\\":null}\",\"maskedIpAddress\":\"<maskedIpAddress>\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Device telemetry

The device telemetry category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to the telemetry pipeline. This category includes errors that occur when sending telemetry events (such as throttling) and receiving telemetry events (such as unauthorized reader). This category cannot catch errors caused by code running on the device itself.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "ingress",
            "category": "DeviceTelemetry",
            "level": "Error",
            "resultType": "Event status",
            "resultDescription": "MessageDescription",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\",\"batching\":\"0\",\"messageSizeInBytes\":\"<messageSizeInBytes>\",\"EventProcessedUtcTime\":\"<UTC timestamp>\",\"EventEnqueuedUtcTime\":\"<UTC timestamp>\",\"partitionId\":\"1\"}", 
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Cloud-to-device commands

The cloud-to-device commands category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to the cloud-to-device message pipeline. This category includes errors that occur from:

* Sending cloud-to-device messages (like unauthorized sender errors),
* Receiving cloud-to-device messages (like delivery count exceeded errors), and
* Receiving cloud-to-device message feedback (like feedback expired errors).

This category does not catch errors when the cloud-to-device message is delivered successfully but then improperly handled by the device.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": " UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "messageExpired",
            "category": "C2DCommands",
            "level": "Error",
            "resultType": "Event status",
            "resultDescription": "MessageDescription",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\",\"messageId\":\"<messageId>\",\"messageSizeInBytes\":\"<messageSize>\",\"protocol\":\"Amqp\",\"deliveryAcknowledgement\":\"<None, NegativeOnly, PositiveOnly, Full>\",\"deliveryCount\":\"0\",\"expiryTime\":\"<timestamp>\",\"timeInSystem\":\"<timeInSystem>\",\"ttl\":<ttl>, \"EventProcessedUtcTime\":\"<UTC timestamp>\",\"EventEnqueuedUtcTime\":\"<UTC timestamp>\", \"maskedIpAddress\": \"<maskedIpAddress>\", \"statusCode\": \"4XX\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Device identity operations

The device identity operations category tracks errors that occur when you attempt to create, update, or delete an entry in your IoT hub's identity registry. Tracking this category is useful for provisioning scenarios.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "get",
            "category": "DeviceIdentityOperations",
            "level": "Error",
            "resultType": "Event status",
            "resultDescription": "MessageDescription",
            "properties": "{\"maskedIpAddress\":\"<maskedIpAddress>\",\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\", \"statusCode\":\"4XX\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### File upload operations

The file upload category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to file upload functionality. This category includes:

* Errors that occur with the SAS URI, such as when it expires before a device notifies the hub of a completed upload.

* Failed uploads reported by the device.

* Errors that occur when a file is not found in storage during IoT Hub notification message creation.

This category cannot catch errors that directly occur while the device is uploading a file to storage.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "ingress",
            "category": "FileUploadOperations",
            "level": "Error",
            "resultType": "Event status",
            "resultDescription": "MessageDescription",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\",\"protocol\":\"<protocol>\",\"authType\":\"{\\\"scope\\\":\\\"device\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"sas\\\",\\\"issuer\\\":\\\"iothub\\\",\\\"acceptingIpFilterRule\\\":null}\",\"blobUri\":\"http//bloburi.com\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Routes

The [message routing](./iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md) category tracks errors that occur during message route evaluation and endpoint health as perceived by IoT Hub. This category includes events such as:

* A rule evaluates to "undefined",
* IoT Hub marks an endpoint as dead, or
* Any errors received from an endpoint.

This category does not include specific errors about the messages themselves (like device throttling errors), which are reported under the "device telemetry" category.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time":"2019-12-12T03:25:14Z",
            "resourceId":"/SUBSCRIPTIONS/91R34780-3DEC-123A-BE2A-213B5500DFF0/RESOURCEGROUPS/ANON-TEST/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.DEVICES/IOTHUBS/ANONHUB1",
            "operationName":"endpointUnhealthy",
            "category":"Routes",
            "level":"Error",
            "resultType":"403004",
            "resultDescription":"DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded",
            "properties":"{\"deviceId\":null,\"endpointName\":\"anon-sb-1\",\"messageId\":null,\"details\":\"DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded\",\"routeName\":null,\"statusCode\":\"403\"}",
            "location":"westus"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Device-to-cloud twin operations

The device-to-cloud twin operations category tracks device-initiated events on device twins. These operations can include get twin, update reported properties, and subscribe to desired properties.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "update",
            "category": "D2CTwinOperations",

### Cloud-to-device twin operations

The cloud-to-device twin operations category tracks service-initiated events on device twins. These operations can include get twin, update or replace tags, and update or replace desired properties.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "read",
            "category": "C2DTwinOperations",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\",\"sdkVersion\":\"<sdkVersion>\",\"messageSize\":\"<messageSize>\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Twin queries

The twin queries category reports on query requests for device twins that are initiated in the cloud.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "query",
            "category": "TwinQueries",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"query\":\"<twin query>\",\"sdkVersion\":\"<sdkVersion>\",\"messageSize\":\"<messageSize>\",\"pageSize\":\"<pageSize>\", \"continuation\":\"<true, false>\", \"resultSize\":\"<resultSize>\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Jobs operations

The jobs operations category reports on job requests to update device twins or invoke direct methods on multiple devices. These requests are initiated in the cloud.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "jobCompleted",
            "category": "JobsOperations",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"jobId\":\"<jobId>\", \"sdkVersion\": \"<sdkVersion>\",\"messageSize\": <messageSize>,\"filter\":\"DeviceId IN ['1414ded9-b445-414d-89b9-e48e8c6285d5']\",\"startTimeUtc\":\"Wednesday, September 13, 2017\",\"duration\":\"0\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Direct Methods

The direct methods category tracks request-response interactions sent to individual devices. These requests are initiated in the cloud.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "send",
            "category": "DirectMethods",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":<messageSize>, \"RequestSize\": 1, \"ResponseSize\": 1, \"sdkVersion\": \"2017-07-11\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Distributed Tracing (Preview)

The distributed tracing category tracks the correlation IDs for messages that carry the trace context header. To fully enable these logs, client-side code must be updated by following [Analyze and diagnose IoT applications end-to-end with IoT Hub distributed tracing (preview)](iot-hub-distributed-tracing.md).

Note that `correlationId` conforms to the [W3C Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context) proposal, where it contains a `trace-id` as well as a `span-id`.

#### IoT Hub D2C (device-to-cloud) logs

IoT Hub records this log when a message containing valid trace properties arrives at IoT Hub.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "DiagnosticIoTHubD2C",
            "category": "DistributedTracing",
            "correlationId": "00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-0144d2590aacd909-01",
            "level": "Information",
            "resultType": "Success",
            "resultDescription":"Receive message success",
            "durationMs": "",
            "properties": "{\"messageSize\": 1, \"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\", \"callerLocalTimeUtc\": : \"2017-02-22T03:27:28.633Z\", \"calleeLocalTimeUtc\": \"2017-02-22T03:27:28.687Z\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

Here, `durationMs` is not calculated as IoT Hub's clock might not be in sync with the device clock, and thus a duration calculation can be misleading. We recommend writing logic using the timestamps in the `properties` section to capture spikes in device-to-cloud latency.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **messageSize** | Integer | The size of device-to-cloud message in bytes |
| **deviceId** | String of ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric characters | The identity of the device |
| **callerLocalTimeUtc** | UTC timestamp | The creation time of the message as reported by the device local clock |
| **calleeLocalTimeUtc** | UTC timestamp | The time of message arrival at the IoT Hub's gateway as reported by IoT Hub service side clock |

#### IoT Hub ingress logs

IoT Hub records this log when message containing valid trace properties writes to internal or built-in Event Hub.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "DiagnosticIoTHubIngress",
            "category": "DistributedTracing",
            "correlationId": "00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-349810a9bbd28730-01",
            "level": "Information",
            "resultType": "Success",
            "resultDescription":"Ingress message success",
            "durationMs": "10",
            "properties": "{\"isRoutingEnabled\": \"true\", \"parentSpanId\":\"0144d2590aacd909\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the `properties` section, this log contains additional information about message ingress.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **isRoutingEnabled** | String | Either true or false, indicates whether or not message routing is enabled in the IoT Hub |
| **parentSpanId** | String | The [span-id](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#parent-id) of the parent message, which would be the D2C message trace in this case |

#### IoT Hub egress logs

IoT Hub records this log when [routing](iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md) is enabled and the message is written to an [endpoint](iot-hub-devguide-endpoints.md). If routing is not enabled, IoT Hub doesn't record this log.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "DiagnosticIoTHubEgress",
            "category": "DistributedTracing",
            "correlationId": "00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-98ac3578922acd26-01",
            "level": "Information",
            "resultType": "Success",
            "resultDescription":"Egress message success",
            "durationMs": "10",
            "properties": "{\"endpointType\": \"EventHub\", \"endpointName\": \"myEventHub\", \"parentSpanId\":\"349810a9bbd28730\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the `properties` section, this log contains additional information about message ingress.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **endpointName** | String | The name of the routing endpoint |
| **endpointType** | String | The type of the routing endpoint |
| **parentSpanId** | String | The [span-id](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#parent-id) of the parent message, which would be the IoT Hub ingress message trace in this case |

### Configurations

```json
{
    "records":
    [
         {
             "time": "2019-09-24T17:21:52Z",
             "resourceId": "Resource Id",
             "operationName": "ReadManyConfigurations",
             "category": "Configurations",
             "resultType": "",

             "level": "Information",
             "durationMs": "17",
             "properties": "{\"configurationId\":\"\",\"sdkVersion\":\"2018-06-30\",\"messageSize\":\"0\",\"statusCode\":null}",
             "location": "southcentralus"
         }
    ]
}
```

### Device Streams (Preview)

The device streams category tracks request-response interactions sent to individual devices.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
         {
             "time": "2019-09-19T11:12:04Z",
             "resourceId": "Resource Id",
             "operationName": "invoke",
             "category": "DeviceStreams",

             "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"myDevice\",\"moduleId\":\"myModule\",\"sdkVersion\":\"2019-05-01-preview\",\"requestSize\":\"3\",\"responseSize\":\"5\",\"statusCode\":null,\"requestName\":\"myRequest\",\"direction\":\"c2d\"}",
             "location": "Central US"
         }
    ]
}
```
