Machine learning is a technique of data science that helps computers learn from existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud predictive analytics service that makes it possible to quickly create and deploy predictive models as analytics solutions.

## What you learn

You learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to do weather forecast (chance of rain) using the temperature and humidity data from your Azure IoT hub. The chance of rain is the output of a prepared weather prediction model. The model is built upon historic data to forecast chance of rain based on temperature and humidity.

## What you do

- Deploy the weather prediction model as a web service.
- Get your IoT hub ready for data access by adding a consumer group.
- Create a Stream Analytics job and configure the job to:
  - Read temperature and humidity data from your IoT hub.
  - Call the web service to get the rain chance.
  - Save the result to an Azure blob storage.
- Use Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer to view the weather forecast.

## What you need

- Complete the [Raspberry Pi online simulator](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started.md) tutorial or one of the device tutorials; for example, [Raspberry Pi with node.js](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started.md). These cover the following requirements:
  - An active Azure subscription.
  - An Azure IoT hub under your subscription.
  - A client application that sends messages to your Azure IoT hub.
- An [Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](https://studio.azureml.net/) account.
- An [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#types-of-storage-accounts), A **General-purpose v2** account is preferred, but any Azure Storage account that supports Azure Blob storage will also work.

> [!Note]
> This article uses Azure Stream Analytics and several other paid services. Extra charges are incurred in Azure Stream Analytics when data must be transferred across Azure regions. For this reason, it would be good to ensure that your Resource Group, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage account -- as well as the Machine Learning Studio (classic) workspace and Azure Stream Analytics Job added later in this tutorial -- are all located in the same Azure region. You can check regional support for Azure Machine Learning Studio and other Azure services on the [Azure product availability by region page](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=machine-learning-studio&regions=all).

## Deploy the weather prediction model as a web service

In this section you get the weather prediction model from the Azure AI Library. Then you add an R-script module to the model to clean the temperature and humidity data. Lastly, you deploy the model as a predictive web service.

### Get the weather prediction model

In this section you get the weather prediction model from the Azure AI Gallery and open it in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic).

1. Go to the [weather prediction model page](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Weather-prediction-model-1).

   ![Open the weather prediction model page in Azure AI Gallery](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/weather-prediction-model-in-azure-ai-gallery.png)

1. Select **Open in Studio (classic)** to open the model in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic). Select a region near your IoT hub and the correct workspace in the **Copy experiment from Gallery** pop-up.

   ![Open the weather prediction model in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/open-ml-studio.png)

### Add an R-script module to clean temperature and humidity data

For the model to behave correctly, the temperature and humidity data must be convertible to numeric data. In this section, you add an R-script module to the weather prediction model that removes any rows that have data values for temperature or humidity that cannot be converted to numeric values.

1. On the left-side of the Azure Machine Learning Studio window, select the arrow to expand the tools panel. Enter "Execute" into the search box. Select the **Execute R Script** module.

   ![Select Execute R Script module](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/select-r-script-module.png)

1. Drag the **Execute R Script** module near the **Clean Missing Data** module and the existing **Execute R Script** module on the diagram. Delete the connection between the **Clean Missing Data** and the **Execute R Script** modules and then connect the inputs and outputs of the new module as shown.

   ![Add Execute R Script module](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/add-r-script-module.png)

1. Select the new **Execute R Script** module to open its properties window. Copy and paste the following code into the **R Script** box.

   ```r
   # Map 1-based optional input ports to variables
   data <- maml.mapInputPort(1) # class: data.frame

   data$temperature <- as.numeric(as.character(data$temperature))
   data$humidity <- as.numeric(as.character(data$humidity))

   completedata <- data[complete.cases(data), ]

   maml.mapOutputPort('completedata')

   ```

   When you're finished, the properties window should look similar to the following:

### Deploy predictive web service

In this section, you validate the model, set up a predictive web service based on the model, and then deploy the web service.

1. Select **Run** to validate the steps in the model. This step might take a few minutes to complete.

   ![Run the experiment to validate the steps](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/run-experiment.png)

1. Select **SET UP WEB SERVICE** > **Predictive Web Service**. The predictive experiment diagram opens.

   ![Deploy the weather prediction model in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/predictive-experiment.png)

1. In the predictive experiment diagram, delete the connection between the **Web service input** module and the **Select Columns in Dataset** at the top. Then drag the **Web service input** module somewhere near the **Score Model** module and connect it as shown:

   ![Connect two modules in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/connect-modules-azure-machine-learning-studio.png)

1. Select **RUN** to validate the steps in the model.

1. Select **DEPLOY WEB SERVICE** to deploy the model as a web service.

1. On the dashboard of the model, download the **Excel 2010 or earlier workbook** for **REQUEST/RESPONSE**.

   > [!Note]
   > Make sure that you download the **Excel 2010 or earlier workbook** even if you are running a later version of Excel on your computer.

   ![Download the Excel for the REQUEST RESPONSE endpoint](media/iot-hub-weather-forecast-machine-learning/download-workbook.png)

1. Open the Excel workbook, make a note of the **WEB SERVICE URL** and **ACCESS KEY**.

## Use Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer to view the weather forecast

Run the client application to start collecting and sending temperature and humidity data to your IoT hub. For each message that your IoT hub receives, the Stream Analytics job calls the weather forecast web service to produce the chance of rain. The result is then saved to your Azure blob storage. Azure Storage Explorer is a tool that you can use to view the result.

1. [Download and install Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/).
1. Open Azure Storage Explorer.
1. Sign in to your Azure account.
1. Select your subscription.
1. Select your subscription > **Storage Accounts** > your storage account > **Blob Containers** > your container.
1. Download a .csv file to see the result. The last column records the chance of rain.
