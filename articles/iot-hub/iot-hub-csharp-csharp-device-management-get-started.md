# Get started with device management (.NET)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-dm-getstarted](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-dm-getstarted.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Use the Azure portal to create an IoT hub and create a device identity in your IoT hub.

* Create a simulated device app that contains a direct method that reboots that device. Direct methods are invoked from the cloud.

* Create a .NET console app that calls the reboot direct method in the simulated device app through your IoT hub.

At the end of this tutorial, you have two .NET console apps:

* **SimulateManagedDevice**. This app connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, receives a reboot direct method, simulates a physical reboot, and reports the time for the last reboot.

* **TriggerReboot**. This app calls a direct method in the simulated device app, displays the response, and displays the updated reported properties.

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio.

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

## Register a new device in the IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-device](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-device.md)]

## Get the IoT hub connection string

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-howto-device-management-shared-access-policy-text](../../includes/iot-hub-howto-device-management-shared-access-policy-text.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-service-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-service-connection-string.md)]

## Trigger a remote reboot on the device using a direct method

In this section, you create a .NET console app, using C#, that initiates a remote reboot on a device using a direct method. The app uses device twin queries to discover the last reboot time for that device.

1. In Visual Studio, select **Create a new project**.

1. In **Create a new project**, find and select the **Console App (.NET Framework)** project template, and then select **Next**.

1. In **Configure your new project**, name the project *TriggerReboot*, and select .NET Framework version 4.5.1 or later. Select **Create**.

    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-device-management-get-started/create-trigger-reboot-configure.png)

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **TriggerReboot** project, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

1. Select **Browse**, then search for and select **Microsoft.Azure.Devices**. Select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** package.

    ![NuGet Package Manager window](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-device-management-get-started/create-trigger-reboot-nuget-devices.png)

   This step downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices/) NuGet package and its dependencies.

1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
   using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared;
   ```

1. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the `{iot hub connection string}` placeholder value with the IoT Hub connection string you copied previously in [Get the IoT hub connection string](#get-the-iot-hub-connection-string).

   ```csharp
   static RegistryManager registryManager;
   static string connString = "{iot hub connection string}";
   static ServiceClient client;
   static string targetDevice = "myDeviceId";
   ```

1. Add the following method to the **Program** class.  This code gets the device twin for the rebooting device and outputs the reported properties.

   ```csharp
   public static async Task QueryTwinRebootReported()
   {
       Twin twin = await registryManager.GetTwinAsync(targetDevice);
       Console.WriteLine(twin.Properties.Reported.ToJson());
   }
   ```

1. Add the following method to the **Program** class.  This code initiates the reboot on the device using a direct method.

   ```csharp
   public static async Task StartReboot()
   {
       client = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connString);
       CloudToDeviceMethod method = new CloudToDeviceMethod("reboot");
       method.ResponseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);

       CloudToDeviceMethodResult result = await 
         client.InvokeDeviceMethodAsync(targetDevice, method);

       Console.WriteLine("Invoked firmware update on device.");
   }
   ```

1. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:

   ```csharp
   registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connString);
   StartReboot().Wait();
   QueryTwinRebootReported().Wait();
   Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to exit.");
   Console.ReadLine();
   ```

1. Select **Build** > **Build Solution**.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial performs only a single query for the device's reported properties. In production code, we recommend polling to detect changes in the reported properties.

## Create a simulated device app

In this section, you:

* Create a .NET console app that responds to a direct method called by the cloud.

* Trigger a simulated device reboot.

* Use the reported properties to enable device twin queries to identify devices and when they were last rebooted.

To create the simulated device app, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio, in the TriggerReboot solution you already created, select **File** > **New** > **Project**. In **Create a new project**, find and select the **Console App (.NET Framework)** project template, and then select **Next**.

1. In **Configure your new project**, name the project *SimulateManagedDevice*, and for **Solution**, select **Add to solution**. Select **Create**.

    ![Name and add your project to the solution](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-device-management-get-started/configure-device-app.png)

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the new **SimulateManagedDevice** project, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

1. Select **Browse**, then search for and select **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client**. Select **Install**.

    ![NuGet Package Manager window Client app](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-device-management-get-started/create-device-nuget-devices-client.png)

   This step downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT device SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client/) NuGet package and its dependencies.

1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared;
    ```

1. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the `{device connection string}` placeholder value with the device connection string that you noted previously in [Register a new device in the IoT hub](#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub).

    ```csharp
    static string DeviceConnectionString = "{device connection string}";
    static DeviceClient Client = null;
    ```

1. Add the following to implement the direct method on the device:

   ```csharp
   static Task<MethodResponse> onReboot(MethodRequest methodRequest, object userContext)
   {
       // In a production device, you would trigger a reboot 
       //   scheduled to start after this method returns.
       // For this sample, we simulate the reboot by writing to the console
       //   and updating the reported properties.
       try
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Rebooting!");

           // Update device twin with reboot time. 
           TwinCollection reportedProperties, reboot, lastReboot;
           lastReboot = new TwinCollection();
           reboot = new TwinCollection();
           reportedProperties = new TwinCollection();
           lastReboot["lastReboot"] = DateTime.Now;
           reboot["reboot"] = lastReboot;
           reportedProperties["iothubDM"] = reboot;
           Client.UpdateReportedPropertiesAsync(reportedProperties).Wait();
       }
       catch (Exception ex)
       {
           Console.WriteLine();
           Console.WriteLine("Error in sample: {0}", ex.Message);
       }

       string result = "'Reboot started.'";
       return Task.FromResult(new MethodResponse(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(result), 200));
   }
   ```

1. Finally, add the following code to the **Main** method to open the connection to your IoT hub and initialize the method listener:

   ```csharp
   try
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Connecting to hub");
       Client = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(DeviceConnectionString, 
         TransportType.Mqtt);

       // setup callback for "reboot" method
       Client.SetMethodHandlerAsync("reboot", onReboot, null).Wait();
       Console.WriteLine("Waiting for reboot method\n Press enter to exit.");
       Console.ReadLine();

       Console.WriteLine("Exiting...");

       // as a good practice, remove the "reboot" handler
       Client.SetMethodHandlerAsync("reboot", null, null).Wait();
       Client.CloseAsync().Wait();
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine();
       Console.WriteLine("Error in sample: {0}", ex.Message);
   }
   ```

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your solution, and then select **Set StartUp Projects**.

1. For **Common Properties** > **Startup Project**, Select **Single startup project**, and then select the **SimulateManagedDevice** project. Select **OK** to save your changes.

1. Select **Build** > **Build Solution**.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in [Transient fault handling](/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults).

## Run the apps

You're now ready to run the apps.

1. To run the .NET device app **SimulateManagedDevice**, in Solution Explorer, right-click the **SimulateManagedDevice** project, select **Debug**, and then select **Start new instance**. The app should start listening for method calls from your IoT hub.

1. After that the device is connected and waiting for method invocations, right-click the **TriggerReboot** project, select **Debug**, and then select **Start new instance**.

   You should see "Rebooting!" written in the **SimulatedManagedDevice** console and the reported properties of the device, which include the last reboot time,  written in the **TriggerReboot** console.
