# Deprecation of TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in IoT Hub

To provide best-in-class encryption, IoT Hub is moving to Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 as the encryption mechanism of choice for IoT devices and services. 

## Timeline

IoT Hub will continue to support TLS 1.0/1.1 until further notice. However, we recommend that all customers migrate to TLS 1.2 as soon as possible.

## Deprecating TLS 1.1 ciphers

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SH`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`

## Deprecating TLS 1.0 ciphers

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`

## TLS 1.2 cipher suites

See [IoT Hub TLS 1.2 cipher suites](iot-hub-tls-support.md#cipher-suites).
 
## Customer feedback

While the TLS 1.2 enforcement is an industry-wide best-in-class encryption choice and will be enabled as planned, we still would like to hear from customers regarding their specific deployments and difficulties adopting TLS 1.2. For this purpose, you can send your comments to [iot_tls1_deprecation@microsoft.com](mailto:iot_tls1_deprecation@microsoft.com).
