# Use IP filters

Security is an important aspect of any IoT solution based on Azure IoT Hub. Sometimes you need to explicitly specify the IP addresses from which devices can connect as part of your security configuration. The *IP filter* feature enables you to configure rules for rejecting or accepting traffic from specific IPv4 addresses.

## When to use

Use IP filter to receive traffic only from a specified range of IP addresses and reject everything else. For example, you're using your IoT hub with [Azure Express Route](../expressroute/expressroute-faqs.md#supported-services) to create private connections between an IoT hub and your on-premises infrastructure.

## Default setting

To get to the IP Filter settings page, select **Networking**, **Public access**, then choose **Selected IP Ranges**:

By default, the **IP Filter** grid in the portal for an IoT hub is empty. This default setting means that your hub blocks connections from all IP addresses. This default setting is equivalent to a rule that blocks the `0.0.0.0/0` IP address range.

## Add or edit an IP filter rule

To add an IP filter rule, select **+ Add IP Filter Rule**. To quickly add your computer's IP address, click the **Add your client IP address**. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-ip-filtering/ip-filter-add-rule.png" alt-text="Add an IP filter rule to an IoT hub":::

After selecting **Add IP Filter Rule**, fill in the fields. These fields are pre-filled for you if you selected to add your client IP address.

:::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-ip-filtering/ip-filter-after-selecting-add.png" alt-text="After selecting Add an IP Filter rule":::

* Provide a **name** for the IP Filter rule. This name must be a unique, case-insensitive, alphanumeric string up to 128 characters long. Only the ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric characters plus `{'-', ':', '/', '\', '.', '+', '%', '_', '#', '*', '?', '!', '(', ')', ',', '=', '@', ';', '''}` are accepted.

* Provide a single IPv4 address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, in CIDR notation 192.168.100.0/22 represents the 1024 IPv4 addresses from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.103.255.

After filling in the fields, select **Save** to save the rule. You see an alert notifying you that the update is in progress.

:::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-ip-filtering/ip-filter-save-new-rule.png" alt-text="Notification about saving an IP filter rule":::

The **Add** option is disabled when you reach the maximum of 10 IP filter rules.

To edit an existing rule, select the data you want to change, make the change, then select **Save** to save your edit.

## Delete an IP filter rule

To delete an IP filter rule, select the trash can icon on that row and then select **Save**. The rule is removed and the change is saved.

:::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-ip-filtering/ip-filter-delete-rule.png" alt-text="Delete an IoT Hub IP filter rule":::

## Apply IP filter rules to the built-in Event Hub compatible endpoint

To apply the IP filter rules to the built-in Event Hub compatible endpoint, check the box next to **Apply IP filters to the built-in endpoint?**, then select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="media/iot-hub-ip-filtering/ip-filter-built-in-endpoint.png" alt-text="Image showing the toggle for the built-in endpoint and save":::

> [!NOTE]
> This option isn't available to free (F1) IoT hubs. To apply IP filter rules to the built-in endpoint, use a paid IoT hub.

By enabling this option, your IP filter rules are replicated to the built-in endpoint, so only trusted IP ranges can access it.

If you disable this option, the built-in endpoint is accessible to all IP addresses. This behavior may be useful if you want to read from the endpoint with services with changing IP addresses like Azure Stream Analytics. 

## How filter rules are applied

The IP filter rules are applied at the IoT Hub service level. Therefore, the IP filter rules apply to all connections from devices and back-end apps using any supported protocol. Also, you can choose if the [built-in Event Hub compatible endpoint](iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md) (not via the IoT Hub connection string) are bound to these rules. 

Any connection attempt from an IP address that isn't explicitly allowed receives an unauthorized 401 status code and description. The response message does not mention the IP rule. Rejecting IP addresses can prevent other Azure services such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Virtual Machines, or the Device Explorer in Azure portal from interacting with the IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> If you must use Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) to read messages from an IoT hub with IP filter enabled, **disable** the **Apply IP filters to the built-in endpoint** option, and then use the event hub-compatible name and endpoint of your IoT hub to manually add an [Event Hubs stream input](../stream-analytics/stream-analytics-define-inputs.md#stream-data-from-event-hubs) in the ASA.

### Ordering

IP filter rules are *allow* rules and applied without ordering. Only IP addresses that you add are allowed to connect to IoT Hub. 

For example, if you want to accept addresses in the range `192.168.100.0/22` and reject everything else, you only need to add one rule in the grid with address range `192.168.100.0/22`.

### Azure portal 

IP filter rules are also applied when using IoT Hub through Azure portal. This is because API calls to the IoT Hub service are made directly using your browser with your credentials, which is consistent with other Azure services. To access IoT Hub using Azure portal when IP filter is enabled, add your computer's IP address to the allowlist. 

## Retrieve and update IP filters using Azure CLI

Your IoT Hub's IP filters can be retrieved and updated through [Azure  CLI](/cli/azure/).

To retrieve current IP filters of your IoT Hub, run:

```azurecli-interactive
az resource show -n <iothubName> -g <resourceGroupName> --resource-type Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs
```

This will return a JSON object where your existing IP filters are listed under the `properties.networkRuleSets` key:

```json
{
...
    "properties": {
        "networkRuleSets": {
            "defaultAction": "Deny",
            "applyToBuiltInEventHubEndpoint": true,
            "ipRules": [{
                    "filterName": "TrustedFactories",
                    "action": "Allow",
                    "ipMask": "1.2.3.4/5"
                },
                {
                    "filterName": "TrustedDevices",
                    "action": "Allow",
                    "ipMask": "1.1.1.1/1"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

To add a new IP filter for your IoT Hub, run:

```azurecli-interactive
az resource update -n <iothubName> -g <resourceGroupName> --resource-type Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs --add properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules "{\"action\":\"Allow\",\"filterName\":\"TrustedIP\",\"ipMask\":\"192.168.0.1\"}"
```

To remove an existing IP filter in your IoT Hub, run:

```azurecli-interactive
az resource update -n <iothubName> -g <resourceGroupName> --resource-type Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs --add properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules <ipFilterIndexToRemove>
```

Here, `<ipFilterIndexToRemove>` must correspond to the ordering of IP filters in your IoT Hub's `properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules`.

## Retrieve and update IP filters using Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

Your IoT Hub's IP filters can be retrieved and set through [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/).

```powershell
# Get your IoT Hub resource using its name and its resource group name
$iothubResource = Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupNmae> -ResourceName <iotHubName> -ExpandProperties

# Access existing IP filter rules
$iothubResource.Properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules |% { Write-host $_ }

# Construct a new IP filter
$filter = @{'filterName'='TrustedIP'; 'action'='Allow'; 'ipMask'='192.168.0.1'}

# Add your new IP filter rule
$iothubResource.Properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules += $filter

# Remove an existing IP filter rule using its name, e.g., 'GoodIP'
$iothubResource.Properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules = @($iothubResource.Properties.networkRuleSets.ipRules | Where 'filterName' -ne 'GoodIP')

# Update your IoT Hub resource with your updated IP filters
$iothubResource | Set-AzResource -Force
```

## Update IP filter rules using REST


You may also retrieve and modify your IoT Hub's IP filter using Azure resource Provider's REST endpoint. See `properties.networkRuleSets` in [createorupdate method](/rest/api/iothub/iothubresource/createorupdate).
