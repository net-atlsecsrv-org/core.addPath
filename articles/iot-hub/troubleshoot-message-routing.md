# Troubleshooting message routing

This article provides monitoring and troubleshooting guidance for common issues and resolution for IoT Hub [message routing](iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md).

## Monitoring message routing

We recommend you monitor [IoT Hub metrics related to message routing and endpoints](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routing-metrics) to give you an overview of the messages sent. You can also create a diagnostic setting to send operations for [**routes** in IoT Hub resource logs](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routes) to Azure Monitor Logs, Event Hubs or Azure Storage for custom processing. To learn more about using metrics, resource logs, and diagnostic settings, see [Monitor IoT Hub](monitor-iot-hub.md). For a tutorial, see [Set up and use metrics and resource logs with an IoT hub](tutorial-use-metrics-and-diags.md).

We also recommend enabling the [fallback route](iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md#fallback-route) if you want to maintain messages that don't match the query on any of the routes. These can be retained in the [built-in endpoint](iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md) for the amount of retention days configured.

## Top issues

The following are the most common issues observed with message routing. To start troubleshooting, click on the issue for detailed steps.

* [Messages from my devices are not being routed as expected](#messages-from-my-devices-are-not-being-routed-as-expected)
* [I suddenly stopped getting messages at the built-in Event Hubs endpoint](#i-suddenly-stopped-getting-messages-at-the-built-in-endpoint)

### Messages from my devices are not being routed as expected

To troubleshoot this issue, analyze the following.

#### The routing metrics for this endpoint

All the [IoT Hub metrics related to routing](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routing-metrics) are prefixed with *Routing*. You can combine information from multiple metrics to identify root cause for issues. For example, use metric **Routing Delivery Attempts** to identify the number of messages that were delivered to an endpoint or dropped when they didn't match queries on any of the routes and fallback route was disabled. Check the **Routing Latency** metric to observe whether latency for message delivery is steady or increasing. A growing latency can indicate a problem with a specific endpoint and we recommend checking [the health of the endpoint](#the-health-of-the-endpoint). These routing metrics also have [dimensions](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#metric-dimensions) that provide details on the metric like the endpoint type, specific endpoint name and a reason why the message was not delivered.

#### The resource logs for any operational issues

Observe the [**Routes** resource logs](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routes) to get more information on the routing and endpoint [operations](#operation-names) or identify errors and relevant [error code](#common-error-codes) to understand the issue further. For example, the operation name **RouteEvaluationError** in the log indicates the route could not be evaluated because of an issue with the message format. Use the tips provided for the specific [operation names](#operation-names) to mitigate the issue. When an event is logged as an error, the log will also provide more information on why the evaluation failed. For example, if the operation name is **EndpointUnhealthy**, an [Error code](#common-error-codes) of 403004 indicates the endpoint ran out of space.

#### The health of the endpoint

Use the REST API [Get Endpoint Health](/rest/api/iothub/iothubresource/getendpointhealth#iothubresource_getendpointhealth) to get [health status](iot-hub-devguide-endpoints.md#custom-endpoints) of the endpoints. The *Get Endpoint Health* API also provides information on the last time a message was successfully sent to the endpoint, the [last known error](#last-known-errors-for-iot-hub-routing-endpoints), last known error time and the last time a send attempt was made for this endpoint. Use the possible mitigation provided for the specific [last known error](#last-known-errors-for-iot-hub-routing-endpoints).

### I suddenly stopped getting messages at the built-in endpoint

To troubleshoot this issue, analyze the following.

#### Was a new route created?

Once a route is created, data stops flowing to the built-in-endpoint, unless a route is created to that endpoint. To ensure messages continues to flow to the built-in-endpoint if a new route is added, configure a route to the *events* endpoint. 

#### Was the Fallback route disabled?

The fallback route sends all the messages that don't satisfy query conditions on any of the existing routes to the [built-in-Event Hubs](iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md) (messages/events), that is compatible with [Event Hubs](../event-hubs/index.yml). If message routing is turned on, you can enable the fallback route capability. If there are no routes to the built-in-endpoint and a fallback route is enabled, only messages that don't match any query conditions on routes will be sent to the built-in-endpoint. Also, if all existing routes are deleted, fallback route must be enabled to receive all data at the built-in-endpoint.

You can enable/disable the fallback route in the Azure portal->Message Routing blade. You can also use Azure Resource Manager for [FallbackRouteProperties](/rest/api/iothub/iothubresource/createorupdate#fallbackrouteproperties) to use a custom endpoint for fallback route.
