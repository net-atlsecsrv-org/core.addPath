# Canceling and deleting Azure Import/Export jobs

 To request that a job be canceled before it is in the `Packaging` state, call the [Update Job Properties](/rest/api/storageimportexport/jobs) operation and set the `CancelRequested` element to `true`. The job is canceled on a best-effort basis. If drives are in the process of transferring data, data may continue to be transferred even after cancellation has been requested.

 A canceled job is moved to the `Completed` state and is kept for 90 days, at which point it is deleted.

 To delete a job, call the [Delete Job](/rest/api/storageimportexport/jobs) operation before the job has shipped (that is, while the job is in the `Creating` state). You can also delete a job when it is in the `Completed` state. After a job is deleted, its information and status are no longer accessible via the REST API or the Azure portal.
