# azcopy remove

## Synopsis

```azcopy
azcopy remove [resourceURL] [flags]
```

## Examples

Remove a single blob by using a SAS token:

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/blob]?[SAS]"
```

Remove an entire virtual directory by using a SAS token:
 
```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" --recursive=true
```

Remove only the blobs inside of a virtual directory, but don't remove any subdirectories or blobs within those subdirectories:

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/virtual/dir]" --recursive=false
```

Remove a subset of blobs in a virtual directory (For example: remove only jpg and pdf files, or if the blob name is `exactName`):

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" --recursive=true --include-pattern="*.jpg;*.pdf;exactName"
```

Remove an entire virtual directory but exclude certain blobs from the scope (For example: every blob that starts with foo or ends with bar):

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" --recursive=true --exclude-pattern="foo*;*bar"
```

Remove specific blobs and virtual directories by putting their relative paths (NOT URL-encoded) in a file:

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/parent/dir]" --recursive=true --list-of-files=/usr/bar/list.txt
- file content:
	dir1/dir2
	blob1
	blob2
```
Remove a single file from a Blob Storage account that has a hierarchical namespace (include/exclude not supported):

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].dfs.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/file]?[SAS]"
```

Remove a single directory from a Blob Storage account that has a hierarchical namespace (include/exclude not supported):

```azcopy
azcopy rm "https://[account].dfs.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]"
```

## Options

**--delete-snapshots** string   By default, the delete operation fails if a blob has snapshots. Specify `include` to remove the root blob and all its snapshots; alternatively specify `only` to remove only the snapshots but keep the root blob.

**--exclude-path** string   Exclude these paths when removing. This option does not support wildcard characters (*). Checks relative path prefix. For example: `myFolder;myFolder/subDirName/file.pdf`

**--exclude-pattern** string   Exclude files where the name matches the pattern list. For example: `*.jpg`;`*.pdf`;`exactName`

**--force-if-read-only**   When deleting an Azure Files file or folder, force the deletion to work even if the existing object is has its read-only attribute set.

**--help**   help for remove.

**--include-path** string   Include only these paths when removing. This option does not support wildcard characters (*). Checks relative path prefix. For example: `myFolder;myFolder/subDirName/file.pdf`

**--include-pattern** string  Include only files where the name matches the pattern list. For example: *`.jpg`;*`.pdf`;`exactName`

**--list-of-files** string  Defines the location of a file, which contains the list of files and directories to be deleted. The relative paths should be 
delimited by line breaks, and the paths should NOT be URL-encoded. 

**--list-of-versions** string   Specifies a file where each version id is listed on a separate line. Ensure that the source must point to a single blob and all the version ids specified in the file using this flag must belong to the source blob only. Specified version ids of the given blob will get deleted from Azure Storage. 

**--log-level** string   Define the log verbosity for the log file. Available levels include: `INFO`(all requests/responses), `WARNING`(slow responses), `ERROR`(only failed requests), and `NONE`(no output logs). (default `INFO`) (default `INFO`)

**--recursive**    Look into subdirectories recursively when syncing between directories.

## Options inherited from parent commands

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|--cap-mbps float|Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.|
|--output-type string|Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is "text".|
|--trusted-microsoft-suffixes string   |Specifies additional domain suffixes where Azure Active Directory login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.|
