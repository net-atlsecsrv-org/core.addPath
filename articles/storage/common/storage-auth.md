# Authorizing access to data in Azure Storage

Each time you access data in your storage account, your client makes a request over HTTP/HTTPS to Azure Storage. Every request to a secure resource must be authorized, so that the service ensures that the client has the permissions required to access the data.

The following table describes the options that Azure Storage offers for authorizing access to resources:

|  |Shared Key (storage account key)  |Shared access signature (SAS)  |Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)  |Active Directory (preview) |Anonymous public read access  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Azure Blobs     |[Supported](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key/)         |[Supported](storage-sas-overview.md)         |[Supported](storage-auth-aad.md)         |Not supported|[Supported](../blobs/storage-manage-access-to-resources.md)         |
|Azure Files (SMB)     |[Supported](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key/)         |Not supported         |[Supported, only with AAD Domain Services](../files/storage-files-active-directory-overview.md)         |[Supported, credentials must be synced to Azure AD](../files/storage-files-active-directory-overview.md)|Not supported         |
|Azure Files (REST)     |[Supported](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key/)         |[Supported](storage-sas-overview.md)         |Not supported         |Not supported |Not supported         |
|Azure Queues     |[Supported](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key/)         |[Supported](storage-sas-overview.md)         |[Supported](storage-auth-aad.md)         |Not Supported | Not supported         |
|Azure Tables     |[Supported](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key/)         |[Supported](storage-sas-overview.md)         |Not supported         |Not supported| Not supported         |

Each authorization option is briefly described below:

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integration** for blobs, and queues. Azure AD provides role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained control over a client's access to resources in a storage account. For more information regarding Azure AD integration for blobs and queues, see [Authorize access to Azure blobs and queues using Azure Active Directory](storage-auth-aad.md).

- **Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) authentication** for Azure Files. Azure Files supports identity-based authorization over Server Message Block (SMB) through Azure AD DS. You can use RBAC for fine-grained control over a client's access to Azure Files resources in a storage account. For more information regarding Azure Files authentication using domain services, refer to our [overview](../files/storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).

- **Active Directory (AD) authentication (preview)** for Azure Files. Azure Files supports identity-based authorization over SMB through AD. Your AD domain service can be hosted on on-premises machines or in Azure VMs. SMB access to Files is supported using AD credentials from domain joined machines, either on-premises or in Azure. You can use RBAC for share level access control and NTFS DACLs for directory/file level permission enforcement. For more information regarding Azure Files authentication using domain services, refer to our [overview](../files/storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).

- **Shared Key authorization** for blobs, files, queues, and tables. A client using Shared Key passes a header with every request that is signed using the storage account access key. For more information, see [Authorize with Shared Key](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key/).
- **Shared access signatures** for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Shared access signatures (SAS) provide limited delegated access to resources in a storage account. Adding constraints on the time interval for which the signature is valid or on permissions it grants provides flexibility in managing access. For more information, see [Using shared access signatures (SAS)](storage-sas-overview.md).
- **Anonymous public read access** for containers and blobs. Authorization is not required. For more information, see [Manage anonymous read access to containers and blobs](../blobs/storage-manage-access-to-resources.md).  

By default, all resources in Azure Storage are secured, and are available only to the account owner. Although you can use any of the authorization strategies outlined above to grant clients access to resources in your storage account, Microsoft recommends using Azure AD when possible for maximum security and ease of use.
