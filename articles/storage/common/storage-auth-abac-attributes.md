# Actions and attributes for Azure role assignment conditions in Azure Storage (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure ABAC and Azure role assignment conditions are currently in preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This article describes the supported attribute dictionaries that can be used in conditions on Azure role assignments for each Azure Storage [DataAction](../../role-based-access-control/role-definitions.md#dataactions). For the list of Blob service operations that are affected by a specific permission or DataAction, see [Permissions for Blob service operations](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-azure-active-directory#permissions-for-blob-service-operations).

To understand the role assignment condition format, see [Azure role assignment condition format and syntax](../../role-based-access-control/conditions-format.md).

## Suboperations

Multiple Storage service operations can be associated with a single permission or DataAction. However, each of these operations that are associated with the same permission might support different parameters. *Suboperations* enable you to differentiate between service operations that require the same permission but support different set of attributes for conditions. Thus, by using a suboperation, you can specify one condition for access to a subset of operations that support a given parameter. Then, you can use another access condition for operations with the same action that doesn't support that parameter.

For example, the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/write` action is required for over a dozen different service operations. Some of these operations can accept blob index tags as request parameter, while others don't. For operations that accept blob index tags as a parameter, you can use blob index tags in a Request condition. However, if such a condition is defined on the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/write` action, all operations that don't accept tags as a request parameter cannot evaluate this condition, and will fail the authorization access check.

In this case, the optional suboperation `Blob.Write.WithTagHeaders` can be used to apply a condition to only those operations that support blob index tags as a request parameter.

Similarly, only select operations on the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read` action can have support blob index tags as a precondition for access. This subset of operations is identified by the `Blob.Read.WithTagConditions` suboperation.

> [!NOTE]
> Blobs also support the ability to store arbitrary user-defined key-value metadata. Although metadata is similar to blob index tags, you must use blob index tags with conditions. For more information, see [Manage and find data on Azure Blob Storage with Blob Index (preview)](../blobs/storage-manage-find-blobs.md).

In this preview, storage accounts support the following suboperations:

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | DataAction | Suboperation | Display name | Description |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read` | `Blob.Read.WithTagConditions` | Blob read operations that support conditions on tags | Includes REST operations Get Blob, Get Blob Metadata, Get Blob Properties, Get Block List, Get Page Ranges, Query Blob Contents. |
> | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/write` <br/> `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/add/action` | `Blob.Write.WithTagHeaders` | Blob writes for content with optional tags | Includes REST operations Put Blob, Copy Blob, Copy Blob From URL and Put Block List. |

## Actions and suboperations

The following table lists the supported actions and suboperations for conditions in Azure Storage.

## Attributes

The following table lists the descriptions for the supported attributes for conditions in Azure Storage.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Display name | Description | Attribute |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Container name| Name of a storage container or file system. Use when you want to check the container name. | `containers:name` |
> | Blob path | Path of a virtual directory, blob, folder or file resource. Use when you want to check the blob name or folders in a blob path. | `blobs:path` |
> | Blob index tags [Keys] | Index tags on a blob resource. Arbitrary user-defined key-value properties that you can store alongside a blob resource. Use when you want to check the key in blob index tags. | `tags&$keys$&` |
> | Blob index tags [Values in key] | Index tags on a blob resource. Arbitrary user-defined key-value properties that you can store alongside a blob resource. Use when you want to check both the key (case-sensitive) and value in blob index tags. | `tags:`*keyname*`<$key_case_sensitive$>` |

> [!NOTE]
> Attributes and values listed are considered case-insensitive, unless stated otherwise.

> [!NOTE]
> When specifying conditions for `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs:path` attribute, the values shouldn't include the container name or a preceding '/' character. Use the path characters without any URL encoding.

## Attributes available for each action

The following table lists which attributes you can use in your condition expressions depending on the action you target. If you select multiple actions for a single condition, there might be fewer attributes to choose from for your condition because the attributes must be available across the selected actions.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | DataAction | Attribute | Type | Applies to |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/delete` | `containers:name` | string | ResourceAttributeOnly |
