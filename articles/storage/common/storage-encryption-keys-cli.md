# Configure customer-managed keys for Azure Storage encryption from Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [storage-encryption-configure-keys-include](../../../includes/storage-encryption-configure-keys-include.md)]

This article shows how to configure a key vault with customer-managed keys using Azure CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using customer-managed keys with Azure Storage encryption requires that two properties be set on the key vault, **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge**. These properties are not enabled by default. To enable these properties, use either PowerShell or Azure CLI.
> Only RSA keys and key size 2048 are supported.

## Assign an identity to the storage account

To enable customer-managed keys for your storage account, first assign a system-assigned managed identity to the storage account. You'll use this managed identity to grant the storage account permissions to access the key vault.

To assign a managed identity using Azure CLI, call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update). Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>

az storage account update \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --assign-identity
```

For more information about configuring system-assigned managed identities with Azure CLI, see [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on an Azure VM using Azure CLI](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md).

## Create a new key vault

The key vault that you use to store customer-managed keys for Azure Storage encryption must have two key protection settings enabled, **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge**. To create a new key vault using PowerShell or Azure CLI with these settings enabled, execute the following commands. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values. 

To create a new key vault using Azure CLI, call [az keyvault create](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-create). Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault create \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --location <region> \
    --enable-soft-delete \
    --enable-purge-protection
```

## Configure the key vault access policy

Next, configure the access policy for the key vault so that the storage account has permissions to access it. In this step, you'll use the managed identity that you previously assigned to the storage account.

To set the access policy for the key vault, call [az keyvault set-policy](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-set-policy). Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
storage_account_principal=$(az storage account show \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --query identity.principalId \
    --output tsv)
az keyvault set-policy \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group>
    --object-id $storage_account_principal \
    --key-permissions get recover unwrapKey wrapKey
```

## Create a new key

Next, create a key in the key vault. To create a key, call [az keyvault key create](/cli/azure/keyvault/key#az-keyvault-key-create). Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault key create
    --name <key> \
    --vault-name <key-vault>
```

## Configure encryption with customer-managed keys

By default, Azure Storage encryption uses Microsoft-managed keys. Configure your Azure Storage account for customer-managed keys and specify the key to associate with the storage account.

To update the storage account's encryption settings, call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update). This example also queries for the key vault URI and key version, both of which values are needed to associate the key with the storage account. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
key_vault_uri=$(az keyvault show \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --query properties.vaultUri \
    --output tsv)
key_version=$(az keyvault key list-versions \
    --name <key> \
    --vault-name <key-vault> \
    --query [].kid \
    --output tsv | cut -d '/' -f 6)
az storage account update 
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --encryption-key-name <key> \
    --encryption-key-version $key_version \
    --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Keyvault \
    --encryption-key-vault $key_vault_uri
```

## Update the key version

When you create a new version of a key, you'll need to update the storage account to use the new version. First, query for the key vault URI by calling [az keyvault show](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-show), and for the key version by calling [az keyvault key list-versions](/cli/azure/keyvault/key#az-keyvault-key-list-versions). Then call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version of the key, as shown in the previous section.
