# Use the Azurite emulator for local Azure Storage development and testing (preview)

The Azurite version 3.2 open-source emulator (preview) provides a free local environment for testing your Azure blob and queue storage applications. When you're satisfied with how your application is working locally, switch to using an Azure Storage account in the cloud. The emulator provides cross-platform support on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Azurite v3 supports APIs implemented by the Azure Blob service.

Azurite is the future storage emulator platform. Azurite supersedes the [Azure Storage Emulator](storage-use-emulator.md). Azurite will continue to be updated to support the latest versions of Azure Storage APIs.

There are several different ways to install and run Azurite on your local system:

  1. [Install and run the Azurite Visual Studio Code extension](#install-and-run-the-azurite-visual-studio-code-extension)
  1. [Install and run Azurite by using NPM](#install-and-run-azurite-by-using-npm)
  1. [Install and run the Azurite Docker image](#install-and-run-the-azurite-docker-image)
  1. [Clone, build, and run Azurite from the GitHub repository](#clone-build-and-run-azurite-from-the-github-repository)

## Install and run the Azurite Visual Studio Code extension

Within Visual Studio Code, select the **EXTENSIONS** pane and search for *Azurite* in the **EXTENSIONS:MARKETPLACE**.

![Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace](media/storage-use-azurite/azurite-vs-code-extension.png)

   * **Azurite: Queue Port** - The Queue service listening port. The default port is 10001.
   * **Azurite: Silent** - Silent mode disables the access log. The default value is **false**.

## Install and run Azurite by using NPM

This installation method requires that you have [Node.js version 8.0 or later](https://nodejs.org) installed. **npm** is the package management tool included with every Node.js installation. After installing Node.js, execute the following **npm** command to install Azurite.

```console
npm install -g azurite
```

After installing Azurite, see [Run Azurite from a command-line](#run-azurite-from-a-command-line).

## Install and run the Azurite Docker image

Use [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) to pull the [latest Azurite image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-storage-azurite) by using the following command:

```console
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
```

**Run the Azurite Docker image**:

The following command runs the Azurite Docker image. The `-p 10000:10000` parameter redirects requests from host machine's port 10000 to the Docker instance.

```console
docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
```

**Specify the workspace location**:

In the following example, the `-v c:/azurite:/data` parameter specifies *c:/azurite* as the Azurite persisted data location. The directory, *c:/azurite*, must be created before running the Docker command.

```console
docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -v c:/azurite:/data mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
```

**Run just the blob service**

```console
docker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
    azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0 --blobPort 10000
```

**Set all Azurite parameters**:

This example shows how to set all of the command-line parameters. All of the parameters below should be placed on a single command-line.

```console
docker run -p 8888:8888
           -p 9999:9999
           -v c:/azurite:/workspace mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite
           -l /workspace
           -d /workspace/debug.log
           --blobPort 8888
           --blobHost 0.0.0.0
           --queuePort 9999
           --queueHost 0.0.0.0
```

See [Command-line options](#command-line-options) for more information about configuring Azurite at start-up.

## Clone, build, and run Azurite from the GitHub repository

This installation method requires that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/azure/azurite) for the Azurite project by using the following console command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azurite.git
```

After cloning the source code, execute following commands from the root of the cloned repo to build and install Azurite.

```console
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g
```

After installing and building Azurite, see [Run Azurite from a command-line](#run-azurite-from-a-command-line).

## Run Azurite from a command-line

> [!NOTE]
> Azurite cannot be run from the command line if you only installed the Visual Studio Code extension. Instead, use the VS Code command palette. For more information, see [Install and run the Azurite Visual Studio Code extension](#install-and-run-the-azurite-visual-studio-code-extension).

To get started immediately with the command-line, create a directory called **c:\azurite**, then launch Azurite by issuing the following command:

```console
azurite --silent --location c:\azurite --debug c:\azurite\debug.log
```

This command tells Azurite to store all data in a particular directory, **c:\azurite**. If the **--location** option is omitted, it will use the current working directory.

## Command-line options

This section details the command-line switches available when launching Azurite. All command-line switches are optional.

```console
C:\Azurite> azurite [--blobHost <IP address>] [--blobPort <port address>] 
    [-d | --debug <log file path>] [-l | --location <workspace path>]
    [--queueHost <IP address>] [--queuePort <port address>]
    [-s | --silent] [-h | --help]
```

The **-d** is a shortcut for **--debug**, **-l** switch is a shortcut for **--location**, **-s** is a shortcut for **--silent**, and **-h** is a shortcut for **--help**.

### Blob listening host

**Optional** By default, Azurite will listen to 127.0.0.1 as the local server. Use the **--blobHost** switch to set the address to your requirements.

Accept requests on the local machine only:

```console
azurite --blobHost 127.0.0.1
```

Allow remote requests:

```console
azurite --blobHost 0.0.0.0
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Allowing remote requests may make your system vulnerable to external attacks.

### Blob listening port configuration

**Optional** By default, Azurite will listen for the Blob service on port 10000. Use the **--blobPort** switch to specify the listening port that you require.

> [!NOTE]
> After using a customized port, you need to update the connection string or corresponding configuration in your Azure Storage tools or SDKs.

Customize the Blob service listening port:

```console
azurite --blobPort 8888
```

Let the system auto select an available port:

```console
azurite --blobPort 0
```

The port in use is displayed during Azurite startup.

### Queue listening host

**Optional** By default, Azurite will listen to 127.0.0.1 as the local server. Use the **--queueHost** switch to set the address to your requirements.

Accept requests on the local machine only:

```console
azurite --queueHost 127.0.0.1
```

Allow remote requests:

```console
azurite --queueHost 0.0.0.0
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Allowing remote requests may make your system vulnerable to external attacks.

### Queue listening port configuration

**Optional** By default, Azurite will listen for the Queue service on port 10001. Use the **--queuePort** switch to specify the listening port that you require.

> [!NOTE]
> After using a customized port, you need to update the connection string or corresponding configuration in your Azure Storage tools or SDKs.

Customize the Queue service listening port:

```console
azurite --queuePort 8888
```

Let the system auto select an available port:

```console
azurite --queuePort 0
```

The port in use is displayed during Azurite startup.

### Workspace path

**Optional** Azurite stores data to the local disk during execution. Use the **--location** switch to specify a path as the workspace location. By default, the current process working directory will be used.

```console
azurite --location c:\azurite
```

```console
azurite -l c:\azurite
```

### Access log

**Optional** By default, the access log is displayed in the console window. Disable the display of the access log by using the **--silent** switch.

```console
azurite --silent
```

```console
azurite -s
```

### Debug log

**Optional** The debug log includes detailed information on every request and exception stack trace. Enable the debug log by providing a valid local file path to the **--debug** switch.

```console
azurite --debug path/debug.log
```

```console
azurite -d path/debug.log
```

### Loose mode

**Optional** By default, Azurite applies strict mode to block unsupported request headers and parameters. Disable strict mode by using the **--loose** switch.

```console
azurite --loose
```

Note the capital 'L' shortcut switch:

```console
azurite -L
```

## Authorization for tools and SDKs

Connect to Azurite from Azure Storage SDKs or tools, like [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/), by using any authentication strategy. Authentication is required. Azurite supports authorization with Shared Key and shared access signatures (SAS). Azurite also supports anonymous access to public containers.

### Well-known storage account and key

You can use the following account name and key with Azurite. This is the same well-known account and key used by the legacy Azure storage emulator.

* Account name: `devstoreaccount1`
* Account key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==`

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to SharedKey authentication, Azurite supports account and service SAS authentication. Anonymous access is also available when a container is set to allow public access.

### Connection string

The easiest way to connect to Azurite from your application is to configure a connection string in your application's configuration file that references the shortcut *UseDevelopmentStorage=true*. Here's an example of a connection string in an *app.config* file:

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="StorageConnectionString" value="UseDevelopmentStorage=true" />
</appSettings>
```

For more information, see [Configure Azure Storage connection strings](storage-configure-connection-string.md).

### Custom storage accounts and keys

Azurite supports custom storage account names and keys by setting the `AZURITE_ACCOUNTS` environment variable in the following format: `account1:key1[:key2];account2:key1[:key2];...`.

For example, use a custom storage account that has one key:

```cmd
set AZURITE_ACCOUNTS="account1:key1"
```

Or use multiple storage accounts with 2 keys each:

```cmd
set AZURITE_ACCOUNTS="account1:key1:key2;account2:key1:key2"
```

Azurite refreshes custom account names and keys from the environment variable every minute by default. With this feature, you can dynamically rotate the account key, or add new storage accounts without restarting Azurite.

> [!NOTE]
> The default `devstoreaccount1` storage account is disabled when you set custom storage accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> Update the connection string accordingly when using custom account names and keys.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `export` keyword to set environment variables in a Linux environment, use `set` in Windows.

### Storage Explorer

In Azure Storage Explorer, connect to Azurite by clicking the **Add Account** icon, then select **Attach to a local emulator** and click **Connect**.

## Differences between Azurite and Azure Storage

There are functional differences between a local instance of Azurite and an Azure Storage account in the cloud.

### Endpoint and connection URL

The service endpoints for Azurite are different from the endpoints of an Azure Storage account. The local computer doesn't do domain name resolution, requiring Azurite endpoints to be local addresses.

When you address a resource in an Azure Storage account, the account name is part of the URI host name. The resource being addressed is part of the URI path:

`<http|https>://<account-name>.<service-name>.core.windows.net/<resource-path>`

The following URI is a valid address for a blob in an Azure Storage account:

`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

Since the local computer doesn't do domain name resolution, the account name is part of the URI path instead of the host name. Use the following URI format for a resource in Azurite:

`http://<local-machine-address>:<port>/<account-name>/<resource-path>`

The following address might be used for accessing a blob in Azurite:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/myaccount/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

### Scaling and performance

Azurite is not a scalable storage service and does not support a large number of concurrent clients. There's no performance guarantee. Azurite is intended for development and testing purposes.

### Error handling

Azurite is aligned with Azure Storage error handling logic, but there are differences. For example, error messages may be different, while error status codes align.

### RA-GRS

Azurite supports read-access geo-redundant replication (RA-GRS). For storage resources, access the secondary location by appending **-secondary** to the account name. For example, the following address might be used for accessing a blob using the read-only secondary in Azurite:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1-secondary/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

## Azurite is open-source
