# Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage

Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage provides an additional layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without the need to be a security expert or manage security monitoring systems. 

Security alerts are triggered when anomalies in activity occur.  These security alerts are integrated with [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/), and are also sent via email to subscription administrators, with details of suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

> [!NOTE]
> * Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage is currently available only for the Blob storage.
> * For pricing details, including a free 30 day trial, see the [Azure Security Center pricing page]( https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/security-center/).
> * ATP for Azure storage feature is currently not available in Azure government and sovereign cloud regions.

Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage ingests diagnostic logs of read, write, and delete requests to Blob storage for threat detection. To investigate the alerts from Advanced Threat Protection, you can view related storage activity using Storage Analytics Logging. For more information, see how to [configure Storage Analytics logging](storage-monitor-storage-account.md#configure-logging).
