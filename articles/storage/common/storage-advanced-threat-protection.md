# Configure advanced threat protection for Azure Storage

Advanced threat protection for Azure Storage provides an additional layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without being a security expert or managing security monitoring systems.

Security alerts are triggered when anomalies in activity occur. These security alerts are integrated with [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/), and are also sent via email to subscription administrators, with details of suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced threat protection for Azure Storage is currently available only for Blob storage. It is not available in Azure government and sovereign cloud regions. For pricing details, including a free 30 day trial, see the [Azure Security Center pricing page]( https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/security-center/).

Advanced threat protection for Azure Storage ingests diagnostic logs of read, write, and delete requests to Blob storage for threat detection. To investigate the alerts from advanced threat protection, you can view related storage activity using Storage Analytics Logging. For more information, see **Configure logging** in [Monitor a storage account in the Azure portal](storage-monitor-storage-account.md#configure-logging).

## Set up advanced threat protection

You can configure advanced threat protection in any of several ways, described in the following sections.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

### [Azure Policy](#tab/azure-policy)

Use an Azure Policy to enable advanced threat protection across storage accounts under a specific subscription or resource group.

1. Launch the Azure **Policy - Definitions** page.

1. Search for the **Deploy Advanced Threat Protection on Storage Accounts** policy.

     ![Search Policy](./media/storage-advanced-threat-protection/storage-atp-policy-definitions.png)

## Explore security anomalies

When storage activity anomalies occur, you receive an email notification with information about the suspicious security event. Details of the event include:

* The nature of the anomaly
* The storage account name
* The event time
* The storage type
* The potential causes
* The investigation steps
* The remediation steps

The email also includes details on possible causes and recommended actions to investigate and mitigate the potential threat.

![Azure Storage advanced threat protection alert email](./media/storage-advanced-threat-protection/storage-advanced-threat-protection-alert-email.png)

You can review and manage your current security alerts from Azure Security Center's [Security alerts tile](../../security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md). Clicking on a specific alert provides details and actions for investigating the current threat and addressing future threats.
