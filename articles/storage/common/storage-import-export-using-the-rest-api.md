# Using the Azure Import/Export service REST API

The Microsoft Azure Import/Export service exposes a REST API to enable programmatic control of import/export jobs. You can use the REST API to perform all of the import/export operations that you can perform with the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Additionally, you can use the REST API to perform certain granular operations, such as querying the percentage completion of a job, which is not currently available in the Azure portal.

See [Using the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service to Transfer Data to Blob Storage](../storage-import-export-service.md) for an overview of the Import/Export service and a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the portal to create and manage import and export jobs.

## Service endpoints

The Azure Import/Export service is a resource provider for Azure Resource Manager and provides a set of REST APIs at the following HTTPS endpoint for managing import/export jobs:

```
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.ImportExport/jobs/<job-name>
```

## Versioning

Requests to the Import/Export service must specify the `api-version` parameter and set its value to `2016-11-01`.
