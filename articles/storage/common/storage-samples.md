# Azure Storage samples

Use the links below to view and download Azure Storage sample code and applications.

## Azure Code Samples library

The [Azure Code Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/?service=storage) library includes samples for Azure Storage that you can download and run locally. The Code Sample Library provides sample code in .zip format. Alternatively, you can browse and clone the GitHub repository for each sample.

## .NET samples

To explore the .NET samples, download the [.NET Storage Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/) from NuGet. The .NET storage client library is also available in the [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).

* [Azure Storage samples using .NET](storage-samples-dotnet.md)

## Java samples

To explore the Java samples, download the [Java Storage Client Library](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-java).

* [Azure Storage samples using Java](storage-samples-java.md)

## Python samples

To explore the Python samples, download the [Python Storage Client Library](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-python).

* [Azure Storage samples using Python](storage-samples-python.md)

## Node.js samples

To explore the Node.js samples, download the [Node.js Storage Client Library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node).

* [Azure Storage samples using JavaScript/Node.js](storage-samples-javascript.md)

## C++ samples

To explore the C++ samples, download the [C++ Storage Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/wastorage/) from NuGet.
