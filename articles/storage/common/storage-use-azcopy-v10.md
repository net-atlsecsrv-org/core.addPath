# Get started with AzCopy

AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account. This article helps you download AzCopy, connect to your storage account, and then transfer files.

> [!NOTE]
> AzCopy **V10** is the currently supported version of AzCopy.
>
> If you need to use AzCopy **v8.1**, see the [Use the previous version of AzCopy](#previous-version) section of this article.

<a id="download-and-install-azcopy" />

## Download AzCopy

First, download the AzCopy V10 executable file to any directory on your computer. 

- [Windows](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows) (zip)
- [Linux](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux) (tar)
- [MacOS](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-mac) (zip)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to copy data to and from your [Azure Table storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview) service, then install [AzCopy version 7.3](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopynet).

## Run AzCopy

For convenience, consider adding the directory location of the AzCopy executable to your system path for ease of use. That way you can type `azcopy` from any directory on your system.

If you choose not to add the AzCopy directory to your path, you'll have to change directories to the location of your AzCopy executable and type `azcopy` or `.\azcopy` in Windows PowerShell command prompts.

To see a list of commands, type `azcopy -h` and then press the ENTER key.

To learn about a specific command, just include the name of the command (For example: `azcopy list -h`).

Before you can do anything meaningful with AzCopy, you need to decide how you'll provide authorization credentials to the storage service.

## Choose how you'll provide authorization credentials

You can provide authorization credentials by using Azure Active Directory (AD), or by using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token.

Use this table as a guide:

| Storage type | Currently supported method of authorization |
|--|--|
|**Blob storage** | Azure AD & SAS |
|**Blob storage (hierarchial namespace)** | Azure AD only |
|**File storage** | SAS only |

### Option 1: Use Azure AD

The level of authorization that you need is based on whether you plan to upload files or just download them.

#### Authorization to upload files

Verify that one of these roles has been assigned to your identity:

- [Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor)
- [Storage Blob Data Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)

These roles can be assigned to your identity in any of these scopes:

- Container (file system)
- Storage account
- Resource group
- Subscription

To learn how to verify and assign roles, see [Grant access to Azure blob and queue data with RBAC in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).

You don't need to have one of these roles assigned to your identity if your identity is added to the access control list (ACL) of the target container or directory. In the ACL, your identity needs write permission on the target directory, and execute permission on container and each parent directory.

To learn more, see [Access control in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control).

#### Authorization to download files

Verify that one of these roles has been assigned to your identity:

- [Storage Blob Data Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader)
- [Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor)
- [Storage Blob Data Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)

These roles can be assigned to your identity in any of these scopes:

- Container (file system)
- Storage account
- Resource group
- Subscription

To learn how to verify and assign roles, see [Grant access to Azure blob and queue data with RBAC in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).

You don't need to have one of these roles assigned to your identity if your identity is added to the access control list (ACL) of the target container or directory. In the ACL, your identity needs read permission on the target directory, and execute permission on container and each parent directory.

To learn more, see [Access control in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control).

#### Authenticate your identity

After you've verified that your identity has been given the necessary authorization level, open a command prompt, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

```azcopy
azcopy login
```

This command returns an authentication code and the URL of a website. Open the website, provide the code, and then choose the **Next** button.

![Create a container](media/storage-use-azcopy-v10/azcopy-login.png)

A sign-in window will appear. In that window, sign into your Azure account by using your Azure account credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you can close the browser window and begin using AzCopy.

### Option 2: Use a SAS token

You can append a SAS token to each source or destination URL that use in your AzCopy commands.

This example command recursively copies data from a local directory to a blob container. A fictitious SAS token is appended to the end of the of the container URL.

```azcopy
azcopy cp "C:\local\path" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bjqt&srt=sco&sp=rwddgcup&se=2019-05-01T05:01:17Z&st=2019-04-30T21:01:17Z&spr=https&sig=MGCXiyEzbtttkr3ewJIh2AR8KrghSy1DGM9ovN734bQF4%3D" --recursive=true
```

To learn more about SAS tokens and how to obtain one, see [Using shared access signatures (SAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1).

## Transfer files

After you've authenticated your identity or obtained a SAS token, you can begin transferring files.

To find example commands, see any of these articles.

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and blob storage](storage-use-azcopy-blobs.md)

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and file storage](storage-use-azcopy-files.md)

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and Amazon S3 buckets](storage-use-azcopy-s3.md)

## Configure, optimize, and troubleshoot AzCopy

See [Configure, optimize, and troubleshoot AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy-configure.md)

## Use AzCopy in Storage Explorer

If you want to leverage the performance advantages of AzCopy, but you prefer to use Storage Explorer rather than the command line to interact with your files, then enable AzCopy in Storage Explorer.

In Storage Explorer, choose **Preview**->**Use AzCopy for Improved Blob Upload and Download**.

![Enable AzCopy as a transfer engine in Azure Storage Explorer](media/storage-use-azcopy-v10/enable-azcopy-storage-explorer.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> You don't have to enable this setting if you've enabled a hierarchical namespace on your storage account. That's because Storage Explorer automatically uses AzCopy on storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.

## Use the previous version of AzCopy

If you need to use the previous version of AzCopy (AzCopy v8.1), see either of the following links:

- [AzCopy on Windows (v8)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/storage/storage-use-azcopy)
- [AzCopy on Linux (v8)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/storage/storage-use-azcopy-linux)
