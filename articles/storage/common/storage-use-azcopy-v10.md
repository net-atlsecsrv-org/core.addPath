# Get started with AzCopy

AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account. This article helps you download AzCopy, connect to your storage account, and then transfer files.

> [!NOTE]
> AzCopy **V10** is the currently supported version of AzCopy.
>
> If you need to use AzCopy **v8.1**, see the [Use the previous version of AzCopy](#previous-version) section of this article.

<a id="download-and-install-azcopy" />

## Download AzCopy

First, download the AzCopy V10 executable file to any directory on your computer. 

- [Windows](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows) (zip)
- [Linux](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux) (tar)
- [MacOS](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-mac) (zip)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to copy data to and from your [Azure Table storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview) service, then install [AzCopy version 7.3](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopynet).

## Run AzCopy

For convenience, consider adding the directory location of the AzCopy executable to your system path for ease of use. That way you can type `azcopy` from any directory on your system.

If you choose not to add the AzCopy directory to your path, you'll have to change directories to the location of your AzCopy executable and type `azcopy` or `.\azcopy` in Windows PowerShell command prompts.

To see a list of commands, type `azcopy -h` and then press the ENTER key.

To learn about a specific command, just include the name of the command (For example: `azcopy list -h`).

> [!NOTE] 
> As an owner of your Azure Storage account, you aren't automatically assigned permissions to access data. Before you can do anything meaningful with AzCopy, you need to decide how you'll provide authorization credentials to the storage service. 

## Choose how you'll provide authorization credentials

You can provide authorization credentials by using Azure Active Directory (AD), or by using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token.

Use this table as a guide:

| Storage type | Currently supported method of authorization |
|--|--|
|**Blob storage** | Azure AD & SAS |
|**Blob storage (hierarchial namespace)** | Azure AD only |
|**File storage** | SAS only |

### Option 1: Use Azure AD

By using Azure AD, you can provide credentials once instead of having to append a SAS token to each command.  

The level of authorization that you need is based on whether you plan to upload files or just download them.

If you just want to download files, then verify that the [Storage Blob Data Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader) has been assigned to your user identity or service principal. 

> [!NOTE]
> User identities and service principals are each a type of *security principal*, so we'll use the term *security principal* for the remainder of this article.

If you want to upload files, then verify that one of these roles has been assigned to your security principal:

- [Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor)
- [Storage Blob Data Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)

These roles can be assigned to your identity in any of these scopes:

- Container (file system)
- Storage account
- Resource group
- Subscription

To learn how to verify and assign roles, see [Grant access to Azure blob and queue data with RBAC in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).

You don't need to have one of these roles assigned to your security principal if your security principal is added to the access control list (ACL) of the target container or directory. In the ACL, your security principal needs write permission on the target directory, and execute permission on container and each parent directory.

To learn more, see [Access control in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control).

#### Authenticate a user identity

After you've verified that your user identity has been given the necessary authorization level, open a command prompt, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

```azcopy
azcopy login
```

If you belong to more than one organization, include the tenant ID of the organization to which the storage account belongs.

```azcopy
azcopy login --tenant-id=<tenant-id>
```

Replace the `<tenant-id>` placeholder with the tenant ID of the organization to which the storage account belongs. To find the tenant ID, select **Azure Active Directory > Properties > Directory ID** in the Azure portal.

This command returns an authentication code and the URL of a website. Open the website, provide the code, and then choose the **Next** button.

![Create a container](media/storage-use-azcopy-v10/azcopy-login.png)

A sign-in window will appear. In that window, sign into your Azure account by using your Azure account credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you can close the browser window and begin using AzCopy.

<a id="service-principal" />

#### Authenticate a service principal

This is a great option if you plan to use AzCopy inside of a script that runs without user interaction. 

Before you run that script, you have to sign-in interactively at least one time so that you can provide AzCopy with the credentials of your service principal.  Those credentials are stored in a secured and encrypted file so that your script doesn't have to provide that sensitive information.

You can sign into your account by using a client secret or by using the password of a certificate that is associated with your service principal's app registration. 

To learn more about creating service principal, see [How to: Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

To learn more about service principals in general, see [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals)

##### Using a client secret

Start by setting the `AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable to the client secret of your service principal's app registration. 

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to set this value from your command prompt, and not in the environment variable settings of your operating system. That way, the value is available only to the current session.

This example shows how you could do this in PowerShell.

```azcopy
$env:AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET="$(Read-Host -prompt "Enter key")"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Consider using a prompt as shown in this example. That way, the client secret won't appear in your console's command history. 

Next, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

```azcopy
azcopy login --service-principal --application-id <application-id>
```

Replace the `<application-id>` placeholder with the application ID of your service principal's app registration.

##### Using a certificate

If you prefer to use your own credentials for authorization, you can upload a certificate to your app registration, and then use that certificate to login.

In addition to uploading your certificate to your app registration, you'll also need to have a copy of the certificate saved to the machine or VM where AzCopy will be running. This copy of the certificate should be in .PFX or .PEM format, and must include the private key. The private key should be password-protected. If you're using Windows, and your certificate exists only in a certificate store, make sure to export that certificate to a PFX file (including the private key). For guidance, see [Export-PfxCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/pkiclient/export-pfxcertificate?view=win10-ps)

Next, set the `AZCOPY_SPA_CERT_PASSWORD` environment variable to the certificate password.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to set this value from your command prompt, and not in the environment variable settings of your operating system. That way, the value is available only to the current session.

This example shows how you could do this in PowerShell.

```azcopy
$env:AZCOPY_SPA_CERT_PASSWORD="$(Read-Host -prompt "Enter key")"
```

Next, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

```azcopy
azcopy login --service-principal --certificate-path <path-to-certificate-file>
```

Replace the `<path-to-certificate-file>` placeholder with the relative or fully-qualified path to the certificate file. AzCopy saves the path to this certificate but it doesn't save a copy of the certificate, so make sure to keep that certificate in place.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider using a prompt as shown in this example. That way, your password won't appear in your console's command history. 

### Option 2: Use a SAS token

You can append a SAS token to each source or destination URL that use in your AzCopy commands.

This example command recursively copies data from a local directory to a blob container. A fictitious SAS token is appended to the end of the of the container URL.

```azcopy
azcopy cp "C:\local\path" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bjqt&srt=sco&sp=rwddgcup&se=2019-05-01T05:01:17Z&st=2019-04-30T21:01:17Z&spr=https&sig=MGCXiyEzbtttkr3ewJIh2AR8KrghSy1DGM9ovN734bQF4%3D" --recursive=true
```

To learn more about SAS tokens and how to obtain one, see [Using shared access signatures (SAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1).

## Transfer files

After you've authenticated your identity or obtained a SAS token, you can begin transferring files.

To find example commands, see any of these articles.

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and blob storage](storage-use-azcopy-blobs.md)

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and file storage](storage-use-azcopy-files.md)

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and Amazon S3 buckets](storage-use-azcopy-s3.md)

- [Transfer data with AzCopy and Azure Stack storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-storage-transfer#azcopy)

## Use AzCopy in a script

Before you run that script, you have to sign-in interactively at least one time so that you can provide AzCopy with the credentials of your service principal.  Those credentials are stored in a secured and encrypted file so that your script doesn't have to provide that sensitive information. For examples, see the [Authenticate your service principal](#service-principal) section of this article.

Over time, the AzCopy [download link](#download-and-install-azcopy) will point to new versions of AzCopy. If your script downloads AzCopy, the script might stop working if a newer version of AzCopy modifies features that your script depends upon. 

To avoid these issues, obtain a static (un-changing) link to the current version of AzCopy. That way, your script downloads the same exact version of AzCopy each time that it runs.

To obtain the link, run this command:

| Operating system  | Command |
|--------|-----------|
| **Linux** | `curl -v https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux` |
| **Windows** | `(curl https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows -MaximumRedirection 0 -ErrorAction silentlycontinue).RawContent` |

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux, `--strip-components=1` on the `tar` command removes the top-level folder that contains the version name, and instead extracts the binary directly into the current folder. This allows the script to be updated with a new version of `azcopy` by only updating the `wget` URL.

The URL appears in the output of this command. Your script can then download AzCopy by using that URL.

| Operating system  | Command |
|--------|-----------|
| **Linux** | `wget -O azcopyv10.tar https://azcopyvnext.azureedge.net/release20190301/azcopy_linux_amd64_10.0.8.tar.gz tar -xf azcopyv10.tar --strip-components=1 ./azcopy` |
| **Windows** | `Invoke-WebRequest https://azcopyvnext.azureedge.net/release20190517/azcopy_windows_amd64_10.1.2.zip -OutFile azcopyv10.zip <<Unzip here>>` |

## Use AzCopy in Storage Explorer

If you want to leverage the performance advantages of AzCopy, but you prefer to use Storage Explorer rather than the command line to interact with your files, then enable AzCopy in Storage Explorer. 

In Storage Explorer, choose **Preview**->**Use AzCopy for Improved Blob Upload and Download**.

![Enable AzCopy as a transfer engine in Azure Storage Explorer](media/storage-use-azcopy-v10/enable-azcopy-storage-explorer.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> You don't have to enable this setting if you've enabled a hierarchical namespace on your storage account. That's because Storage Explorer automatically uses AzCopy on storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.  

Storage Explorer uses your account key to perform operations, so after you sign into Storage Explorer, you won't need to provide additional authorization credentials.
