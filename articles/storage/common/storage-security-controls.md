# Security controls for Azure Storage

This article documents the security controls built into Azure Storage.

[!INCLUDE [Security controls Header](../../../includes/security-controls-header.md)]

## Data protection

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Server-side encryption at rest: Microsoft-managed keys | Yes |  |
| Server-side encryption at rest: customer-managed keys (BYOK) | Yes | See [Storage Service Encryption using customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault](storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).|
| Column level encryption (Azure Data Services)| N/A |  |

| Network isolation and firewall support| Yes | |
| Forced tunneling support| N/A |  |

## Monitoring & logging

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Azure monitoring support (Log analytics, App insights, etc.)| Yes | Azure Monitor Metrics|
| Control and management plane logging and audit | Yes | Azure Activity Log |
| Data plane logging and audit| Yes | Azure Monitor Resource Logs |

## Identity

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Authentication| Yes | Azure Active Directory, Shared key, Shared access token. |
| Authorization| Yes | Support Authorization via RBAC, POSIX ACLs, and SAS Tokens |
