# Create an Azure Storage account

An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.

In this how-to article, you learn to create a storage account using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure?view=azure-cli-latest), or an [Azure Resource Manager template](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).  

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

None.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To create an Azure storage account with PowerShell, make sure you have installed Azure PowerShell module Az version 0.7 or later. For more information, see [Introducing the Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).

To find your current version, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-InstalledModule -Name "Az"
```

To install or upgrade Azure PowerShell, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps).

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can sign in to Azure and run Azure CLI commands in one of two ways:

- You can run CLI commands from within the Azure portal, in Azure Cloud Shell.
- You can install the CLI and run CLI commands locally.

### Use Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. The Azure CLI is pre-installed and configured to use with your account. Click the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu in the upper-right section of the Azure portal:

[![Cloud Shell](./media/storage-quickstart-create-account/cloud-shell-menu.png)](https://portal.azure.com)

The button launches an interactive shell that you can use to run the steps outlined in this how-to article:

[![Screenshot showing the Cloud Shell window in the portal](./media/storage-quickstart-create-account/cloud-shell.png)](https://portal.azure.com)

### Install the CLI locally

You can also install and use the Azure CLI locally. This how-to article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

# [Template](#tab/template)

None.

---

## Sign in to Azure

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Sign in to your Azure subscription with the `Connect-AzAccount` command and follow the on-screen directions to authenticate.

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To launch Azure Cloud Shell, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

To log into your local installation of the CLI, run the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

# [Template](#tab/template)

## Create a storage account

Now you are ready to create a storage account.

Every storage account must belong to an Azure resource group. A resource group is a logical container for grouping your Azure services. When you create a storage account, you have the option to either create a new resource group, or use an existing resource group. This article shows how to create a new resource group.

A **general-purpose v2** storage account provides access to all of the Azure Storage services: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The steps outlined here create a general-purpose v2 storage account, but the steps to create any type of storage account are similar.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

[!INCLUDE [storage-create-account-portal-include](../../../includes/storage-create-account-portal-include.md)]

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

First, create a new resource group with PowerShell using the [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) command:

```powershell
# put resource group in a variable so you can use the same group name going forward,
# without hard-coding it repeatedly
$resourceGroup = "storage-resource-group"
$location = "westus"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location
```

If you're not sure which region to specify for the `-Location` parameter, you can retrieve a list of supported regions for your subscription with the [Get-AzLocation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azlocation) command:

```powershell
Get-AzLocation | select Location
```

Next, create a general-purpose v2 storage account with read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) by using the [New-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/New-azStorageAccount) command. Remember that the name of your storage account must be unique across Azure, so replace the placeholder value in brackets with your own unique value:

```powershell
New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Name <account-name> `
  -Location $location `
  -SkuName Standard_RAGRS `
  -Kind StorageV2
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan to use [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), include `-EnableHierarchicalNamespace $True` in this list of parameters.

To create a general-purpose v2 storage account with a different replication option, substitute the desired value in the table below for the **SkuName** parameter.

|Replication option  |SkuName parameter  |
|---------|---------|
|Locally redundant storage (LRS)     |Standard_LRS         |
|Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)     |Standard_ZRS         |
|Geo-redundant storage (GRS)     |Standard_GRS         |
|Read-access geo-redundant storage (GRS)     |Standard_RAGRS         |
|Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)    |Standard_GZRS         |
|Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)    |Standard_RAGZRS         |

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

First, create a new resource group with Azure CLI using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create \
    --name storage-resource-group \
    --location westus
```

If you're not sure which region to specify for the `--location` parameter, you can retrieve a list of supported regions for your subscription with the [az account list-locations](/cli/azure/account#az_account_list) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az account list-locations \
    --query "[].{Region:name}" \
    --out table
```

Next, create a general-purpose v2 storage account with read-access geo-redundant storage by using the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_create) command. Remember that the name of your storage account must be unique across Azure, so replace the placeholder value in brackets with your own unique value:

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create \
    --name <account-name> \
    --resource-group storage-resource-group \
    --location westus \
    --sku Standard_RAGRS \
    --kind StorageV2
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan to use [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), include `--enable-hierarchical-namespace true` in this list of parameters. 

To create a general-purpose v2 storage account with a different replication option, substitute the desired value in the table below for the **sku** parameter.

|Replication option  |sku parameter  |
|---------|---------|
|Locally redundant storage (LRS)     |Standard_LRS         |
|Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)     |Standard_ZRS         |
|Geo-redundant storage (GRS)     |Standard_GRS         |
|Read-access geo-redundant storage (GRS)     |Standard_RAGRS         |
|Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)    |Standard_GZRS         |
|Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)    |Standard_RAGZRS         |

# [Template](#tab/template)

You can use either Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to deploy a Resource Manager template to create a storage account. The template used in this how-to article is from [Azure Resource Manager quickstart templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-storage-account-create/). To run the scripts, select **Try it** to open the Azure Cloud Shell. To paste the script, right-click the shell, and then select **Paste**.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Resource Group name"
$location = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the location (i.e. centralus)"

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location "$location"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json"
```

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the Resource Group name:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
echo "Enter the location (i.e. centralus):" &&
read location &&
az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
az group deployment create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-file "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json"
```

> [!NOTE]
> This template serves only as an example. There are many storage account settings that aren't configured as part of this template. For example, if you want to use [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), you would modify this template by setting the `isHnsEnabledad` property of the `StorageAccountPropertiesCreateParameters` object to `true`. 

To learn how to modify this template or create new ones, see:

- [Azure Resource Manager documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/).
- [Storage account template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.storage/allversions).
- [Additional storage account template samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Storage).

## Delete a storage account

Deleting a storage account deletes the entire account, including all data in the account, and cannot be undone.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to the storage account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click **Delete**.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To delete the storage account, use the [Remove-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/remove-azstorageaccount) command:

```powershell
Remove-AzStorageAccount -Name <storage-account> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group>
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To delete the storage account, use the [az storage account delete](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-delete) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account delete --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group>
```

# [Template](#tab/template)

To delete the storage account, use either Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$storageResourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the resource group name"
$storageAccountName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the storage account name"
Remove-AzStorageAccount -Name $storageAccountName -ResourceGroupName $storageResourceGroupName
```

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the resource group name:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
echo "Enter the storage account name:" &&
read storageAccountName &&
az storage account delete --name storageAccountName --resource-group resourceGroupName
```

---

Alternately, you can delete the resource group, which deletes the storage account and any other resources in that resource group. For more information about deleting a resource group, see [Delete resource group and resources](../../azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group.md).

> [!WARNING]
> It's not possible to restore a deleted storage account or retrieve any of the content that it contained before deletion. Be sure to back up anything you want to save before you delete the account. This also holds true for any resources in the account—once you delete a blob, table, queue, or file, it is permanently deleted.
>
> If you try to delete a storage account associated with an Azure virtual machine, you may get an error about the storage account still being in use. For help troubleshooting this error, see [Troubleshoot errors when you delete storage accounts](../common/storage-resource-manager-cannot-delete-storage-account-container-vhd.md).

## Next steps
