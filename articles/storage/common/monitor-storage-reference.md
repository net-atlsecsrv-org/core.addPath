# Azure Storage monitoring data reference

See [Monitoring Azure Storage](monitor-storage.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for Azure Storage.

## Metrics

The following tables list the platform metrics collected for Azure Storage. 

### Capacity metrics

Capacity metrics values are sent to Azure Monitor every hour. The values are refreshed daily. The time grain defines the time interval for which metrics values are presented. The supported time grain for all capacity metrics is one hour (PT1H).

Azure Storage provides the following capacity metrics in Azure Monitor.

### Transaction metrics

Transaction metrics are emitted on every request to a storage account from Azure Storage to Azure Monitor. In the case of no activity on your storage account, there will be no data on transaction metrics in the period. All transaction metrics are available at both account and service level (Blob storage, Table storage, Azure Files, and Queue storage). The time grain defines the time interval that metric values are presented. The supported time grains for all transaction metrics are PT1H and PT1M.

Azure Storage provides the following transaction metrics in Azure Monitor.

| Metric | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Transactions | The number of requests made to a storage service or the specified API operation. This number includes successful and failed requests, as well as requests that produced errors. <br/><br/> Unit: Count <br/> Aggregation Type: Total <br/> Applicable dimensions: ResponseType, GeoType, ApiName, and Authentication ([Definition](#metrics-dimensions))<br/> Value example: 1024 |

| Egress | The amount of egress data. This number includes egress from an external client into Azure Storage as well as egress within Azure. As a result, this number does not reflect billable egress. <br/><br/> Unit: Bytes <br/> Aggregation Type: Total <br/> Applicable dimensions: GeoType, ApiName, and Authentication ([Definition](#metrics-dimensions)) <br/> Value example: 1024 |
| SuccessServerLatency | The average time used to process a successful request by Azure Storage. This value does not include the network latency specified in SuccessE2ELatency. <br/><br/> Unit: Milliseconds <br/> Aggregation Type: Average <br/> Applicable dimensions: GeoType, ApiName, and Authentication ([Definition](#metrics-dimensions)) <br/> Value example: 1024 |
| SuccessE2ELatency | The average end-to-end latency of successful requests made to a storage service or the specified API operation. This value includes the required processing time within Azure Storage to read the request, send the response, and receive acknowledgment of the response. <br/><br/> Unit: Milliseconds <br/> Aggregation Type: Average <br/> Applicable dimensions: GeoType, ApiName, and Authentication ([Definition](#metrics-dimensions)) <br/> Value example: 1024 |
| Availability | The percentage of availability for the storage service or the specified API operation. Availability is calculated by taking the total billable requests value and dividing it by the number of applicable requests, including those requests that produced unexpected errors. All unexpected errors result in reduced availability for the storage service or the specified API operation. <br/><br/> Unit: Percent <br/> Aggregation Type: Average <br/> Applicable dimensions: GeoType, ApiName, and Authentication ([Definition](#metrics-dimensions)) <br/> Value example: 99.99 |

## Metrics dimensions

Azure Storage supports following dimensions for metrics in Azure Monitor.

| Dimension Name | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **BlobType** | The type of blob for Blob metrics only. The supported values are **BlockBlob**, **PageBlob**, and **Azure Data Lake Storage**. Append Blob is included in BlockBlob. |
| **BlobTier** | Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. See more in [Azure Storage blob tier](../blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers.md). The supported values include: <br/> <li>**Hot**: Hot tier</li> <li>**Cool**: Cool tier</li> <li>**Archive**: Archive tier</li> <li>**Premium**: Premium tier for block blob</li> <li>**P4/P6/P10/P15/P20/P30/P40/P50/P60**: Tier types for premium page blob</li> <li>**Standard**: Tier type for standard page Blob</li> <li>**Untiered**: Tier type for general purpose v1 storage account</li> |
| **GeoType** | Transaction from Primary or Secondary cluster. The available values include **Primary** and **Secondary**. It applies to Read Access Geo Redundant Storage(RA-GRS) when reading objects from secondary tenant. |
| **ResponseType** | Transaction response type. The available values include: <br/><br/> <li>**ServerOtherError**: All other server-side errors except described ones </li> <li>**ServerBusyError**: Authenticated request that returned an HTTP 503 status code. </li> <li>**ServerTimeoutError**: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code. The timeout occurred due to a server error. </li> <li>**AuthorizationError**: Authenticated request that failed due to unauthorized access of data or an authorization failure. </li> <li>**NetworkError**: Authenticated request that failed due to network errors. Most commonly occurs when a client prematurely closes a connection before timeout expiration. </li><li>**ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError**: The request is throttled on bandwidth for exceeding [storage account scalability limits](scalability-targets-standard-account.md).</li><li>**ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError**: The request is throttled on request rate for exceeding [storage account scalability limits](scalability-targets-standard-account.md).<li>**ClientThrottlingError**: Other client-side throttling error. ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError and ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError are excluded.</li> <li>**ClientTimeoutError**: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code. If the client's network timeout or the request timeout is set to a lower value than expected by the storage service, it is an expected timeout. Otherwise, it is reported as a ServerTimeoutError. </li> <li>**ClientOtherError**: All other client-side errors except described ones. </li> <li>**Success**: Successful request</li> <li> **SuccessWithThrottling**: Successful request when a SMB client gets throttled in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.</li> |
| **ApiName** | The name of operation. For example: <br/> <li>**CreateContainer**</li> <li>**DeleteBlob**</li> <li>**GetBlob**</li> For all operation names, see [document](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages). |
| **Authentication** | Authentication type used in transactions. The available values include: <br/> <li>**AccountKey**: The transaction is authenticated with storage account key.</li> <li>**SAS**: The transaction is authenticated with shared access signatures.</li> <li>**OAuth**: The transaction is authenticated with OAuth access tokens.</li> <li>**Anonymous**: The transaction is requested anonymously. It doesn’t include preflight requests.</li> <li>**AnonymousPreflight**: The transaction is preflight request.</li> |

For the metrics supporting dimensions, you need to specify the dimension value to see the corresponding metrics values. For example, if you look at  **Transactions** value for successful responses, you need to filter the **ResponseType** dimension with **Success**. Or if you look at **BlobCount** value for Block Blob, you need to filter the **BlobType** dimension with **BlockBlob**.

## Resource logs (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor is in public preview, and is available for preview testing in all public cloud regions. To enroll in the preview, see [this page](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRxW65f1VQyNCuBHMIMBV8qlUM0E0MFdPRFpOVTRYVklDSE1WUTcyTVAwOC4u).  This preview enables logs for blobs (including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), files, queues, tables, premium storage accounts in general-purpose v1 and general-purpose v2 storage accounts. Classic storage accounts are not supported.

The following table lists the properties for Azure Storage resource logs when they're collected in Azure Monitor Logs or Azure Storage. The properties describe the operation, the service, and the type of authorization that was used to perform the operation.
