# Using Private Endpoints for Azure Storage (Preview)

You can use [Private Endpoints](../../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) for your Azure Storage accounts to allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access data over a [Private Link](../../private-link/private-link-overview.md). The private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet address space for your storage account service. Network traffic between the clients on the VNet and the storage account traverses over the VNet and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.

Using private endpoints for your storage account enables you to:
- Secure your storage account by configuring the storage firewall to block all connections on the public endpoint for the storage service.
- Increases security for the virtual network (VNet), by enabling you to block exfiltration of data from the VNet.
- Securely connect to storage accounts from on-premises networks that connect to the VNet using [VPN](../../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) or [ExpressRoutes](../../expressroute/expressroute-locations.md) with private-peering.

## Conceptual Overview
![Private Endpoints for Azure Storage Overview](media/storage-private-endpoints/storage-private-endpoints-overview.jpg)

A Private Endpoint is a special network interface for an Azure service in your [Virtual Network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) (VNet). When you create a private endpoint for your storage account, it provides secure connectivity between clients on your VNet and your storage. The private endpoint is assigned an IP address from the IP address range of your VNet. The connection between the private endpoint and the storage service uses a secure private link.

Applications in the VNet can connect to the storage service over the private endpoint seamlessly, using the same connection strings and authorization mechanisms that they would use otherwise. Private endpoints can be used with all protocols supported by the storage account, including REST and SMB.

When you create a private endpoint for a storage service in your VNet, a consent request is sent for approval to the storage account owner. If the user requesting the creation of the private endpoint is also an owner of the storage account, this consent request is automatically approved.

Storage account owners can manage consent requests and the private endpoints, through the 'Private Endpoints' tab for the storage account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

> [!TIP]
> If you want to restrict access to your storage account through the private endpoint only, configure the storage firewall to deny all access through the public endpoint.

You can secure your storage account to only accept connections from your  VNet, by [configuring the storage firewall](storage-network-security.md#change-the-default-network-access-rule) to deny access through its public endpoint by default. You don't need a firewall rule to allow traffic from a VNet that has a private endpoint, since the storage firewall only controls access through the public endpoint. Private endpoints instead rely on the consent flow for granting subnets access to the storage service.

### Private Endpoints for Storage Service

When creating the private endpoint, you must specify the storage account and the storage service to which it connects. You need a separate private endpoint for each storage service in a storage account that you need to access, namely [Blobs](../blobs/storage-blobs-overview.md), [Data Lake Storage Gen2](../blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction.md), [Files](../files/storage-files-introduction.md), [Queues](../queues/storage-queues-introduction.md), [Tables](../tables/table-storage-overview.md), or [Static Websites](../blobs/storage-blob-static-website.md).

> [!TIP]
> Create a separate private endpoint for the secondary instance of the storage service for better read performance on RA-GRS accounts.

For read availability on a [read-access geo redundant storage account](storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage), you need separate private endpoints for both the primary and secondary instances of the service. You don't need to create a private endpoint for the secondary instance for failover. The private endpoint will automatically connect to the new primary instance after failover.

#### Resources

For more detailed information on creating a private endpoint for your storage account, refer to the following articles:

- [Connect privately to a storage account from the Storage Account experience in the Azure portal](../../private-link/create-private-endpoint-storage-portal.md)
- [Create a private endpoint using the Private Link Center in the Azure portal](../../private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal.md)
- [Create a private endpoint using Azure CLI](../../private-link/create-private-endpoint-cli.md)
- [Create a private endpoint using Azure PowerShell](../../private-link/create-private-endpoint-powershell.md)

### DNS changes for Private Endpoints

Clients on a VNet can use the same connection string for the storage account even when using a private endpoint.

When you create a private endpoint, we update the DNS CNAME resource record for that storage endpoint to an alias in a subdomain with the prefix '*privatelink*'. By default, we also create a [private DNS zone](../../dns/private-dns-overview.md) attached to the VNet. This private DNS zone corresponds to the subdomain with the prefix '*privatelink*', and contains the DNS A resource records for the private endpoints.

When you resolve the storage endpoint URL from outside the VNet with the private endpoint, it resolves to the public endpoint of the storage service. When resolved from the VNet hosting the private endpoint, the storage endpoint URL resolves to the private endpoint's IP address.

For the illustrated example above, the DNS resource records for the storage account 'StorageAccountA', when resolved from outside the VNet hosting the private endpoint, will be:

| Name                                                  | Type  | Value                                                 |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| ``StorageAccountA.blob.core.windows.net``             | CNAME | ``StorageAccountA.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`` |
| ``StorageAccountA.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`` | CNAME | \<storage service public endpoint\>                   |
| \<storage service public endpoint\>                   | A     | \<storage service public IP address\>                 |

As previously mentioned, you can deny all access through the public endpoint using the storage firewall.

The DNS resource records for StorageAccountA, when resolved by a client in the VNet hosting the private endpoint, will be:

| Name                                                  | Type  | Value                                                 |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| ``StorageAccountA.blob.core.windows.net``             | CNAME | ``StorageAccountA.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`` |
| ``StorageAccountA.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`` | A     | 10.1.1.5                                              |

This approach enables access to the storage account using the same connection string from the VNet hosting the private endpoints, as well as clients outside the VNet. You can use the storage firewall to deny access to all clients outside the VNet.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a custom or on-premises DNS server, you should use the 'privatelink' subdomain of the storage service to configure DNS resource records for the private endpoints.

The recommended DNS zone names for private endpoints for storage services are:

| Storage service       | Zone name                          |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Blob service          | privatelink.blob.core.windows.net  |
| Data Lake File System | privatelink.dfe.core.windows.net   |
| File service          | privatelink.file.core.windows.net  |
| Queue service         | privatelink.queue.core.windows.net |
| Table service         | privatelink.table.core.windows.net |
| Static Websites       | privatelink.web.core.windows.net   |

## Known Issues

### Copy Blob failures

Currently, [Copy Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/Copy-Blob) commands issued to storage accounts accessed through private endpoints fail when the source storage account is protected by a firewall.

### Subnets with Service Endpoints
During the preview, you can't create a private endpoint in a subnet that has service endpoints. You can create separate subnets in the same VNet for service endpoints and private endpoints.

### Storage access constraints for clients in VNets with Private Endpoints

Clients in VNets with existing private endpoints face constraints when accessing other storage accounts that have private endpoints. For instance, suppose a VNet N1 has a private endpoint for a storage account A1 for, say, the blob service. If storage account A2 has a private endpoint in a VNet N2 for the blob service, then clients in VNet N1 must also access the blob service of account A2 using a private endpoint. If storage account A2 does not have any private endpoints for the blob service, then clients in VNet N1 can access its blob service without a private endpoint.

This constraint is a result of the DNS changes made when account A2 creates a private endpoint.

### Network Security Group rules on subnets with private endpoints

[Network Security Group](../../virtual-network/security-overview.md) (NSG) rules cannot be configured for subnets with private endpoints, at this time. A limited workaround for this issue is to implement your access rules for private endpoints on the source subnets, though this approach may require a higher management overhead.
