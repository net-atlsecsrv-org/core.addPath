# Known issues with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

This article lists the features and tools that are not yet supported or only partially supported with storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2).

<a id="blob-apis-disabled" />

## Blob storage APIs

Blob storage APIs are disabled to prevent inadvertent data access issues that could arise because Blob Storage APIs aren't yet interoperable with Azure Data Lake Gen2 APIs.

### What to do with existing tools, applications, and services

If any of these use Blob APIs, and you want to use them to work with all of the content that you upload to your account, then don't enable a hierarchical namespace on your Blob storage account until Blob APIs become interoperable with Azure Data Lake Gen2 APIs.

Using a storage account without a hierarchical namespace means you then don't have access to Data Lake Storage Gen2 specific features, such as directory and file system access control lists.

### What to do with unmanaged Virtual Machine (VM) disks

These depend upon the disabled Blob Storage APIs, so if you want to enable a hierarchical namespace on a storage account, consider placing them into a storage account that doesn't have the hierarchical namespace feature enabled.

### What to do if you used Blob APIs to load data before Blob APIs were disabled

If you used these APIs to load data before they were disabled, and you have a production requirement to access that data, then please contact Microsoft Support with the following information:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Subscription ID (the GUID, not the name).
> * Storage account name(s).
> * Whether you are actively impacted in production, and if so, for which storage accounts?.
> * Even if you are not actively impacted in production, tell us whether you need this data to be copied to another storage account for some reason, and if so, why?

Under these circumstances, we can restore access to the Blob API for a limited period of time so that you can copy this data into a storage account that doesn't have the hierarchical namespace feature enabled.

## All other features and tools

The following table lists all other features and tools that are not yet supported or only partially supported with storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2).

| Feature / Tool    | More information    |
|--------|-----------|
| **APIs for Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage accounts** | Partially supported <br><br>You can use Data Lake Storage Gen2 **REST** APIs, but APIs in other Blob SDKs such as the .NET, Java, Python SDKs are not yet available.|
| **AzCopy** | Version-specific support <br><br>Use only the latest version of AzCopy ([AzCopy v10](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ftables%2ftoc.json)). Earlier versions of AzCopy such as AzCopy v8.1, are not supported.|
| **Azure Blob storage Lifecycle management policies** | Not yet supported |
| **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)** | Not yet supported|
| **Azure Event Grid** | Not yet supported |
| **Azure search** |Not yet supported|
| **Azure Storage Explorer** | Version-specific support <br><br>Use only version `1.6.0` or higher. <br>Version `1.6.0` is available as a [free download](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/).|
| **Blob container ACLs** |Not yet supported|
| **Blobfuse** |Not yet supported|
| **Custom domains** |Not yet supported|
| **Diagnostic logs** |Not yet supported|
| **File System Explorer** | Limited support |
| **Immutable storage** |Not yet supported <br><br>Immutable storage gives the ability to store data in a [WORM (Write Once, Read Many)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-immutable-storage) state.|
| **Object-level tiers** |Not yet supported <br><br>For example: Premium, Hot, Cold, and Archive tiers.|
| **Powershell and CLI support** | Limited functionality <br><br>You can create an account by using Powershell or the CLI. You can't perform operations or set access control lists on file systems, directories, and files.|
| **Static websites** |Not yet supported <br><br>Specifically, the ability to serve files to [Static websites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website).|
| **Third party applications** | Limited support <br><br>Third party applications that use REST APIs to work will continue to work if you use them with Data Lake Storage Gen2. <br>If you have an application that uses Blob APIs, that application will most likely have issues if you use that application with Data Lake Storage Gen2. To learn more, see the [Blob storage APIs are disabled for Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage accounts](#blob-apis-disabled) section of this article.|
| **Versioning features** |Not yet supported <br><br>This includes [snapshots](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/creating-a-snapshot-of-a-blob) and [soft delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete).|
