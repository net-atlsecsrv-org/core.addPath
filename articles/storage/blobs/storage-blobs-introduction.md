# Introduction to Azure Blob storage

[!INCLUDE [storage-blob-concepts-include](../../../includes/storage-blob-concepts-include.md)]

## Blob storage resources

Blob storage offers three types of resources:

- The **storage account**
- A **container** in the storage account
- A **blob** in a container

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.

![Diagram showing the relationship between a storage account, containers, and blobs](./media/storage-blobs-introduction/blob1.png)

### Storage accounts

A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account.

For example, if your storage account is named *mystorageaccount*, then the default endpoint for Blob storage is:

```
http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
```

To create a storage account, see [Create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md). To learn more about storage accounts, see [Azure storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).

### Containers

A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.

> [!NOTE]
> The container name must be lowercase. For more information about naming containers, see [Naming and Referencing Containers, Blobs, and Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-and-Referencing-Containers--Blobs--and-Metadata).

### Blobs

Azure Storage supports three types of blobs:

- **Block blobs** store text and binary data. Block blobs are made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually. Block blobs store up to about 4.75 TiB of data. Larger block blobs are available in preview, up to about 190.7 TiB
- **Append blobs** are made up of blocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are ideal for scenarios such as logging data from virtual machines.
- **Page blobs** store random access files up to 8 TB in size. Page blobs store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for Azure virtual machines. For more information about page blobs, see [Overview of Azure page blobs](storage-blob-pageblob-overview.md)

For more information about the different types of blobs, see [Understanding Block Blobs, Append Blobs, and Page Blobs](/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs).

## Move data to Blob storage

A number of solutions exist for migrating existing data to Blob storage:

- **AzCopy** is an easy-to-use command-line tool for Windows and Linux that copies data to and from Blob storage, across containers, or across storage accounts. For more information about AzCopy, see [Transfer data with the AzCopy v10](../common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md).
- The **Azure Storage Data Movement library** is a .NET library for moving data between Azure Storage services. The AzCopy utility is built with the Data Movement library. For more information, see the [reference documentation](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.storage.datamovement) for the Data Movement library.
- **Azure Data Factory** supports copying data to and from Blob storage by using the account key, a shared access signature, a service principal, or managed identities for Azure resources. For more information, see [Copy data to or from Azure Blob storage by using Azure Data Factory](../../data-factory/connector-azure-blob-storage.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).
- **Blobfuse** is a virtual file system driver for Azure Blob storage. You can use blobfuse to access your existing block blob data in your Storage account through the Linux file system. For more information, see [How to mount Blob storage as a file system with blobfuse](storage-how-to-mount-container-linux.md).
- **Azure Data Box** service is available to transfer on-premises data to Blob storage when large datasets or network constraints make uploading data over the wire unrealistic. Depending on your data size, you can request [Azure Data Box Disk](../../databox/data-box-disk-overview.md), [Azure Data Box](../../databox/data-box-overview.md), or [Azure Data Box Heavy](../../databox/data-box-heavy-overview.md) devices from Microsoft. You can then copy your data to those devices and ship them back to Microsoft to be uploaded into Blob storage.
- The **Azure Import/Export service** provides a way to import or export large amounts of data to and from your storage account using hard drives that you provide. For more information, see [Use the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service to transfer data to Blob storage](../common/storage-import-export-service.md).
