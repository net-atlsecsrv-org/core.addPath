# Blob storage features available in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Blob Storage features such as [diagnostic logging](../common/storage-analytics-logging.md), [access tiers](storage-blob-storage-tiers.md), and [Blob Storage lifecycle management policies](storage-lifecycle-management-concepts.md) now work with accounts that have a hierarchical namespace. Therefore, you can enable hierarchical namespaces on your Blob storage accounts without losing access to these features.

This table lists the Blob storage features that you can use with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. The items that appear in these tables will change over time as support continues to expand.
