# Encryption scopes for Blob storage (preview)

Encryption scopes provide the ability to manage encryption at the level of the container or an individual blob. You can use encryption scopes to create secure boundaries between data that resides in the same storage account but belongs to different customers.

By default, a storage account is encrypted with a key that is scoped to the entire storage account. With an encryption scope, you can specify that one or more containers are encrypted with a key that is scoped only to those containers.

You can choose to use either Microsoft-managed keys or customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. Different encryption scopes on the same storage account can use either Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys.

After you have created an encryption scope, you can specify that encryption scope on a request to create a container or a blob. For more information about how to create an encryption scope, see [Create and manage encryption scopes (preview)](encryption-scope-manage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Encryption scopes are not supported with read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) accounts during preview.

> The encryption scopes preview is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) are not currently available.

> To avoid unexpected costs, be sure to disable any encryption scopes that you do not currently need.

## Create a container or blob with an encryption scope

Blobs that are created under an encryption scope are encrypted with the key specified for that scope. You can specify an encryption scope for an individual blob when you create the blob, or you can specify a default encryption scope when you create a container. When a default encryption scope is specified at the level of a container, all blobs in that container are encrypted with the key associated with the default scope.

When you create a blob in a container that has a default encryption scope, you can specify an encryption scope that overrides the default encryption scope if the container is configured to allow overrides of the default encryption scope. To prevent overrides of the default encryption scope, configure the container to deny overrides for an individual blob.

Read operations on a blob that belongs to an encryption scope happen transparently, so long as the encryption scope is not disabled.

## Disable an encryption scope

When you disable an encryption scope, any subsequent read or write operations made with the encryption scope will fail with HTTP error code 403 (Forbidden). If you re-enable the encryption scope, read and write operations will proceed normally again.

When an encryption scope is disabled, you are no longer billed for it. Disable any encryption scopes that are not needed to avoid unnecessary charges.

If your encryption scope is protected with customer-managed keys, then you can also delete the associated key in the key vault in order to disable the encryption scope. Keep in mind that customer-managed keys are protected by soft delete and purge protection in the key vault, and a deleted key is subject to the behavior defined for by those properties. For more information, see one of the following topics in the Azure Key Vault documentation:

- [How to use soft-delete with PowerShell](../../key-vault/general/soft-delete-powershell.md)
- [How to use soft-delete with CLI](../../key-vault/general/soft-delete-cli.md)

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to delete an encryption scope.
