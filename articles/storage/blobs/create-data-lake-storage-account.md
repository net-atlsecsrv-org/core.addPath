# Create a storage account to use with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

To use Data Lake Storage Gen2 capabilities, create a storage account that has a hierarchical namespace.

## Choose a storage account type

Data Lake Storage capabilities are supported in the following types of storage accounts:

- General-purpose v2
- BlockBlobStorage

For information about how to choose between them, see [storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md).

## Create a storage account with a hierarchical namespace

Create either a [general-purpose V2 account](../common/storage-account-create.md) or a [BlockBlobStorage](storage-blob-create-account-block-blob.md) account with the **Hierarchical namespace** setting enabled.

Unlock Data Lake Storage capabilities when you create the account by enabling the **Hierarchical namespace** setting in the **Advanced** tab of the **Create storage account** page. You must enable this setting when you create the account. You can't enable it afterwards.

The following image shows this setting in the **Create storage account** page.

If you have an existing storage account that you want to use with Data Lake Storage, and the hierarchical namespace setting is disabled, you must migrate the data to a new storage account that has the setting enabled.
