# Use Python for files & ACLs in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (preview)

This article shows you how to use Python to create and manage directories, files, and permissions in storage accounts that has hierarchical namespace (HNS) enabled. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Data Lake Storage client library for Python is currently in public preview.

[Package (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-file-datalake/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-datalake/samples) | [API reference](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-storage-file-datalake/12.0.0b5/index.html) | [Gen1 to Gen2 mapping](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-datalake/GEN1_GEN2_MAPPING.md) | [Give Feedback](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)

## Prerequisites

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * An Azure subscription. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
> * A storage account that has hierarchical namespace (HNS) enabled. Follow [these](data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account.md) instructions to create one.

## Set up your project

Install the Azure Data Lake Storage client library for Python by using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```
pip install azure-storage-file-datalake --pre
```

Add these import statements to the top of your code file.

```python
import os, uuid, sys
from azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClient
```

## Connect to the account

To use the snippets in this article, you'll need to create a **DataLakeServiceClient** instance that represents the storage account. The easiest way to get one is to use an account key. 

This example uses an account key to create a **DataLakeServiceClient** instance that represents the storage account. 

```python
try:  
    global service_client
        
    service_client = DataLakeServiceClient(account_url="{}://{}.dfs.core.windows.net".format(
        "https", storage_account_name), credential=storage_account_key)
    
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```
 
- Replace the `storage_account_name` placeholder value with the name of your storage account.

- Replace the `storage-account-key` placeholder value with your storage account access key.

## Create a file system

A file system acts as a container for your files. You can create one by calling the **FileSystemDataLakeServiceClient.create_file_system** method.

This example creates a file system named `my-file-system`.

```python
def create_file_system():
    try:
        global file_system_client

        file_system_client = service_client.create_file_system(file_system="my-file-system")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(e) 
```


## Create a directory

Create a directory reference by calling the **FileSystemClient.create_directory** method.

This example adds a directory named `my-directory` to a file system. 

```python
def create_directory():
    try:
        file_system_client.create_directory("my-directory")
    
    except Exception as e:
     print(e) 
```

## Rename or move a directory

Rename or move a directory by calling the **DataLakeDirectoryClient.rename_directory** method. Pass the path of the desired directory a parameter. 

This example renames a sub-directory to the name `my-subdirectory-renamed`.

```python
def rename_directory():
    try:
       
       file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")
       directory_client = file_system_client.get_directory_client("my-directory")
       
       new_dir_name = "my-directory-renamed"
       directory_client.rename_directory(rename_destination=directory_client.file_system_name + '/' + new_dir_name)

    except Exception as e:
     print(e) 
```

## Delete a directory

Delete a directory by calling the **DataLakeDirectoryClient.delete_directory** method.

This example deletes a directory named `my-directory`.  

```python
def delete_directory():
    try:
        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")
        directory_client = file_system_client.get_directory_client("my-directory")

        directory_client.delete_directory()
    except Exception as e:
     print(e) 
```

## Manage directory permissions

Get the access control list (ACL) of a directory by calling the **DataLakeDirectoryClient.get_access_control** method and set the ACL by calling the **DataLakeDirectoryClient.set_access_control** method.

This example gets and sets the ACL of a directory named `my-directory`. The string `rwxr-xrw-` gives the owning user read, write, and execute permissions, gives the owning group only read and execute permissions, and gives all others read and write permission.

```python
def manage_directory_permissions():
    try:
        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")

        directory_client = file_system_client.get_directory_client("my-directory")
        
        acl_props = directory_client.get_access_control()
        
        print(acl_props['permissions'])
        
        new_dir_permissions = "rwxr-xrw-"
        
        directory_client.set_access_control(permissions=new_dir_permissions)
        
        acl_props = directory_client.get_access_control()
        
        print(acl_props['permissions'])
    
    except Exception as e:
     print(e) 
```

## Upload a file to a directory 

First, create a file reference in the target directory by creating an instance of the **DataLakeFileClient** class. Upload a file by calling the **DataLakeFileClient.append_data** method. Make sure to complete the upload by calling the **DataLakeFileClient.flush_data** method.

This example uploads a text file to a directory named `my-directory`.   

```python
def upload_file_to_directory():
    try:

        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")

        directory_client = file_system_client.get_directory_client("my-directory")
        
        file_client = directory_client.create_file("uploaded-file.txt")
        local_file = open("C:\\file-to-upload.txt",'r')

        file_contents = local_file.read()

        file_client.append_data(data=file_contents, offset=0, length=len(file_contents))

        file_client.flush_data(len(file_contents))

    except Exception as e:
      print(e) 
```

## Manage file permissions

Get the access control list (ACL) of a file by calling the **DataLakeFileClient.get_access_control** method and set the ACL by calling the **DataLakeFileClient.set_access_control** method.

This example gets and sets the ACL of a file named `my-file.txt`. The string `rwxr-xrw-` gives the owning user read, write, and execute permissions, gives the owning group only read and execute permissions, and gives all others read and write permission.

```python
def manage_file_permissions():
    try:
        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")

        directory_client = file_system_client.get_directory_client("my-directory")
        
        file_client = directory_client.get_file_client("uploaded-file.txt")

        acl_props = file_client.get_access_control()
        
        print(acl_props['permissions'])
        
        new_file_permissions = "rwxr-xrw-"
        
        file_client.set_access_control(permissions=new_file_permissions)
        
        acl_props = file_client.get_access_control()
        
        print(acl_props['permissions'])

    except Exception as e:
     print(e) 
```

## Download from a directory 

Open a local file for writing. Then, create a **DataLakeFileClient** instance that represents the file that you want to download. Call the **DataLakeFileClient.read_file** to read bytes from the file and then write those bytes to the local file. 

```python
def download_file_from_directory():
    try:
        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")

        directory_client = file_system_client.get_directory_client("my-directory")
        
        local_file = open("C:\\file-to-download.txt",'wb')

        file_client = directory_client.get_file_client("uploaded-file.txt")

        downloaded_bytes = file_client.read_file()

        local_file.write(downloaded_bytes)

        local_file.close()

    except Exception as e:
     print(e)
```
## List directory contents

List directory contents by calling the **FileSystemClient.get_paths** method, and then enumerating through the results.

This example, prints the path of each subdirectory and file that is located in a directory named `my-directory`.

```python
def list_directory_contents():
    try:
        
        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="my-file-system")

        paths = file_system_client.get_paths(path="my-directory")

        for path in paths:
            print(path.name + '\n')

    except Exception as e:
     print(e) 
```
