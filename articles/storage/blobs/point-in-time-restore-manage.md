# Enable and manage point-in-time restore for block blobs (preview)

You can use point-in-time restore (preview) to restore block blobs to their state at an earlier point in time. This article describes how to enable point-in-time restore for a storage account with PowerShell. It also shows how to perform a restore operation with PowerShell.

For more information and to learn how to register for the preview, see [Point-in-time restore for block blobs (preview)](point-in-time-restore-overview.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> Point-in-time restore supports restoring operations on block blobs only. Operations on containers cannot be restored. If you delete a container from the storage account by calling the [Delete Container](/rest/api/storageservices/delete-container) operation during the point-in-time restore preview, that container cannot be restored with a restore operation. During the preview, instead of deleting a container, delete individual blobs if you may want to restore them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The point-in-time restore preview is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) are not currently available.

## Install the preview module

To configure Azure point-in-time restore with PowerShell, first install the Az.Storage preview module version 1.14.1-preview or later. Using the latest preview version is recommended, but point-in-time restore is supported in version 1.14.1-preview and later. Remove any other versions of the Az.Storage module.

The following command installs Az.Storage [2.0.1-preview](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Storage/2.0.1-preview) module:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.Storage -RequiredVersion 2.0.1-preview -AllowPrerelease
```

The above command requires Version 2.2.4.1 or greater of PowerShellGet to install. To determine what version you currently have loaded:
```powershell
Get-Module PowerShellGet
```
For more information about installing Azure PowerShell, see [Install Azure PowerShell with PowerShellGet](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## Enable and configure point-in-time restore

Before you enable and configure point-in-time restore, enable its prerequisites for the storage account: soft delete, change feed, and blob versioning. For more information about enabling each of these features, see these articles:

- [Enable soft delete for blobs](soft-delete-enable.md)
- [Enable and disable the change feed](storage-blob-change-feed.md#enable-and-disable-the-change-feed)
- [Enable and manage blob versioning](versioning-enable.md)

To configure Azure point-in-time restore with PowerShell, call the Enable-AzStorageBlobRestorePolicy command. The following example enables soft delete and sets the soft-delete retention period, enables change feed, and then enables point-in-time restore. Before running the example, use the Azure portal or an Azure Resource Manager template to also enable blob versioning.

When running the example, remember to replace the values in angle brackets with your own values:

```powershell
# Sign in to your Azure account.
Connect-AzAccount

# Set resource group and account variables.
$rgName = "<resource-group>"
$accountName = "<storage-account>"

# Enable soft delete with a retention of 6 days.
Enable-AzStorageBlobDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -RetentionDays 6

# Enable change feed.
Update-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -EnableChangeFeed $true

# Enable point-in-time restore with a retention period of 5 days.
# The retention period for point-in-time restore must be at least one day less than that set for soft delete.
Enable-AzStorageBlobRestorePolicy -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -RestoreDays 5

# View the service settings.
Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName
```

## Perform a restore operation

To initiate a restore operation, call the **Restore-AzStorageBlobRange** command, specifying the restore point as a UTC **DateTime** value. You can specify lexicographical ranges of blobs to restore, or omit a range to restore all blobs in all containers in the storage account. Up to 10 lexicographical ranges are supported per restore operation. Page blobs and append blobs are not included in the restore. The restore operation may take several minutes to complete.

Keep in mind the following rules when specifying a range of blobs to restore:

- The container pattern specified for the start range and end range must include a minimum of three characters. The forward slash (/) that is used to separate a container name from a blob name does not count toward this minimum.
- Up to 10 ranges can be specified per restore operation.
- Wildcard characters are not supported. They are treated as standard characters.
- You can restore blobs in the `$root` and `$web` containers by explicitly specifying them in a range passed to a restore operation. The `$root` and `$web` containers are restored only if they are explicitly specified. Other system containers cannot restored.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you perform a restore operation, Azure Storage blocks data operations on the blobs in the ranges being restored for the duration of the operation. Read, write, and delete operations are blocked in the primary location. For this reason, operations such as listing containers in the Azure portal may not perform as expected while the restore operation is underway.
>
> Read operations from the secondary location may proceed during the restore operation if the storage account is geo-replicated.

### Restore all containers in the account

To restore all containers and blobs in the storage account, call the **Restore-AzStorageBlobRange** command, omitting the `-BlobRestoreRange` parameter. The following example restores containers in the storage account to their state 12 hours before the present moment:

```powershell
# Specify -TimeToRestore as a UTC value
Restore-AzStorageBlobRange -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -TimeToRestore (Get-Date).AddHours(-12)
```

### Restore a single range of block blobs

To restore a range of blobs, call the **Restore-AzStorageBlobRange** command and specify a lexicographical range of container and blob names for the `-BlobRestoreRange` parameter. The start of the range is in inclusive, and the end of the range is exclusive.

For example, to restore the blobs in a single container named *sample-container*, you can specify a range that starts with *sample-container* and ends with *sample-container1*. There is no requirement for the containers named in the start and end ranges to exist. Because the end of the range is exclusive, even if the storage account includes a container named *sample-container1*, only the container named *sample-container* will be restored:

```powershell
$range = New-AzStorageBlobRangeToRestore -StartRange sample-container -EndRange sample-container1
```

To specify a subset of blobs in a container to restore, use a forward slash (/) to separate the container name from the blob pattern. For example, the following range selects blobs in a single container whose names begin with the letters *d* through *f*:

```powershell
$range = New-AzStorageBlobRangeToRestore -StartRange sample-container/d -EndRange sample-container/g
```

Next, provide the range to the **Restore-AzStorageBlobRange** command. Specify the restore point by providing a UTC **DateTime** value for the `-TimeToRestore` parameter. The following example restores blobs in the specified range to their state 3 days before the present moment:

```powershell
# Specify -TimeToRestore as a UTC value
Restore-AzStorageBlobRange -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -BlobRestoreRange $range `
    -TimeToRestore (Get-Date).AddDays(-3)
```

### Restore multiple ranges of block blobs

To restore multiple ranges of block blobs, specify an array of ranges for the `-BlobRestoreRange` parameter. Up to 10 ranges are supported per restore operation. The following example specifies two ranges to restore the complete contents of *container1* and *container4*:

```powershell
# Specify a range that includes the complete contents of container1.
$range1 = New-AzStorageBlobRangeToRestore -StartRange container1 -EndRange container2
# Specify a range that includes the complete contents of container4.
$range2 = New-AzStorageBlobRangeToRestore -StartRange container4 -EndRange container5

Restore-AzStorageBlobRange -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -TimeToRestore (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-30) `
    -BlobRestoreRange @($range1, $range2)
```

### Restore block blobs asynchronously

To run a restore operation asynchronously, add the `-AsJob` parameter to the call to **Restore-AzStorageBlobRange** and store the result of the call in a variable. The **Restore-AzStorageBlobRange** command returns an object of type **AzureLongRunningJob**. You can check the **State** property of this object to determine whether the restore operation has completed. The value of the **State** property may be **Running** or **Completed**.

The following example shows how to call a restore operation asynchronously:

```powershell
$job = Restore-AzStorageBlobRange -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -StorageAccountName $accountName `
    -TimeToRestore (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-5) `
    -AsJob

# Check the state of the job.
$job.State
```

To wait on the completion of the restore operation after it is running, call the [Wait-Job](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/wait-job) command, as shown in the following example:

```powershell
$job | Wait-Job
```

## Known issues
- For a subset of restores where append blobs are present, the restore will fail. For now, please do not perform restores if append blobs are present in the account.
