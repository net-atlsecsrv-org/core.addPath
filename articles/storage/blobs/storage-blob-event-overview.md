# Reacting to Blob storage events

Azure Storage events allow applications to react to the creation and deletion of blobs using modern serverless architectures. It does so without the need for complicated code or expensive and inefficient polling services.  Instead, events are pushed through [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/) to subscribers such as [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/), or even to your own custom http listener, and you only pay for what you use.

Blob storage events are reliably sent to the Event grid service which provides reliable delivery services to your applications through rich retry policies and dead-letter delivery. To learn more, see [Event Grid message delivery and retry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/delivery-and-retry).

Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file-oriented workflow.  Asynchronous file uploads are a great fit for events.  When changes are infrequent, but your scenario requires immediate responsiveness, event-based architecture can be especially efficient.

Take a look at [Route Blob storage events to a custom web endpoint - CLI](storage-blob-event-quickstart.md) or [Route Blob storage events to a custom web endpoint - PowerShell](storage-blob-event-quickstart-powershell.md) for a quick example. 

![Event Grid Model](./media/storage-blob-event-overview/event-grid-functional-model.png)

## Blob storage accounts
Blob storage events are available in general-purpose v2 storage accounts and Blob storage accounts. **General-purpose v2** storage accounts support all features for all storage services, including Blobs, Files, Queues, and Tables. A **Blob storage account** is a specialized storage account for storing your unstructured data as blobs (objects) in Azure Storage. Blob storage accounts are like general-purpose storage accounts and share all the great durability, availability, scalability, and performance features that you use today including 100% API consistency for block blobs and append blobs. For more information, see [Azure storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md).

## Available Blob storage events
Event grid uses [event subscriptions](../../event-grid/concepts.md#event-subscriptions) to route event messages to subscribers.  Blob storage event subscriptions can include two types of events:  

> |Event Name|Description|
> |----------|-----------|
> |`Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated`|Fired when a blob is created or replaced through the `PutBlob`, `PutBlockList`, or `CopyBlob` operations|
> |`Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted`|Fired when a blob is deleted through a `DeleteBlob` operation|

## Event Schema
Blob storage events contain all the information you need to respond to changes in your data.  You can identify a Blob storage event because the eventType property starts with "Microsoft.Storage". Additional information about the usage of Event Grid event properties is documented in [Event Grid event schema](../../event-grid/event-schema.md).  

> |Property|Type|Description|
> |-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
> |topic|string|Full Azure Resource Manager id of the storage account that emits the event.|
> |subject|string|The relative resource path to the object that is the subject of the event, using the same extended Azure Resource Manager format that we use to describe storage accounts, services, and containers for Azure RBAC.  This format includes a case-preserving blob name.|
> |eventTime|string|Date/time that the event was generated, in ISO 8601 format|
> |eventType|string|"Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated" or "Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted"|
> |Id|string|Unique identifier if this event|
> |dataVersion|string|The schema version of the data object.|
> |metadataVersion|string|The schema version of top-level properties.|
> |data|object|Collection of blob storage-specific event data|
> |data.contentType|string|The content type of the blob, as would be returned in the Content-Type header from the blob|
> |data.contentLength|number|The size of the blob as in integer representing a number of bytes, as would be returned in the Content-Length header from the blob.  Sent with BlobCreated event, but not with BlobDeleted.|
> |data.url|string|The url of the object that is the subject of the event|
> |data.eTag|string|The etag of the object when this event fired.  Not available for the BlobDeleted event.|
> |data.api|string|The name of the api operation that triggered this event. For BlobCreated events, this value is "PutBlob", "PutBlockList", or "CopyBlob". For BlobDeleted events, this value is "DeleteBlob". These values are the same api names that are present in the Azure Storage diagnostic logs. See [Logged Operations and Status Messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages).|
> |data.sequencer|string|An opaque string value representing the logical sequence of events for any particular blob name.  Users can use standard string comparison to understand the relative sequence of two events on the same blob name.|
> |data.requestId|string|Service-generated request id for the storage API operation. Can be used to correlate to Azure Storage diagnostic logs using the "request-id-header" field in the logs and is returned from initiating API call in the 'x-ms-request-id' header. See [Log Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-log-format).|
> |data.clientRequestId|string|Client-provided request id for the storage API operation. Can be used to correlate to Azure Storage diagnostic logs using the "client-request-id" field in the logs, and can be provided in client requests using the "x-ms-client-request-id" header. See [Log Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-log-format). |
> |data.storageDiagnostics|object|Diagnostic data occasionally included by the Azure Storage service. When present, should be ignored by event consumers.|
|data.blobType|string|The type of the blob. Valid values are either "BlockBlob" or "PageBlob".| 

Here is an example of a BlobCreated event:
```json
[{
  "topic": "/subscriptions/319a9601-1ec0-0000-aebc-8fe82724c81e/resourceGroups/testrg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myaccount",
  "subject": "/blobServices/default/containers/testcontainer/blobs/file1.txt",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",
  "eventTime": "2017-08-16T01:57:26.005121Z",
  "id": "602a88ef-0001-00e6-1233-1646070610ea",
  "data": {
    "api": "PutBlockList",
    "clientRequestId": "799304a4-bbc5-45b6-9849-ec2c66be800a",
    "requestId": "602a88ef-0001-00e6-1233-164607000000",
    "eTag": "0x8D4E44A24ABE7F1",
    "contentType": "text/plain",
    "contentLength": 447,
    "blobType": "BlockBlob",
    "url": "https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer/file1.txt",
    "sequencer": "00000000000000EB000000000000C65A",
  },
  "dataVersion": "",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]

```

For more information, see [Blob storage events schema](../../event-grid/event-schema-blob-storage.md).

## Filtering events
Blob event subscriptions can be filtered based on the event type and by the container name and blob name of the object that was created or deleted.  Filters can be applied to event subscriptions either during the [creation](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription?view=azure-cli-latest) of the event subscription or [at a later time](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription?view=azure-cli-latest). Subject filters in Event Grid work based on "begins with" and "ends with" matches, so that events with a matching subject are delivered to the subscriber. 

The subject of Blob storage events uses the format:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/<containername>/blobs/<blobname>
```

To match all events for a storage account, you can leave the subject filters empty.

To match events from blobs created in a set of containers sharing a prefix, use a `subjectBeginsWith` filter like:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/containerprefix
```

To match events from blobs created in specific container, use a `subjectBeginsWith` filter like:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/
```

To match events from blobs created in specific container sharing a blob name prefix, use a `subjectBeginsWith` filter like:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/blobs/blobprefix
```

To match events from blobs created in specific container sharing a blob suffix, use a `subjectEndsWith` filter like ".log" or ".jpg". For more information, see [Event Grid Concepts](../../event-grid/concepts.md#event-subscriptions).

## Practices for consuming events
Applications that handle Blob storage events should follow a few recommended practices:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * As multiple subscriptions can be configured to route events to the same event handler, it is important not to assume events are from a particular source, but to check the topic of the message to ensure that it comes from the storage account you are expecting.
> * Similarly, check that the eventType is one you are prepared to process, and do not assume that all events you receive will be the types you expect.
> * As messages can arrive out of order and after some delay, use the etag fields to understand if your information about objects is still up-to-date.  Also, use the sequencer fields to understand the order of events on any particular object.
> * Use the blobType field to understand what type of operations are allowed on the blob, and which client library types you should use to access the blob. Valid values are either `BlockBlob` or `PageBlob`. 
> * Use the url field with the `CloudBlockBlob` and `CloudAppendBlob` constructors to access the blob.
> * Ignore fields you don't understand. This practice will help keep you resilient to new features that might be added in the future.
