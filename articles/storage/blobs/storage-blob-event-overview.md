# Reacting to Blob storage events

Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events, such as the creation and deletion of blobs, by using modern serverless architectures. It does so without the need for complicated code or expensive and inefficient polling services.

Instead, events are pushed through [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/) to subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own custom http listener, and you only pay for what you use.

Blob storage events are reliably sent to the Event Grid service which provides reliable delivery services to your applications through rich retry policies and dead-letter delivery.

Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file-oriented workflow. Asynchronous file uploads are a great fit for events. When changes are infrequent, but your scenario requires immediate responsiveness, event-based architecture can be especially efficient.

## The event model

Event Grid uses [event subscriptions](../../event-grid/concepts.md#event-subscriptions) to route event messages to subscribers. This image illustrates the relationship between event publishers, event subscriptions, and event handlers.

![Event Grid Model](./media/storage-blob-event-overview/event-grid-functional-model.png)

First, subscribe an endpoint to an event. Then, when an event is triggered, the Event Grid service will send data about that event to the endpoint.

See the [Blob storage events schema](../../event-grid/event-schema-blob-storage.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) article to view:

## Filtering events

Blob event subscriptions can be filtered based on the event type and by the container name and blob name of the object that was created or deleted.  Filters can be applied to event subscriptions either during the [creation](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription?view=azure-cli-latest) of the event subscription or [at a later time](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription?view=azure-cli-latest). Subject filters in Event Grid work based on "begins with" and "ends with" matches, so that events with a matching subject are delivered to the subscriber.

To learn more about how to apply filters, see [Filter events for Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/how-to-filter-events).

The subject of Blob storage events uses the format:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/<containername>/blobs/<blobname>
```

To match all events for a storage account, you can leave the subject filters empty.

To match events from blobs created in a set of containers sharing a prefix, use a `subjectBeginsWith` filter like:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/containerprefix
```

To match events from blobs created in specific container, use a `subjectBeginsWith` filter like:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/
```

To match events from blobs created in specific container sharing a blob name prefix, use a `subjectBeginsWith` filter like:

```
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/blobs/blobprefix
```

To match events from blobs created in specific container sharing a blob suffix, use a `subjectEndsWith` filter like ".log" or ".jpg". For more information, see [Event Grid Concepts](../../event-grid/concepts.md#event-subscriptions).

## Practices for consuming events

Applications that handle Blob storage events should follow a few recommended practices:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * As multiple subscriptions can be configured to route events to the same event handler, it is important not to assume events are from a particular source, but to check the topic of the message to ensure that it comes from the storage account you are expecting.
> * Similarly, check that the eventType is one you are prepared to process, and do not assume that all events you receive will be the types you expect.
> * As messages can arrive out of order and after some delay, use the etag fields to understand if your information about objects is still up-to-date.  Also, use the sequencer fields to understand the order of events on any particular object.
> * Use the blobType field to understand what type of operations are allowed on the blob, and which client library types you should use to access the blob. Valid values are either `BlockBlob` or `PageBlob`. 
> * Use the url field with the `CloudBlockBlob` and `CloudAppendBlob` constructors to access the blob.
> * Ignore fields you don't understand. This practice will help keep you resilient to new features that might be added in the future.
> * If you want to ensure that the **Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated** event is triggered only when a Block Blob is completely committed, filter the event for the `CopyBlob`, `PutBlob`, `PutBlockList` or `FlushWithClose` REST API calls. These API calls trigger the **Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated** event only after data is fully committed to a Block Blob.
