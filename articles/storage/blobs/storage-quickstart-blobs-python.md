# Quickstart: Upload, download, and list blobs with Python

In this quickstart, you see how to use Python to upload, download, and list block blobs in a container in Azure Blob storage. Blobs are simply objects that can hold any amount of text or binary data (such as images, documents, streaming media, archive data, etc.), and are distinct in Azure Storage from file shares, schemaless tables, and message queues. (For more information, see [Introduction to Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).)

[!INCLUDE [storage-multi-protocol-access-preview](../../../includes/storage-multi-protocol-access-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [storage-quickstart-prereq-include](../../../includes/storage-quickstart-prereq-include.md)]

Make sure you have the following additional prerequisites installed:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)

## Download the sample application
The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-blobs-python-quickstart.git) in this quickstart is a basic Python application.  

Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to download a copy of the application to your development environment. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-blobs-python-quickstart.git 
```

This command clones the *Azure-Samples/storage-blobs-python-quickstart* repository to your local git folder. To run the Python program, open the *example.py* file at the root of the repository.  

[!INCLUDE [storage-copy-account-key-portal](../../../includes/storage-copy-account-key-portal.md)]

## Configure your storage connection string
In the application, provide your storage account name and account key to create a `BlockBlobService` object. Open the *example.py* file from the Solution Explorer in your IDE. Replace the `accountname` and `accountkey` values with your account name and key. 

```python
block_blob_service = BlockBlobService(
    account_name='accountname', account_key='accountkey')
```

## Run the sample
This sample creates a test file in the *Documents* folder. The sample program uploads the test file to Blob storage, lists the blobs in the container, and downloads the file with a new name. 

First, install the dependencies by running `pip install`:

```python
    pip install azure-storage-blob
```

Next, run the sample. You’ll see messages similar to the following output:
  
```output
Temp file = C:\Users\azureuser\Documents\QuickStart_9f4ed0f9-22d3-43e1-98d0-8b2c05c01078.txt

Uploading to Blob storage as blobQuickStart_9f4ed0f9-22d3-43e1-98d0-8b2c05c01078.txt

List blobs in the container
         Blob name: QuickStart_9f4ed0f9-22d3-43e1-98d0-8b2c05c01078.txt

Downloading blob to C:\Users\azureuser\Documents\QuickStart_9f4ed0f9-22d3-43e1-98d0-8b2c05c01078_DOWNLOADED.txt
```
Before you continue, look in your *Documents* folder for the two files. You can open them and see they're the same.

You can also use a tool such as the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com) to view the files in Blob storage. Azure Storage Explorer is a free cross-platform tool that allows you to access your storage account information. 

After you've verified the files, press any key to finish the demo and delete the test files. Now that you know what the sample does, open the *example.py* file to look at the code. 

## Understand the sample code

Let’s walk through the sample code to understand how it works.

### Get references to the storage objects
First, you create the references to the objects used to access and manage Blob storage. These objects build on each other, and each is used by the next one in the list.

* Instantiate the **BlockBlobService** object, which points to the Blob service in your storage account. 

* Instantiate the **CloudBlobContainer** object, which represents the container you're accessing. Containers are used to organize your blobs like you use folders on your computer to organize your files.

Once you have the Cloud Blob container, instantiate the **CloudBlockBlob** object that points to the specific blob that you're interested in. You can then upload, download, and copy the blob as you need.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Container names must be lowercase. For more information about container and blob names, see [Naming and referencing Containers, Blobs, and Metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata).

In this section, you instantiate the objects, create a new container, and then set permissions on the container so the blobs are public. The container is called **quickstartblobs**. 

```python
# Create the BlockBlockService that is used to call the Blob service for the storage account.
block_blob_service = BlockBlobService(
    account_name='accountname', account_key='accountkey')

# Create a container called 'quickstartblobs'.
container_name = 'quickstartblobs'
block_blob_service.create_container(container_name)

# Set the permission so the blobs are public.
block_blob_service.set_container_acl(
    container_name, public_access=PublicAccess.Container)
```
### Upload blobs to the container

Blob storage supports block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs. Block blobs are the most commonly used, and that's what is used in this quickstart.  

To upload a file to a blob, get the full file path by joining the directory name with the file name on your local drive. You can then upload the file to the specified path using the `create_blob_from_path` method. 

The sample code creates a local file to be used for the upload and download, storing the file to be uploaded as *full_path_to_file* and the name of the blob as *local_file_name*. The following example uploads the file to your container called **quickstartblobs**.

```python
# Create a file in Documents to test the upload and download.
local_path = os.path.expanduser("~\Documents")
local_file_name = "QuickStart_" + str(uuid.uuid4()) + ".txt"
full_path_to_file = os.path.join(local_path, local_file_name)

# Write text to the file.
file = open(full_path_to_file, 'w')
file.write("Hello, World!")
file.close()

print("Temp file = " + full_path_to_file)
print("\nUploading to Blob storage as blob" + local_file_name)

# Upload the created file, use local_file_name for the blob name.
block_blob_service.create_blob_from_path(
    container_name, local_file_name, full_path_to_file)
```

There are several upload methods that you can use with Blob storage. For example, if you have a memory stream, you can use the `create_blob_from_stream` method rather than `create_blob_from_path`. 

Block blobs can be as large as 4.7 TB, and can be anything from Excel spreadsheets to large video files. Page blobs are primarily used for the VHD files that back IaaS VMs. Append blobs are used for logging, such as when you want to write to a file and then keep adding more information. Most objects stored in Blob storage are block blobs.

### List the blobs in a container

Get a list of files in the container with the `list_blobs` method. This method returns a generator. The following code retrieves the list of blobs&mdash;then loops through them&mdash;showing the names of the blobs found in a container.  

```python
# List the blobs in the container.
print("\nList blobs in the container")
generator = block_blob_service.list_blobs(container_name)
for blob in generator:
    print("\t Blob name: " + blob.name)
```

### Download the blobs

Download blobs to your local disk using the `get_blob_to_path` method. 
The following code downloads the blob uploaded in a previous section. *_DOWNLOADED* is added as a suffix to the blob name so you can see both files on local disk. 

```python
# Download the blob(s).
# Add '_DOWNLOADED' as prefix to '.txt' so you can see both files in Documents.
full_path_to_file2 = os.path.join(local_path, string.replace(
    local_file_name, '.txt', '_DOWNLOADED.txt'))
print("\nDownloading blob to " + full_path_to_file2)
block_blob_service.get_blob_to_path(
    container_name, local_file_name, full_path_to_file2)
```

### Clean up resources
If you no longer need the blobs uploaded in this quickstart, you can delete the entire container using the `delete_container` method. To delete individual files instead, use the `delete_blob` method.

```python
# Clean up resources. This includes the container and the temp files.
block_blob_service.delete_container(container_name)
os.remove(full_path_to_file)
os.remove(full_path_to_file2)
```
