# How to use Queue storage from Ruby
[!INCLUDE [storage-selector-queue-include](../../../includes/storage-selector-queue-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [storage-try-azure-tools-queues](../../../includes/storage-try-azure-tools-queues.md)]

## Overview
This guide shows you how to perform common scenarios using the Microsoft
Azure Queue Storage service. The samples are written using the Ruby Azure API.
The scenarios covered include **inserting**, **peeking**, **getting**,
and **deleting** queue messages, as well as **creating and deleting
queues**.

## Create a Ruby Application
Create a Ruby application. For instructions, see [Create a Ruby App in App Service on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-ruby).

## Configure Your Application to Access Storage
To use Azure storage, you need to download and use the Ruby azure package, which includes a set of convenience libraries that communicate with the storage REST services.

### Use RubyGems to obtain the package
1. Use a command-line interface such as **PowerShell** (Windows), **Terminal** (Mac), or **Bash** (Unix).
2. Type "gem install azure" in the command window to install the gem and dependencies.

### Import the package
Use your favorite text editor, add the following to the top of the Ruby file where you intend to use storage:

```ruby
require "azure"
```

## Setup an Azure Storage Connection
The azure module will read the environment variables **AZURE\_STORAGE\_ACCOUNT** and **AZURE\_STORAGE\_ACCESS_KEY** 
for information required to connect to your Azure storage account. If these environment variables are not set, 
you must specify the account information before using **Azure::QueueService** with the following code:

```ruby
Azure.config.storage_account_name = "<your azure storage account>"
Azure.config.storage_access_key = "<your Azure storage access key>"
```

To obtain these values from a classic or Resource Manager storage account in the Azure portal:

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to the storage account you want to use.
3. In the Settings blade on the right, click **Access Keys**.
4. In the Access keys blade that appears, you'll see the access key 1 and access key 2. You can use either of these. 
5. Click the copy icon to copy the key to the clipboard. 

## How To: Create a Queue
The following code creates a **Azure::QueueService** object, which enables you to work with queues.

```ruby
azure_queue_service = Azure::QueueService.new
```

Use the **create_queue()** method to create a queue with the specified name.

```ruby
begin
  azure_queue_service.create_queue("test-queue")
rescue
  puts $!
end
```

## How To: Insert a Message into a Queue
To insert a message into a queue, use the **create_message()** method to create a new message and add it to the queue.

```ruby
azure_queue_service.create_message("test-queue", "test message")
```

## How To: Peek at the Next Message
You can peek at the message in the front of a queue without removing it from the queue by calling the **peek\_messages()** method. By default, **peek\_messages()** peeks at a single message. You can also specify how many messages you want to peek.

```ruby
result = azure_queue_service.peek_messages("test-queue",
  {:number_of_messages => 10})
```

## How To: Dequeue the Next Message
You can remove a message from a queue in two steps.

1. When you call **list\_messages()**, you get the next message in a queue by default. You can also specify how many messages you want to get. The messages returned from **list\_messages()** becomes invisible to any other code reading messages from this queue. You pass in the visibility timeout in seconds as a parameter.
2. To finish removing the message from the queue, you must also call **delete_message()**.

This two-step process of removing a message assures that when your code fails to process a message due to hardware or software failure, another instance of your code can get the same message and try again. Your code calls **delete\_message()** right after the message has been processed.

```ruby
messages = azure_queue_service.list_messages("test-queue", 30)
azure_queue_service.delete_message("test-queue", 
  messages[0].id, messages[0].pop_receipt)
```

## How To: Change the Contents of a Queued Message
You can change the contents of a message in-place in the queue. The code below uses the **update_message()** method to update a message. The method will return a tuple which contains the pop receipt of the queue message and a UTC date time value that represents when the message will be visible on the queue.

```ruby
message = azure_queue_service.list_messages("test-queue", 30)
pop_receipt, time_next_visible = azure_queue_service.update_message(
  "test-queue", message.id, message.pop_receipt, "updated test message", 
  30)
```

## How To: Additional Options for Dequeuing Messages
There are two ways you can customize message retrieval from a queue.

1. You can get a batch of message.
2. You can set a longer or shorter invisibility timeout, allowing your code more or less time to fully process each message.

The following code example uses the **list\_messages()** method to get 15 messages in one call. Then it prints and deletes each message. It also sets the invisibility timeout to five minutes for each message.

```ruby
azure_queue_service.list_messages("test-queue", 300
  {:number_of_messages => 15}).each do |m|
  puts m.message_text
  azure_queue_service.delete_message("test-queue", m.id, m.pop_receipt)
end
```

## How To: Get the Queue Length
You can get an estimation of the number of messages in the queue. The **get\_queue\_metadata()** method asks the queue service to return the approximate message count and metadata about the queue.

```ruby
message_count, metadata = azure_queue_service.get_queue_metadata(
  "test-queue")
```

## How To: Delete a Queue
To delete a queue and all the messages contained in it, call the **delete\_queue()** method on the queue object.

```ruby
azure_queue_service.delete_queue("test-queue")
```
