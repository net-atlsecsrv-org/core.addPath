- [Samples](../common/storage-samples-java.md?toc=%252fazure%252fstorage%252fqueues%252ftoc.json#queue-samples)

## Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/) version 8 or above
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure storage account - [create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md)

## Setting up

This section walks you through preparing a project to work with the Azure Queue storage client library v12 for Java.

### Create the project

Create a Java application named *queues-quickstart-v12*.

1. In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use Maven to create a new console app with the name *queues-quickstart-v12*. Type the following **mvn** command to create a "Hello world!" Java project.

   ```console
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.queues.quickstart \
                          -DartifactId=queues-quickstart-v12 \
                          -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
                          -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 \
                          -DinteractiveMode=false
   ```

1. The output from generating the project should look something like this:

    ```console
    [INFO] Scanning for projects...
    [INFO]

    ```

1. Switch to the newly created *queues-quickstart-v12* directory.

   ```console
   cd queues-quickstart-v12
   ```

### Install the package

Open the *pom.xml* file in your text editor. Add the following dependency element to the group of dependencies.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-storage-queue</artifactId>
  <version>12.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Set up the app framework

From the project directory:

1. Navigate to the */src/main/java/com/queues/quickstart* directory
1. Open the *App.java* file in your editor
1. Delete the `System.out.println("Hello world!");` statement
1. Add `import` directives

Here's the code:

```java
package com.queues.quickstart;

/**
 * Azure queue storage v12 SDK quickstart
 */
import com.azure.storage.queue.*;
import com.azure.storage.queue.models.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.time.*;

public class App
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    {
    }
}
```

## Object model

Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously. Queue storage offers three types of resources:

- The storage account
- A queue in the storage account
- Messages within the queue

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.

![Diagram of Queue storage architecture](./media/storage-queues-introduction/queue1.png)

Use the following Java classes to interact with these resources:

- [QueueClientBuilder](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclientbuilder): The `QueueClientBuilder` class configures and instantiates a `QueueClient` object.
- [QueueServiceClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueserviceclient): The `QueueServiceClient` allows you to manage the all queues in your storage account.
- [QueueClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient): The `QueueClient` class allows you to manage and manipulate an individual queue and its messages.
- [QueueMessageItem](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.models.queuemessageitem): The `QueueMessageItem` class represents the individual objects returned when calling [receiveMessages](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.receivemessages) on a queue.

## Code examples

These example code snippets show you how to do the following actions with the Azure Queue storage client library for Java:

- [Get the connection string](#get-the-connection-string)
- [Create a queue](#create-a-queue)
- [Add messages to a queue](#add-messages-to-a-queue)
- [Peek at messages in a queue](#peek-at-messages-in-a-queue)
- [Update a message in a queue](#update-a-message-in-a-queue)
- [Receive and delete messages from a queue](#receive-and-delete-messages-from-a-queue)
- [Delete a queue](#delete-a-queue)

### Get the connection string

The code below retrieves the connection string for the storage account. The connection string is stored the environment variable created in the [Configure your storage connection string](#configure-your-storage-connection-string) section.

Add this code inside the `main` method:

```java
System.out.println("Azure Queues storage v12 - Java quickstart sample\n");

// Retrieve the connection string for use with the application. The storage
// connection string is stored in an environment variable on the machine
// running the application called AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING. If the environment variable
// is created after the application is launched in a console or with
// Visual Studio, the shell or application needs to be closed and reloaded
// to take the environment variable into account.
String connectStr = System.getenv("AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING");
```

### Create a queue

Decide on a name for the new queue. The code below appends a GUID value to the queue name to ensure that it's unique.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Queue names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and must begin with a letter or a number. Each hyphen must be preceded and followed by a non-hyphen character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long. For more information about naming queues, see [Naming Queues and Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-queues-and-metadata).

Create an instance of the [QueueClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient) class. Then, call the [create](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.create) method to create the queue in your storage account.

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```java
// Create a unique name for the queue
String queueName = "quickstartqueues-" + java.util.UUID.randomUUID();

System.out.println("Creating queue: " + queueName);

// Instantiate a QueueClient which will be
// used to create and manipulate the queue
QueueClient queueClient = new QueueClientBuilder()
                                .connectionString(connectStr)
                                .queueName(queueName)
                                .buildClient();

// Create the queue
queueClient.create();
```

### Add messages to a queue

The following code snippet adds messages to queue by calling the [sendMessage](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.sendmessage) method. It also saves a [SendMessageResult](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.models.sendmessageresult) returned from a `sendMessage` call. The result is used to update the message later in the program.

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```java
System.out.println("\nAdding messages to the queue...");

// Send several messages to the queue
queueClient.sendMessage("First message");
queueClient.sendMessage("Second message");

// Save the result so we can update this message later
SendMessageResult result = queueClient.sendMessage("Third message");
```

### Peek at messages in a queue

Peek at the messages in the queue by calling the [peekMessages](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.peekmessages) method. The `peelkMessages` method retrieves one or more messages from the front of the queue but doesn't alter the visibility of the message.

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```java
System.out.println("\nPeek at the messages in the queue...");

// Peek at messages in the queue
queueClient.peekMessages(10, null, null).forEach(
    peekedMessage -> System.out.println("Message: " + peekedMessage.getMessageText()));
```

### Update a message in a queue

Update the contents of a message by calling the [updateMessage](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.updatemessage) method. The `updateMessage` method can change a message's visibility timeout and contents. The message content must be a UTF-8 encoded string that is up to 64 KB in size. Along with new content for the message, pass in the message ID and pop receipt by using the `SendMessageResult` that was saved earlier in the code. The message ID and pop receipt identify which message to update.

```java
System.out.println("\nUpdating the third message in the queue...");

// Update a message using the result that
// was saved when sending the message
queueClient.updateMessage(result.getMessageId(),
                          result.getPopReceipt(),
                          "Third message has been updated",
                          Duration.ofSeconds(1));
```

### Receive and delete messages from a queue

Download previously added messages by calling the [receiveMessages](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.receivemessages) method. The example code also deletes messages from the queue after they're received and processed. In this case, processing is just displaying the message on the console.

The app pauses for user input by calling `System.console().readLine();` before it receives and deletes the messages. Verify in your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) that the resources were created correctly, before they're deleted. Any messages not explicitly deleted will eventually become visible in the queue again for another chance to process them.

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```java
System.out.println("\nPress Enter key to receive messages and delete them from the queue...");
System.console().readLine();

// Get messages from the queue
queueClient.receiveMessages(10).forEach(
    // "Process" the message
    receivedMessage -> {
        System.out.println("Message: " + receivedMessage.getMessageText());

        // Let the service know we're finished with
        // the message and it can be safely deleted.
        queueClient.deleteMessage(receivedMessage.getMessageId(), receivedMessage.getPopReceipt());
    }
);
```

### Delete a queue

The following code cleans up the resources the app created by deleting the queue using the [delete](/java/api/com.azure.storage.queue.queueclient.delete) method.

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```java
System.out.println("\nPress Enter key to delete the queue...");
System.console().readLine();

// Clean up
System.out.println("Deleting queue: " + queueClient.getQueueName());
queueClient.delete();

System.out.println("Done");
```

## Run the code

This app creates and adds three messages to an Azure queue. The code lists the messages in the queue, then retrieves and deletes them, before finally deleting the queue.

In your console window, navigate to your application directory, then build and run the application.

```console
mvn compile
```

Then, build the package.

```console
mvn package
```

Run the following `mvn` command to execute the app.

```console
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.queues.quickstart.App" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
```

The output of the app is similar to the following example:

```output
Azure Queues storage v12 - Java quickstart sample

Adding messages to the queue...

Peek at the messages in the queue...
Message: First message
Message: Second message
Message: Third message

Updating the third message in the queue...

Press Enter key to receive messages and delete them from the queue...

Message: First message
Message: Second message
Message: Third message has been updated

Press Enter key to delete the queue...

Deleting queue: quickstartqueues-fbf58f33-4d5a-41ac-ac0e-1a05d01c7003
Done
```

When the app pauses before receiving messages, check your storage account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Verify the messages are in the queue.

Press the **Enter** key to receive and delete the messages. When prompted, press the **Enter** key again to delete the queue and finish the demo.
