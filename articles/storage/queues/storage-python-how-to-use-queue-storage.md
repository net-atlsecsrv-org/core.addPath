# How to use Azure Queue storage v2.1 from Python

[!INCLUDE [storage-selector-queue-include](../../../includes/storage-selector-queue-include.md)]

This article demonstrates common scenarios using the Azure Queue storage service. The scenarios covered include inserting, peeking, getting, and deleting queue messages, and creating and deleting queues.

[!INCLUDE [storage-try-azure-tools-queues](../../../includes/storage-try-azure-tools-queues.md)]

## Overview

The samples in this article are written in Python and use the [Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for Python]. For more information on queues, see the [Next steps](#next-steps) section.

## Download and install Azure Storage SDK for Python

The [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-python) requires Python version 2.7, 3.3, or later.
 
### Install via PyPi

To install via the Python Package Index (PyPI), type:

```bash
pip install azure-storage-queue==2.1.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are upgrading from the Azure Storage SDK for Python version 0.36 or earlier, uninstall the older SDK using `pip uninstall azure-storage` before installing the latest package.

For alternative installation methods, see [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python/).

## View the sample application

To view and run a sample application that shows how to use Python with Azure Queues, see [Azure Storage: Getting Started with Azure Queues in Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-queue-python-getting-started). 

To run the sample application, make sure you have installed both the `azure-storage-queue` and `azure-storage-common` packages.

## Create a queue

The [QueueService](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice) object lets you work with queues. The following code creates a `QueueService` object. Add the following near the top of any Python file in which you wish to programmatically access Azure Storage:

```python
from azure.storage.queue import QueueService
```

The following code creates a `QueueService` object using the storage account name and account key. Replace *myaccount* and *mykey* with your account name and key.

```python
queue_service = QueueService(account_name='myaccount', account_key='mykey')

queue_service.create_queue('taskqueue')
```

## Insert a message into a queue

To insert a message into a queue, use the [put_message](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#put-message-queue-name--content--visibility-timeout-none--time-to-live-none--timeout-none-) method to create a new message and add it to the queue.

```python
queue_service.put_message('taskqueue', u'Hello World')
```

Azure queue messages are stored as text. If you want to store binary data, setup Base64 encoding and decoding functions on the queue service object before putting a message in the queue.

```python
# setup queue Base64 encoding and decoding functions
queue_service.encode_function = QueueMessageFormat.binary_base64encode
queue_service.decode_function = QueueMessageFormat.binary_base64decode
```

## Peek at the next message

You can peek at the message in the front of a queue without removing it from the queue by calling the [peek_messages](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#peek-messages-queue-name--num-messages-none--timeout-none-) method. By default, `peek_messages` peeks at a single message.

```python
messages = queue_service.peek_messages('taskqueue')
for message in messages:
    print(message.content)
```

## Dequeue messages

Your code removes a message from a queue in two steps. When you call [get_messages](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#get-messages-queue-name--num-messages-none--visibility-timeout-none--timeout-none-), you get the next message in a queue by default. A message returned from `get_messages` becomes invisible to any other code reading messages from this queue. By default, this message stays invisible for 30 seconds. To finish removing the message from the queue, you must also call [delete_message](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#delete-message-queue-name--message-id--pop-receipt--timeout-none-). This two-step process of removing a message assures that when your code fails to process a message due to hardware or software failure, another instance of your code can get the same message and try again. Your code calls `delete_message` right after the message has been processed.

```python
messages = queue_service.get_messages('taskqueue')
for message in messages:
    print(message.content)
    queue_service.delete_message('taskqueue', message.id, message.pop_receipt)
```

There are two ways you can customize message retrieval from a queue. First, you can get a batch of messages (up to 32). Second, you can set a longer or shorter invisibility timeout, allowing your code more or less time to fully process each message. The following code example uses the `get_messages` method to get 16 messages in one call. Then it processes each message using a for loop. It also sets the invisibility timeout to five minutes for each message.

```python
messages = queue_service.get_messages(
    'taskqueue', num_messages=16, visibility_timeout=5*60)
for message in messages:
    print(message.content)
    queue_service.delete_message('taskqueue', message.id, message.pop_receipt)
```

## Change the contents of a queued message

You can change the contents of a message in-place in the queue. If the message represents a work task, you could use this feature to update the status of the work task. The code below uses the [update_message](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#update-message-queue-name--message-id--pop-receipt--visibility-timeout--content-none--timeout-none-) method to update a message. The visibility timeout is set to 0, meaning the message appears immediately and the content is updated.

```python
messages = queue_service.get_messages('taskqueue')
for message in messages:
    queue_service.update_message(
        'taskqueue', message.id, message.pop_receipt, 0, u'Hello World Again')
```

## Get the queue length

You can get an estimate of the number of messages in a queue. The [get_queue_metadata](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#get-queue-metadata-queue-name--timeout-none-) method asks the queue service to return metadata about the queue, and the `approximate_message_count`. The result is only approximate because messages can be added or removed after the queue service responds to your request.

```python
metadata = queue_service.get_queue_metadata('taskqueue')
count = metadata.approximate_message_count
```

## Delete a queue

To delete a queue and all the messages contained in it, call the [delete_queue](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueservice.queueservice#delete-queue-queue-name--fail-not-exist-false--timeout-none-) method.

```python
queue_service.delete_queue('taskqueue')
```
