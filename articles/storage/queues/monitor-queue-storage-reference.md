# Azure Queue Storage monitoring data reference

See [Monitoring Azure Storage](monitor-queue-storage.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for Azure Storage.

## Metrics

The following tables list the platform metrics collected for Azure Storage.

### Capacity metrics

Capacity metrics values are refreshed daily (up to 24 hours). The time grain defines the time interval for which metrics values are presented. The supported time grain for all capacity metrics is one hour (PT1H).

Azure Storage provides the following capacity metrics in Azure Monitor.

#### Account-level capacity metrics

[!INCLUDE [Account-level capacity metrics](../../../includes/azure-storage-account-capacity-metrics.md)]

#### Queue Storage metrics

This table shows [Queue Storage metrics](../../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported.md#microsoftstoragestorageaccountsqueueservices).

| Metric | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **QueueCapacity** | The amount of Queue Storage used by the storage account. <br><br> Unit: `Bytes` <br> Aggregation type: `Average` <br> Value example: `1024` |
| **QueueCount** | The number of queues in the storage account. <br><br> Unit: `Count` <br> Aggregation type: `Average` <br> Value example: `1024` |
| **QueueMessageCount** | The approximate number of queue messages in the storage account. <br><br> Unit: `Count` <br> Aggregation type: `Average` <br> Value example: `1024` |

### Transaction metrics

Transaction metrics are emitted on every request to a storage account from Azure Storage to Azure Monitor. In the case of no activity on your storage account, there will be no data on transaction metrics in the period. All transaction metrics are available at both account and Queue Storage service level. The time grain defines the time interval that metric values are presented. The supported time grains for all transaction metrics are PT1H and PT1M.
