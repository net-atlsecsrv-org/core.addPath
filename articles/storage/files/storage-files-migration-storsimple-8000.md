# StorSimple 8100 and 8600 migration to Azure File Sync

The StorSimple 8000 series is represented by either the 8100 or the 8600 physical, on-premises appliances, and their cloud service components. It is possible to migrate the data from either of these appliances to an Azure File Sync environment. Azure File Sync is the default and strategic long-term Azure service that StorSimple appliances can be migrated to.

StorSimple 8000 series will reach its [end-of-life](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=StorSimple%208000%20Series) in December 2022. It is important to begin planning your migration as soon as possible. This article provides the necessary background knowledge and migrations steps for a successful migration to Azure File Sync. 

## Phase 1: Prepare for migration

This section contains the steps you should take at the beginning of your migration from StorSimple volumes to Azure file shares.

### Inventory
When you begin planning your migration, first identify all the StorSimple appliances and volumes you need to migrate. Once you've done that, you can decide on the best migration path for you.

* StorSimple physical appliances (8000 series) use this migration guide. 
* Virtual appliances, [StorSimple 1200 series, use a different migration guide](storage-files-migration-storsimple-1200.md).

### Migration cost summary
Migrations to Azure file shares from StorSimple volumes via Data Transformation jobs in a StorSimple Data Manager resource are free of charge. However, there are other costs that can be incurred during and after a migration:

* **Network egress:** Your StorSimple files live in a storage account within a specific Azure region. If you provision the Azure file shares you migrate into in a storage account that is located in the same Azure region, no egress cost will occur. You can move your files to a storage account in a different region as part of this migration. In that case, egress costs will apply to you.
* **Azure file share transactions:** When files are copied into an Azure file share (as part of a migration or outside of one) transaction costs apply as files and metadata are being written. As a best practice, start your Azure file share on the transaction optimized tier during the migration. Switch to your desired tier after the migration completed. The phases below will call this out at the appropriate point.
* **Changing an Azure file share tier:** Changing the tier of an Azure file share costs transactions. In most cases, it will be more cost efficient to follow the advice from the previous point.
* **Storage cost:** When this migration starts copying files into an Azure file share, Azure Files storage is consumed and billed. 
* **StorSimple:** Until you have a chance to deprovision the StorSimple devices and storage accounts, StorSimple cost for storage, backups, and appliances will continue to occur.

### Direct share access vs. Azure File Sync
Azure file shares open up a whole new world of opportunities for structuring your file services deployment. An Azure file share is just an SMB share in the cloud, that you can set up to have users access directly over the SMB protocol with the familiar Kerberos authentication and existing NTFS permissions (file and folder ACLs) working natively. [Learn more about identity based access to Azure file shares](storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).

An alternative to direct access is a [Azure File Sync](https://aka.ms/AFS). Azure File Sync is a direct analog for StorSimple's ability to cache frequently used files on premises. 

Azure File Sync is a Microsoft cloud service, based on two main components:

* File synchronization and cloud tiering.
* File shares as native storage in Azure, that can be accessed over multiple protocols like SMB and file REST. 

Azure file shares retain important file fidelity aspects on stored files like attributes, permissions, and timestamps. With Azure file shares, there is no longer a need for an application or service to interpret the files and folders stored in the cloud. You can access them natively over familiar protocols and clients like Windows File Explorer. Azure file shares allow you to store general-purpose file server data and application data in the cloud. Backup of an Azure file share is a built-in functionality and can be further enhanced by Azure Backup.

This article focuses on the migration steps. If before migrating you'd like to learn more about Azure File Sync, we recommend the following articles:

* [Azure File Sync - overview](https://aka.ms/AFS "Overview")
* [Azure File Sync - deployment guide](storage-sync-files-deployment-guide.md)

### StorSimple Service Data Encryption Key
When you first set up your StorSimple appliance, it generated a '*Service Data Encryption Key*' and instructed you to securely store the key.
This key is used to encrypt all data in the associated Azure storage account, that the StorSimple appliance stores your files in.

The 'Service Data Encryption Key' is necessary for a successful migration. Now is a good time to retrieve this key from your records, for each of the appliances in your inventory.

If you cannot find the key(s) in your records, you can retrieve the key from the appliance. Each appliance has a unique encryption key.

* File a support request with Microsoft Azure through the Azure portal. The content of the request should have the StorSimple device serial numbers and the request to retrieve the "Service Data Encryption Key". 
* A StorSimple support engineer will contact you with a request for a screen sharing meeting.
* Ensure that before the meeting begins, you connect to your StorSimple appliance [via a serial console](../../storsimple/storsimple-8000-windows-powershell-administration.md#connect-to-windows-powershell-for-storsimple-via-the-device-serial-console) or through a [remote PowerShell session](../../storsimple/storsimple-8000-windows-powershell-administration.md#connect-remotely-to-storsimple-using-windows-powershell-for-storsimple). 

> [!CAUTION]
> When you are deciding how to connect to your StorSimple appliance, consider the following:
> * Connecting through an HTTPS session is the most secure and recommended option.
> * Connecting directly to the device serial console is secure, but connecting to the serial console over network switches is not. 
> * HTTP session connections are an option but are **not encrypted** and therefore also not recommended unless used within in a closed, trusted network.

### StorSimple volume backups
StorSimple offers differential backups on the volume level. Azure file shares also have this ability, called share snapshots.

Decide if as part of your migration, you also have an obligation to move any backups.

> [!CAUTION]
> Stop here if you must migrate backups from StorSimple volumes.
>
> You can currently only migrate your most recent volume backup. Support for backup migration will arrive at the end of 2020.
> If you start now, you cannot "bolt-on" your backups later.
> In the upcoming version, backups must be "played back" to the Azure file shares from oldest to newest, with Azure file share snapshots taken in between.

If you want to only migrate the live data and have no requirements for backups, you can continue following this guide.
If you only have a very short-term backup retention requirement of say, a month or two, then you can decide to continue your migration now and only deprovision your StorSimple resources after that period. This approach would allow you to create as much backup history on the Azure file share side as you need. For the time you keep both systems running, additional cost applies, which makes this not an approach you should consider if you need more than very short-term backup retention.

### Map your existing StorSimple volumes to Azure file shares
[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-namespace-mapping](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-namespace-mapping.md)]

### Number of storage accounts
Your migration will likely benefit from a deployment of multiple storage accounts, that each hold a smaller number of Azure file shares.

If your file shares are highly active (utilized by many users and/or applications) then just two Azure file shares might reach the performance limit of your storage account. Because of this, the best practice is to migrate to multiple storage accounts, each with their own individual file shares and typically no more than two or three shares per storage account.

A best practice is to deploy storage accounts with one file share each. You can pool multiple Azure file shares into the same storage account, in case you have archival shares in them.

These considerations apply more to [direct cloud access](#direct-share-access-vs-azure-file-sync) (through an Azure VM or service) than to Azure File Sync. If you plan to use Azure File Sync only on these shares, then grouping several into a single Azure storage account is fine. Also consider you might want to lift and shift an app into the cloud, that would then directly access a file share. Or you could start using a service in Azure that would also benefit from having higher IOPS and throughput numbers available. 

If you've made a list of your shares, you should map each share to the storage account that it will reside in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you decide on an Azure region and then each storage account and Azure File Sync resource match that same region you've selected.

### Phase 1 summary
At the end of Phase 1:
* You have a good overview of your StorSimple devices and volumes.
* The Data Transformation service is ready to access your StorSimple volumes in the cloud, because you have retrieved your Service Data Encryption key for each StorSimple device.
* You have a plan for not only which volumes need to be migrated, but also how to map your volumes to the appropriate number of Azure file shares and storage accounts.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you must migrate backups from StorSimple volumes, **STOP HERE**.
>
> This migration approach relies on new data transformation service capabilities that currently cannot migrate backups. Support for backup migration will arrive at the end of 2020.
> You can currently only migrate your live data. If you start now, you cannot "bolt-on" your backups later.
> Backups must be "played back" to the Azure file shares from oldest to newest to live data, with Azure file share snapshots in between.

If you want to only migrate the live data and have no requirements for backups, you can continue following this guide.

## Phase 2: Deploying Azure storage and migration resources

This section discusses considerations around deploying the different resource types that are needed in Azure. Some will hold your data post migration and some are needed solely for the migration. Do not start deploying resources until you've finalized your deployment plan. It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to change certain aspects of your Azure resources once they've been deployed.

### Deploy storage accounts
You will likely need to deploy several Azure storage accounts. Each one will hold a smaller number of Azure file shares, as per your deployment plan, completed in the previous section of this article. Got to the Azure portal to [deploy your planned storage accounts](../common/storage-account-create.md#create-a-storage-account). Consider adhering to the following, basic settings for any new storage account:

##### Subscription
You can use the same subscription you used for your StorSimple deployment or a different one. The only limitation is that your subscription must be in the same Azure AD tenant as the StorSimple subscription. Consider moving the StorSimple subscription to the correct tenant before starting a migration. You can only move the entire subscription, individual StorSimple resources cannot be moved to a different tenant or subscription.

##### Resource group
Resource groups are assisting with organization of resources and admin management permissions. Find out more about [resource groups in Azure](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#what-is-a-resource-group).

##### Storage account name
The name of your storage account will become part of a URL and has certain character limitations. In your naming convention, consider that storage account names have to be unique in the world, allow only lower case letters and numbers, require between 3 to 24 characters, and do not allow special characters like hyphens or underscores. See also: [Azure storage resource naming rules](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftstorage).

##### Location
The "Location" or Azure region of a storage account is very important. If you use Azure File Sync, all of your storage accounts must be in the same region as your Storage Sync Service resource. The Azure region you pick, should be close or central to your local servers/users. Once your resource has been deployed, you cannot change its region.

You can pick a different region from where your StorSimple data (storage account) currently resides.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you pick a different region from your current, StorSimple storage account location, [egress charges will apply](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth) during the migration. Data will leave the StorSimple region and enter your new storage account region. No bandwidth charges apply if you stay within the same Azure region.

##### Performance
You have the option to pick premium storage (SSD) for Azure file shares or standard storage. Standard storage includes [several tiers for a file share](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md#changing-the-tier-of-an-azure-file-share). Standard storage is the right option for most customers migrating from StorSimple.

Still not sure?
* Choose premium storage if you need the [performance of a premium Azure file share](storage-files-planning.md#understanding-provisioning-for-premium-file-shares).
* Choose standard storage for general purpose file server workloads, including hot data and archive data. Also choose standard storage if the only workload on the share in the cloud will be Azure File Sync.

##### Account kind
* For standard storage, choose: *StorageV2 (general purpose v2)*
* For premium file shares, choose: *FileStorage*

##### Replication
There are several replication settings available. Learn more about the different replication types.

Only choose from either of the following two options:
* *Locally redundant storage (LRS)*
* *Zone redundant storage (ZRS)* - which is not available in all Azure regions.

> [!NOTE]
> Only LRS and ZRS redundancy types are compatible with the the large, 100TiB-capacity Azure file shares.

Globally redundant storage (all variations) is currently not supported. You can switch your redundancy type later, and to GRS when support for it arrives in Azure.

##### Enable 100TiB-capacity file shares

        :::image type="content" source="media/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share/large-file-shares-advanced-enable.png" alt-text="An image showing the Advanced tab in the Azure portal for the creation of a storage account.":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        Under the *Advanced* section of the new storage account wizard in the Azure portal, you can enable *Large file shares* support in this storage account. If this option is not available to you, you most likely selected the wrong redundancy type. Ensure you only select LRS or ZRS for this option to become available.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Opting for the large, 100TiB-capacity file shares has several benefits:
* Your performance is greatly increased as compared to the smaller, 5TiB-capacity file shares. (for example: 10 times the IOPS)
* Your migration will finish significantly faster.
* You ensure that a file share will have enough capacity to hold all the data you will migrate into it.
* Future growth is covered.

### Azure file shares
Once your storage accounts are created, you can navigate into the *"File share"* section of the storage account and deploy the appropriate number of Azure file shares as per your migration plan from Phase 1. Consider adhering to the following, basic settings for your new file shares in Azure:

    :::column:::

The best practice is to not set a quota here as your migration and other services will fail when the quota is reached.</br></br>**Tier**</br>Select *Transaction Optimized* for your new file share. During the migration, many transactions will occur and it is more cost efficient to change your tier later to the tier best suited to your workload.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### StorSimple Data Manager
The Azure resource that will hold you migration jobs, is called a *"StorSimple Data Manager"*. Click new resource and search for it, then click *Create*.

This is a temporary resource used for orchestration, you will deprovision it after your migration completes. It should be deployed in the same subscription, resource group, and region as your StorSimple storage account.

### Azure File Sync
Azure File Sync (AFS) allows you to add on-premises caching of the most frequently accessed files. Similar to the caching abilities of StorSimple, the AFS cloud tiering feature offers local-access latency in combination with improved control over the available cache capacity on the Windows Server and multi-site sync. If having an on-premises cache is your goal, then in your local network, prepare a Windows Server VM (physical servers and fail-over clusters are also supported), with sufficient "Direct Attached Storage (DAS)" capacity. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't set up Azure File Sync yet, it is best to set up Azure File Sync after the migration of your share is complete. Deploying AFS should not start before Phase 4 of a migration.

### Phase 2 summary
At the end of Phase 2, you will have deployed your storage accounts, all Azure file shares across them and also have a StorSimple Data Manager resource. You will use the latter in Phase 3, when you actually configure your migration jobs.

## Phase 3: Create and run a migration job
This section describes how to set up a migration job and carefully map the directories on a StorSimple volume that should be copied into the target Azure file share you select. To get started, navigate to your StorSimple Data Manager, find **Job definitions** in the menu and select **+Job definition**. The target storage type is the default: *Azure file share*.

![StorSimple 8000 series migration job types.](media/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000-new-job-type.png "A screenshot of the Job definitions Azure portal with a new Job definition dialog opened, that asks for the type of job: Copy to a file share or a blob container.")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running any migration job, stop any automatically scheduled backups of your StorSimple volumes.

    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest volume backup will be used to perform the migration. Ensure at least one volume backup is present or the job will fail. Also ensure that the latest backup you have is fairly recent, to keep the delta to the live share as small as possible. It could be worth manually triggering and completing another volume backup **before** running the job you just created.

### Directory Mapping
This is optional for your migration job. If you leave it empty, **all** the files and folders on the root of your StorSimple volume will be moved into the root of your target Azure file share. In most cases, storing an entire volume's content in an Azure file share is not the best approach. It's often better to split a volume's content across multiple file shares in Azure. If you haven't made a plan already, check out this section first: [Map your StorSimple volume to Azure file shares](#map-your-existing-storsimple-volumes-to-azure-file-shares)

As part of your migration plan, you may have decided that the folders on a StorSimple volume need to be split across multiple Azure file shares. If that is the case, you can accomplish that split by:
1. Defining multiple jobs to migrate the folders on one volume, each will have the same StorSimple volume source but a different Azure file share as the target.
1. Specifying precisely which folders from the StorSimple volume need to be migrated into the specified file share, by using the *Directory-mapping* section of the job creation form and following the specific [mapping semantics](#semantic-elements).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The paths and mapping expressions in this form cannot be validated when the form is submitted. If mappings are specified incorrectly, a job may either fail completely or produce an undesirable result. In that case it is usually best to delete the Azure file share, recreate it and then fix the mapping statements in a new migration job for the share. Running a new job with a fixed mapping statements can fix omitted folders and bring them into the existing share. However, only folders that were omitted because of path misspellings can be addressed this way.

#### Semantic elements
A mapping is expressed from left to right: [\source path] \> [\target path].

|Semantic character          | Meaning  |
|:---------------------------|:---------|
| **\\**                     | root level indicator        |
| **\>**                     | [source] and [target] mapping operator        |
|**\|** or RETURN (new line) | separator of two folder-mapping instructions. </br>Alternatively, you can omit this character and press enter to get the next mapping expression on its own line.        |

### Examples
Moves the content of folder “User data” to the root of the target file share:
``` console
\User data > \\
```
Moves the entire volume content into a new path on the target file share:
``` console
\ \> \Apps\HR tracker
```
Moves the source folder content to into a new path on the target file share:
``` console
\HR resumes-Backup \> \Backups\HR\resumes
```
Sorts multiple source locations into a new directory structure:
``` console
\HR\Candidate Tracker\v1.0 > \Apps\Candidate tracker
\HR\Candidates\Resumes > \HR\Candidates\New
\Archive\HR\Old Resumes > \HR\Candidates\Archived
```

### Semantic rules
* Always specify folder paths relative to the root level. 
* Begin each folder path with a root level indicator "\". 
* Do not include drive letters. 
* When specifying multiple paths, source or target paths cannot overlap:</br>
   Invalid source path overlap example:</br>
    *\\folder\1 > \\folder*</br>
    *\\folder\\1\\2 > \\folder2*</br>
   Invalid target path overlap example:</br>
   *\\folder > \\*</br>
   *\\folder2 > \\*</br>
* Source folders that do not exist, will be ignored. 
* Folder structures that do not exist on the target, will be created. 
* Like Windows: folder names are case insensitive but case preserving.

> [!NOTE]
> contents of the "*\System Volume Information*" folder and the "*$Recycle.Bin*" on your StorSimple volume will be not be copied by the transformation job.

### Phase 3 summary
At the end of Phase 3, you will have run your data transformation jobs from StorSimple volumes into Azure file shares. You can now focus on setting up either Azure File Sync for the share (after the migration jobs for a share have completed) or direct share access for your information workers and apps to the Azure file share.

## Phase 4: Accessing your Azure file shares

There are two main strategies for accessing your Azure file shares:

* **Azure File Sync:** [How to deploy Azure File Sync](#deploy-azure-file-sync) to an on-premises Windows Server. AFS has all the advantages of a local cache, just like StorSimple.
* **Direct share access:** [How to deploy direct-share-access](#deploy-direct-share-access). Use this strategy if your access scenario for a given Azure file share will not benefit from local caching or you have no longer an ability to host an on-premises Windows Server. Here, your users and apps will continue to access SMB shares over the SMB protocol, but these shares are no longer on an on-premises server, but directly in the cloud.

You should have already decided which option is best for you, in [phase 1](#phase-1-prepare-for-migration) of this guide.

The remainder of this section focuses on deployment instructions.

### Deploy Azure File Sync

It is time to deploy a part of Azure File Sync:
1. Create the Azure File Sync cloud resource.
1. Deploy the Azure File Sync agent on your on-prem server.
1. Register the server with the cloud resource

Do not yet create any sync groups. Setting up sync with an Azure file share should only occur once your migration jobs to an Azure file share have completed. If you were to begin using File Sync before your migration completes, it will make your migration unnecessarily difficult since you cannot easily tell when it is time to initiate a cut-over.

#### Deploy the Azure File Sync cloud resource

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-deploy-afs-sss](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-deploy-azure-file-sync-storage-sync-service.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you like to change in which Azure region your data resides in when the migration is done, then deploy the Storage Sync Service in the same region as the target storage accounts for this migration.

#### Deploy an on-premises Windows Server

* Create a Windows Server 2019 - at a minimum 2012R2 - as a virtual machine or physical server. A Windows Server fail-over cluster is also supported. Don't reuse the server fronting the StorSimple 8100 or 8600.
* Provision or add Direct Attached Storage (DAS as compared to NAS, which is not supported).

It is best practice to give your new Windows Server an equal or larger amount of storage than your StorSimple 8100 or 8600 appliance has locally available for caching. You will use the Windows Server the same way you used the StorSimple appliance, if it has the same amount of storage as the appliance then the caching experience should be similar, if not the same.
You can add or remove storage from your Windows Server at will. This enables you to scale your local volume size and the amount of local storage available for caching.

#### Prepare the Windows Server for file sync

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-deploy-afs-agent](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-deploy-azure-file-sync-agent.md)]

#### Configure Azure File Sync on the Windows Server

Your registered on-premises Windows Server must be ready and connected to the internet for this process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your StorSimple migration of files and folders into the Azure file share must be complete before you proceed. Make sure there are no more changes done to the file share.

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-configure-sync](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-configure-sync.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to turn on cloud tiering! Cloud tiering is the Azure File Sync feature that allows the local server to have less storage capacity than is stored in the cloud, yet have the full namespace available. Locally interesting data is also cached locally for fast, local access performance. Another reason to turn on cloud tiering at this step is that we do not want to sync file content at this stage, only the namespace should be moving at this time.

### Phase 4 summary
In this phase you've created and run multiple *Data Transformation Service* (DTS) jobs in your *StorSimple Data Manager*. Those jobs have migrated your files and folders to Azure file shares. Furthermore, you've deployed either Azure File Sync or prepared your network and storage accounts for direct-share-access.

## Phase 5: User cut-over
This phase is all about wrapping up your migration:
* Plan your downtime.
* Catch-up with any changes your users and apps produced on the StorSimple side while the Data Transformation jobs in Phase 3 have been running. 
* Fail your users over to the new Windows Server with Azure File Sync or the Azure file shares via direct-share-access.

### Plan your downtime
This migration approach requires some downtime for your users and apps. The goal is to keep downtime to a minimum and the following considerations can help:

* Keep your StorSimple volumes available while running your data transformation jobs.
* When you finished running your data migration job(s) for a share, it's time to remove user access (at least write access) from the StorSimple volumes/shares. A final RoboCopy will catch up your Azure file share, then you can cut-over your users. Where you run RoboCopy depends on whether you chose to use Azure File Sync or direct-share-access. The upcoming section on RoboCopy covers that.
* Once you completed the RoboCopy catch-up, you are ready to expose the new location to your users. Either the Azure file share directly or an SMB share on a Windows Server with AFS. Often a DFS-N deployment will help accomplish a cut-over quickly, and efficiently. It will keep your existing share addresses consistent and repoint to a new location, containing your migrated files and folders.

### Determine when your namespace has fully synced to your server

When you use Azure File Sync for an Azure file share, it is important that you determine your entire namespace has finished downloading to the server BEFORE you start any local RoboCopy. The time it takes to download your namespace depends on the number of items in your Azure file share. There are two methods for determining whether your namespace has fully arrived on the server:

#### Azure portal
You can use the Azure portal to see when your namespace has fully arrived.
* Sign in to the Azure portal, navigate to your sync group and check the sync status of your sync group and server endpoint. 
* The interesting direction is download: If the server endpoint is newly provisioned, it will show **Initial sync** indicating the namespace is still coming down.
Once that changes to anything but *Initial sync*, your namespace will be fully populated on the server and you are good to proceed with a local RoboCopy.

#### Windows Server Event Viewer
ou can also use the Event Viewer on your Windows Server to tell when the namespace has fully arrived.

1. Open the **Event Viewer** and navigate to **Applications and Services**.
1. Navigate and open **Microsoft\FileSync\Agent\Telemetry**.
1. Look for the most recent **event 9102**, which corresponds to a completed sync session.
1. Select **Details** and confirm that you are looking at an event where the **SyncDirection** value is **Download**.
1. For the time where your namespace has completed download to the server, there will be a single event with **Scenario**, value **FullGhostedSync** and **HResult** = **0**.
1. Should you miss that event, you can also look for other **9102 events** with **SyncDirection** = **Download** and **Scenario** = **"RegularSync"**. Finding one of these events also indicates that the namespace has finished downloading and sync progressed to regular sync sessions, whether there is anything to sync or not, at this time.

### A final RoboCopy
At this point, there are differences between your on-premises Windows Server and the StorSimple 8100 or 8600 appliance:

1. You need to catch up with the changes that users/apps produced on the StorSimple side while the migration was ongoing.
1. For cases where you use Azure File Sync: The StorSimple appliance has a populated cache vs. the Windows Server just a namespace with no file content stored locally at this time. So the final RoboCopy can help jump-start your local AFS cache by pulling over locally cached file content as much as is available and can fit on the AFS server.
1. Some files may have been left behind by the data transformation job due to invalid characters. If so, copy them to the Azure File Sync enabled Windows Server. Later on you can adjust them so that they will sync. If you don't use Azure File Sync for a particular share, you'd be better off renaming the files with invalid characters on the StorSimple volume and then run the RoboCopy directly against the Azure file share. 

> [!WARNING]
> You must not start the RoboCopy before the server has the namespace for an Azure file share downloaded fully!
> Checkout: "[Determine when your namespace has fully downloaded to your server](#determine-when-your-namespace-has-fully-synced-to-your-server)"

 You only want to copy files that were changed after the migration job last ran and files that haven't moved through said jobs before. You can solve the problems why they didn't move later on the server, after the migration is complete. See [Azure File Sync troubleshooting](storage-sync-files-troubleshoot.md#how-do-i-see-if-there-are-specific-files-or-folders-that-are-not-syncing).

RoboCopy has several parameters. The following showcases a finished command and a list of reasons for choosing these parameters:

```console
Robocopy /MT:16 /UNILOG:<file name> /TEE /B /MIR /COPYALL /DCOPY:DAT <SourcePath> <Dest.Path>
```

Background:

   :::column span="1":::
      /MIR
   :::column-end:::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::

When you configure source and target locations of the RoboCopy command, make sure you review the structure of source and target to ensure they match. If you used the directory-mapping feature of the migration job, your root-directory structure might be different than the structure of your StorSimple volume. If that's the case, you may need multiple RoboCopy jobs, one for each sub-directory. Since this RoboCopy command uses /MIR - it will not move files that are the same (tiered files for instance), but if you get source and target path wrong, /MIR also purges directory structures on your Windows Server / Azure file share, that are not present on the StorSimple source path. So they must match exactly for the RoboCopy job to reach it's intended goal of just updating your migrated content with the latest changes made while the migration ongoing. 

Consult the RoboCopy log file to see if files have been left behind. If issues exist, fix them, and rerun the RoboCopy command. Do not deprovision any StorSimple resources before you fix outstanding issues for files or folders you care about.

If you don't use Azure File Sync to cache the particular Azure file share in question, but rather opted for direct-share-access:
1. [Mount your Azure file share](storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md#mount-the-azure-file-share) as a network drive to a local Windows machine.
1. Perform the RoboCopy between your StorSimple and the mounted Azure file share. If files don't copy, fix up their names on the StorSimple side to remove invalid characters and retry RoboCopy. The previously listed RoboCopy command can be run multiple times w/o causing unnecessary recall to StorSimple.

### User cut-over

If you use Azure File Sync, you likely need to create the SMB shares on that AFS enabled Windows Server that match the shares you had on the StorSimple volumes. You can front-load this step and do it earlier to not lose time here, but you must ensure that before this point, nobody has access to cause changes to the Windows Server.

If you have a DFS-N deployment, you can point the DFN-Namespaces to the new server folder locations. If you do not have a DFS-N deployment, and you fronted your 8100 / 8600 appliance locally with a Windows Server, you can take that server off the domain. Then domain join your new, Azure File Sync enabled, Windows Server. During that process, give the server the same server name and share names as the old server, so that cut-over remains transparent for your users, group policy, and scripts.

## Deprovision
When you deprovision a resource, you lose access to the configuration of that resource, as well as its data. Deprovisioning cannot be undone, so do not proceed until you've confirmed that your migration is complete and there are no dependencies whatsoever on the StorSimple files, folders, or volume backups that you are about to deprovision.

Before you begin, it is a best practice to observe your new Azure File Sync deployment in production, for a bit. That gives you options to fix any problems you might encounter.
Once you have observed your Azure File Sync deployment for at least a few days, you can begin to deprovision resources in this order:

1. Deprovision your StorSimple Data Manager resource via the Azure portal.
   All of your DTS jobs will be deleted with it. You won't be able to easily retrieve the copy logs. If they are important for your records, retrieve them before you deprovision.
1. Make sure that your StorSimple physical appliances have been migrated, then unregister them.
   If you aren't completely sure that they have been migrated, do not proceed. If you deprovision these resources while they are still necessary, you will not be able to recover the data or their configuration.
1. If there are no more registered devices left in a StorSimple Device Manager, you can proceed to remove that Device Manager resource itself.
1. It is now time to delete the StorSimple storage account in Azure. Again, stop and confirm your migration is complete and nothing and no one depends on this data, before you proceed.
1. Unplug the StorSimple physical appliance from your data center.
1. If you own the StorSimple appliance, you are free to PC Recycle it. 
   If your device is leased, inform the lessor and return the device as appropriate.

Your migration is complete.
