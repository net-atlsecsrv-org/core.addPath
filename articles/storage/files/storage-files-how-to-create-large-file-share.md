# Enable and create large file shares

When you enable large file shares on your storage account, your file shares can scale up to 100 TiB. You can enable this scaling on your existing storage accounts for your existing file shares.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- If you intend to use the Azure CLI, [install the latest version](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
- If you intend to use Azure PowerShell, [install the latest version](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.0.0).

## Restrictions

For now, you can only use locally-redundant storage (LRS) or zone-redundant storage (ZRS) on large file share–enabled accounts. You can't use geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), or read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS).
Enabling large file shares on an account is an irreversible process. After you enable it, you won't be able to convert your account to GZRS, GRS, or RA-GRS.

## Create a new storage account

### Portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the Azure portal, select **All services**. 
1. In the list of resources, enter **Storage Accounts**. As you type, the list filters based on your input. Select **Storage Accounts**.
1. On the **Storage Accounts** window that appears, select **Add**.
1. Select the subscription that you'll use to create the storage account.
1. Under the **Resource group** field, select **Create new**. Enter a name for your new resource group.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create a resource group in the portal](media/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share/create-large-file-share.png)

1. Next, enter a name for your storage account. The name must be unique across Azure. The name also must be 3 to 24 characters in length, and it can only have numbers and lowercase letters.
1. Select a location for your storage account, and make sure it's [one of the supported replication for large file shares](storage-files-planning.md#regional-availability).
1. Set the replication to either **Locally redundant storage** or **Zone-redundant storage**.
1. Leave these fields at their default values:

   |Field  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Deployment model     |Resource Manager         |
   |Performance     |Standard         |
   |Account kind     |StorageV2 (general-purpose v2)         |
   |Access tier     |Hot         |

1. Select **Advanced**, and then select the **Enabled** option button to the right of **Large file shares**.
1. Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.

    ![Screenshot with the "enabled" option button on a new storage account in the Azure portal](media/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share/large-file-shares-advanced-enable.png)

1. Select **Create**.

### CLI

First, [install the latest version of the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) so that you can enable large file shares.

To create a storage account with large file shares enabled, use the following command. Replace `<yourStorageAccountName>`, `<yourResourceGroup>`, and `<yourDesiredRegion>` with your information.

```azurecli-interactive
## This command creates a large file share–enabled account. It will not support GZRS, GRS, or RA-GRS.
az storage account create --name <yourStorageAccountName> -g <yourResourceGroup> -l <yourDesiredRegion> --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2 --enable-large-file-share
```

### PowerShell

First, [install the latest version of PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.0.0) so that you can enable large file shares.

To create a storage account with large file shares enabled, use the following command. Replace `<yourStorageAccountName>`, `<yourResourceGroup>`, and `<yourDesiredRegion>` with your information.

```powershell
## This command creates a large file share–enabled account. It will not support GZRS, GRS, or RA-GRS.
New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <yourResourceGroup> -Name <yourStorageAccountName> -Location <yourDesiredRegion> -SkuName Standard_LRS -EnableLargeFileShare;
```

## Enable large files shares on an existing account

You can also enable large file shares on your existing accounts. If you enable large file shares, you won't be able to convert to GZRS, GRS, or RA-GRS. Enabling large file shares is irreversible on this storage account.

### Portal

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and go to the storage account where you want to enable large file shares.
1. Open the storage account and select **Configuration**.
1. Select **Enabled** on **Large file shares**, and then select **Save**.
1. Select **Overview** and select **Refresh**.

![Selecting the Enabled option button on an existing storage account in the Azure portal](media/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share/enable-large-file-shares-on-existing.png)

You've now enabled large file shares on your storage account. Next, you must update existing share's quota to take advantage of increased capacity and scale.

If you receive the error message "Large file shares are not available for the account yet," your region might be in the middle of completing its rollout. Contact support if you have an urgent need for large file shares.

### CLI

To enable large file shares on your existing account, use the following command. Replace `<yourStorageAccountName>` and `<yourResourceGroup>` with your information.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account update --name <yourStorageAccountName> -g <yourResourceGroup> --enable-large-file-share
```

### PowerShell

To enable large file shares on your existing account, use the following command. Replace `<yourStorageAccountName>` and `<yourResourceGroup>` with your information.

```powershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <yourResourceGroup> -Name <yourStorageAccountName> -EnableLargeFileShare
```

## Create a large file share

After you've enabled large file shares on your storage account, you can create file shares in that account with higher quotas. 

### Portal

Creating a large file share is almost identical to creating a standard file share. The main difference is that you can set a quota up to 100 TiB.

1. From your storage account, select **File shares**.
1. Select **+ File share**.
1. Enter a name for your file share. You can also set the quota size you'd like, up to 100 TiB. Then select **Create**.

### CLI

To create a large file share, use the following command. Replace `<yourStorageAccountName>`, `<yourStorageAccountKey>`, and `<yourFileShareName>` with your information.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage share create --account-name <yourStorageAccountName> --account-key <yourStorageAccountKey> --name <yourFileShareName>
```

### PowerShell

To create a large file share, use the following command. Replace `<YourStorageAccountName>`, `<YourStorageAccountKey>`, and `<YourStorageAccountFileShareName>` with your information.

```powershell
##Config
$storageAccountName = "<YourStorageAccountName>"
$storageAccountKey = "<YourStorageAccountKey>"
$shareName="<YourStorageAccountFileShareName>"
$ctx = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $storageAccountKey
New-AzStorageShare -Name $shareName -Context $ctx
```

## Expand existing file shares

After you've enabled large file shares on your storage account, you can also expand existing file shares in that account to the higher quota. 

### Portal

1. From your storage account, select **File shares**.
1. Right-click your file share, and then select **Quota**.
1. Enter the new size that you want, and then select **OK**.

### CLI

To set the quota to the maximum size, use the following command. Replace `<yourStorageAccountName>`, `<yourStorageAccountKey>`, and `<yourFileShareName>` with your information.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage share update --account-name <yourStorageAccountName> --account-key <yourStorageAccountKey> --name <yourFileShareName> --quota 102400
```

### PowerShell

To set the quota to the maximum size, use the following command. Replace `<YourStorageAccountName>`, `<YourStorageAccountKey>`, and `<YourStorageAccountFileShareName>` with your information.

```powershell
##Config
$storageAccountName = "<YourStorageAccountName>"
$storageAccountKey = "<YourStorageAccountKey>"
$shareName="<YourStorageAccountFileShareName>"
$ctx = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $storageAccountKey
# update quota
Set-AzStorageShareQuota -ShareName $shareName -Context $ctx -Quota 102400
```
