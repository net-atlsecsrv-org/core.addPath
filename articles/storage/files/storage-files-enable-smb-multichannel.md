# Enable SMB Multichannel on a FileStorage account (preview) 

Azure FileStorage accounts support SMB Multichannel (preview), which increases the performance from an SMB 3.x client by establishing multiple network connections to your premium file shares. This article provides step-by-step guidance to enable SMB Multichannel on an existing storage account. For detailed information on Azure Files SMB Multichannel, see SMB Multichannel performance.

## Limitations

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-smb-multi-channel-restrictions](../../../includes/storage-files-smb-multi-channel-restrictions.md)]

### Regional availability

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-smb-multi-channel-regions](../../../includes/storage-files-smb-multi-channel-regions.md)]

## Prerequisites

- [Create a FileStorage account](storage-how-to-create-premium-fileshare.md).
- If you intend to use the Azure PowerShell module, [install the 3.0.1-preview version of the module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Storage/3.0.1-preview).

## Getting started

Open a PowerShell window and sign into your Azure subscription. From there, you can register for the SMB Multichannel preview with the following commands.

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount
# Setting your active subscription to the one you want to register for the preview. 
# Replace the <subscription-id> placeholder with your subscription id. 
$context = Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId <your-subscription-id> 
Set-AzContext $context

Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowSMBMultichannel -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage 
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Registration may take up to an hour.

### Verify that feature registration is complete

Since it may take up to an hour to enable the feature on your storage account, you may want to use the following command to validate that it is registered for your subscription:

```azurepowershell
Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowSMBMultichannel -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage
```


## Enable SMB Multichannel 
Once you have created a FileStorage account, you can follow the instructions to update SMB Multichannel settings for your storage account.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
1. Sign into the Azure portal and navigate to the FileStorage storage account you want to configure SMB Multichannel on.
1. Select **File shares** under **File service**, and then select **File share settings**.
1. Toggle **SMB Multichannel** to **on** (or **off** to disable) and select **save**.

If the SMB Multichannel option is not visible under **File share settings** or you get a failed to update setting error while updating the configuration, please make sure that your subscription is registered and your account is in one of the [supported regions](#regional-availability) with supported account type and replication.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To enable SMB Multichannel using the Azure PowerShell module, you must [install the 3.0.1-preview version](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Storage/3.0.1-preview) of the module.

Set the variables `$resourceGroupName` and `$storageAccountName` to your resource group and storage account before running these PowerShell commands.

```azurepowershell
# Enable SMB Multichannel on the premium storage account that's in one of the supported regions
Update-AzStorageFileServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -EnableSmbMultichannel $true 
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
Azure CLI does not yet support configuring SMB Multichannel. See the portal instructions to configure SMB Multichannel on storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> Any changes to SMB Multichannel configuration settings will apply to all file shares under the storage account. You will need to remount the share on your client for the changes to take effect, though.
