# Troubleshoot Azure Files problems in Windows

This article lists common problems that are related to Microsoft Azure Files when you connect from Windows clients. It also provides possible causes and resolutions for these problems. In addition to the troubleshooting steps in this article, you can also use [AzFileDiagnostics](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Troubleshooting-tool-for-a9fa1fe5) to ensure that the Windows client environment has correct prerequisites. AzFileDiagnostics automates detection of most of the symptoms mentioned in this article and helps set up your environment to get optimal performance. You can also find this information in the [Azure Files shares Troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4022301/troubleshooter-for-azure-files-shares) that provides steps to assist you with problems connecting/mapping/mounting Azure Files shares.

<a id="error5"></a>
## Error 5 when you mount an Azure file share

When you try to mount a file share, you might receive the following error:

- System error 5 has occurred. Access is denied.

### Cause 1: Unencrypted communication channel

For security reasons, connections to Azure file shares are blocked if the communication channel isn't encrypted and if the connection attempt isn't made from the same datacenter where the Azure file shares reside. Unencrypted connections within the same datacenter can also be blocked if the [Secure transfer required](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer) setting is enabled on the storage account. An encrypted communication channel is provided only if the user's client OS supports SMB encryption.

Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and later versions of each system negotiate requests that include SMB 3.0, which supports encryption.

### Solution for cause 1

1. Connect from a client that supports SMB encryption (Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 or later) or connect from a virtual machine in the same datacenter as the Azure storage account that is used for the Azure file share.
2. Verify the [Secure transfer required](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer) setting is disabled on the storage account if the client does not support SMB encryption.

### Cause 2: Virtual network or firewall rules are enabled on the storage account 

If virtual network (VNET) and firewall rules are configured on the storage account, network traffic will be denied access unless the client IP address or virtual network is allowed access.

### Solution for cause 2

Verify virtual network and firewall rules are configured properly on the storage account. To test if virtual network or firewall rules is causing the issue, temporarily change the setting on the storage account to **Allow access from all networks**. To learn more, see [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security).

<a id="error53-67-87"></a>
## Error 53, Error 67, or Error 87 when you mount or unmount an Azure file share

When you try to mount a file share from on-premises or from a different datacenter, you might receive the following errors:

- System error 53 has occurred. The network path was not found.
- System error 67 has occurred. The network name cannot be found.
- System error 87 has occurred. The parameter is incorrect.

### Cause 1: Port 445 is blocked

System error 53 or system error 67 can occur if port 445 outbound communication to an Azure Files datacenter is blocked. To see the summary of ISPs that allow or disallow access from port 445, go to [TechNet](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32346.azure-summary-of-isps-that-allow-disallow-access-from-port-445.aspx).

To check if your firewall or ISP is blocking port 445, use the [AzFileDiagnostics](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Troubleshooting-tool-for-a9fa1fe5) tool or `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet. 

To use the `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet, the Azure PowerShell module must be installed, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps) for more information. Remember to replace `<your-storage-account-name>` and `<your-resource-group-name>` with the relevant names for your storage account.

   
    $resourceGroupName = "<your-resource-group-name>"
    $storageAccountName = "<your-storage-account-name>"

    # This command requires you to be logged into your Azure account, run Login-AzAccount if you haven't
    # already logged in.
    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName

    # The ComputerName, or host, is <storage-account>.file.core.windows.net for Azure Public Regions.
    # $storageAccount.Context.FileEndpoint is used because non-Public Azure regions, such as sovereign clouds
    # or Azure Stack deployments, will have different hosts for Azure file shares (and other storage resources).
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName ([System.Uri]::new($storageAccount.Context.FileEndPoint).Host) -Port 445
    
If the connection was successful, you should see the following output:
    
  
    ComputerName     : <your-storage-account-name>
    RemoteAddress    : <storage-account-ip-address>
    RemotePort       : 445
    InterfaceAlias   : <your-network-interface>
    SourceAddress    : <your-ip-address>
    TcpTestSucceeded : True
 

> [!Note]  
> The above command returns the current IP address of the storage account. This IP address is not guaranteed to remain the same, and may change at any time. Do not hardcode this IP address into any scripts, or into a firewall configuration.

### Solution for cause 1

#### Solution 1 - Use Azure File Sync
Azure File Sync can transform your on-premises Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. Azure File Sync works over port 443 and can thus be used as a workaround to access Azure Files from clients that have port 445 blocked. [Learn how to setup Azure File Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-sync-files-extend-servers).

#### Solution 2 - Use VPN
By Setting up a VPN to your specific Storage Account, the traffic will go through a secure tunnel as opposed to over the internet. Follow the [instructions to setup VPN](storage-files-configure-p2s-vpn-windows.md) to access Azure Files from Windows.

#### Solution 3 - Unblock port 445 with help of your ISP/IT Admin
Work with your IT department or ISP to open port 445 outbound to [Azure IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).

#### Solution 4 - Use REST API based tools like Storage Explorer/Powershell
Azure Files also supports REST in addition to SMB. REST access works over port 443 (standard tcp). There are various tools that are written using REST API which enable rich UI experience. [Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows) is one of them. [Download and Install Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) and connect to your file share backed by Azure Files. You can also use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-powershell) which also user REST API.

### Cause 2: NTLMv1 is enabled

System error 53 or system error 87 can occur if NTLMv1 communication is enabled on the client. Azure Files supports only NTLMv2 authentication. Having NTLMv1 enabled creates a less-secure client. Therefore, communication is blocked for Azure Files. 

To determine whether this is the cause of the error, verify that the following registry subkey is set to a value of 3:

**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa > LmCompatibilityLevel**

For more information, see the [LmCompatibilityLevel](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc960646.aspx) topic on TechNet.

### Solution for cause 2

Revert the **LmCompatibilityLevel** value to the default value of 3 in the following registry subkey:

  **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa**

<a id="error1816"></a>
## Error 1816 "Not enough quota is available to process this command" when you copy to an Azure file share

### Cause

Error 1816 happens when you reach the upper limit of concurrent open handles that are allowed for a file on the computer where the file share is being mounted.

### Solution

Reduce the number of concurrent open handles by closing some handles, and then retry. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Storage performance and scalability checklist](../common/storage-performance-checklist.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json).

To view open handles for a file share, directory or file, use the [Get-AzStorageFileHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstoragefilehandle) PowerShell cmdlet.  

To close open handles for a file share, directory or file, use the [Close-AzStorageFileHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/close-azstoragefilehandle) PowerShell cmdlet.

> [!Note]  
> The Get-AzStorageFileHandle and Close-AzStorageFileHandle cmdlets are included in Az PowerShell module version 2.4 or later. To install the latest Az PowerShell module, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## Error “Authorization failure” when browsing to an Azure file share in the portal

When you browse to an Azure file share in the portal, you may receive the following error:

Authorization failure  
You do not have access 

### Cause 1: Your user account does not have access to the storage account

### Solution for cause 1

Browse to the storage account where the Azure file share is located, click **Access control (IAM)** and verify your user account has access to the storage account. To learn more, see [How to secure your storage account with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-security-guide#how-to-secure-your-storage-account-with-role-based-access-control-rbac).

### Cause 2: Virtual network or firewall rules are enabled on the storage account

### Solution for cause 2

Verify virtual network and firewall rules are configured properly on the storage account. To test if virtual network or firewall rules is causing the issue, temporarily change the setting on the storage account to **Allow access from all networks**. To learn more, see [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security).

<a id="open-handles"></a>
## Unable to delete a file or directory in an Azure file share

### Cause
This issue typically occurs if the file or directory has an open handle. 

### Solution

If the SMB clients have closed all open handles and the issue continues to occur, perform the following:

- Use the [Get-AzStorageFileHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstoragefilehandle) PowerShell cmdlet to view open handles.

- Use the [Close-AzStorageFileHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/close-azstoragefilehandle) PowerShell cmdlet to close open handles. 

> [!Note]  
> The Get-AzStorageFileHandle and Close-AzStorageFileHandle cmdlets are included in Az PowerShell module version 2.4 or later. To install the latest Az PowerShell module, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

<a id="slowfilecopying"></a>
## Slow file copying to and from Azure Files in Windows

You might see slow performance when you try to transfer files to the Azure File service.

- If you don't have a specific minimum I/O size requirement, we recommend that you use 1 MiB as the I/O size for optimal performance.
-	If you know the final size of a file that you are extending with writes, and your software doesn't have compatibility problems when the unwritten tail on the file contains zeros, then set the file size in advance instead of making every write an extending write.
-	Use the right copy method:
    -	Use [AzCopy](../common/storage-use-azcopy.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json) for any transfer between two file shares.
    -	Use [Robocopy](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/granth/2009/12/07/multi-threaded-robocopy-for-faster-copies/) between file shares on an on-premises computer.

### Considerations for Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2

For clients that are running Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2, make sure that the [KB3114025](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3114025) hotfix is installed. This hotfix improves the performance of create and close handles.

You can run the following script to check whether the hotfix has been installed:

`reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\Policies`

If hotfix is installed, the following output is displayed:

`HKEY_Local_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\Policies {96c345ef-3cac-477b-8fcd-bea1a564241c} REG_DWORD 0x1`

> [!Note]
> Windows Server 2012 R2 images in Azure Marketplace have hotfix KB3114025 installed by default, starting in December 2015.

<a id="shareismissing"></a>
## No folder with a drive letter in "My Computer" or "This PC"

If you map an Azure file share as an administrator by using net use, the share appears to be missing.

### Cause

By default, Windows File Explorer does not run as an administrator. If you run net use from an administrative command prompt, you map the network drive as an administrator. Because mapped drives are user-centric, the user account that is logged in does not display the drives if they are mounted under a different user account.

### Solution
Mount the share from a non-administrator command line. Alternatively, you can follow [this TechNet topic](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee844140.aspx) to configure the **EnableLinkedConnections** registry value.

<a id="netuse"></a>
## Net use command fails if the storage account contains a forward slash

### Cause

The net use command interprets a forward slash (/) as a command-line option. If your user account name starts with a forward slash, the drive mapping fails.

### Solution

You can use either of the following steps to work around the problem:

- Run the following PowerShell command:

  `New-SmbMapping -LocalPath y: -RemotePath \\server\share -UserName accountName -Password "password can contain / and \ etc"`

  From a batch file, you can run the command this way:

  `Echo new-smbMapping ... | powershell -command –`

- Put double quotation marks around the key to work around this problem--unless the forward slash is the first character. If it is, either use the interactive mode and enter your password separately or regenerate your keys to get a key that doesn't start with a forward slash.

<a id="cannotaccess"></a>
## Application or service cannot access a mounted Azure Files drive

### Cause

Drives are mounted per user. If your application or service is running under a different user account than the one that mounted the drive, the application will not see the drive.

### Solution

Use one of the following solutions:

-	Mount the drive from the same user account that contains the application. You can use a tool such as PsExec.
- Pass the storage account name and key in the user name and password parameters of the net use command.
- Use the cmdkey command to add the credentials into Credential Manager. Perform this from a command line under the service account context, either through an interactive login or by using runas.
  
  `cmdkey /add:<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net /user:AZURE\<storage-account-name> /pass:<storage-account-key>`
- Map the share directly without using a mapped drive letter. Some applications may not reconnect to the drive letter properly, so using the full UNC path may be more reliable. 

  `net use * \\storage-account-name.file.core.windows.net\share`

After you follow these instructions, you might receive the following error message when you run net use for the system/network service account: "System error 1312 has occurred. A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated." If this occurs, make sure that the username that is passed to net use includes domain information (for example: "[storage account name].file.core.windows.net").

<a id="doesnotsupportencryption"></a>
## Error "You are copying a file to a destination that does not support encryption"

When a file is copied over the network, the file is decrypted on the source computer, transmitted in plaintext, and re-encrypted at the destination. However, you might see the following error when you're trying to copy an encrypted file: "You are copying the file to a destination that does not support encryption."

### Cause
This problem can occur if you are using Encrypting File System (EFS). BitLocker-encrypted files can be copied to Azure Files. However, Azure Files does not support NTFS EFS.

### Workaround
To copy a file over the network, you must first decrypt it. Use one of the following methods:

- Use the **copy /d** command. It allows the encrypted files to be saved as decrypted files at the destination.
- Set the following registry key:
  - Path = HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System
  - Value type = DWORD
  - Name = CopyFileAllowDecryptedRemoteDestination
  - Value = 1

Be aware that setting the registry key affects all copy operations that are made to network shares.

## Slow enumeration of files and folders

### Cause

This problem can occur if there is no enough cache on client machine for large directories.

### Solution

To resolve this problem,  adjusting the **DirectoryCacheEntrySizeMax** registry value  to allow caching of larger directory listings in the client machine:

- Location: HKLM\System\CCS\Services\Lanmanworkstation\Parameters
- Value mane: DirectoryCacheEntrySizeMax 
- Value type:DWORD
 
 
For example, you can set it to 0x100000 and see if the performance become better.

## Error AadDsTenantNotFound in enabling Azure Active Directory Domain Service (AAD DS) authentication for Azure Files "Unable to locate active tenants with tenant Id aad-tenant-id"

### Cause

Error AadDsTenantNotFound happens when you try to [enable Azure Active Directory Domain Service (AAD DS) authentication for Azure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-active-directory-enable) on a storage account where [AAD Domain Service(AAD DS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-overview) is not created on the AAD tenant of the associated subscription.  

### Solution

Enable AAD DS on the AAD tenant of the subscription that your storage account is deployed to. You need administrator privileges of the AAD tenant to create a managed domain. If you aren't the administrator of the Azure AD tenant, contact the administrator and follow the step-by-step guidance to [Enable Azure Active Directory Domain Services using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-getting-started).

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-condition-headers](../../../includes/storage-files-condition-headers.md)]

## Error 'System error 1359 has occurred. An internal error' received over SMB access to file shares with Azure Active Directory Domain Service (AAD DS) authentication enabled

### Cause

Error 'System error 1359 has occurred. An internal error' happens when you try to connect to your file share with AAD DS authentication enabled against an AAD DS with domain DNS name starting with a numeric character. For example, if your AAD DS Domain DNS name is "1domain", you will get this error when attempting to mount the file share using AAD credentials. 

### Solution

Currently, you can consider redeploying your AAD DS using a new domain DNS name that applies with the rules below:
- Names cannot begin with a numeric character.
- Names must be from 3 to 63 characters long.
