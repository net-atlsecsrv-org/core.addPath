# Mount Azure file share over SMB with macOS
[Azure Files](storage-files-introduction.md) is Microsoft's easy-to-use cloud file system. Azure file shares can be mounted with the industry standard SMB 3 protocol by macOS El Capitan 10.11+. This article shows two different ways to mount an Azure file share on macOS: with the Finder UI and using the Terminal.

> [!Note]  
> Before mounting an Azure file share over SMB, we recommend disabling SMB packet signing. Not doing so may yield poor performance when accessing the Azure file share from macOS. Your SMB connection will be encrypted, so this does not affect the security of your connection. From the terminal, the following commands will disable SMB packet signing, as described by this [Apple support article on disabling SMB packet signing](https://support.apple.com/HT205926):  
>    ```
>    sudo -s
>    echo "[default]" >> /etc/nsmb.conf
>    echo "signing_required=no" >> /etc/nsmb.conf
>    exit
>    ```

## Prerequisites for mounting an Azure file share on macOS
* **Storage account name**: To mount an Azure file share, you will need the name of the storage account.

* **Storage account key**: To mount an Azure file share, you will need the primary (or secondary) storage key. SAS keys are not currently supported for mounting.

* **Ensure port 445 is open**: SMB communicates over TCP port 445. On your client machine (the Mac), check to make sure your firewall is not blocking TCP port 445.

## Mount an Azure file share via Finder
1. **Open Finder**: Finder is open on macOS by default, but you can ensure it is the currently selected application by clicking the "macOS face icon" on the dock:

2. **Select "Connect to Server" from the "Go" Menu**: Using the UNC path from the prerequisites, convert the beginning double backslash (`\\`) to `smb://` and all other backslashes (`\`) to forwards slashes (`/`). Your link should look like the following:

3. **Use the storage account name and storage account key when prompted for a username and password**: When you click "Connect" on the "Connect to Server" dialog, you will be prompted for the username and password (This will be autopopulated with your macOS username). You have the option of placing the storage account name/storage account key in your macOS Keychain.

4. **Use the Azure file share as desired**: After substituting the share name and storage account key in for the username and password, the share will be mounted. You may use this as you would normally use a local folder/file share, including dragging and dropping files into the file share:

## Mount an Azure file share via Terminal
1. Replace `<storage-account-name>` with the name of your storage account. Provide Storage Account Key as password when prompted. 

    ```
    mount_smbfs //<storage-account-name>@<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net/<share-name> <desired-mount-point>
    ```

2. **Use the Azure file share as desired**: The Azure file share will be mounted at the mount point specified by the previous command.
