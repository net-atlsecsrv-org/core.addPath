# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Azure Files
[Azure Files](storage-files-introduction.md) offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard [Server Message Block (SMB) protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365233.aspx). You can mount Azure file shares concurrently on cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. You also can cache Azure file shares on Windows Server machines by using Azure File Sync for fast access close to where the data is used.

## General
* <a id="why-files-useful"></a>
  **How is Azure Files useful?**  
   You can use Azure Files to create file shares in the cloud, without being responsible for managing the overhead of a physical server, device, or appliance. We do the monotonous work for you, including applying OS updates and replacing bad disks. To learn more about the scenarios that Azure Files can help you with, see [Why Azure Files is useful](storage-files-introduction.md#why-azure-files-is-useful).

* <a id="file-access-options"></a>
  **What are different ways to access files in Azure Files?**  
    You can mount the file share on your local machine by using the SMB 3.0 protocol, or you can use tools like [Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/) to access files in your file share. From your application, you can use storage client libraries, REST APIs, PowerShell, or Azure CLI to access your files in the Azure file share.

* <a id="what-is-afs"></a>
  **What is Azure File Sync?**  
    You can use Azure File Sync to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms your Windows Server machines into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, Network File System (NFS), and File Transfer Protocol Service (FTPS). You can have as many caches as you need across the world.

* <a id="files-versus-blobs"></a>
  **Why would I use an Azure file share versus Azure Blob storage for my data?**  
    Azure Files and Azure Blob storage both offer ways to store large amounts of data in the cloud, but they are useful for slightly different purposes. 
    
    Azure Blob storage is useful for massive-scale, cloud-native applications that need to store unstructured data. To maximize performance and scale, Azure Blob storage is a simpler storage abstraction than a true file system. You can access Azure Blob storage only through REST-based client libraries (or directly through the REST-based protocol).

    Azure Files is specifically a file system. Azure Files has all the file abstracts that you know and love from years of working with on-premises operating systems. Like Azure Blob storage, Azure Files offers a REST interface and REST-based client libraries. Unlike Azure Blob storage, Azure Files offers SMB access to Azure file shares. By using SMB, you can mount an Azure file share directly on Windows, Linux, or macOS, either on-premises or in cloud VMs, without writing any code or attaching any special drivers to the file system. You also can cache Azure file shares on on-premises file servers by using Azure File Sync for quick access, close to where the data is used. 
   
    For a more in-depth description on the differences between Azure Files and Azure Blob storage, see [Introduction to the core Azure Storage services](../common/storage-introduction.md). To learn more about Azure Blob storage, see [Introduction to Blob storage](../blobs/storage-blobs-introduction.md).

* <a id="files-versus-disks"></a>**Why would I use an Azure file share instead of Azure Disks?**  
    A disk in Azure Disks is simply a disk. To get value from Azure Disks, you must attach a disk to a virtual machine that's running in Azure. Azure Disks can be used for everything that you would use a disk for on an on-premises server. You can use it as an OS system disk, as swap space for an OS, or as dedicated storage for an application. An interesting use for Azure Disks is to create a file server in the cloud to use in the same places where you might use an Azure file share. Deploying a file server in Azure Virtual Machines is a high-performance way to get file storage in Azure when you require deployment options that currently are not supported by Azure Files (such as NFS protocol support or premium storage). 

    However, running a file server with Azure Disks as back-end storage typically is much more expensive than using an Azure file share, for a few reasons. First, in addition to paying for disk storage, you also must pay for the expense of running one or more Azure VMs. Second, you also must manage the VMs that are used to run the file server. For example, you are responsible for OS upgrades. Finally, if you ultimately require data to be cached on-premises, it's up to you to set up and manage replication technologies, such as Distributed File System Replication (DFSR), to make that happen.

    One approach to getting the best of both Azure Files and a file server that's hosted in Azure Virtual Machines (in addition to using Azure Disks as back-end storage) is to install Azure File Sync on a file server that's hosted on a cloud VM. If the Azure file share is in the same region as your file server, you can enable cloud tiering and set the volume of free space percentage to maximum (99%). This ensures minimal duplication of data. You also can use any applications you want with your file servers, like applications that require NFS protocol support.

    For information about an option for setting up a high-performance and highly available file server in Azure, see [Deploying IaaS VM guest clusters in Microsoft Azure](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/clustering/2017/02/14/deploying-an-iaas-vm-guest-clusters-in-microsoft-azure/). For a more in-depth description of the differences between Azure Files and Azure Disks, see [Introduction to the core Azure Storage services](../common/storage-introduction.md). To learn more about Azure Disks, see [Azure Managed Disks overview](../../virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview.md).

* <a id="get-started"></a>
  **How do I get started using Azure Files?**  
   Getting started with Azure Files is easy. First, [create a file share](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md), and then mount it in your preferred operating system: 

  * [Mount in Windows](storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md)
  * [Mount in Linux](storage-how-to-use-files-linux.md)
  * [Mount in macOS](storage-how-to-use-files-mac.md)

    For a more in-depth guide about deploying an Azure file share to replace production file shares in your organization, see [Planning for an Azure Files deployment](storage-files-planning.md).

* <a id="redundancy-options"></a>
  **What storage redundancy options are supported by Azure Files?**  
    Currently, Azure Files supports locally redundant storage (LRS), zone redundant storage (ZRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS). We plan to support read-access geo-redundant (RA-GRS) storage in the future, but we don't have timelines to share at this time.

* <a id="tier-options"></a>
  **What storage tiers are supported in Azure Files?**  
    Azure Files supports two storage tiers: premium and standard. Standard file shares are created in general purpose (GPv1 or GPv2) storage accounts and premium file shares are created in FileStorage storage accounts. Learn more about how to create [standard file shares](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md) and [premium file shares](storage-how-to-create-premium-fileshare.md). 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create Azure file shares from Blob storage accounts or *premium* general purpose (GPv1 or GPv2) storage accounts. Standard Azure file shares must created in *standard* general purpose accounts only and premium Azure file shares must be created in FileStorage storage accounts only. *Premium* general purpose (GPv1 and GPv2) storage accounts are for premium page blobs only. 

* <a id="give-us-feedback"></a>
  **I really want to see a specific feature added to Azure Files. Can you add it?**  
    The Azure Files team is interested in hearing any and all feedback you have about our service. Please vote on feature requests at [Azure Files UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217298-storage/category/180670-files)! We're looking forward to delighting you with many new features.

  **Does Azure Files support file locking?**  
    Yes, Azure Files fully supports SMB/Windows-styleÂ file locking, [see details](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/managing-file-locks). 
    
## Azure File Sync

* <a id="afs-region-availability"></a>
  **What regions are supported for Azure File Sync?**  
    The list of available regions can be found on the [Region availability](storage-sync-files-planning.md#azure-file-sync-region-availability) section of the Azure File Sync planning guide. We will continuously add support for additional regions, including non-Public regions.

* <a id="cross-domain-sync"></a>
  **Can I have domain-joined and non-domain-joined servers in the same sync group?**  
    Yes. A sync group can contain server endpoints that have different Active Directory memberships, even if they are not domain-joined. Although this configuration technically works, we do not recommend this as a typical configuration because access control lists (ACLs) that are defined for files and folders on one server might not be able to be enforced by other servers in the sync group. For best results, we recommend syncing between servers that are in the same Active Directory forest, between servers that are in different Active Directory forests but which have established trust relationships, or between servers that are not in a domain. We recommend that you avoid using a mix of these configurations.

* <a id="afs-change-detection"></a>
  **I created a file directly in my Azure file share by using SMB or in the portal. How long does it take for the file to sync to the servers in the sync group?**  
    [!INCLUDE [storage-sync-files-change-detection](../../../includes/storage-sync-files-change-detection.md)]


* <a id="afs-sync-time"></a>
  **How long does it take for Azure File Sync to upload 1TiB of data?**
  
    Performance will vary based on your environmental settings, configuration, and whether this is an initial sync or an ongoing sync. For more information, see [Azure File Sync performance metrics](storage-files-scale-targets.md#azure-file-sync-performance-metrics)

* <a id="afs-conflict-resolution"></a>**If the same file is changed on two servers at approximately the same time, what happens?**  
    Azure File Sync uses a simple conflict-resolution strategy: we keep both changes to files that are changed on two servers at the same time. The most recently written change keeps the original file name. The older file has the "source" machine and the conflict number appended to the name. It follows this taxonomy: 
   
    \<FileNameWithoutExtension\>-\<MachineName\>\[-#\].\<ext\>  

    For example, the first conflict of CompanyReport.docx would become CompanyReport-CentralServer.docx if CentralServer is where the older write occurred. The second conflict would be named CompanyReport-CentralServer-1.docx. Azure File Sync supports 100 conflict files per file. Once the maximum number of conflict files has been reached, the file will fail to sync until the number of conflict files is less than 100.

* <a id="afs-storage-redundancy"></a>
  **Is geo-redundant storage supported for Azure File Sync?**  
    Yes, Azure Files supports both locally redundant storage (LRS) and geo-redundant storage (GRS). If you initiate a storage account failover between paired regions from an account configured for GRS, Microsoft recommends that you treat the new region as a backup of data only. Azure File Sync does not automatically begin syncing with the new primary region. 

* <a id="sizeondisk-versus-size"></a>
  **Why doesn't the *Size on disk* property for a file match the *Size* property after using Azure File Sync?**  
  See [Understanding Cloud Tiering](storage-sync-cloud-tiering.md#sizeondisk-versus-size).

* <a id="is-my-file-tiered"></a>
  **How can I tell whether a file has been tiered?**  
  See [Understanding Cloud Tiering](storage-sync-cloud-tiering.md#is-my-file-tiered).

* <a id="afs-recall-file"></a>**A file I want to use has been tiered. How can I recall the file to disk to use it locally?**  
  See [Understanding Cloud Tiering](storage-sync-cloud-tiering.md#afs-recall-file).

* <a id="afs-force-tiering"></a>
  **How do I force a file or directory to be tiered?**  
  See [Understanding Cloud Tiering](storage-sync-cloud-tiering.md#afs-force-tiering).

* <a id="afs-effective-vfs"></a>
  **How is *volume free space* interpreted when I have multiple server endpoints on a volume?**  
  See [Understanding Cloud Tiering](storage-sync-cloud-tiering.md#afs-effective-vfs).

* <a id="afs-files-excluded"></a>
  **Which files or folders are automatically excluded by Azure File Sync?**  
  See [Files skipped](storage-sync-files-planning.md#files-skipped).

* <a id="afs-os-support"></a>
  **Can I use Azure File Sync with either Windows Server 2008 R2, Linux, or my network-attached storage (NAS) device?**  
    Currently, Azure File Sync supports only Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2012 R2. At this time, we don't have any other plans we can share, but we're open to supporting additional platforms based on customer demand. Let us know at [Azure Files UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217298-storage/category/180670-files) what platforms you would like us to support.

* <a id="afs-tiered-files-out-of-endpoint"></a>
  **Why do tiered files exist outside of the server endpoint namespace?**  
    Prior to Azure File Sync agent version 3, Azure File Sync blocked the move of tiered files outside the server endpoint but on the same volume as the server endpoint. Copy operations, moves of non-tiered files, and moves of tiered to other volumes were unaffected. The reason for this behavior was the implicit assumption that File Explorer and other Windows APIs have that move operations on the same volume are (nearly) instantaneous rename operations. This means moves will make File Explorer or other move methods (such as command line or PowerShell) appear unresponsive while Azure File Sync recalls the data from the cloud. Starting with [Azure File Sync agent version 3.0.12.0](storage-files-release-notes.md#supported-versions), Azure File Sync will allow you to move a tiered file outside of the server endpoint. We avoid the negative effects previously mentioned by allowing the tiered file to exist as a tiered file outside of the server endpoint and then recalling the file in the background. This means that moves on the same volume are instantaneous, and we do all the work to recall the file to disk after the move has completed. 

* <a id="afs-do-not-delete-server-endpoint"></a>
  **I'm having an issue with Azure File Sync on my server (sync, cloud tiering, etc.). Should I remove and recreate my server endpoint?**  
    [!INCLUDE [storage-sync-files-remove-server-endpoint](../../../includes/storage-sync-files-remove-server-endpoint.md)]
    
* <a id="afs-resource-move"></a>
  **Can I move the storage sync service and/or storage account to a different resource group or subscription?**  
   Yes, the storage sync service and/or storage account can be moved to a different resource group or subscription within the existing Azure AD tenant. If the storage account is moved, you need to give the Hybrid File Sync Service access to the storage account (see [Ensure Azure File Sync has access to the storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-sync-files-troubleshoot?tabs=portal1%2Cportal#troubleshoot-rbac)).

    > [!Note]  
    > Azure File Sync does not support moving the subscription to a different Azure AD tenant.
    
* <a id="afs-ntfs-acls"></a>
  **Does Azure File Sync preserve directory/file level NTFS ACLs along with data stored in Azure Files?**

    As of February 24th, 2020, new and existing ACLs tiered by Azure file sync will be persisted in NTFS format, and ACL modifications made directly to the Azure file share will sync to all servers in the sync group. Any changes on ACLs made to Azure Files will sync down via Azure file sync. When copying data to Azure Files, make sure you use SMB to access the share and preserve your ACLs. Existing REST based tools, such as AzCopy or Storage Explorer do not persist ACLs.

    If you have enabled Azure Backup on your file sync managed file shares, file ACLs can continue to be restored as part of the backup restore workflow. This works either for the entire share or individual files/directories.

    If you are using snapshots as part of the self-managed backup solution for file shares managed by file sync, your ACLs may not be restored properly to NTFS ACLs if the snapshots were taken prior to February 24th, 2020. If this occurs, consider contacting Azure Support.
    
## Security, authentication, and access control
* <a id="ad-support"></a>
**Is identity-based authentication and access control supported by Azure Files?**  
    
    Yes, Azure Files supports identity-based authentication and access control. You can choose one of two ways to use identity-based access control: on-premises Active Directory Domain Services or Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS). On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) supports authentication using AD DS domain-joined machines, either on-premises or in Azure, to access Azure file shares over SMB. Azure AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure Files enables Azure AD DS domain-joined Windows VMs to access shares, directories, and files using Azure AD credentials. For more details, see [Overview of Azure Files identity-based authentication support for SMB access](storage-files-active-directory-overview.md). 

    Azure Files offers two additional ways to manage access control:

    - You can use shared access signatures (SAS) to generate tokens that have specific permissions, and which are valid for a specified time interval. For example, you can generate a token with read-only access to a specific file that has a 10-minute expiry. Anyone who possesses the token while the token is valid has read-only access to that file for those 10 minutes. Shared access signature keys are supported only via the REST API or in client libraries. You must mount the Azure file share over SMB by using the storage account keys.

    - Azure File Sync preserves and replicates all discretionary ACLs, or DACLs, (whether Active Directory-based or local) to all server endpoints that it syncs to. 
    
    You can refer to [Authorizing access to Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) for a comprehensive representation of all protocols supported on Azure Storage services. 
    
* <a id="encryption-at-rest"></a>
**How can I ensure that my Azure file share is encrypted at rest?**  

    Yes. For more information see [Azure Storage Service Encryption](../common/storage-service-encryption.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json).

* <a id="access-via-browser"></a>
**How can I provide access to a specific file by using a web browser?**  

    You can use shared access signatures to generate tokens that have specific permissions, and which are valid for a specified time interval. For example, you can generate a token that gives read-only access to a specific file, for a set period of time. Anyone who possesses the URL can access the file directly from any web browser while the token is valid. You can easily generate a shared access signature key from a UI like Storage Explorer.

* <a id="file-level-permissions"></a>
**Is it possible to specify read-only or write-only permissions on folders within the share?**  

    If you mount the file share by using SMB, you don't have folder-level control over permissions. However, if you create a shared access signature by using the REST API or client libraries, you can specify read-only or write-only permissions on folders within the share.

* <a id="ip-restrictions"></a>
**Can I implement IP restrictions for an Azure file share?**  

    Yes. Access to your Azure file share can be restricted at the storage account level. For more information, see [Configure Azure Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks](../common/storage-network-security.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json).

* <a id="data-compliance-policies"></a>
**What data compliance policies does Azure Files support?**  

   Azure Files runs on top of the same storage architecture that's used in other storage services in Azure Storage. Azure Files applies the same data compliance policies that are used in other Azure storage services. For more information about Azure Storage data compliance, you can refer to [Azure Storage compliance offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-compliance-offerings), and go to the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://microsoft.com/trustcenter/default.aspx).
   
### AD DS & Azure AD DS Authentication
* <a id="ad-support-devices"></a>
**Does Azure Files Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) Authentication support SMB access using Azure AD credentials from devices joined to or registered with Azure AD?**

    No, this scenario is not supported.

* <a id="ad-vm-subscription"></a>
**Can I access Azure file shares with Azure AD credentials from a VM under a different subscription?**

    If the subscription under which the file share is deployed is associated with the same Azure AD tenant as the Azure AD DS deployment to which the VM is domain-joined, you can then access Azure file shares using the same Azure AD credentials. The limitation is imposed not on the subscription but on the associated Azure AD tenant.
    
* <a id="ad-support-subscription"></a>
**Can I enable either Azure AD DS or on-premises AD DS authentication for Azure file shares using an Azure AD tenant that is different from the Azure file share's primary tenant?**

    No, Azure Files only supports Azure AD DS or on-premises AD DS integration with an Azure AD tenant that resides in the same subscription as the file share. Only one subscription can be associated with an Azure AD tenant. This limitation applies to both Azure AD DS and on-premises AD DS authentication methods. When using on-premises AD DS for authentication, [the AD DS credential must be synced to the Azure AD](../../active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-roadmap.md) that the storage account is associated with.

* <a id="ad-linux-vms"></a>
**Does Azure AD DS or on-premises AD DS authentication for Azure file shares support Linux VMs?**

    No, authentication from Linux VMs is not supported.

* <a id="ad-aad-smb-afs"></a>
**Do file shares managed by Azure File Sync support either Azure AD DS or on-premises AD DS authentication?**

    Yes, you can enable Azure AD DS or on-premises AD DS authentication on a file share managed by Azure File Sync. Changes to the directory/file NTFS ACLs on local file servers will be tiered to Azure Files and vice-versa.

* <a id="ad-aad-smb-files"></a>
**How can I check if I have enabled AD DS authentication on my storage account and retrieve the domain information?**

    For instructions, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#1-enable-ad-authentication-for-your-account).

* <a id=""></a>
**Does Azure Files Azure AD authentication support Linux VMs?**

    No, authentication from Linux VMs is not supported.

* <a id="ad-multiple-forest"></a>
**Does on-premises AD DS authentication for Azure file shares support integration with an AD DS environment using multiple forests?**    

    Azure Files on-premises AD DS authentication only integrates with the forest of the domain service that the storage account is registered to. To support authentication from another forest, your environment must have a forest trust configured correctly. The way Azure Files register in AD DS almost the same as a regular file server, where it creates an identity (computer or service logon account) in AD DS for authentication. The only difference is that the registered SPN of the storage account ends with "file.core.windows.net" which does not match with the domain suffix. Consult your domain administrator to see if any update to your DNS routing policy is required to enable multiple forest authentication due to the different domain suffix.

* <a id=""></a>
**What regions are available for Azure Files AD DS authentication?**

    Refer to [AD DS regional availability](storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable.md#regional-availability) for details.
    
* <a id="ad-aad-smb-afs"></a>
**Can I leverage Azure Files Active Directory (AD) authentication on file shares managed by Azure File Sync?**

    Yes, you can enable AD authentication on a file share managed by Azure file sync. Changes to the directory/file NTFS ACLs on local file servers will be tiered to Azure Files and vice-versa.

* <a id="ad-aad-smb-files"></a>
**How can I check if I have enabled AD authentication on my storage account and the AD domain information?**

    You can refer to the instructions provided [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#enable-ad-authentication-for-your-account) to validate if Azure Files AD Authentication is enabled on your storage account and retrieve the AD domain information.

* <a id="ad-aad-smb-files"></a>
**Is there any difference in creating a computer account or service logon account to represent my storage account in AD?**

    Creating either a [computer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-accounts#manage-default-local-accounts-in-active-directory) (default) or a [service logon account](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/ad/about-service-logon-accounts) has no difference on how the authentication would work with Azure Files. You can make your own choice on how to represent a storage account as an identity in your AD environment. The default DomainAccountType set in Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth cmdlet is computer account. However, the password expiration age configured in your AD environment can be different for computer or service logon account and you need to take that into consideration for [Update the password of your storage account identity in AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#5-update-ad-account-password).
 
* <a id="ad-support-rest-apis"></a>
**Are there REST APIs to support Get/Set/Copy directory/file Windows ACLs?**

    Yes, we support REST APIs that get, set, or copy NTFS ACLs for directories or files when using the [2019-07-07](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/versioning-for-the-azure-storage-services#version-2019-07-07) (or later) REST API. We also support persisting Windows ACLs in REST based tools: [AzCopy v10.4+](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy/releases).


## On-premises access

* <a id="port-445-blocked"></a>
**My ISP or IT blocks Port 445 which is failing Azure Files mount. What should I do?**

    You can learn about [various ways to workaround blocked port 445 here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshoot-windows-file-connection-problems#cause-1-port-445-is-blocked). Azure Files only allows connections using SMB 3.0 (with encryption support) from outside the region or datacenter. SMB 3.0 protocol has introduced many security features including channel encryption which is very secure to use over internet. However its possible that port 445 has been blocked due to historical reasons of vulnerabilities found in lower SMB versions. In ideal case, the port should be blocked for only for SMB 1.0 traffic and SMB 1.0 should be turned off on all clients.

* <a id="expressroute-not-required"></a>
**Do I have to use Azure ExpressRoute to connect to Azure Files or to use Azure File Sync on-premises?**  

    No. ExpressRoute is not required to access an Azure file share. If you are mounting an Azure file share directly on-premises, all that's required is to have port 445 (TCP outbound) open for internet access (this is the port that SMB uses to communicate). If you're using Azure File Sync, all that's required is port 443 (TCP outbound) for HTTPS access (no SMB required). However, you *can* use ExpressRoute with either of these access options.

* <a id="mount-locally"></a>
**How can I mount an Azure file share on my local machine?**  

    You can mount the file share by using the SMB protocol if port 445 (TCP outbound) is open and your client supports the SMB 3.0 protocol (for example, if you're using Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016). If port 445 is blocked by your organization's policy or by your ISP, you can use Azure File Sync to access your Azure file share.

## Backup
* <a id="backup-share"></a>
**How do I back up my Azure file share?**  
    You can use periodic [share snapshots](storage-snapshots-files.md) for protection against accidental deletions. You also can use AzCopy, Robocopy, or a third-party backup tool that can back up a mounted file share. Azure Backup offers backup of Azure Files. Learn more about [back up Azure file shares by Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-files).

## Share snapshots

### Share snapshots: General
* <a id="what-are-snaphots"></a>
**What are file share snapshots?**  
    You can use Azure file share snapshots to create a read-only version of your file shares. You also can use Azure Files to copy an earlier version of your content back to the same share, to an alternate location in Azure, or on-premises for more modifications. To learn more about share snapshots, see the [Share snapshot overview](storage-snapshots-files.md).

* <a id="where-are-snapshots-stored"></a>
**Where are my share snapshots stored?**  
    Share snapshots are stored in the same storage account as the file share.

* <a id="snapshot-consistency"></a>
**Are share snapshots application-consistent?**  
    No, share snapshots are not application-consistent. The user must flush the writes from the application to the share before taking the share snapshot.

* <a id="snapshot-limits"></a>
**Are there limits on the number of share snapshots I can use?**  
    Yes. Azure Files can retain a maximum of 200 share snapshots. Share snapshots do not count toward the share quota, so there is no per-share limit on the total space that's used by all the share snapshots. Storage account limits still apply. After 200 share snapshots, you must delete older snapshots to create new share snapshots.

* <a id="snapshot-cost"></a>
**How much do share snapshots cost?**  
    Standard transaction and standard storage cost will apply to snapshot. Snapshots are incremental in nature. The base snapshot is the share itself. All the subsequent snapshots are incremental and will only store the diff from the previous snapshot. This means that the delta changes that will be seen in the bill will be minimal if your workload churn is minimal. See [Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/files/) for Standard Azure Files pricing information. Today the way to look at size consumed by share snapshot is by comparing the billed capacity with used capacity. We are working on tooling to improve the reporting.

* <a id="ntfs-acls-snaphsots"></a>
**Are NTFS ACLs on directories and files persisted in share snapshots?**  
    NTFS ACLs on directories and files are persisted in share snapshots.

### Create share snapshots
* <a id="file-snaphsots"></a>
**Can I create share snapshot of individual files?**  
    Share snapshots are created at the file share level. You can restore individual files from the file share snapshot, but you cannot create file-level share snapshots. However, if you have taken a share-level share snapshot and you want to list share snapshots where a specific file has changed, you can do this under **Previous Versions** on a Windows-mounted share. 
    
    If you need a file snapshot feature, let us know at [Azure Files UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217298-storage/category/180670-files).

* <a id="encrypted-snapshots"></a>
**Can I create share snapshots of an encrypted file share?**  
    You can take a share snapshot of Azure file shares that have encryption at rest enabled. You can restore files from a share snapshot to an encrypted file share. If your share is encrypted, your share snapshot also is encrypted.

* <a id="geo-redundant-snaphsots"></a>
**Are my share snapshots geo-redundant?**  
    Share snapshots have the same redundancy as the Azure file share for which they were taken. If you have selected geo-redundant storage for your account, your share snapshot also is stored redundantly in the paired region.

### Manage share snapshots
* <a id="browse-snapshots-linux"></a>
**Can I browse my share snapshots from Linux?**  
    You can use Azure CLI to create, list, browse, and restore share snapshots in Linux.

* <a id="copy-snapshots-to-other-storage-account"></a>
**Can I copy the share snapshots to a different storage account?**  
    You can copy files from share snapshots to another location, but you cannot copy the share snapshots themselves.

### Restore data from share snapshots
* <a id="promote-share-snapshot"></a>
**Can I promote a share snapshot to the base share?**  
    You can copy data from a share snapshot to any other destination. You cannot promote a share snapshot to the base share.

* <a id="restore-snapshotted-file-to-other-share"></a>
**Can I restore data from my share snapshot to a different storage account?**  
    Yes. Files from a share snapshot can be copied to the original location or to an alternate location that includes either the same storage account or a different storage account, in either the same region or in different regions. You also can copy files to an on-premises location or to any other cloud.    
  
### Clean up share snapshots
* <a id="delete-share-keep-snapshots"></a>
**Can I delete my share but not delete my share snapshots?**  
    If you have active share snapshots on your share, you cannot delete your share. You can use an API to delete share snapshots, along with the share. You also can delete both the share snapshots and the share in the Azure portal.

* <a id="delete-share-with-snapshots"></a>
**What happens to my share snapshots if I delete my storage account?**  
    If you delete your storage account, the share snapshots also are deleted.

## Billing and pricing
* <a id="vm-file-share-network-traffic"></a>
**Does the network traffic between an Azure VM and an Azure file share count as external bandwidth that is charged to the subscription?**  
    If the file share and VM are in the same Azure region, there is no additional charge for the traffic between the file share and the VM. If the file share and the VM are in different regions, the traffic between them are charged as external bandwidth.

* <a id="share-snapshot-price"></a>
**How much do share snapshots cost?**  
     During preview, there is no charge for share snapshot capacity. Standard storage egress and transaction costs apply. After general availability, subscriptions will be charged for capacity and transactions on share snapshots.
     
     Share snapshots are incremental in nature. The base share snapshot is the share itself. All subsequent share snapshots are incremental and store only the difference from the preceding share snapshot. You are billed only for the changed content. If you have a share with 100 GiB of data but only 5 GiB has changed since your last share snapshot, the share snapshot consumes only 5 additional GiB, and you are billed for 105 GiB. For more information about transaction and standard egress charges, see the [Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/files/).

## Scale and performance
* <a id="files-scale-limits"></a>
**What are the scale limits of Azure Files?**  
    For information about scalability and performance targets for Azure Files, see [Azure Files scalability and performance targets](storage-files-scale-targets.md).

* <a id="need-larger-share"></a>
**What sizes are available for Azure file shares?**  
    Azure file share sizes (premium and standard) can scale up to 100 TiB. See the [Onboard to larger file shares (standard tier)](storage-files-planning.md#enable-standard-file-shares-to-span-up-to-100-tib) section of the planning guide for onboarding instructions to the larger file shares for the standard tier.

* <a id="lfs-performance-impact"></a>
**Does expanding my file share quota impact my workloads or Azure File Sync?**
    
    No. Expanding the quota will not impact your workloads or Azure File Sync.

* <a id="open-handles-quota"></a>
**How many clients can access the same file simultaneously?**   
    There is a quota of 2,000 open handles on a single file. When you have 2,000 open handles, an error message is displayed that says the quota is reached.

* <a id="zip-slow-performance"></a>
**My performance is slow when I unzip files in Azure Files. What should I do?**  
    To transfer large numbers of files to Azure Files, we recommend that you use AzCopy (for Windows; in preview for Linux and UNIX) or Azure PowerShell. These tools have been optimized for network transfer.

* <a id="slow-perf-windows-81-2012r2"></a>
**Why is my performance slow after I mount my Azure file share on Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows 8.1?**  
    There is a known issue when mounting an Azure file share on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1. The issue was patched in the April 2014 cumulative update for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. For optimum performance, ensure that all instances of Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 have this patch applied. (You should always receive  Windows patches through Windows Update.) For more information, see the associated Microsoft Knowledge Base article [Slow performance when you access Azure Files from Windows 8.1 or Server 2012 R2](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3114025).

## Features and interoperability with other services
* <a id="cluster-witness"></a>
**Can I use my Azure file share as a *File Share Witness* for my Windows Server Failover Cluster?**  
    Currently, this configuration is not supported for an Azure file share. For more information about how to set this up for Azure Blob storage, see [Deploy a Cloud Witness for a Failover Cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/failover-clustering/deploy-cloud-witness).

* <a id="containers"></a>
**Can I mount an Azure file share on an Azure Container instance?**  
    Yes, Azure file shares are a good option when you want to persist information beyond the lifetime of a container instance. For more information, see [Mount an Azure file share with Azure Container instances](../../container-instances/container-instances-mounting-azure-files-volume.md).

* <a id="rest-rename"></a>
**Is there a rename operation in the REST API?**  
    Not at this time.

* <a id="nested-shares"></a>
**Can I set up nested shares? In other words, a share under a share?**  
    No. The file share *is* the virtual driver that you can mount, so nested shares are not supported.

* <a id="ibm-mq"></a>
**How do I use Azure Files with IBM MQ?**  
    IBM has released a document that helps IBM MQ customers configure Azure Files with the IBM service. For more information, see [How to set up an IBM MQ multi-instance queue manager with Microsoft Azure Files service](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-azure/wiki/How-to-setup-IBM-MQ-Multi-instance-queue-manager-with-Microsoft-Azure-File-Service).
