# Reset ExpressRoute circuit peerings use the Azure portal

This article describes how to disable and enable peerings of an ExpressRoute circuit using the Azure portal. When you disable a peering, the BGP session for both the primary and the secondary connection of your ExpressRoute circuit will be shut down. You'll lose connectivity through this peering to Microsoft. When you enable a peering, the BGP session on both the primary and the secondary connection of your ExpressRoute circuit will be brought up. You'll regain connectivity through this peering to Microsoft. You can enable and disable Microsoft Peering and Azure Private Peering on an ExpressRoute circuit independently. The first time you configure the peerings on your ExpressRoute circuit, the peerings are enabled by default.

There are a couple scenarios where you may find it helpful resetting your ExpressRoute peerings.
* Test your disaster recovery design and implementation. For example, you have two ExpressRoute circuits. You can disable the peerings of one circuit and force your network traffic to fail over to the other circuit.
* Enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Azure Private Peering or Microsoft Peering of your ExpressRoute circuit. BFD gets enabled by default on Azure Private Peering if your ExpressRoute circuit is created after August 1 2018 and on Microsoft Peering. If your ExpressRoute circuit gets created after January 10 2020. If your circuit was created before that, BFD wasn't enabled. You can enable BFD by disabling the peering and reenabling it. 

### Sign in to the Azure portal
