# ExpressRoute partners and peering locations

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Locations By Provider](expressroute-locations.md)
> * [Providers By Location](expressroute-locations-providers.md)


The tables in this article provide information on ExpressRoute geographical coverage and locations, ExpressRoute connectivity providers,and ExpressRoute System Integrators (SIs).

> [!Note]
> Azure regions and ExpressRoute locations are two distinct and different concepts, understanding the difference between the two is critical to exploring Azure hybrid networking connectivity.

## Azure regions
Azure regions are global datacenters where Azure compute, networking and storage resources are located. When creating an Azure resource, a customer needs to select a resource location. The resource location determines which Azure datacenter (or availability zone) the resource is created in.

## ExpressRoute locations
ExpressRoute locations (sometimes referred to as peering locations or meet-me-locations) are co-location facilities where Microsoft Enterprise edge (MSEE) devices are located. ExpressRoute locations are the entry point to Microsoft’s network – and are globally distributed, providing customers the opportunity to connect to Microsoft’s network around the world. These locations are where ExpressRoute partners and ExpressRoute Direct customers issue cross connections to Microsoft’s network. In general, the ExpressRoute location does not need to match the Azure region. For example, a customer can create an ExpressRoute circuit with the resource location *East US*, in the *Seattle* Peering location.

You will have access to Azure services across all regions within a geopolitical region if you connected to at least one ExpressRoute location within the geopolitical region. 

## <a name="locations"></a>Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region
The following table provides a map of Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region.

| **Geopolitical region** | **Azure regions** | **ExpressRoute locations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Australia Government** | Australia Central, Australia Central 2 |Canberra, Canberra2 |
| **Europe** | France Central, France South, North Europe, West Europe, UK West, UK South |Amsterdam, Amsterdam2, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, London, London2, Marseille, Newport(Wales), Paris, Stockholm, Zurich, Munich |
| **North America** | East US, West US, East US 2, West US 2, Central US, South Central US, North Central US, West Central US, Canada Central, Canada East |Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Antonio, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley2, Washington DC, Washington DC2, Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto |
| **Asia** | East Asia, Southeast Asia |Hong Kong SAR, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Singapore2, Taipei |
| **India** | India West, India Central, India South |Chennai, Chennai2, Mumbai, Mumbai2 |
| **Japan** | Japan West, Japan East |Osaka, Tokyo |
| **Oceania** | Australia Southeast, Australia East |Auckland, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney | 
| **South Korea** | Korea Central, Korea South |Busan, Seoul|
| **UAE** | UAE Central, UAE North | Dubai, Dubai2 |
| **South Africa** | South Africa West, South Africa North |Cape Town, Johannesburg |
| **South America** | Brazil South |Sao Paulo |

## Azure regions and geopolitical boundaries for national clouds
The table below provides information on regions and geopolitical boundaries for national clouds.

| **Geopolitical region** | **Azure regions** | **ExpressRoute locations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **US Government cloud** |US Gov Arizona, US Gov Iowa, US Gov Texas, US Gov Virginia, US DoD Central, US DoD East  |Chicago, Dallas, New York, Phoenix, San Antonio, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Washington DC |
| **China East** |China East, China East2 |Shanghai, Shanghai2 |
| **China North** |China North, China North2 |Beijing, Beijing2 |
| **Germany** |Germany Central, Germany East |Berlin, Frankfurt |

Connectivity across geopolitical regions is not supported on the standard ExpressRoute SKU. You will need to enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on to support global connectivity. Connectivity to national cloud environments is not supported. You can work with your connectivity provider if such a need arises.

## <a name="partners"></a>ExpressRoute connectivity providers

The following table shows connectivity locations and the service providers for each location. If you want to view service providers and the locations for which they can provide service, see [Locations by service provider](expressroute-locations.md).

* **Local Azure Regions** are the ones that [ExpressRoute Local](expressroute-faqs.md) at each peering location can access. **n/a** indicates that ExpressRoute Local is not available at that peering location.

* **Zone** refers to [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/expressroute/).

## <a name="c1partners"></a>Connectivity through Exchange providers
If your connectivity provider is not listed in previous sections, you can still create a connection.

* Check with your connectivity provider to see if they are connected to any of the exchanges in the table above. You can check the following links to gather more information about services offered by exchange providers. Several connectivity providers are already connected to Ethernet exchanges.
  * [Cologix](https://www.cologix.com/)
  * [CoreSite](https://www.coresite.com/)
  * [Equinix Cloud Exchange](https://www.equinix.com/services/interconnection-connectivity/cloud-exchange/)
  * [InterXion](https://www.interxion.com/)
  * [NextDC](https://www.nextdc.com/)
  * [Megaport](https://www.megaport.com/services/microsoft-expressroute/)
  * [PacketFabric](https://www.packetfabric.com/packetcor/microsoft-azure/)
  
* Have your connectivity provider extend your network to the peering location of choice.
  * Ensure that your connectivity provider extends your connectivity in a highly available manner so that there are no single points of failure.
* Order an ExpressRoute circuit with the exchange as your connectivity provider to connect to Microsoft.
  * Follow steps in [Create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) to set up connectivity.

## Connectivity through satellite operators
If you are remote and don't have fiber connectivity or you want to explore other connectivity options you can check the following satellite operators. 

* Intelsat
* [SES](https://www.ses.com/networks/signature-solutions/signature-cloud/ses-and-azure-expressroute)
* [Viasat](http://www.directcloud.viasatbusiness.com/)
