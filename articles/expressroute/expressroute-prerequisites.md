# ExpressRoute prerequisites & checklist
To connect to Microsoft cloud services using ExpressRoute, you need to verify that the following requirements listed in the following sections have been met.

[!INCLUDE [expressroute-office365-include](../../includes/expressroute-office365-include.md)]

## Azure account
* A valid and active Microsoft Azure account. This account is required to set up the ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute circuits are resources within Azure subscriptions. An Azure subscription is a requirement even if connectivity is limited to non-Azure Microsoft cloud services, such as Office 365.
* An active Office 365 subscription (if using Office 365 services). For more information, see the Office 365 specific requirements section of this article.

## Connectivity provider

* You can work with an [ExpressRoute connectivity partner](expressroute-locations.md#partners) to connect to the Microsoft cloud. You can set up a connection between your on-premises network and Microsoft in [three ways](expressroute-introduction.md).
* If your provider is not an ExpressRoute connectivity partner, you can still connect to the Microsoft cloud through a [cloud exchange provider](expressroute-locations.md#connectivity-through-exchange-providers).

## Network requirements
* **Redundancy at each peering location**: Microsoft requires redundant BGP sessions to be set up between Microsoftâ€™s routers and the peering routers on each ExpressRoute circuit (even when you have just [one physical connection to a cloud exchange](expressroute-faqs.md#onep2plink)).
* **Redundancy for Disaster Recovery**: Microsoft strongly recommends you set up at least two ExpressRoute circuits in different peering locations to avoid a single point of failure.
* **Routing**: depending on how you connect to the Microsoft Cloud, you or your provider needs to set up and manage the BGP sessions for [routing domains](expressroute-circuit-peerings.md). Some Ethernet connectivity providers or cloud exchange providers may offer BGP management as a value-add service.
* **NAT**: Microsoft only accepts public IP addresses through Microsoft peering. If you are using private IP addresses in your on-premises network, you or your provider needs to translate the private IP addresses to the public IP addresses [using the NAT](expressroute-nat.md).
* **QoS**: Skype for Business has various services (for example; voice, video, text) that require differentiated QoS treatment. You and your provider should follow the [QoS requirements](expressroute-qos.md).
* **Network Security**: consider [network security](../best-practices-network-security.md) when connecting to the Microsoft Cloud via ExpressRoute.
