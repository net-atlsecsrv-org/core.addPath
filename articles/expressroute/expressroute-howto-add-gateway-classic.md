This article will walk you through the steps to add, resize, and remove a virtual network (VNet) gateway for a pre-existing VNet. The steps for this configuration are specifically for VNets that were created using the **classic deployment model** and that will be used in an ExpressRoute configuration.

## Before beginning
Verify that you have installed the Azure PowerShell cmdlets needed for this configuration.

[!INCLUDE [classic powershell install instructions](../../includes/expressroute-poweshell-classic-install-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [expressroute-gateway-classic-ps](../../includes/expressroute-gateway-classic-ps-include.md)]

## Next steps
After you have created the VNet gateway, you can link your VNet to an ExpressRoute circuit. See [Link a Virtual Network to an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-classic.md).
