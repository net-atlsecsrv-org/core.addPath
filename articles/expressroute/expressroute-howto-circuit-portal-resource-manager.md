# Quickstart: Create and modify an ExpressRoute circuit

This quickstart shows you how to create an ExpressRoute circuit using the Azure portal and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. You can also check the status, update, delete, or deprovision a circuit.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* Review the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) and [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) before you begin configuration.
* You can [view a video](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/azure-expressroute-how-to-create-an-expressroute-circuit) before beginning to better understand the steps.

## <a name="create"></a>Create and provision an ExpressRoute circuit

### Sign in to the Azure portal

From a browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure account.

### Create a new ExpressRoute circuit

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your ExpressRoute circuit is billed from the moment a service key is issued. Ensure that you perform this operation when the connectivity provider is ready to provision the circuit.

You can create an ExpressRoute circuit by selecting the option to create a new resource. 

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **Create a resource**. Select **Networking** > **ExpressRoute**, as shown in the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/create-expressroute-circuit-menu.png" alt-text="Create an ExpressRoute circuit":::

2. After you select **ExpressRoute**, you'll see the **Create ExpressRoute** page. Provide the **Resource Group**, **Region**, and  **Name** for the circuit. Then select **Next: Configuration >**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-create-basic.png" alt-text="Configure the resource group and region":::

3. When you're filling in the values on this page, make sure that you specify the correct SKU tier (Local, Standard, or Premium) and data metering billing model (Unlimited or Metered).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-create-configuration.png" alt-text="Configure the circuit":::
    
    * **Port type** determines if you're connecting to a service provider or directly into Microsoft's global network at a peering location.
    * **Create new or import from classic** determines if a new circuit is being created or if you're migrating a classic circuit to Azure Resource Manager.
    * **Provider** is the internet service provider who you will be requesting your service from.
    * **Peering Location** is the physical location where you're peering with Microsoft.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The Peering Location indicates the [physical location](expressroute-locations.md) where you are peering with Microsoft. This is **not** linked to "Location" property, which refers to the geography where the Azure Network Resource Provider is located. While they are not related, it is a good practice to choose a Network Resource Provider geographically close to the Peering Location of the circuit.

    * **SKU** determines whether an ExpressRoute local, ExpressRoute standard, or an ExpressRoute premium add-on is enabled. You can specify **Local** to get the local SKU, **Standard** to get the standard SKU or **Premium** for the premium add-on. You can change the SKU to enable the premium add-on.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You cannot change the SKU from **Standard/Premium** to **Local**.
    
    * **Billing model** determines the billing type. You can specify **Metered** for a metered data plan and **Unlimited** for an unlimited data plan. You can change the billing type from **Metered** to **Unlimited**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You can not change the type from **Unlimited** to **Metered**.

    * **Allow classic operation** will allow classic virtual networks to be link to the circuit.

### View the circuits and properties

**View all the circuits**

You can view all the circuits that you created by selecting **All services > Networking > ExpressRoute circuits** on the left-side menu.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-menu.png" alt-text="Expressroute circuit menu":::

All Expressroute circuits created in the subscription will appear here.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-list.png" alt-text="Expressroute circuit list":::

**View the properties**

You can view the properties of the circuit by selecting it. On the **Overview** page for your circuit, the service key appears in the service key field. Refer to the service key for your circuit and provide it to the service provider to complete the provisioning process. The service key is specific to your circuit.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-overview.png" alt-text="View properties":::

### Send the service key to your connectivity provider for provisioning

On this page, **Provider status** gives you the current state of provisioning on the service-provider side. **Circuit status** provides you the state on the Microsoft side. For more information about circuit provisioning states, see the [Workflows](expressroute-workflows.md#expressroute-circuit-provisioning-states) article.

When you create a new ExpressRoute circuit, the circuit is in the following state:

Provider status: **Not provisioned**<BR>
Circuit status: **Enabled**

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-overview-provisioning-state.png" alt-text="Starts provisioning process":::

The circuit changes to the following state when the connectivity provider is currently enabling it for you:

Provider status: **Provisioning**<BR>
Circuit status: **Enabled**

To use the ExpressRoute circuit, it must be in the following state:

Provider status: **Provisioned**<BR>
Circuit status: **Enabled**

### Periodically check the status and the state of the circuit key

You can view the properties of the circuit that you're interested in by selecting it. Check the **Provider status** and ensure that it has moved to **Provisioned** before you continue.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/provisioned.png" alt-text="Circuit and provider status":::

### Create your routing configuration

For step-by-step instructions, refer to the [ExpressRoute circuit routing configuration](expressroute-howto-routing-portal-resource-manager.md) article to create and modify circuit peerings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions only apply to circuits that are created with service providers that offer layer 2 connectivity services. If you're using a service provider that offers managed layer 3 services (typically an IP VPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider configures and manages routing for you.

### Link a virtual network to an ExpressRoute circuit

Next, link a virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit. Use the [Linking virtual networks to ExpressRoute circuits](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md) article when you work with the Resource Manager deployment model.

## <a name="status"></a>Getting the status of an ExpressRoute circuit

You can view the status of a circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page.

## <a name="modify"></a>Modifying an ExpressRoute circuit

You can modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity. You can modify the bandwidth, SKU, billing model and allow classic operations on the **Configuration** page. For information on limits and limitations, see the [ExpressRoute FAQ](expressroute-faqs.md).

You can do the following tasks with no downtime:

* Enable or disable an ExpressRoute Premium add-on for your ExpressRoute circuit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
  > Changing the SKU from **Standard/Premium** to **Local** is not supported.

* Increase the bandwidth of your ExpressRoute circuit, provided there's capacity available on the port.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Downgrading the bandwidth of a circuit is not supported.

* Change the metering plan from *Metered Data* to *Unlimited Data*.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Changing the metering plan from **Unlimited Data** to **Metered Data** is not supported.

* You can enable and disable *Allow Classic Operations*.
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You may have to recreate the ExpressRoute circuit if there is inadequate capacity on the existing port. You cannot upgrade the circuit if there is no additional capacity available at that location.
  >
  > Although you can seamlessly upgrade the bandwidth, you cannot reduce the bandwidth of an ExpressRoute circuit without disruption. Downgrading bandwidth requires you to deprovision the ExpressRoute circuit and then reprovision a new ExpressRoute circuit.
  >
  > Disabling the Premium add-on operation can fail if you're using resources that are greater than what is permitted for the standard circuit.

To modify an ExpressRoute circuit, select **Configuration**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-configuration.png" alt-text="Modify circuit":::

## <a name="delete"></a>Deprovisioning an ExpressRoute circuit

If the ExpressRoute circuit service provider provisioning state is **Provisioning** or **Provisioned** you must work with your service provider to deprovision the circuit on their side. We continue to reserve resources and bill you until the service provider completes deprovisioning the circuit and notifies us.

> [!NOTE]
>* You must unlink *all virtual networks* from the ExpressRoute circuit before deprovisioning. If this operation fails, check whether any virtual networks are linked to the circuit.
>* If the service provider has deprovisioned the circuit (the service provider provisioning state is set to **Not provisioned**), you can delete the circuit. This stops billing for the circuit.


## <a name="cleanup"></a>Clean up resources

You can delete your ExpressRoute circuit by selecting the **Delete** icon. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-delete.png" alt-text="Delete circuit":::
