# Reset ExpressRoute circuit peerings

This article describes how to disable and enable peerings of an ExpressRoute circuit using PowerShell. When you disable a peering, the BGP session on both the primary connection and the secondary connection of your ExpressRoute circuit will be shut down. You will lose connectivity through this peering to Microsoft. When you enable a peering, the BGP session on both the primary connection and the secondary connection of your ExpressRoute circuit will be brought up. You will regain connectivity through this peering to Microsoft. You can enable and disable Microsoft Peering and Azure Private Peering on an ExpressRoute circuit independently. When you first configure the peerings on your ExpressRoute circuit, the peerings are enabled by default.

There are a couple scenarios where you may find it helpful resetting your ExpressRoute peerings.
* Test your disaster recovery design and implementation. For example, you have two ExpressRoute circuits. You can disable the peerings of one circuit and force your network traffic to fail over to the other circuit.
* Enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Azure Private Peering or Microsoft Peering of your ExpressRoute circuit. BFD is enabled by default on Azure Private Peering if your ExpressRoute circuit is created after August 1 2018 and on Microsoft Peering if your ExpressRoute circuit is created after January 10 2020. If your circuit was created before that, BFD wasn't enabled. You can enable BFD by disabling the peering and reenabling it. 

### Working with Azure PowerShell

## Reset a peering

1. If you are running PowerShell locally, open your PowerShell console with elevated privileges, and connect to your account. Use the following example to help you connect:

   ```azurepowershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```
2. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, check the subscriptions for the account.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Get-AzSubscription
   ```
3. Specify the subscription that you want to use.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"
   ```
4. Run the following commands to retrieve your ExpressRoute circuit.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"
   ```
5. Identify the peering you want to disable or enable. *Peerings* is an array. In the following example, Peerings[0] is Azure Private Peering and Peerings[1] Microsoft Peering.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
   ResourceGroupName                : ExpressRouteResourceGroup
   Location                         : westus
   Id                               : /subscriptions/########-####-####-####-############/resourceGroups/ExpressRouteResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/ExpressRouteARMCircuit

   Authorizations                   : []
   AllowClassicOperations           : False
   GatewayManagerEtag               :
   ```
6. Run the following commands to change the state of the peering.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $ckt.Peerings[0].State = "Disabled"
   Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
   ```
   The peering should be in a state you set.
