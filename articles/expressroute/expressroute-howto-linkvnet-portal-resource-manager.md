# Tutorial: Connect a virtual network to an ExpressRoute circuit using the portal

This tutorial helps you create a connection to link a virtual network to an Azure ExpressRoute circuit using the Azure portal. The virtual networks that you connect to your Azure ExpressRoute circuit can either be in the same subscription or be part of another subscription.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Connect a virtual networking to a circuit in the same subscription.
> - Connect a virtual networking to a circuit in a different subscription.
> - Delete the link between the virtual network and ExpressRoute circuit.

## Prerequisites

* Review the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md), [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md), and [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) before you begin configuration.

* You must have an active ExpressRoute circuit.
  * Follow the instructions to [create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager.md) and have the circuit enabled by your connectivity provider.
  * Ensure that you have Azure private peering configured for your circuit. See the [Create and modify peering for an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-routing-portal-resource-manager.md) article for peering and routing instructions.
  * Ensure that Azure private peering gets configured and establishes BGP peering between your network and Microsoft for end-to-end connectivity.
  * Ensure that you have a virtual network and a virtual network gateway created and fully provisioned. Follow the instructions to [create a virtual network gateway for ExpressRoute](expressroute-howto-add-gateway-resource-manager.md). A virtual network gateway for ExpressRoute uses the GatewayType 'ExpressRoute', not VPN.

* You can link up to 10 virtual networks to a standard ExpressRoute circuit. All virtual networks must be in the same geopolitical region when using a standard ExpressRoute circuit.

* A single VNet can be linked to up to four ExpressRoute circuits. Use the following process to create a new connection object for each ExpressRoute circuit you're connecting to. The ExpressRoute circuits can be in the same subscription, different subscriptions, or a mix of both.

* If you enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on, you can link virtual networks outside of the geopolitical region of the ExpressRoute circuit. The premium add-on will also allow you to connect more than 10 virtual networks to your ExpressRoute circuit depending on the bandwidth chosen. Check the [FAQ](expressroute-faqs.md) for more details on the premium add-on.

* You can [view a video](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/azure-expressroute-how-to-create-a-connection-between-your-vpn-gateway-and-expressroute-circuit) before beginning to better understand the steps.

## Connect a VNet to a circuit - same subscription

> [!NOTE]
> BGP configuration information will not appear if the layer 3 provider configured your peerings. If your circuit is in a provisioned state, you should be able to create connections.

### To create a connection

1. Ensure that your ExpressRoute circuit and Azure private peering have been configured successfully. Follow the instructions in [Create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and [Create and modify peering for an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-routing-arm.md). Your ExpressRoute circuit should look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/express-route-circuit.png" alt-text="ExpressRoute circuit screenshot":::

2. You can now start provisioning a connection to link your virtual network gateway to your ExpressRoute circuit. Select **Connection** > **Add** to open the **Add connection** page, and then configure the values.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/add-connection.png" alt-text="Add connection screenshot":::

3. After your connection has been successfully configured, your connection object will show the information for the connection.

## Connect a VNet to a circuit - different subscription

You can share an ExpressRoute circuit across multiple subscriptions. The following figure shows a simple schematic of how sharing works for ExpressRoute circuits across multiple subscriptions.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/cross-subscription.png" alt-text="Cross-subscription connectivity":::

Each of the smaller clouds within the large cloud is used to represent subscriptions that belong to different departments within an organization. Each of the departments within the organization uses their own subscription for deploying their services--but they can share a single ExpressRoute circuit to connect back to your on-premises network. A single department (in this example: IT) can own the ExpressRoute circuit. Other subscriptions within the organization may use the ExpressRoute circuit.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Connectivity and bandwidth charges for the dedicated circuit will be applied to the ExpressRoute circuit owner. All virtual networks share the same bandwidth.

### Administration - About circuit owners and circuit users

The 'circuit owner' is an authorized Power User of the ExpressRoute circuit resource. The circuit owner can create authorizations that can be redeemed by 'circuit users'. Circuit users are owners of virtual network gateways that aren't within the same subscription as the ExpressRoute circuit. Circuit users can redeem authorizations (one authorization per virtual network).

The circuit owner has the power to modify and revoke authorizations at any time. Revoking an authorization results in all link connections being deleted from the subscription whose access was revoked.

### Circuit owner operations

**To create a connection authorization**

The circuit owner creates an authorization, which creates an authorization key to be used by a circuit user to connect their virtual network gateways to the ExpressRoute circuit. An authorization is valid for only one connection.

> [!NOTE]
> Each connection requires a separate authorization.
>

1. In the ExpressRoute page, select **Authorizations** and then type a **name** for the authorization and select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/authorization.png" alt-text="Authorizations":::

2. Once the configuration is saved, copy the **Resource ID** and the **Authorization Key**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/authorization-key.png" alt-text="Authorization key":::

**To delete a connection authorization**

You can delete a connection by selecting the **Delete** icon on the page for your connection.

### Circuit user operations

The circuit user needs the resource ID and an authorization key from the circuit owner.

**To redeem a connection authorization**

1. Select the **+New** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/create-new-resources.png" alt-text="Create new resources":::

2. Search for **"Connection"** in the Marketplace, select it, and select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/search-connection.png" alt-text="Search for connection":::

3. Make sure the **Connection type** is set to "ExpressRoute".
4. Fill in the details, then select **OK** in the Basics page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/connection-basics.png" alt-text="Basics page":::

5. In the **Settings** page, Select the **Virtual network gateway** and check the **Redeem authorization** check box.
6. Enter the **Authorization key** and the **Peer circuit URI** and give the connection a name. Select **OK**. The **Peer Circuit URI** is the Resource ID of the ExpressRoute circuit (which you can find under the Properties Setting pane of the ExpressRoute Circuit).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager/connection-settings.png" alt-text="Settings page":::

7. Review the information in the **Summary** page and select **OK**.

**To release a connection authorization**

You can release an authorization by deleting the connection that links the ExpressRoute circuit to the virtual network.

## Clean up resources

You can delete a connection and unlink your VNet to an ExpressRoute circuit by selecting the **Delete** icon on the page for your connection.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to connect a virtual network to a circuit in the same subscription and a different subscription. For more information about the ExpressRoute gateway, see:
