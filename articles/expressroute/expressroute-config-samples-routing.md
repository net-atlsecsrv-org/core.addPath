# Router configuration samples to set up and manage routing
This page provides interface and routing configuration samples for Cisco IOS-XE and Juniper MX series routers when you're working with Azure ExpressRoute.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Samples on this page are purely for guidance. You must work with your vendor's sales/technical team and your networking team to find appropriate configurations to meet your needs. Microsoft won't support issues related to configurations listed in this page. Contact your device vendor for support issues.

## MTU and TCP MSS settings on router interfaces
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the ExpressRoute interface is 1500, which is the typical default MTU for an Ethernet interface on a router. Unless your router has a different MTU by default, there is no need to specify a value on the router interface.

Unlike an Azure VPN gateway, the TCP maximum segment size (MSS) for an ExpressRoute circuit does not need to be specified.

The router configuration samples in this article apply to all peerings. Review [ExpressRoute peerings](expressroute-circuit-peerings.md) and [ExpressRoute routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md) for more details on routing.


## Cisco IOS-XE based routers
The samples in this section apply to any router running the IOS-XE OS family.

### Configure interfaces and subinterfaces
You'll need one subinterface per peering in every router that you connect to Microsoft. A subinterface can be identified with a VLAN ID or a stacked pair of VLAN IDs and an IP address.

**Dot1Q interface definition**

This sample provides the subinterface definition for a subinterface with a single VLAN ID. The VLAN ID is unique per peering. The last octet of your IPv4 address will always be an odd number.

    interface GigabitEthernet<Interface_Number>.<Number>
     encapsulation dot1Q <VLAN_ID>
     ip address <IPv4_Address><Subnet_Mask>

**QinQ interface definition**

This sample provides the subinterface definition for a subinterface with two VLAN IDs. The outer VLAN ID (s-tag), if used, remains the same across all peerings. The inner VLAN ID (c-tag) is unique per peering. The last octet of your IPv4 address will always be an odd number.

    interface GigabitEthernet<Interface_Number>.<Number>
     encapsulation dot1Q <s-tag> seconddot1Q <c-tag>
     ip address <IPv4_Address><Subnet_Mask>

### Set up eBGP sessions
You must set up a BGP session with Microsoft for every peering. Set up a BGP session by using the following sample. If the IPv4 address that you used for your subinterface was a.b.c.d, then the IP address of the BGP neighbor (Microsoft) will be a.b.c.d+1. The last octet of the BGP neighbor's IPv4 address will always be an even number.

    router bgp <Customer_ASN>
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> remote-as 12076
     !        
     address-family ipv4
     neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> activate
     exit-address-family
    !

### Set up prefixes to be advertised over the BGP session
Configure your router to advertise select prefixes to Microsoft by using the following sample.

    router bgp <Customer_ASN>
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> remote-as 12076
     !        
     address-family ipv4
      network <Prefix_to_be_advertised> mask <Subnet_mask>
      neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> activate
     exit-address-family
    !

### Route maps
Use route maps and prefix lists to filter prefixes propagated into your network. See the following sample, and ensure that you have the appropriate prefix lists set up.

    router bgp <Customer_ASN>
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> remote-as 12076
     !        
     address-family ipv4
      network <Prefix_to_be_advertised> mask <Subnet_mask>
      neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> activate
      neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> route-map <MS_Prefixes_Inbound> in
     exit-address-family
    !
    route-map <MS_Prefixes_Inbound> permit 10
     match ip address prefix-list <MS_Prefixes>
    !

### Configure BFD

You'll configure BFD in two places: one at the interface level and another at BGP level. The example here is for the QinQ interface. 

    interface GigabitEthernet<Interface_Number>.<Number>
     bfd interval 300 min_rx 300 multiplier 3
     encapsulation dot1Q <s-tag> seconddot1Q <c-tag>
     ip address <IPv4_Address><Subnet_Mask>
    
    router bgp <Customer_ASN>
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> remote-as 12076
     !        
     address-family ipv4
      neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> activate
      neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure> fall-over bfd
     exit-address-family
    !


## Juniper MX series routers
The samples in this section apply to any Juniper MX series router.

### Configure interfaces and subinterfaces

**Dot1Q interface definition**

This sample provides the subinterface definition for a subinterface with a single VLAN ID. The VLAN ID is unique per peering. The last octet of your IPv4 address will always be an odd number.

    interfaces {
        vlan-tagging;
        <Interface_Number> {
            unit <Number> {
                vlan-id <VLAN_ID>;
                family inet {
                    address <IPv4_Address/Subnet_Mask>;
                }
            }
        }
    }


**QinQ interface definition**

This sample provides the subinterface definition for a subinterface with two VLAN IDs. The outer VLAN ID (s-tag), if used, remains the same across all peerings. The inner VLAN ID (c-tag) is unique per peering. The last octet of your IPv4 address will always be an odd number.

    interfaces {
        <Interface_Number> {
            flexible-vlan-tagging;
            unit <Number> {
                vlan-tags outer <S-tag> inner <C-tag>;
                family inet {
                    address <IPv4_Address/Subnet_Mask>;
                }                           
            }                               
        }                                   
    }                           

### Set up eBGP sessions
You must set up a BGP session with Microsoft for every peering. Set up a BGP session by using the following sample. If the IPv4 address that you used for your subinterface was a.b.c.d, then the IP address of the BGP neighbor (Microsoft) will be a.b.c.d+1. The last octet of the BGP neighbor's IPv4 address will always be an even number.

    routing-options {
        autonomous-system <Customer_ASN>;
    }
    }
    protocols {
        bgp { 
            group <Group_Name> { 
                peer-as 12076;              
                neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure>;
            }                               
        }                                   
    }

### Set up prefixes to be advertised over the BGP session
Configure your router to advertise select prefixes to Microsoft by using the following sample.

    policy-options {
        policy-statement <Policy_Name> {
            term 1 {
                from protocol OSPF;
        route-filter 
    <Prefix_to_be_advertised/Subnet_Mask> exact;
                then {
                    accept;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    protocols {
        bgp { 
            group <Group_Name> { 
                export <Policy_Name>
                peer-as 12076;              
                neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure>;
            }                               
        }                                   
    }


### Route policies
You can use route maps and prefix lists to filter prefixes propagated into your network. See the following sample, and ensure you have the appropriate prefix lists set up.

    policy-options {
        prefix-list MS_Prefixes {
            <IP_Prefix_1/Subnet_Mask>;
            <IP_Prefix_2/Subnet_Mask>;
        }
        policy-statement <MS_Prefixes_Inbound> {
            term 1 {
                from {
                prefix-list MS_Prefixes;
                }
                then {
                    accept;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    protocols {
        bgp { 
            group <Group_Name> { 
                export <Policy_Name>
                import <MS_Prefixes_Inbound>
                peer-as 12076;              
                neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure>;
            }                               
        }                                   
    }

### Configure BFD
Configure BFD under the protocol BGP section only.

    protocols {
        bgp { 
            group <Group_Name> { 
                peer-as 12076;              
                neighbor <IP#2_used_by_Azure>;
                bfd-liveness-detection {
                       minimum-interval 3000;
                       multiplier 3;
                }
            }                               
        }                                   
    }
