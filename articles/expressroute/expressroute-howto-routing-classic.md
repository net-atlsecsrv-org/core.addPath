This article walks you through the steps to create and manage peering/routing configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit using PowerShell and the classic deployment model. The steps below will also show you how to check the status, update, or delete and deprovision peerings for an ExpressRoute circuit. You can configure one, two, or all three peerings (Azure private, Azure public, and Microsoft) for an ExpressRoute circuit. You can configure peerings in any order you choose. However, you must make sure that you complete the configuration of each peering one at a time. 

These instructions only apply to circuits created with service providers that offer Layer 2 connectivity services. If you are using a service provider that offers managed Layer 3 services (typically an IPVPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider will configure and manage routing for you.

## Configuration prerequisites

* Make sure that you have reviewed the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) page, the [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md) page, and the [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) page before you begin configuration.
* You must have an active ExpressRoute circuit. Follow the instructions to [create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) and have the circuit enabled by your connectivity provider before you proceed. The ExpressRoute circuit must be in a provisioned and enabled state for you to be able to run the cmdlets described below.

### Download the latest PowerShell cmdlets

Install the latest versions of the Azure Service Management (SM) PowerShell modules and the ExpressRoute module. When using the following example, note that the version number (in this example, 5.1.1) will change as newer versions of the cmdlets are released.

```powershell
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\Azure\Azure.psd1'
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\ExpressRoute\ExpressRoute.psd1'
```

For more information, see [Getting started with Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/azure/overview) for step-by-step guidance on how to configure your computer to use the Azure PowerShell modules.

### Sign in

To sign in to your Azure account, use the following examples:

1. Open your PowerShell console with elevated rights and connect to your account.

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```
2. Check the subscriptions for the account.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzSubscription
   ```
3. If you have more than one subscription, select the subscription that you want to use.

   ```powershell
   Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"
   ```

4. Next, use the following cmdlet to add your Azure subscription to PowerShell for the classic deployment model.

   ```powershell
   Add-AzureAccount
   ```

## Azure private peering

This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update, and delete the Azure private peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

### To create Azure private peering

1. **Create an ExpressRoute circuit.**

   Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider. If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure private peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below.
2. **Check the ExpressRoute circuit to make sure it is provisioned.**
   
   Check to see if the ExpressRoute circuit is Provisioned and also Enabled.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureDedicatedCircuit -ServiceKey "*********************************"
   ```

   Return:

   ```powershell
   Bandwidth                        : 200
   CircuitName                      : MyTestCircuit
   Location                         : Silicon Valley
   ServiceKey                       : *********************************
   ServiceProviderName              : equinix
   ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
   Sku                              : Standard
   Status                           : Enabled
   ```
   
   Make sure that the circuit shows as Provisioned and Enabled. If it isn't, work with your connectivity provider to get your circuit to the required state and status.

   ```powershell
   ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
   Status                           : Enabled
   ```
3. **Configure Azure private peering for the circuit.**

   Make sure that you have the following items before you proceed with the next steps:
   
   * A /30 subnet for the primary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
   * A /30 subnet for the secondary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
   * A valid VLAN ID to establish this peering on. Verify that no other peering in the circuit uses the same VLAN ID.
   * AS number for peering. You can use both 2-byte and 4-byte AS numbers. You can use a private AS number for this peering. Verify that you are not using 65515.
   * An MD5 hash if you choose to use one. **Optional**.
     
   You can use the following example to configure Azure private peering for your circuit:

   ```powershell
   New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 100
   ```    

   If you want to use an MD5 hash, use the following example to configure private peering for your circuit:

   ```powershell
   New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 100 -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
   ```
     
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Verify that you specify your AS number as peering ASN, not customer ASN.
   > 

### To view Azure private peering details

You can view configuration details using the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************"
```

Return:

```
AdvertisedPublicPrefixes       : 
AdvertisedPublicPrefixesState  : Configured
AzureAsn                       : 12076
CustomerAutonomousSystemNumber : 
PeerAsn                        : 1234
PrimaryAzurePort               : 
PrimaryPeerSubnet              : 10.0.0.0/30
RoutingRegistryName            : 
SecondaryAzurePort             : 
SecondaryPeerSubnet            : 10.0.0.4/30
State                          : Enabled
VlanId                         : 100
```

### To update Azure private peering configuration

You can update any part of the configuration using the following cmdlet. In the following example, the VLAN ID of the circuit is being updated from 100 to 500.

```powershell
Set-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 500 -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
```

### To delete Azure private peering

You can remove your peering configuration by running the following cmdlet. You must make sure that all virtual networks are unlinked from the ExpressRoute circuit before running this cmdlet.

```powershell
Remove-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************"
```

## Azure public peering

This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update, and delete the Azure public peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure public peering is deprecated for new circuits.
>

### To create Azure public peering

1. **Create an ExpressRoute circuit**

   Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider. If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure public peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below.
2. **Check ExpressRoute circuit to verify that it is provisioned**

   You must first check to see if the ExpressRoute circuit is Provisioned and also Enabled.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureDedicatedCircuit -ServiceKey "*********************************"
   ```

   Return:

   ```powershell
   Bandwidth                        : 200
   CircuitName                      : MyTestCircuit
   Location                         : Silicon Valley
   ServiceKey                       : *********************************
   ServiceProviderName              : equinix
   ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
   Sku                              : Standard
   Status                           : Enabled
   ```
   
   Verify that the circuit shows as Provisioned and Enabled. If it isn't, work with your connectivity provider to get your circuit to the required state and status.

   ```powershell
   ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
   Status                           : Enabled
   ```
4. **Configure Azure public peering for the circuit**
   
   Make sure that you have the following information before you proceed:
   
   * A /30 subnet for the primary link. This must be a valid public IPv4 prefix.
   * A /30 subnet for the secondary link. This must be a valid public IPv4 prefix.
   * A valid VLAN ID to establish this peering on. Verify that no other peering in the circuit uses the same VLAN ID.
   * AS number for peering. You can use both 2-byte and 4-byte AS numbers.
   * An MD5 hash if you choose to use one. **Optional**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure that you specify your AS number as peering ASN and not customer ASN.
   >  
     
   You can use the following example to configure Azure public peering for your circuit:

   ```powershell
   New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Public -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 200
   ```
     
   If you want to use an MD5 hash, use the following example to configure your circuit:
     
   ```powershell
   New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Public -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 200 -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
   ```
     
### To view Azure public peering details

To view configuration details, use the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Public -ServiceKey "*********************************"

VlanId                         : 200
```

### To update Azure public peering configuration

You can update any part of the configuration using the following cmdlet. In this example, the VLAN ID of the circuit is being updated from 200 to 600.

```powershell
Set-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Public -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 600 -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
```

Verify that the circuit shows as Provisioned and Enabled. 
### To delete Azure public peering

You can remove your peering configuration by running the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Remove-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Public -ServiceKey "*********************************"
```

## Microsoft peering

This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update, and delete the Microsoft peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

### To create Microsoft peering

1. **Create an ExpressRoute circuit**
  
   Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider. If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure private peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below.
2. **Check ExpressRoute circuit to verify that it is provisioned**

   Verify that the circuit shows as Provisioned and Enabled. 
   
   ```powershell
   Get-AzureDedicatedCircuit -ServiceKey "*********************************"
   ```

   Return:
   
   ```powershell
   Bandwidth                        : 200
   CircuitName                      : MyTestCircuit
   Location                         : Silicon Valley
   ServiceKey                       : *********************************
   ServiceProviderName              : equinix
   ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
   Sku                              : Standard
   Status                           : Enabled
   ```
   
   Verify that the circuit shows as Provisioned and Enabled. If it isn't, work with your connectivity provider to get your circuit to the required state and status.

   ```powershell
   ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
   Status                           : Enabled
   ```
3. **Configure Microsoft peering for the circuit**
   
    Make sure that you have the following information before you proceed.
   
   * A /30 subnet for the primary link. This must be a valid public IPv4 prefix owned by you and registered in an RIR / IRR.
   * A /30 subnet for the secondary link. This must be a valid public IPv4 prefix owned by you and registered in an RIR / IRR.
   * A valid VLAN ID to establish this peering on. Verify that no other peering in the circuit uses the same VLAN ID.
   * AS number for peering. You can use both 2-byte and 4-byte AS numbers.
   * Advertised prefixes: You must provide a list of all prefixes you plan to advertise over the BGP session. Only public IP address prefixes are accepted. You can send a comma-separated list if you plan to send a set of prefixes. These prefixes must be registered to you in an RIR / IRR.
   * Customer ASN: If you are advertising prefixes that are not registered to the peering AS number, you can specify the AS number to which they are registered. **Optional**.
   * Routing Registry Name: You can specify the RIR / IRR against which the AS number and prefixes are registered.
   * An MD5 hash, if you choose to use one. **Optional.**
     
   Run the following cmdlet to configure Microsoft peering for your circuit:
 
   ```powershell
   New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Microsoft -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "131.107.0.4/30" -VlanId 300 -PeerAsn 1234 -CustomerAsn 2245 -AdvertisedPublicPrefixes "123.0.0.0/30" -RoutingRegistryName "ARIN" -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
