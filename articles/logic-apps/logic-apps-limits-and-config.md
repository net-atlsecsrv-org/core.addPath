# Limits and configuration information for Azure Logic Apps

This article describes the limits and configuration details for creating and running automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps. For Power Automate, see [Limits and configuration in Power Automate](/flow/limits-and-config).

<a name="definition-limits"></a>

## Logic app definition limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app definition:

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Actions per workflow | 500 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. |
| Allowed nesting depth for actions | 8 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. |
| Workflows per region per subscription | 1,000 | |
| Triggers per workflow | 10 | When working in code view, not the designer |
| Switch scope cases limit | 25 | |
| Variables per workflow | 250 | |
| Name for `action` or `trigger` | 80 characters | |
| Characters per expression | 8,192 | |
| Length of `description` | 256 characters | |
| Maximum number of `parameters` | 50 | |
| Maximum number of `outputs` | 10 | |
| Maximum size for `trackedProperties` | 16,000 characters |
| Inline Code action - Maximum number of code characters | 1,024 characters | To extend this limit to 100,000 characters, create your logic apps with the **Logic App (Preview)** resource type, either [by using the Azure portal](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-azure-portal.md) or [by using Visual Studio Code and the **Azure Logic Apps (Preview)** extension](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-visual-studio-code.md). |
| Inline Code action - Maximum duration for running code | 5 seconds | To extend this limit to a 15 seconds, create your logic apps with the **Logic App (Preview)** resource type, either [by using the Azure portal](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-azure-portal.md) or [by using Visual Studio Code and the **Azure Logic Apps (Preview)** extension](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-visual-studio-code.md). |

## Run duration and retention history limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Run duration | 90 days | 366 days | Run duration is calculated by using a run's start time and the limit that's specified in the workflow setting, [**Run history retention in days**](#change-duration) at that start time. <p><p>To change the default limit, see [Change run duration and history retention in storage](#change-duration). |
| Run history retention in storage | 90 days | 366 days | If a run's duration exceeds the current run history retention limit, the run is removed from the runs history in storage. Whether the run completes or times out, run history retention is always calculated by using the run's start time and the current limit specified in the workflow setting, [**Run history retention in days**](#change-retention). No matter the previous limit, the current limit is always used for calculating retention. <p><p>To change the default limit and for more information, see [Change duration and run history retention in storage](#change-retention). To increase the maximum limit, [contact the Logic Apps team](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) for help with your requirements. |
| Minimum recurrence interval | 1 second | 1 second ||
| Maximum recurrence interval | 500 days | 500 days ||
|||||

<a name="change-duration"></a>
<a name="change-retention"></a>

### Change run duration and history retention in storage

The same setting controls the maximum number of days that a workflow can run and for keeping run history in storage. To change the default or current limit for these properties, follow these steps.

* For logic apps in multi-tenant Azure, the 90-day default limit is the same as the maximum limit. You can only decrease this value.

* For logic apps in an integration service environment, you can decrease or increase the 90-day default limit.

For example, suppose that you reduce the retention limit from 90 days to 30 days. A 60-day-old run is removed from the runs history. If you increase the retention period from 30 days to 60 days, a 20-day-old run stays in the runs history for another 40 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a run's duration exceeds the current run history retention limit, the run is removed from the runs history in storage. 
> To avoid losing run history, make sure that the retention limit is *always* more than the run's longest possible duration.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, find and select **Logic apps**.

1. Find and select your logic app. Open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. On the logic app's menu, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Runtime options**, from the **Run history retention in days** list, select **Custom**.

1. Drag the slider to change the number of days that you want.

1. When you're done, on the **Workflow settings** toolbar, select **Save**.

If you generate an Azure Resource Manager template for your logic app, this setting appears as a property in your workflow's resource definition, which is described in the [Microsoft.Logic workflows template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/workflows):

```json
{
   "name": "{logic-app-name}",
   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/workflows",
   "location": "{Azure-region}",
   "apiVersion": "2019-05-01",
   "properties": {
      "definition": {},
      "parameters": {},
      "runtimeConfiguration": {
         "lifetime": {
            "unit": "day",
            "count": {number-of-days}
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Concurrency, looping, and debatching limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

### Loops

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Foreach array items | 100,000 | This limit describes the highest number of array items that a "for each" loop can process. <p><p>To filter larger arrays, you can use the [query action](logic-apps-perform-data-operations.md#filter-array-action). |
| Foreach concurrency | With concurrency off: 20 <p><p>With concurrency on: <p><p>- Default: 20 <br>- Min: 1 <br>- Max: 50 | This limit is highest number of "for each" loop iterations that can run at the same time, or in parallel. <p><p>To change this limit, see [Change "for each" concurrency limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-for-each-concurrency) or [Run "for each" loops sequentially](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#sequential-for-each). |
| Until iterations | - Default: 60 <br>- Min: 1 <br>- Max: 5,000 | The highest number of cycles that an "Until" loop can have during a logic app run. <p><p>To change this limit, in the "Until" loop shape, select **Change limits**, and specify the value for the **Count** property. |
| Until timeout | - Default: PT1H (1 hour) | The most amount of time that the "Until" loop can run before exiting and is specified in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). The timeout value is evaluated for each loop cycle. If any action in the loop takes longer than the timeout limit, the current cycle doesn't stop. However, the next cycle doesn't start because the limit condition isn't met. <p><p>To change this limit, in the "Until" loop shape, select **Change limits**, and specify the value for the **Timeout** property. |
||||

### Concurrency and debatching

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Trigger concurrency | With concurrency off: Unlimited <p><p>With concurrency on, which you can't undo after enabling: <p><p>- Default: 25 <br>- Min: 1 <br>- Max: 50 | This limit is the highest number of logic app instances that can run at the same time, or in parallel. <p><p>**Note**: When concurrency is turned on, the SplitOn limit is reduced to 100 items for [debatching arrays](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#split-on-debatch). <p><p>To change this limit, see [Change trigger concurrency limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-trigger-concurrency) or [Trigger instances sequentially](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#sequential-trigger). |
| Maximum waiting runs | With concurrency off: <p><p>- Min: 1 <br>- Max: 50 <p><p>With concurrency on: <p><p>- Min: 10 plus the number of concurrent runs (trigger concurrency) <br>- Max: 100 | This limit is the highest number of logic app instances that can wait to run when your logic app is already running the maximum concurrent instances. <p><p>To change this limit, see [Change waiting runs limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-waiting-runs). |
| SplitOn items | With concurrency off: 100,000 <p><p>With concurrency on: 100 | For triggers that return an array, you can specify an expression that uses a 'SplitOn' property that [splits or debatches array items into multiple workflow instances](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#split-on-debatch) for processing, rather than use a "Foreach" loop. This expression references the array to use for creating and running a workflow instance for each array item. <p><p>**Note**: When concurrency is turned on, the SplitOn limit is reduced to 100 items. |

<a name="throughput-limits"></a>

## Throughput limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app definition:

### Multi-tenant Logic Apps service

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Action: Executions per 5 minutes | 100,000 is the default limit, but 300,000 is the maximum limit. | To raise the default limit to the maximum for your logic app, see [Run in high throughput mode](#run-high-throughput-mode), which is in preview. Or, you can [distribute the workload across more than one logic app](../logic-apps/handle-throttling-problems-429-errors.md#logic-app-throttling) as necessary. |
| Action: Concurrent outbound calls | ~2,500 | You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
| Runtime endpoint: Concurrent inbound calls | ~1,000 | You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
| Runtime endpoint: Read calls per 5 minutes  | 60,000 | This limit applies to calls that get the raw inputs and outputs from a logic app's run history. You can distribute the workload across more than one app as necessary. |
| Runtime endpoint: Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 45,000 | You can distribute workload across more than one app as necessary. |
| Content throughput per 5 minutes | 600 MB | You can distribute workload across more than one app as necessary. |
||||

<a name="run-high-throughput-mode"></a>

#### Run in high throughput mode

For a single logic app definition, the number of actions that execute every 5 minutes has a [default limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#throughput-limits). To raise the default limit to the maximum for your logic app, you can enable high throughput mode, which is in preview. Or, you can [distribute the workload across more than one logic app](../logic-apps/handle-throttling-problems-429-errors.md#logic-app-throttling) as necessary.

1. In the Azure portal, on your logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Runtime options** > **High throughput**, change the setting to **On**.

   ![Screenshot that shows logic app menu in Azure portal with "Workflow settings" and "High throughput" set to "On".](./media/logic-apps-limits-and-config/run-high-throughput-mode.png)

To enable this setting in an ARM template for deploying your logic app, in the `properties` object for your logic app's resource definition, add the `runtimeConfiguration` object with the `operationOptions` property set to `OptimizedForHighThroughput`:

```json
{
   <template-properties>
   "resources": [
      // Start logic app resource definition
      {
         "properties": {
            <logic-app-resource-definition-properties>,
            <logic-app-workflow-definition>,
            <more-logic-app-resource-definition-properties>,
            "runtimeConfiguration": {
               "operationOptions": "OptimizedForHighThroughput"
            }
         },
         "name": "[parameters('LogicAppName')]",
         "type": "Microsoft.Logic/workflows",
         "location": "[parameters('LogicAppLocation')]",
         "tags": {},
         "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
         "dependsOn": [
         ]
      }
      // End logic app resource definition
   ],
   "outputs": {}
}
```

For more information about your logic app resource definition, see [Overview: Automate deployment for Azure Logic Apps by using Azure Resource Manager templates](../logic-apps/logic-apps-azure-resource-manager-templates-overview.md#logic-app-resource-definition).

### Integration service environment (ISE)

Here are the throughput limits for the [Premium ISE SKU](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level):

| Name | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Base unit execution limit | System-throttled when infrastructure capacity reaches 80% | Provides ~4,000 action executions per minute, which is ~160 million action executions per month | |
| Scale unit execution limit | System-throttled when infrastructure capacity reaches 80% | Each scale unit can provide ~2,000 additional action executions per minute, which is ~80 million more action executions per month | |
| Maximum scale units that you can add | 10 | |
||||

To go above these limits in normal processing, or run load testing that might go above these limits, [contact the Logic Apps team](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) for help with your requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Developer ISE SKU](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level)
> has no published limits, no capabilities for scaling up, and no service-level agreement (SLA). Use this SKU
> only for experimenting, development, and testing, not production or performance testing.

<a name="gateway-limits"></a>

## Gateway limits

Azure Logic Apps supports write operations, including inserts and updates, through the gateway. However, these operations have [limits on their payload size](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem#considerations).

<a name="http-limits"></a>

## HTTP limits

Here are the limits for a single inbound or outbound call:

<a name="http-timeout-limits"></a>

#### Timeout duration

Some connector operations make asynchronous calls or listen for webhook requests, so the timeout for these operations might be longer than these limits. For more information, see the technical details for the specific connector and also [Workflow triggers and actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#http-action).

| Name | Logic Apps (multi-tenant) | Logic Apps (preview) | Integration service environment | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------|
| Outbound request | 120 seconds <br>(2 minutes) | 230 seconds <br>(3.9 minutes) | 240 seconds <br>(4 minutes) | Examples of outbound requests include calls made by the HTTP trigger or action. For more information about the preview version, see [Azure Logic Apps Preview](logic-apps-overview-preview.md). <p><p>**Tip**: For longer running operations, use an [asynchronous polling pattern](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md#async-pattern) or an [until loop](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#until-action). To work around timeout limits when you call another logic app that has a [callable endpoint](logic-apps-http-endpoint.md), you can use the built-in Azure Logic Apps action instead, which you can find in the connector picker under **Built-in**. |
| Inbound request | 120 seconds <br>(2 minutes) | 230 seconds <br>(3.9 minutes) | 240 seconds <br>(4 minutes) | Examples of inbound requests include calls received by the Request trigger, HTTP Webhook trigger, and HTTP Webhook action. For more information about the preview version, see [Azure Logic Apps Preview](logic-apps-overview-preview.md). <p><p>**Note**: For the original caller to get the response, all steps in the response must finish within the limit unless you call another logic app as a nested workflow. For more information, see [Call, trigger, or nest logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md). |

<a name="message-size-limits"></a>

#### Message size

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Message size | 100 MB | 200 MB | To work around this limit, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). However, some connectors and APIs might not support chunking or even the default limit. <p><p>- Connectors such as AS2, X12, and EDIFACT have their own [B2B message limits](#b2b-protocol-limits). <br>- ISE connectors use the ISE limit, not their non-ISE connector limits. |
| Message size with chunking | 1 GB | 5 GB | This limit applies to actions that either natively support chunking or let you enable chunking in their runtime configuration. <p><p>If you're using an ISE, the Logic Apps engine supports this limit, but connectors have their own chunking limits up to the engine limit, for example, see the [Azure Blob Storage connector's API reference](/connectors/azureblob/). For more information about chunking, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). |
|||||

#### Character limits

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Expression evaluation limit | 131,072 characters | The `@concat()`, `@base64()`, `@string()` expressions can't be longer than this limit. |
| Request URL character limit | 16,384 characters |
|||

<a name="retry-policy-limits"></a>

#### Retry policy

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Retry attempts | 90 | The default is 4. To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
| Retry max delay | 1 day | To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
| Retry min delay | 5 seconds | To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
||||

<a name="authentication-limits"></a>

### Authentication limits

Here are the limits for a logic app that starts with a Request trigger and enables [Azure Active Directory Open Authentication](../active-directory/develop/index.yml) (Azure AD OAuth) for authorizing inbound calls to the Request trigger:

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Azure AD authorization policies | 5 | |
| Claims per authorization policy | 10 | |
| Claim value - Maximum number of characters | 150 |
||||

<a name="custom-connector-limits"></a>

## Custom connector limits

Here are the limits for custom connectors that you can create from web APIs.

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Number of custom connectors | 1,000 per Azure subscription | 1,000 per Azure subscription ||
| Number of requests per minute for a custom connector | 500 requests per minute per connection | 2,000 requests per minute per *custom connector* ||
|||

<a name="managed-identity"></a>

## Managed identities

| Name | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Managed identities per logic app | Either the system-assigned identity or 1 user-assigned identity |
| Number of logic apps that have a managed identity in an Azure subscription per region | 1,000 |
|||

<a name="integration-account-limits"></a>

## Integration account limits

Each Azure subscription has these integration account limits:

* One [Free tier](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) integration account per Azure region. This tier is available only for public regions in Azure, for example, West US or Southeast Asia, but not for [Azure China 21Vianet](/azure/china/overview-operations) or [Azure Government](../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md).

* 1,000 total integration accounts, including integration accounts in any [integration service environments (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) across both [Developer and Premium SKUs](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level).

* Each ISE, whether [Developer or Premium](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level), can use a single integration account at no additional cost, although the included account type varies by ISE SKU. You can create more integration accounts for your ISE up to the total limit for an [additional cost](logic-apps-pricing.md#fixed-pricing):

  | ISE SKU | Integration account limits |
  |---------|----------------------------|
  | **Premium** | 20 total accounts, including one Standard account at no additional cost. With this SKU, you can have only [Standard](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) accounts. No Free or Basic accounts are permitted. |
  | **Developer** | 20 total accounts, including one [Free](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) account (limited to 1). With this SKU, you can have either combination: <p>- A Free account and up to 19 [Standard](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) accounts. <br>- No Free account and up to 20 Standard accounts. <p>No Basic or additional Free accounts are permitted. <p><p>**Important**: Use the [Developer SKU](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level) for experimenting, development, and testing, but not for production or performance testing. |
  |||

To learn how pricing and billing work for ISEs, see the [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#fixed-pricing). For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/).

<a name="artifact-number-limits"></a>

### Artifact limits per integration account

Here are the limits on the number of artifacts for each integration account tier. For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/). To learn how pricing and billing work for integration accounts, see the [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the Free tier only for exploratory scenarios,
> not production scenarios. This tier restricts
> throughput and usage, and has no service-level agreement (SLA).

| Artifact | Free | Basic | Standard |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| EDI trading agreements | 10 | 1 | 1,000 |
| EDI trading partners | 25 | 2 | 1,000 |
| Maps | 25 | 500 | 1,000 |
| Schemas | 25 | 500 | 1,000 |
| Assemblies | 10 | 25 | 1,000 |
| Certificates | 25 | 2 | 1,000 |
| Batch configurations | 5 | 1 | 50 |
||||

<a name="artifact-capacity-limits"></a>

### Artifact capacity limits

| Artifact | Limit | Notes |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Assembly | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use an [Azure storage account and blob container](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md). |
| Map (XSLT file) | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use the [Azure Logic Apps REST API - Maps](/rest/api/logic/maps/createorupdate). <p><p>**Note**: The amount of data or records that a map can successfully process is based on the message size and action timeout limits in Azure Logic Apps. For example, if you use an HTTP action, based on [HTTP message size and timeout limits](#http-limits), a map can process data up to the HTTP message size limit if the operation completes within the HTTP timeout limit. |
| Schema | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use an [Azure storage account and blob container](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md). |
||||

<a name="integration-account-throughput-limits"></a>

### Throughput limits

| Runtime endpoint | Free | Basic | Standard | Notes |
|------------------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Read calls per 5 minutes | 3,000 | 30,000 | 60,000 | This limit applies to calls that get the raw inputs and outputs from a logic app's run history. You can distribute the workload across more than one account as necessary. |
| Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 3,000 | 30,000 | 45,000 | You can distribute the workload across more than one account as necessary. |
| Tracking calls per 5 minutes | 3,000 | 30,000 | 45,000 | You can distribute the workload across more than one account as necessary. |
| Blocking concurrent calls | ~1,000 | ~1,000 | ~1,000 | Same for all SKUs. You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
||||

<a name="b2b-protocol-limits"></a>

### B2B protocol (AS2, X12, EDIFACT) message size

Here are the message size limits that apply to B2B protocols:

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| AS2 | v2 - 100 MB<br>v1 - 25 MB | v2 - 200 MB <br>v1 - 25 MB | Applies to decode and encode |
| X12 | 50 MB | 50 MB | Applies to decode and encode |
| EDIFACT | 50 MB | 50 MB | Applies to decode and encode |
||||

<a name="disable-delete"></a>

## Disabling or deleting logic apps

When you disable a logic app, no new runs are instantiated. All in-progress and pending runs continue until they finish, which might take time to complete.

When you delete a logic app, no new runs are instantiated. All in-progress and pending runs are canceled. If you have thousands of runs, cancellation might take significant time to complete.

<a name="configuration"></a>

## Firewall configuration: IP addresses and service tags

The IP addresses that Azure Logic Apps uses for inbound and outbound calls depend on the region where your logic app exists. *All* logic apps in the same region use the same IP address ranges. Some [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started) calls, such as **HTTP** and **HTTP + OpenAPI** requests, go directly through the Azure Logic Apps service and come from the IP addresses that are listed here. For more information about IP addresses used by Power Automate, see [Limits and configuration in Power Automate](/flow/limits-and-config#ip-address-configuration).

> [!TIP]
> To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use
> [service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), rather than
> specify the Logic Apps IP addresses for each region, described later in this section.
> These tags work across the regions where the Logic Apps service is available:
>
> * **LogicAppsManagement**: Represents the inbound IP address prefixes for the Logic Apps service.
> * **LogicApps**: Represents the outbound IP address prefixes for the Logic Apps service.

* For [Azure China 21Vianet](/azure/china/), fixed or reserved IP addresses are unavailable for [custom connectors](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md) and [managed connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md#managed-api-connectors), for example, Azure Storage, SQL Server, Office 365 Outlook, and so on.

* To support the calls that your logic apps directly make with [HTTP](../connectors/connectors-native-http.md), [HTTP + Swagger](../connectors/connectors-native-http-swagger.md), and other HTTP requests, set up your firewall with all the [inbound](#inbound) *and* [outbound](#outbound) IP addresses that are used by the Logic Apps service, based on the regions where your logic apps exist. These addresses appear under the **Inbound** and **Outbound** headings in this section, and are sorted by region.

* To support the calls that [managed connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md#managed-api-connectors) make, set up your firewall with *all* the [outbound](#outbound) IP addresses used by these connectors, based on the regions where your logic apps exist. These addresses appear under the **Outbound** heading in this section, and are sorted by region.

* To enable communication for logic apps that run in an integration service environment (ISE), make sure that you [open these ports](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment.md#network-ports-for-ise).

* If your logic apps have problems accessing Azure storage accounts that use [firewalls and firewall rules](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), you have [various options to enable access](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-storage-accounts-behind-firewalls).

  For example, logic apps can't directly access storage accounts that use firewall rules and exist in the same region. However, if you permit the [outbound IP addresses for managed connectors in your region](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#outbound), your logic apps can access storage accounts that are in a different region except when you use the Azure Table Storage or Azure Queue Storage connectors. To access your Table Storage or Queue Storage, you can use the HTTP trigger and actions instead. For other options, see [Access storage accounts behind firewalls](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-storage-accounts-behind-firewalls).

### Inbound IP addresses

This section lists the inbound IP addresses for the Azure Logic Apps service only. If you have Azure Government, see [Azure Government - Inbound IP addresses](#azure-government-inbound).

> [!TIP]
> To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use the
> [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), **LogicAppsManagement**,
> rather than specify inbound Logic Apps IP address prefixes for each region.
> For managed connectors, you can optionally use the **AzureConnectors** service tag, 
> rather than specify inbound managed connector IP address prefixes for each region.
> These tags work across the regions where the Logic Apps service is available.
