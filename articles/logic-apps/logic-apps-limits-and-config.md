# Limits and configuration information for Azure Logic Apps

This article describes the limits and configuration details for creating and running automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps. For Power Automate, see [Limits and configuration in Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/limits-and-config).

<a name="definition-limits"></a>

## Definition limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app definition:

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Actions per workflow | 500 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. |
| Allowed nesting depth for actions | 8 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. |
| Workflows per region per subscription | 1,000 | |
| Triggers per workflow | 10 | When working in code view, not the designer |
| Switch scope cases limit | 25 | |
| Variables per workflow | 250 | |
| Characters per expression | 8,192 | |
| Maximum size for `trackedProperties` | 16,000 characters |
| Name for `action` or `trigger` | 80 characters | |
| Length of `description` | 256 characters | |
| Maximum `parameters` | 50 | |
| Maximum `outputs` | 10 | |

<a name="run-duration-retention-limits"></a>

## Run duration and retention limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Run duration | 90 days | 366 days | Run duration is calculated by using a run's start time and the limit that's specified *at start time* by the workflow setting, [**Run history retention in days**](#change-duration). <p><p>To change the default limit, which is 90 days, see [change run duration](#change-duration). |
| Run retention in storage | 90 days | 366 days | Run retention is calculated by using a run's start time and the limit that's specified *at the current time* by the workflow setting, [**Run history retention in days**](#change-retention). Whether a run completes or times out, the retention calculation always uses the run's start time. When a run's duration exceeds the *current* retention limit, the run is removed from the runs history. <p><p>If you change this setting, the current limit is always used for calculating retention, no matter the previous limit. For example, if you reduce the retention limit from 90 days to 30 days, a run that's 60 days old is removed from the runs history. If you increase the retention period from 30 days to 60 days, a run that's 20 days old stays in the runs history for another 40 days. <p><p>To change the default limit, which is 90 days, see [change run retention in storage](#change-retention). |
| Minimum recurrence interval | 1 second | 1 second ||
| Maximum recurrence interval | 500 days | 500 days ||

### Change run duration and run retention in storage

To change the default limit for run duration and run retention in storage, follow these steps. To increase the maximum limit, [contact the Logic Apps team](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) for help with your requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> For logic apps in multi-tenant Azure, the 90-day default limit is the same as the maximum limit. You can only decrease this value.
> For logic apps in an integration service environment, you can decrease or increase the 90-day default limit.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). In the portal search box, find and select **Logic apps**.

1. Select and then open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. On the logic app's menu, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Runtime options**, from the **Run history retention in days** list, select **Custom**.

1. Drag the slider to change the number of days that you want.

1. When you're done, on the **Workflow settings** toolbar, select **Save**.

## Concurrency, looping, and debatching limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Trigger concurrency | - Unlimited when the concurrency control is turned off <p><p>- 25 is the default limit when the concurrency control is turned on, which you can't undo after you enable concurrency. You can change the default to a value between 1 and 50 inclusively. | This limit describes the highest number of logic app instances that can run at the same time, or in parallel. <p><p>**Note**: When concurrency is turned on, the SplitOn limit is reduced to 100 items for [debatching arrays](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#split-on-debatch). <p><p>To change the default limit to a value between 1 and 50 inclusively, see [Change trigger concurrency limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-trigger-concurrency) or [Trigger instances sequentially](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#sequential-trigger). |
| Maximum waiting runs | - Without concurrency, the minimum number of waiting runs is 1, while the maximum number is 50. <p><p>- With concurrency, the minimum number of waiting runs is 10 plus the number of concurrent runs (trigger concurrency). You can change the maximum number up to 100 inclusively. | This limit describes the highest number of logic app instances that can wait to run when your logic app is already running the maximum concurrent instances. <p><p>To change the default limit, see [Change waiting runs limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-waiting-runs). |
| Foreach array items | 100,000 | This limit describes the highest number of array items that a "for each" loop can process. <p><p>To filter larger arrays, you can use the [query action](logic-apps-perform-data-operations.md#filter-array-action). |
| Foreach concurrency | 20 is the default limit when the concurrency control is turned off. You can change the default to a value between 1 and 50 inclusively. | This limit is highest number of "for each" loop iterations that can run at the same time, or in parallel. <p><p>To change the default limit to a value between 1 and 50 inclusively, see [Change "for each" concurrency limit](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-for-each-concurrency) or [Run "for each" loops sequentially](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#sequential-for-each). |
| SplitOn items | - 100,000 without trigger concurrency <p><p>- 100 with trigger concurrency | For triggers that return an array, you can specify an expression that uses a 'SplitOn' property that [splits or debatches array items into multiple workflow instances](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#split-on-debatch) for processing, rather than use a "Foreach" loop. This expression references the array to use for creating and running a workflow instance for each array item. <p><p>**Note**: When concurrency is turned on, the SplitOn limit is reduced to 100 items. |
| Until iterations | - Default: 60 <p><p>- Maximum: 5,000 | |
||||

<a name="throughput-limits"></a>

## Throughput limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app definition:

### Multi-tenant Logic Apps service

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Action: Executions per 5 minutes | 100,000 is the default limit, but 300,000 is the maximum limit. | To change the default limit, see [Run your logic app in "high throughput" mode](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#run-high-throughput-mode), which is in preview. Or, you can distribute the workload across more than one logic app as necessary. |
| Action: Concurrent outgoing calls | ~2,500 | You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
| Runtime endpoint: Concurrent incoming calls | ~1,000 | You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
| Runtime endpoint: Read calls per 5 minutes  | 60,000 | You can distribute workload across more than one app as necessary. |
| Runtime endpoint: Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 45,000 | You can distribute workload across more than one app as necessary. |
| Content throughput per 5 minutes | 600 MB | You can distribute workload across more than one app as necessary. |
||||

### Integration service environment (ISE)

Here are the throughput limits for the [Premium ISE SKU](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level):

| Name | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Base unit execution limit | System-throttled when infrastructure capacity reaches 80% | Provides ~4,000 action executions per minute, which is ~160 million action executions per month | |
| Scale unit execution limit | System-throttled when infrastructure capacity reaches 80% | Each scale unit can provide ~2,000 additional action executions per minute, which is ~80 million more action executions per month | |
| Maximum scale units that you can add | 10 | |
||||

To go above these limits in normal processing, or run load testing that might go above these limits, [contact the Logic Apps team](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) for help with your requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Developer ISE SKU](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level) 
> has no published limits, no capabilities for scaling up, and no service-level agreement (SLA). Use this SKU 
> only for experimenting, development, and testing, not production or performance testing.

<a name="gateway-limits"></a>

## Gateway limits

Azure Logic Apps supports write operations, including inserts and updates, through the gateway. However, these operations have [limits on their payload size](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem#considerations).

<a name="request-limits"></a>

## HTTP limits

Here are the limits for a single outgoing or incoming HTTP call:

#### Timeout

Some connector operations make asynchronous calls or listen for webhook requests, so the timeout for these operations might be longer than these limits. For more information, see the technical details for the specific connector and also [Workflow triggers and actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#http-action).

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Outbound request | 120 seconds <br>(2 minutes) | 240 seconds <br>(4 minutes) | Examples of outbound requests include calls made by HTTP triggers. <p><p>**Tip**: For longer running operations, use an [asynchronous polling pattern](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md#async-pattern) or an [until loop](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#until-action). |
| Inbound request | 120 seconds <br>(2 minutes) | 240 seconds <br>(4 minutes) | Examples of inbound requests include calls received by request triggers and webhook triggers. <p><p>**Note**: For the original caller to get the response, all steps in the response must finish within the limit unless you call another logic app as a nested workflow. For more information, see [Call, trigger, or nest logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md). |
|||||

<a name="message-size-limits"></a>

#### Message size

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Message size | 100 MB | 200 MB | To work around this limit, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). However, some connectors and APIs might not support chunking or even the default limit. <p><p>- Connectors such as AS2, X12, and EDIFACT have their own [B2B message limits](#b2b-protocol-limits). <br>- ISE connectors use the ISE limit, not their non-ISE connector limits. |
| Message size with chunking | 1 GB | 5 GB | This limit applies to actions that either natively support chunking or let you enable chunking in their runtime configuration. <p><p>If you're using an ISE, the Logic Apps engine supports this limit, but connectors have their own chunking limits up to the engine limit, for example, see the [Azure Blob Storage connector's API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/azureblob/). For more information about chunking, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). |
|||||

#### Character limits

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Expression evaluation limit | 131,072 characters | The `@concat()`, `@base64()`, `@string()` expressions can't be longer than this limit. |
| Request URL character limit | 16,384 characters |
|||

<a name="retry-policy-limits"></a>

#### Retry policy

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Retry attempts | 90 | The default is 4. To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
| Retry max delay | 1 day | To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
| Retry min delay | 5 seconds | To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
||||

<a name="authentication-limits"></a>

### Authentication limits

Here are the limits for a logic app that starts with a Request trigger and enables [Azure Active Directory Open Authentication](../active-directory/develop/about-microsoft-identity-platform.md) (Azure AD OAuth) for authorizing inbound calls to the Request trigger:

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Azure AD authorization policies | 5 | |
| Claims per authorization policy | 10 | |
||||

<a name="custom-connector-limits"></a>

## Custom connector limits

Here are the limits for custom connectors that you can create from web APIs.

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| Number of custom connectors | 1,000 per Azure subscription | 1,000 per Azure subscription ||
| Number of requests per minute for a custom connector | 500 requests per minute per connection | 2,000 requests per minute per *custom connector* ||
|||

<a name="managed-identity"></a>

## Managed identities

| Name | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Managed identities per logic app | Either the system-assigned identity or 1 user-assigned identity |
| Number of logic apps that have a managed identity in an Azure subscription per region | 250 |
|||

<a name="integration-account-limits"></a>

## Integration account limits

Each Azure subscription has these integration account limits:

* One [Free tier](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) integration account per Azure region

* 1,000 total integration accounts, including integration accounts in any [integration service environments (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) across both [Developer and Premium SKUs](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level).

* Each ISE, whether [Developer or Premium](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level), is limited to 5 total integration accounts:

  | ISE SKU | Integration account limits |
  |---------|----------------------------|
  | **Premium** | 5 total - [Standard](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) accounts only, including one Standard account for free. No Free or Basic accounts are permitted. |
  | **Developer** | 5 total - [Free](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) (limited to 1 account) and [Standard](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) combined, or all Standard accounts. No Basic accounts are permitted. Use the [Developer SKU](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-level) for experimenting, development, and testing, but not for production or performance testing. |
  |||

Additional costs apply to integration accounts that you add beyond the integration accounts that are included with an ISE. To learn how pricing and billing work for ISEs, see the [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#fixed-pricing). For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/).

<a name="artifact-number-limits"></a>

### Artifact limits per integration account

Here are the limits on the number of artifacts for each integration account tier.
For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/). To learn how pricing and billing work for integration accounts, see the [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the Free tier only for exploratory scenarios,
> not production scenarios. This tier restricts
> throughput and usage, and has no service-level agreement (SLA).

| Artifact | Free | Basic | Standard |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| EDI trading agreements | 10 | 1 | 1,000 |
| EDI trading partners | 25 | 2 | 1,000 |
| Maps | 25 | 500 | 1,000 |
| Schemas | 25 | 500 | 1,000 |
| Assemblies | 10 | 25 | 1,000 |
| Certificates | 25 | 2 | 1,000 |
| Batch configurations | 5 | 1 | 50 |
||||

<a name="artifact-capacity-limits"></a>

### Artifact capacity limits

| Artifact | Limit | Notes |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Assembly | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use an [Azure storage account and blob container](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md). |
| Map (XSLT file) | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use the [Azure Logic Apps REST API - Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/logic/maps/createorupdate). <p><p>**Note**: The amount of data or records that a map can successfully process is based on the message size and action timeout limits in Azure Logic Apps. For example, if you use an HTTP action, based on [HTTP message size and timeout limits](#request-limits), a map can process data up to the HTTP message size limit if the operation completes within the HTTP timeout limit. |
| Schema | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use an [Azure storage account and blob container](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md). |
||||

<a name="integration-account-throughput-limits"></a>

### Throughput limits

| Runtime endpoint | Free | Basic | Standard | Notes |
|------------------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Read calls per 5 minutes | 3,000 | 30,000 | 60,000 | You can distribute the workload across more than one account as necessary. |
| Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 3,000 | 30,000 | 45,000 | You can distribute the workload across more than one account as necessary. |
| Tracking calls per 5 minutes | 3,000 | 30,000 | 45,000 | You can distribute the workload across more than one account as necessary. |
| Blocking concurrent calls | ~1,000 | ~1,000 | ~1,000 | Same for all SKUs. You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
||||

<a name="b2b-protocol-limits"></a>

### B2B protocol (AS2, X12, EDIFACT) message size

Here are the message size limits that apply to B2B protocols:

| Name | Multi-tenant limit | Integration service environment limit | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| AS2 | v2 - 100 MB<br>v1 - 50 MB | v2 - 200 MB <br>v1 - 50 MB | Applies to decode and encode |
| X12 | 50 MB | 50 MB | Applies to decode and encode |
| EDIFACT | 50 MB | 50 MB | Applies to decode and encode |
||||

<a name="disable-delete"></a>

## Disabling or deleting logic apps

When you disable a logic app, no new runs are instantiated. All in-progress and pending runs continue until they finish, which might take time to complete.

When you delete a logic app, no new runs are instantiated. All in-progress and pending runs are canceled. If you have thousands of runs, cancellation might take significant time to complete.

<a name="configuration"></a>

## Firewall configuration: IP addresses and service tags

The IP addresses that Azure Logic Apps uses for incoming and outgoing calls depend on the region where your logic app exists. *All* logic apps in the same region use the same IP address ranges. Some [Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started) calls, such as **HTTP** and **HTTP + OpenAPI** requests, go directly through the Azure Logic Apps service and come from the IP addresses that are listed here. For more information about IP addresses used by Power Automate, see [Limits and configuration in Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/limits-and-config#ip-address-configuration).

> [!TIP]
> To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use 
> [service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), rather than 
> specify the Logic Apps IP addresses for each region, described later in this section. 
> These tags work across the regions where the Logic Apps service is available:
>
> * **LogicAppsManagement**: Represents the inbound IP address prefixes for the Logic Apps service.
> * **LogicApps**: Represents the outbound IP address prefixes for the Logic Apps service.

* For [Azure China 21Vianet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/china/), fixed or reserved IP addresses are unavailable for [custom connectors](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md) and [managed connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md#managed-api-connectors), for example, Azure Storage, SQL Server, Office 365 Outlook, and so on.

* To support the calls that your logic apps directly make with [HTTP](../connectors/connectors-native-http.md), [HTTP + Swagger](../connectors/connectors-native-http-swagger.md), and other HTTP requests, set up your firewall with all the [inbound](#inbound) *and* [outbound](#outbound) IP addresses that are used by the Logic Apps service, based on the regions where your logic apps exist. These addresses appear under the **Inbound** and **Outbound** headings in this section, and are sorted by region.

* To support the calls that [managed connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md#managed-api-connectors) make, set up your firewall with *all* the [outbound](#outbound) IP addresses used by these connectors, based on the regions where your logic apps exist. These addresses appear under the **Outbound** heading in this section, and are sorted by region.

* To enable communication for logic apps that run in an integration service environment (ISE), make sure that you [open these ports](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment.md#network-ports-for-ise).

* If your logic apps have problems accessing Azure storage accounts that use [firewalls and firewall rules](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), you have [various options to enable access](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-storage-accounts-behind-firewalls).

  For example, logic apps can't directly access storage accounts that use firewall rules and exist in the same region. However, if you permit the [outbound IP addresses for managed connectors in your region](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#outbound), your logic apps can access storage accounts that are in a different region except when you use the Azure Table Storage or Azure Queue Storage connectors. To access your Table Storage or Queue Storage, you can use the HTTP trigger and actions instead. For other options, see [Access storage accounts behind firewalls](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-storage-accounts-behind-firewalls).

<a name="inbound"></a>

### Inbound IP addresses

This section lists the inbound IP addresses for the Azure Logic Apps service only. If you have Azure Government, see [Azure Government - Inbound IP addresses](#azure-government-inbound).

> [!TIP]
> To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use the 
> [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), **LogicAppsManagement**, 
> rather than specify inbound Logic Apps IP address prefixes for each region. 
> This tag works across the regions where the Logic Apps service is available.

### Outbound IP addresses

This section lists the outbound IP addresses for the Azure Logic Apps service and managed connectors. If you have Azure Government, see [Azure Government - Outbound IP addresses](#azure-government-outbound).

> [!TIP]
> To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use the 
> [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), **LogicApps**, 
> rather than specify outbound Logic Apps IP address prefixes for each region. 
> This tag works across the regions where the Logic Apps service is available. 
> For managed connectors, you must continue to use the IP addresses.
