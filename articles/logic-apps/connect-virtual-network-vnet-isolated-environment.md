# Connect to Azure virtual networks from Azure Logic Apps by using an integration service environment (ISE)

For scenarios where your logic apps and integration accounts need access to an 
[Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md), create an 
[*integration service environment* (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md). 
An ISE is a private and isolated environment that uses dedicated storage and other 
resources that are kept separate from the public or "global" Logic Apps service. 
This separation also reduces any impact that other Azure tenants might have on 
your apps' performance. Your ISE is *injected* into to your Azure virtual network, 
which then deploys the Logic Apps service into your virtual network. When you create 
a logic app or integration account, select this ISE as their location. Your logic app 
or integration account can then directly access resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), 
servers, systems, and services, in your virtual network.

![Select integration service environment](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/select-logic-app-integration-service-environment.png)

This article shows how to complete these tasks:

* Make sure any necessary ports on a virtual network are open so that traffic can travel through your integration service environment (ISE) across the subnets in that virtual network.

* Create your integration service environment (ISE).

* Create a logic app that can run in your ISE.

* Create an integration account for your logic apps in your ISE.

For more information about integration service environments, see 
[Access to Azure Virtual Network resources from Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Logic apps, built-in triggers, built-in actions, and connectors that run in 
  > your ISE use a pricing plan different from the consumption-based pricing plan. 
  > For more information, see [Logic Apps pricing](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md).

* An [Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). 
If you don't have a virtual network, learn how to 
[create an Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md). 

  * Your virtual network must have four *empty* subnets for deploying and 
  creating resources in your ISE. You can create these subnets in advance, 
  or you can wait until you create your ISE where you can create subnets 
  at the same time. Learn more about [subnet requirements](#create-subnet). 
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md), 
    > which provides a private connection to Microsoft cloud services, you must 
    > [create a route table](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.md) that has 
    > the following route and link that table with each subnet used by your ISE:
    > 
    > **Name**: <*route-name*><br>
    > **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0<br>
    > **Next hop**: Internet

  * Make sure that your virtual network [makes these ports available](#ports) 
  so your ISE works correctly and stays accessible.

* If you want to use custom DNS servers for your Azure virtual network, 
[set up those servers by following these steps](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) 
before you deploy your ISE to your virtual network. Otherwise, 
each time you change your DNS server, you also have to restart your ISE, 
which is a capability that's available with ISE public preview.

* Basic knowledge about 
[how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

## Check network ports

When you use an integration service environment (ISE) with a virtual network, a common setup problem is having one or more blocked ports. The connectors that you use for creating connections between your ISE and the destination system might also have their own port requirements. For example, if you communicate with an FTP system by using the FTP connector, make sure the port you use on that FTP system, such as port 21 for sending commands, is available.

To control the traffic across the virtual network's subnets where you deploy ISE, you can set up [network security groups](../virtual-network/security-overview.md) by [filtering network traffic across subnets](../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md). However, your ISE must have specific ports open on the virtual network that uses network security groups. That way, your ISE stays accessible and can work correctly so that you don't lose access to your ISE. Otherwise, if any required ports are unavailable, your ISE stops working.

These tables describe the ports in your virtual network that your ISE uses and where those ports get used. The [Resource Manager service tags](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags) represents a group of IP address prefixes that help minimize complexity when creating security rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For internal communication inside your subnets, 
> ISE requires that you open all ports within those subnets.

| Purpose | Direction | Ports | Source service tag | Destination service tag | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Communication from Azure Logic Apps | Outbound | 80 & 443 | VirtualNetwork | Internet | The port depends on the external service with which the Logic Apps service communicates |

| Azure Storage dependency | Outbound | 80 & 443 | VirtualNetwork | Storage | |
| Intersubnet communication | Inbound & Outbound | 80 & 443 | VirtualNetwork | VirtualNetwork | For communication between subnets |
| Communication to Azure Logic Apps | Inbound | 443 | Internet  | VirtualNetwork | The IP address for the computer or service that calls any request trigger or webhook that exists in your logic app. Closing or blocking this port prevents HTTP calls to logic apps with request triggers.  |
| Logic app run history | Inbound | 443 | Internet  | VirtualNetwork | The IP address for the computer from which you view the logic app's run history. Although closing or blocking this port doesn't prevent you from viewing the run history, you can't view the inputs and outputs for each step in that run history. |

## Create your ISE

To create your integration service environment (ISE), 
follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), 
on the main Azure menu, select **Create a resource**.
In the search box, enter "integration service environment" as your filter.

   ![Create new resource](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/find-integration-service-environment.png)

1. On the Integration Service Environment creation pane, 
choose **Create**.

   ![Choose "Create"](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/create-integration-service-environment.png)

1. Provide these details for your environment, 
and then choose **Review + create**, for example:

   ![Provide environment details](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/integration-service-environment-details.png)

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | The Azure subscription to use for your environment |
   | **Resource group** | Yes | <*Azure-resource-group-name*> | The Azure resource group where you want to create your environment |
   | **Integration Service Environment Name** | Yes | <*environment-name*> | The name to give your environment |
   | **Location** | Yes | <*Azure-datacenter-region*> | The Azure datacenter region where to deploy your environment |
   | **Additional capacity** | Yes | 0 to 10 | The number of additional processing units to use for this ISE resource. To add capacity after creation, see [Add ISE capacity](#add-capacity). |
   | **Virtual network** | Yes | <*Azure-virtual-network-name*> | The Azure virtual network where you want to inject your environment so logic apps in that environment can access your virtual network. If you don't have a network, [create an Azure virtual network first](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md). <p>**Important**: You can *only* perform this injection when you create your ISE. |
   | **Subnets** | Yes | <*subnet-resource-list*> | An ISE requires four *empty* subnets for creating resources in your environment. To create each subnet, [follow the steps under this table](#create-subnet).  |
   |||||

   <a name="create-subnet"></a>

   **Create subnet**

   To create resources in your environment, your ISE needs 
   four *empty* subnets that aren't delegated to any service. 
   You *can't* change these subnet addresses after you create 
   your environment. Each subnet must meet these criteria:

   * Has a name that starts with an alphabetic character or an underscore, 
   and doesn't have these characters: `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `\\`, `?`, `/`

   * Uses the [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) and a Class B address space.

   * Uses at least a `/27` in the address space because each subnet 
   must have 32 addresses as the *minimum*. For example:

     * `10.0.0.0/27` has 32 addresses because 2<sup>(32-27)</sup> is 2<sup>5</sup> or 32.

     * `10.0.0.0/24` has 256 addresses because 2<sup>(32-24)</sup> is 2<sup>8</sup> or 256.

     * `10.0.0.0/28` has only 16 addresses and is too small because 2<sup>(32-28)</sup> 
     is 2<sup>4</sup> or 16.

     To learn more about calculating addresses, see 
     [IPv4 CIDR blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks).

   * If you use [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md), 
   remember to [create a route table](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.md) 
   that has the following route and link that table with each subnet used by your ISE:

     **Name**: <*route-name*><br>
     **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0<br>
     **Next hop**: Internet

   1. Under the **Subnets** list, choose **Manage subnet configuration**.

      ![Manage subnet configuration](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/manage-subnet.png)

   1. On the **Subnets** pane, choose **Subnet**.

      ![Add subnet](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/add-subnet.png)

   1. On the **Add subnet** pane, provide this information.

      * **Name**: The name for your subnet
      * **Address range (CIDR block)**: Your subnet's 
      range in your virtual network and in CIDR format

      ![Add subnet details](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/subnet-details.png)

   1. When you're done, choose **OK**.

   1. Repeat these steps for three more subnets.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If the subnets you try to create aren't valid,
      > the Azure portal shows a message, but doesn't 
      > block your progress.

1. After Azure successfully validates your ISE information, 
choose **Create**, for example:

   ![After successful validation, choose "Create"](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/ise-validation-success.png)

   Azure starts deploying your environment, but this 
   process *might* take up to two hours before finishing. 
   To check deployment status, on your Azure toolbar, 
   choose the notifications icon, which opens the notifications pane.

   ![Check deployment status](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/environment-deployment-status.png)

   If deployment finishes successfully, 
   Azure shows this notification:

   ![Deployment succeeded](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/deployment-success.png)

   Otherwise, follow the Azure portal 
   instructions for troubleshooting deployment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If deployment fails or you delete your ISE, 
   > Azure might take up to an hour before 
   > releasing your subnets. This delay means 
   > means you might have to wait before 
   > reusing those subnets in another ISE. 
   >
   > If you delete your virtual network, 
   > Azure generally takes up to two hours 
   > before releasing up your subnets, 
   > but this operation might take longer. 
   > When deleting virtual networks, 
   > make sure that no resources are 
   > still connected. See [Delete virtual network](../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md#delete-a-virtual-network).

1. To view your environment, choose **Go to resource** if Azure 
doesn't automatically go to your environment after deployment finishes.  

For more information about creating subnets, see 
[Add a virtual network subnet](../virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet.md).

## Create logic app - ISE

To create logic apps that run in your integration service environment (ISE), 
[create your logic apps in the usual way](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md) 
except when you set the **Location** property, select your ISE from the 
**Integration service environments** section, for example:

  ![Select integration service environment](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/create-logic-app-with-integration-service-environment.png)

For differences in how triggers and actions work and how they're labeled when you use an ISE 
compared to the global Logic Apps service, see [Isolated versus global in the ISE overview](connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#difference).

<a name="create-integration-account-environment"></a>

## Create integration account - ISE

If you want to use an integration account with logic apps in an 
integration service environment (ISE), that integration account 
must use the *same environment* as the logic apps. Logic apps in 
an ISE can reference only integration accounts in the same ISE.

To create an integration account that uses an ISE, 
[create your integration account in the usual way](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) 
except when you set the **Location** property, select your ISE from 
the **Integration service environments** section, for example:

![Select integration service environment](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/create-integration-account-with-integration-service-environment.png)

<a name="add-capacity"></a>

## Add ISE capacity

Your ISE base unit has fixed capacity, so if you 
need more throughput, you can add more scale units. 
You can autoscale based on performance metrics or 
based on a number of additional processing units. 
If you choose autoscaling based on metrics, you can 
choose from various criteria and specify the threshold 
conditions for meeting that criteria.

1. In the Azure portal, find your ISE.

1. To review usage and performance metrics for your ISE, 
on your ISE's main menu, select **Overview**.

   ![View usage for ISE](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/integration-service-environment-usage.png)

1. To set up autoscaling, under **Settings**, 
select **Scale out**. On the **Configure** tab, 
choose **Enable autoscale**.

   ![Turn on autoscaling](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/scale-out.png)

1. For **Autoscale setting name**, provide a name for your setting.

1. In the **Default** section, choose either 
**Scale based on a metric** or 
**Scale to a specific instance count**.

   * If you choose instance-based, enter the 
   number of processing units between 0 and 10 inclusively.

   * If you choose metric-based, follow these steps:

     1. In the **Rules** section, choose **Add a rule**.

     1. On the **Scale rule** pane, set up your criteria 
     and action to take when the rule triggers.

     1. When you're done, choose **Add**.

1. When you're finished with your autoscale settings, save your changes.
