# Connect to Azure virtual networks from Azure Logic Apps by using an integration service environment (ISE)

For scenarios where your logic apps and integration accounts need access to an [Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md), create an [*integration service environment* (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md). An ISE is an isolated environment that uses dedicated storage and other resources that are kept separate from the "global" multi-tenant Logic Apps service. This separation also reduces any impact that other Azure tenants might have on your apps' performance. An ISE also provides you with your own static IP addresses. These IP addresses are separate from the static IP addresses that are shared by the logic apps in the public, multi-tenant service.

When you create an ISE, Azure *injects* that ISE into your Azure virtual network, which then deploys the Logic Apps service into your virtual network. When you create a logic app or integration account, select your ISE as their location. Your logic app or integration account can then directly access resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), servers, systems, and services, in your virtual network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For logic apps and integration accounts to work together in an ISE, both must use the *same ISE* as their location.

An ISE has increased limits on run duration, storage retention, throughput, HTTP request and response timeouts, message sizes, and custom connector requests. For more information, see [Limits and configuration for Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). To learn more about ISEs, see [Access to Azure Virtual Network resources from Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md).

This article shows you how to complete these tasks by using the Azure portal:

* Enable access for your ISE.
* Create your ISE.
* Add extra capacity to your ISE.

You can also create an ISE by using the Logic Apps REST API, including setting up customer-managed keys:

* [Create an integration service environment (ISE) by using the Logic Apps REST API](../logic-apps/create-integration-service-environment-rest-api.md)
* [Set up customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest for ISEs](../logic-apps/customer-managed-keys-integration-service-environment.md)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Logic apps, built-in triggers, built-in actions, and connectors that run in your ISE use a pricing plan 
  > different from the consumption-based pricing plan. To learn how pricing and billing work for ISEs, see the 
  > [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#fixed-pricing). 
  > For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md).

* An [Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). If you don't have a virtual network, learn how to [create an Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md).

  * Your virtual network needs to have four *empty* subnets for creating and deploying resources in your ISE. Each subnet supports a different Logic Apps component that's used in your ISE. You can create these subnets in advance, or you can wait until you create your ISE where you can create subnets at the same time. Learn more about [subnet requirements](#create-subnet).

  * Subnet names need to start with either an alphabetic character or an underscore and can't use these characters: `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `\\`, `?`, `/`. 
  
  * If you want to deploy the ISE through an Azure Resource Manager template, first make sure that you delegate one empty subnet to Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironment. You don't need to do this delegation when you deploy through the Azure portal.

  * Make sure that your virtual network [enables access for your ISE](#enable-access) so that your ISE can work correctly and stay accessible.

  * If you use [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md), which provides a private connection to Microsoft cloud services that's facilitated by the connectivity provider, you must [create a route table](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.md) that has the following route and link that table to each subnet that's used by your ISE:

    **Name**: <*route-name*><br>
    **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0<br>
    **Next hop**: Internet

* If you want to use custom DNS servers for your Azure virtual network, [set up those servers by following these steps](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) before you deploy your ISE to your virtual network. For more information about managing DNS server settings, see [Create, change, or delete a virtual network](../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md#change-dns-servers).

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you change your DNS server or DNS server settings, you have to restart your ISE so that the ISE can pick up those changes. For more information, see [Restart your ISE](../logic-apps/ise-manage-integration-service-environment.md#restart-ISE).

## Enable access for ISE

When you use an ISE with an Azure virtual network, a common setup problem is having one or more blocked ports. The connectors that you use for creating connections between your ISE and destination systems might also have their own port requirements. For example, if you communicate with an FTP system by using the FTP connector, the port that you use on your FTP system needs to be available, for example, port 21 for sending commands.

To make sure that your ISE is accessible and that the logic apps in that ISE can communicate across each subnet in your virtual network, [open the ports described in this table for each subnet](#network-ports-for-ise). If any required ports are unavailable, your ISE won't work correctly.

* If you have multiple ISE instances that need access to other endpoints that have IP restrictions, deploy an [Azure Firewall](../firewall/overview.md) or a [network virtual appliance](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md#filter-network-traffic) into your virtual network and route outbound traffic through that firewall or network virtual appliance. You can then [set up a single, outbound, public, static, and predictable IP address](connect-virtual-network-vnet-set-up-single-ip-address.md) that all the ISE instances in your virtual network can use to communicate with destination systems. That way, you don't have to set up additional firewall openings at those destination systems for each ISE.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can use this approach for a single ISE when your scenario requires limiting the 
   > number of IP addresses that need access. Consider whether the additional costs for 
   > the firewall or virtual network appliance make sense for your scenario. Learn more about 
   > [Azure Firewall pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-firewall/).

* If you created a new Azure virtual network and subnets without any constraints, you don't need to set up [network security groups (NSGs)](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#network-security-groups) in your virtual network to control traffic across subnets.

* On an existing virtual network, you can *optionally* set up NSGs by [filtering network traffic across subnets](../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md). If you want to go this route, or if you're already using NSGs, make sure that you [open the ports in this table](#network-ports-for-ise) on the virtual network where you have NSGs or want to set up NSGs.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you use [NSG security rules](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#security-rules), 
  > you need to use *both* the TCP and UDP protocols. NSG security rules describe the ports 
  > that you must open for the IP addresses that need access to those ports. Make sure that 
  > any firewalls, routers, or other items that exist between these endpoints also keep those 
  > ports accessible to those IP addresses.

### Network ports used by your ISE

This table describes the ports in your Azure virtual network that your ISE uses and where those ports get used. To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, the [service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md) in the table represent groups of IP address prefixes for a specific Azure service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Source ports are ephemeral, so make sure that you set them to `*` for all rules. Where noted, internal ISE and external ISE refer to the 
> [endpoint that's selected at ISE creation](connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment.md#create-environment). 
> For more information, see [Endpoint access](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#endpoint-access).

   **Create subnet**

   To create and deploy resources in your environment, your ISE needs four *empty* subnets that aren't delegated to any service. Each subnet supports a different Logic Apps component that's used in your ISE. You *can't* change these subnet addresses after you create your environment. Each subnet needs to meet these requirements:

   * Has a name that starts with an alphabetic character or an underscore (no numbers), and doesn't use these characters: `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `\\`, `?`, `/`.

   * Uses the [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) and a Class B address space.

   * Uses at least a `/27` in the address space because each subnet requires 32 addresses at *minimum*. For example:

     * `10.0.0.0/28` has only 16 addresses and is too small because 2<sup>(32-28)</sup> is 2<sup>4</sup> or 16.

     * `10.0.0.0/27` has 32 addresses because 2<sup>(32-27)</sup> is 2<sup>5</sup> or 32.

     * `10.0.0.0/24` has 256 addresses because 2<sup>(32-24)</sup> is 2<sup>8</sup> or 256. However, more addresses don't provide any additional benefits.

     To learn more about calculating addresses, see [IPv4 CIDR blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks).

   * If you use [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md), you have to [create a route table](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.md) that has the following route and link that table with each subnet that's used by your ISE:

     **Name**: <*route-name*><br>
     **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0<br>
     **Next hop**: Internet

   1. Under the **Subnets** list, select **Manage subnet configuration**.

      ![Manage subnet configuration](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/manage-subnet-configuration.png)

   1. On the **Subnets** pane, select **Subnet**.

      ![Add four empty subnets](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/add-empty-subnets.png)

   1. On the **Add subnet** pane, provide this information.

      * **Name**: The name for your subnet
      * **Address range (CIDR block)**: Your subnet's range in your virtual network and in CIDR format

      ![Add subnet details](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/provide-subnet-details.png)

   1. When you're done, select **OK**.

   1. Repeat these steps for three more subnets.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If the subnets you try to create aren't valid, the Azure portal shows a message, 
      > but doesn't block your progress.

   For more information about creating subnets, see [Add a virtual network subnet](../virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet.md).

1. After Azure successfully validates your ISE information, select **Create**, for example:

   ![After successful validation, select "Create"](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/ise-validation-success.png)

   Azure starts deploying your environment, which usually takes within two hours to finish. Occasionally, deployment might take up to four hours. To check deployment status, on your Azure toolbar, select the notifications icon, which opens the notifications pane.

   ![Check deployment status](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/environment-deployment-status.png)

   If deployment finishes successfully, Azure shows this notification:

   ![Deployment succeeded](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/deployment-success-message.png)

   Otherwise, follow the Azure portal instructions for troubleshooting deployment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If deployment fails or you delete your ISE, Azure might take up to an hour 
   > before releasing your subnets. This delay means means you might have to wait 
   > before reusing those subnets in another ISE.
   >
   > If you delete your virtual network, Azure generally takes up to two hours 
   > before releasing up your subnets, but this operation might take longer. 
   > When deleting virtual networks, make sure that no resources are still connected. 
   > See [Delete virtual network](../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md#delete-a-virtual-network).

1. To view your environment, select **Go to resource** if Azure doesn't automatically go to your environment after deployment finishes.

1. To check the network health for your ISE, see [Manage your integration service environment](../logic-apps/ise-manage-integration-service-environment.md#check-network-health).

1. To start creating logic apps and other artifacts in your ISE, see [Add resources to integration service environments](../logic-apps/add-artifacts-integration-service-environment-ise.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Managed ISE connectors that become available after you create your ISE don't automatically appear in the 
   > connector picker on the Logic App Designer. Before you can use these ISE connectors, you have to manually 
   > [add those connectors to your ISE](../logic-apps/add-artifacts-integration-service-environment-ise.md#add-ise-connectors-environment) 
   > so that they appear in the Logic App Designer.
