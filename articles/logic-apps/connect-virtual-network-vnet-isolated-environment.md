# Connect to Azure virtual networks from Azure Logic Apps by using an integration service environment (ISE)

For scenarios where your logic apps and integration accounts need access to an [Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md), create an [*integration service environment* (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md). An ISE is a private and isolated environment that uses dedicated storage and other resources that are kept separate from the public or "global" Logic Apps service. This separation also reduces any impact that other Azure tenants might have on your apps' performance.

When you create an ISE, Azure *injects* that ISE into your Azure virtual network, which then deploys the Logic Apps service into your virtual network. When you create a logic app or integration account, select your ISE as their location. Your logic app or integration account can then directly access resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), servers, systems, and services, in your virtual network.

![Select integration service environment](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/select-logic-app-integration-service-environment.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For logic apps and integration accounts to work together in an ISE, 
> both must use the *same ISE* as their location.

An ISE has increased limits on run duration, storage retention, throughput, HTTP request and response timeouts, message sizes, and custom connector requests. For more information, see [Limits and configuration for Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). To learn more about ISEs, see [Access to Azure Virtual Network resources from Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md).

This article shows you how to complete these tasks:

* Enable access for your ISE.
* Create your ISE.
* Add extra capacity to your ISE.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Logic apps, built-in triggers, built-in actions, and connectors that run in 
> your ISE use a pricing plan different from the consumption-based pricing plan. 
> To learn how pricing and billing work for ISEs, see the 
> [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#fixed-pricing). 
> For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* An [Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). If you don't have a virtual network, learn how to [create an Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md).

  * Your virtual network needs to have four *empty* subnets for creating and deploying resources in your ISE. You can create these subnets in advance, or you can wait until you create your ISE where you can create subnets at the same time. Learn more about [subnet requirements](#create-subnet).

  * Subnet names need to start with either an alphabetic character or an underscore and can't use these characters: `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `\\`, `?`, `/`. 
  
  * If you want to deploy the ISE through an Azure Resource Manager template, first make sure that you delegate one empty subnet to Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironment. You don't need to do this delegation when you deploy through the Azure portal.

  * Make sure that your virtual network [enables access for your ISE](#enable-access) so that your ISE can work correctly and stay accessible.

  * If you use [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md), which provides a private connection to Microsoft cloud services, you must [create a route table](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.md) that has the following route and link that table to each subnet that's used by your ISE:

    **Name**: <*route-name*><br>
    **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0<br>
    **Next hop**: Internet

* If you want to use custom DNS servers for your Azure virtual network, [set up those servers by following these steps](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) before you deploy your ISE to your virtual network. Otherwise, each time you change your DNS server, you also have to restart your ISE.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If you change your DNS server settings after you create an ISE, make sure that you restart your ISE. 
  > For more information about managing DNS server settings, see [Create, change, or delete a virtual network](../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md#change-dns-servers).

## Enable access for ISE

When you use an ISE with an Azure virtual network, a common setup problem is having one or more blocked ports. The connectors that you use for creating connections between your ISE and destination systems might also have their own port requirements. For example, if you communicate with an FTP system by using the FTP connector, the port that you use on your FTP system needs to be available, for example, port 21 for sending commands.

To make sure that your ISE is accessible and that the logic apps in that ISE can communicate across the subnets in your virtual network, [open the ports in this table](#network-ports-for-ise). If any required ports are unavailable, your ISE won't work correctly.

* If you have multiple ISEs and your virtual network uses [Azure Firewall](../firewall/overview.md) or a [network virtual appliance](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md#filter-network-traffic), you can [set up a single, outbound, public, and predictable IP address](connect-virtual-network-vnet-set-up-single-ip-address.md) to communicate with destination systems. That way, you don't have to set up additional firewall openings for each ISE at the destination.

* If you created a new Azure virtual network and subnets without any constraints, you don't need to set up [network security groups (NSGs)](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#network-security-groups) in your virtual network to control traffic across subnets.

* On an existing virtual network, you can *optionally* set up NSGs by [filtering network traffic across subnets](../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md). If you choose this route, on the virtual network where you want to set up the NSGs, make sure that you [open the ports in this table](#network-ports-for-ise). If you use [NSG security rules](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#security-rules), you need both TCP and UDP protocols.

* If you have previously existing NSGs, make sure that you [open the ports in this table](#network-ports-for-ise). If you use [NSG security rules](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#security-rules), you need both TCP and UDP protocols.

### Network ports used by your ISE

This table describes the ports in your Azure virtual network that your ISE uses and where those ports get used. The [Resource Manager service tags](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags) represents a group of IP address prefixes that help minimize complexity when creating security rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Source ports are ephemeral, so make sure that you set them to `*` for all rules.
> For internal communication inside your subnets, your ISE requires that you open all ports within those subnets.

   |||||

   <a name="create-subnet"></a>

   **Create subnet**

   To create and deploy resources in your environment, your ISE needs four *empty* subnets that aren't delegated to any service. You *can't* change these subnet addresses after you create your environment.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > 
   > Subnet names must start with either an alphabetic character or an underscore 
   > (no numbers), and doesn't use these characters: `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `\\`, `?`, `/`.

   Also, each subnet must meet these requirements:

   * Uses the [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) and a Class B address space.

   * Uses at least a `/27` in the address space because each subnet must have *at least* 32 addresses as a *minimum*. For example:

     * `10.0.0.0/27` has 32 addresses because 2<sup>(32-27)</sup> is 2<sup>5</sup> or 32.

     * `10.0.0.0/24` has 256 addresses because 2<sup>(32-24)</sup> is 2<sup>8</sup> or 256.

     * `10.0.0.0/28` has only 16 addresses and is too small because 2<sup>(32-28)</sup> is 2<sup>4</sup> or 16.

     To learn more about calculating addresses, see [IPv4 CIDR blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks).

   * If you use [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md), you have to [create a route table](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.md) that has the following route and link that table with each subnet that's used by your ISE:

     **Name**: <*route-name*><br>
     **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0<br>
     **Next hop**: Internet

   1. Under the **Subnets** list, choose **Manage subnet configuration**.

      ![Manage subnet configuration](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/manage-subnet.png)

   1. On the **Subnets** pane, choose **Subnet**.

      ![Add subnet](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/add-subnet.png)

   1. On the **Add subnet** pane, provide this information.

      * **Name**: The name for your subnet
      * **Address range (CIDR block)**: Your subnet's range in your virtual network and in CIDR format

      ![Add subnet details](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/subnet-details.png)

   1. When you're done, choose **OK**.

   1. Repeat these steps for three more subnets.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If the subnets you try to create aren't valid, the Azure portal shows a message, 
      > but doesn't block your progress.

   For more information about creating subnets, see [Add a virtual network subnet](../virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet.md).

1. After Azure successfully validates your ISE information, choose **Create**, for example:

   ![After successful validation, choose "Create"](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/ise-validation-success.png)

   Azure starts deploying your environment, which usually takes within two hours to finish. Occasionally, deployment might take up to four hours. To check deployment status, on your Azure toolbar, choose the notifications icon, which opens the notifications pane.

   ![Check deployment status](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/environment-deployment-status.png)

   If deployment finishes successfully, Azure shows this notification:

   ![Deployment succeeded](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/deployment-success.png)

   Otherwise, follow the Azure portal instructions for troubleshooting deployment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If deployment fails or you delete your ISE, Azure might take up to an hour 
   > before releasing your subnets. This delay means means you might have to wait 
   > before reusing those subnets in another ISE.
   >
   > If you delete your virtual network, Azure generally takes up to two hours 
   > before releasing up your subnets, but this operation might take longer. 
   > When deleting virtual networks, make sure that no resources are still connected. 
   > See [Delete virtual network](../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md#delete-a-virtual-network).

1. To view your environment, choose **Go to resource** if Azure doesn't automatically go to your environment after deployment finishes.

1. To check the network health for your ISE, see [Manage your integration service environment](../logic-apps/ise-manage-integration-service-environment.md#check-network-health).

1. To start creating logic apps and other artifacts in your ISE, see [Add artifacts to integration service environments](../logic-apps/add-artifacts-integration-service-environment-ise.md).

<a name="add-capacity"></a>

## Add ISE capacity

The Premium ISE base unit has fixed capacity, so if you need more throughput, you can add more scale units, either during creation or afterwards. You can autoscale based on performance metrics or based on a number of additional processing units. If you choose autoscaling based on metrics, you can choose from various criteria and specify the threshold conditions for meeting that criteria. The Developer SKU doesn't include the capability to add scale units.

1. In the Azure portal, find your ISE.

1. To review usage and performance metrics for your ISE, on your ISE's main menu, select **Overview**.

   ![View usage for ISE](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/integration-service-environment-usage.png)

1. To set up autoscaling, under **Settings**, select **Scale out**. On the **Configure** tab, choose **Enable autoscale**.

   ![Turn on autoscaling](./media/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment/scale-out.png)

1. For **Autoscale setting name**, provide a name for your setting.

1. In the **Default** section, choose either **Scale based on a metric** or **Scale to a specific instance count**.

   * If you choose instance-based, enter the number of processing units between 0 and 10 inclusively.

   * If you choose metric-based, follow these steps:

     1. In the **Rules** section, choose **Add a rule**.

     1. On the **Scale rule** pane, set up your criteria and action to take when the rule triggers.

     1. When you're done, choose **Add**.

1. When you're finished with your autoscale settings, save your changes.
