# Exchange X12 messages for B2B enterprise integration in Azure Logic Apps with Enterprise Integration Pack

Before you can exchange X12 messages for Azure Logic Apps, 
you must create an X12 agreement and 
store that agreement in your integration account. 
Here are the steps for how to create an X12 agreement.

> [!NOTE]
> This page covers the X12 features for Azure Logic Apps. 
> For more information, see [EDIFACT](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md).

## Before you start

Here's the items you need:

* An [integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) 
that's already defined and associated with your Azure subscription
* At least two [partners](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) 
that are defined in your integration account and configured with the X12 identifier under **Business Identities**    
* A required [schema](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) 
that you can upload to your integration account

After you [create an integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md), 
[add partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md), 
and have a [schema](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) that you want to use, 
you can create an X12 agreement by following these steps.

## Create an X12 agreement

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"). 

2. From the main Azure menu, select **All services**. 
   In the search box, enter "integration", 
   and then select **Integration accounts**.  

   ![Find your integration account](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/account-1.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > If **All services** doesn't appear, you might have to expand the menu first. 
   > At the top of the collapsed menu, select **Show menu**.

3. Under **Integration Accounts**, 
   select the integration account where you want to add the agreement.

   ![Select integration account where to create the agreement](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/account-3.png)

4. Select **Overview**, then select the **Agreements** tile. 
   If you don't have an Agreements tile, add the tile first. 

   ![Choose "Agreements" tile](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/agreement-1.png)

5. Under **Agreements**, choose **Add**.

   ![Choose "Add"](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/agreement-2.png)     

6. Under **Add**, enter a **Name** for your agreement. 
   For the agreement type, select **X12**. 
   Select the **Host Partner**, **Host Identity**, 
   **Guest Partner**, and **Guest Identity** for your agreement. 
   For more property details, see the table in this step.

	![Provide agreement details](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/x12-1.png)  

	| Property | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| Name |Name of the agreement |
	| Agreement Type | Should be X12 |
	| Host Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The host partner represents the organization that configures the agreement. |
	| Host Identity |An identifier for the host partner |
	| Guest Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The guest partner represents the organization that's doing business with the host partner. |
	| Guest Identity |An identifier for the guest partner |
	| Receive Settings |These properties apply to all messages received by an agreement. |
	| Send Settings |These properties apply to all messages sent by an agreement. |  

   > [!NOTE]
   > Resolution of X12 agreement depends on matching the sender qualifier and identifier, 
   > and the receiver qualifier and identifier defined in the partner and incoming message. 
   > If these values change for your partner, update the agreement too.

## Configure how your agreement handles received messages

Now that you've set the agreement properties, 
you can configure how this agreement identifies and 
handles incoming messages received from your partner through this agreement.

1.	Under **Add**, select **Receive Settings**.
Configure these properties based on your agreement 
with the partner that exchanges messages with you. 
For property descriptions, see the tables in this section.

	**Receive Settings** is organized into these sections: 
	Identifiers, Acknowledgment, Schemas, Envelopes, Control Numbers, 
	Validations, and Internal Settings.

2. After you're done, 
make sure to save your settings by choosing **OK**.

Now your agreement is ready to handle incoming 
messages that conform to your selected settings.

| FA expected |Returns a functional acknowledgment to the interchange sender. Then select whether you want the 997 or 999 acknowledgments, based on the schema version |
| Include AK2/IK2 Loop |Enables generation of AK2 loops in functional acknowledgments for accepted transaction sets |

### Schemas

Select a schema for each transaction type (ST1) and Sender Application (GS2). 
The receive pipeline disassembles the incoming message by matching the values for ST1 and GS2 
in the incoming message with the values you set here, and the schema of the incoming message with the schema you set here.

![Select schema](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/x12-33.png) 

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Version |Select the X12 version |

| Sender Application (GS02) |Select the sender application |
| Schema |Select the schema file you want to use. Schemas are added to your integration account. |

> [!NOTE]
> Configure the required [Schema](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md)

### Envelopes

![Specify the separator in a transaction set: choose Standard Identifier or Repetition Separator](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/x12-34.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ISA11 Usage |Specifies the separator to use in a transaction set: <p>Select **Standard identifier** to use a period (.) for decimal notation, rather than the decimal notation of the incoming document in the EDI receive pipeline. <p>Select **Repetition Separator** to specify the separator for repeated occurrences of a simple data element or a repeated data structure.
