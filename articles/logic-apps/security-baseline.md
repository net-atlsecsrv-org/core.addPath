# Azure security baseline for Logic Apps

The Azure Security Baseline for Logic Apps contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Connectors that run in the "global," multi-tenant Logic Apps service are deployed and managed by Microsoft. These connectors provide triggers and actions for accessing cloud services, on-premises systems, or both, including Office 365, Azure Blob Storage, SQL Server, Dynamics, Salesforce, SharePoint, and more. You can use the AzureConnectors service tag when specifying rules on your network security group or Azure Firewall to allow access to related resources.

For logic apps that need direct access to resources in an Azure virtual network, you can create an integration service environment (ISE) where you can build, deploy, and run your logic apps on dedicated resources. Some Azure virtual networks use private endpoints (Azure Private Link) for providing access to Azure PaaS services, such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, partner services, or customer services that are hosted on Azure. If your logic apps need access to virtual networks that use private endpoints, you must create, deploy, and run those logic apps inside an ISE.

When you create your ISE, you can choose to use either internal or external access endpoints. Your selection determines whether request or webhook triggers on logic apps in your ISE can receive calls from outside your virtual network. Internal and external access endpoints also affect whether you can view your logic app's run history, including the inputs and outputs for a run, from inside or outside your virtual network.

Make sure that all virtual network subnet deployments related to your ISE have a network security group applied with network access controls specific to your application's trusted ports and sources. When you deploy your logic apps in an ISE, use Private Link. Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Alternatively, if you have a specific use case, you can meet this requirement by implementing Azure Firewall. To help reduce complexity when you set up security rules, use service tags that represent groups of IP address prefixes for a specific Azure service.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: If you run logic apps in an integration service environment (ISE) that uses an external access point, you can use a network security group (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs to an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You can also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: If your logic app uses a request-based trigger, which receives incoming calls or requests, such as the Request or Webhook trigger, you can limit access so that only authorized clients can call your logic app.

If you are running logic apps in an integration service environment (ISE), enable DDoS Protection Standard on the virtual network associated with your ISE to guard against DDoS attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses.

Deploy Azure Firewall at each of the organization's network boundaries with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

Use Azure Security Center Just In Time Network access to configure NSGs to limit exposure of endpoints to approved IP addresses for a limited period.

Use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG configurations that limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: If you are run logic apps in an integration service environment (ISE) that uses an external access point, you can use a network security group (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs to an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You can also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

To provide further protection and information on network traffic, you can refer to access logs, which are generated only if you've enabled them on each Application Gateway instance. You can use this log to view Application Gateway access patterns and analyze important information. This includes the caller's IP, requested URL, response latency, return code, and bytes in and out.

Otherwise, you can leverage a third-party solution from the marketplace to satisfy this requirement.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities. If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or deny malicious traffic.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: For resources that need access to your Azure Logic Apps instances, use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., LogicApps, LogicAppsManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources related to your Azure Logic Apps instances with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Logic" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Logic apps instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions such as:

Diagnostic logs in Logic Apps should be enabled

DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: N/A

**Responsibility**: Microsoft

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: To get richer debugging information about your logic apps during runtime, you can set up and use Azure Monitor logs to record and store information about runtime data and events, such as trigger events, run events, and action events in a Log Analytics workspace. Azure Monitor helps you monitor your cloud and on-premises environments so that you can more easily maintain their availability and performance. By using Azure Monitor logs, you can create log queries that help you collect and review this information. You can also use this diagnostics data with other Azure services, such as Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs.

Alternatively, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### 2.5: Configure security log storage retention

**Guidance**: After you create and run a logic app, you can check that logic app's run status, runs history, trigger history, and performance. For real-time event monitoring and richer debugging, set up diagnostics logging for your logic app by using Azure Monitor logs. This Azure service helps you monitor your cloud and on-premises environments so that you can more easily maintain their availability and performance. You can then find and view events, such as trigger events, run events, and action events. By storing this information in Azure Monitor logs, you can create log queries that help you find and analyze this information. You can also use this diagnostic data with other Azure services, such as Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs.

In Azure Monitor, set log retention period for logs associated with your Azure Logic Apps instances according to your organization's compliance regulations.

### 2.6: Monitor and review Logs

**Guidance**: To set up logging for your logic app, you can enable Log Analytics when you create your logic app, or you can install the Logic Apps Management solution in your Log Analytics workspace for existing logic apps. This solution provides aggregated information for your logic app runs and includes specific details such as status, execution time, resubmission status, and correlation IDs. Then, to enable logging and creating queries for this information, set up Azure Monitor logs.

You can also enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace. Perform queries in Log Analytics to search terms, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide many other insights based on the Activity Log Data that may have been collected for Azure Logic Apps.

Alternatively, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

## Identity and access control

*For more information, see [Security control: Identity and access control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (AD) has built-in roles that must be explicitly assigned and are queryable. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups.

To easily access other resources that are protected by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and authenticate your identity without signing in, your logic app can use a managed identity (formerly Managed Service Identity or MSI), rather than credentials or secrets. Azure manages this identity for you and helps secure your credentials because you don't have to provide or rotate secrets.

Every request endpoint on a logic app has a Shared Access Signature (SAS) in the endpoint's URL. If you share the endpoint URL for a request-based trigger with other parties, you can generate callback URLs that use specific keys and have expiration dates. That way, you can seamlessly roll keys or restrict access to triggering your logic app based on a specific timespan.

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory and Azure Logic Apps do not have the concept of default passwords.

If basic authentication is being used, you will need to specify a username and password. When creating these credentials, ensure that you configure a strong password for authentication.

If you are using Infrastructure as Code, avoid storing passwords in code and instead use Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve credentials.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.4: Use single sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use an Azure app registration (service principal) to retrieve a token that can be used to interact with your Recovery Services vaults via API calls.

Many connectors also require that you first create a connection to the target service or system and provide authentication credentials or other configuration details before you can use a trigger or action in your logic app. For example, you must authorize a connection to a Twitter account for accessing data or to post on your behalf.]

For connectors that use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) OAuth, creating a connection means signing into the service, such as Office 365, Salesforce, or GitHub, where your access token is encrypted and securely stored in an Azure secret store. Other connectors, such as FTP and SQL, require a connection that has configuration details, such as the server address, username, and password. These connection configuration details are also encrypted and securely stored.

### 3.8: Manage Azure resources from only approved locations

**Guidance**: Use Conditional Access Named Locations to allow access to the Azure portal from only specific logical groupings of IP address ranges or countries/regions.

Additionally, every request endpoint on a logic app has a Shared Access Signature (SAS) in the endpoint's URL. You can restrict your logic app to accept requests only from certain IP addresses.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (AD) as the central authentication and authorization system for your Azure Logic Apps instances. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

Where there is support in Logic Apps, use a managed identity to easily access other resources that are protected by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and authenticate your identity without signing in, rather than credentials or secrets. Azure manages this identity for you and helps secure your credentials because you don't have to provide or rotate secrets.

Azure Logic Apps supports both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities. Your logic app can use either the system-assigned identity or a single user-assigned identity, which you can share across a group of logic apps, but not both. Currently, only specific built-in triggers and actions support managed identities, not managed connectors or connections, for example:
- HTTP
- Azure Functions
- Azure API Management
- Azure App Services

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (AD) as the central authentication and authorization system for your Azure Logic Apps instances. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

You have access to Azure AD sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Connectors that run in the "global," multi-tenant Logic Apps service are deployed and managed by Microsoft. These connectors provide triggers and actions for accessing cloud services, on-premises systems, or both, including Office 365, Azure Blob Storage, SQL Server, Dynamics, Salesforce, SharePoint, and more.

For logic apps that need direct access to resources in an Azure virtual network, you can create an integration service environment (ISE) where you can build, deploy, and run your logic apps on dedicated resources. Some Azure virtual networks use private endpoints (Azure Private Link) for providing access to Azure PaaS services, such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure SQL Database, partner services, or customer services that are hosted on Azure. If your logic apps need access to virtual networks that use private endpoints, you must create, deploy, and run those logic apps inside an ISE.

When you create your ISE, you can choose to use either internal or external access endpoints. Your selection determines whether request or webhook triggers on logic apps in your ISE can receive calls from outside your virtual network.

Additionally, implement isolation using separate subscriptions and management groups for individual security domains such as environment type and data sensitivity level. You can restrict the level of access to your Azure resources that your applications and enterprise environments demand. You can control access to Azure resources via Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

### 4.4: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit. In Azure Logic Apps, all the data during a logic app run is encrypted during transit by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and at rest. When you view your logic app's run history, Logic Apps authenticates your access and then provides links to the inputs and outputs for the requests and responses for each run. However, for actions that handle any passwords, secrets, keys, or other sensitive information, you want to prevent others from viewing and accessing that data. For example, if your logic app gets a secret from Azure Key Vault to use when authenticating an HTTP action, you want to hide that secret from view.

The Request trigger supports only Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 for inbound requests. Make sure that any clients connecting to your Azure resources are able to negotiate TLS 1.2 or greater. Outbound calls using the HTTP connector support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.

Follow Azure Security Center recommendations for encryption at rest and encryption in transit, where applicable.

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

**Guidance**: You can permit only specific users or groups to run specific tasks, such as managing, editing, and viewing logic apps. To control their permissions, use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) so that you can assign customized or built-in roles to the members in your Azure subscription:
- Logic App Contributor: Lets you manage logic apps, but you can't change access to them.
- Logic App Operator: Lets you read, enable, and disable logic apps, but you can't edit or update them.

To prevent others from changing or deleting your logic app, you can use Azure Resource Lock. This capability prevents others from changing or deleting production resources.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Azure Logic Apps relies on Azure Storage to store and automatically encrypt data at rest. This encryption protects your data and helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, Azure Storage uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt your data.

When you create an integration service environment (ISE) for hosting your logic apps, and you want more control over the encryption keys used by Azure Storage, you can set up, use, and manage your own key by using Azure Key Vault. This capability is also known as "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK), and your key is called a "customer-managed key".

### 7.11: Manage Azure secrets securely

**Guidance**: Secure inputs and outputs in logic app run history by using obfuscation. If you deploy across different environments, consider parameterizing the values in your logic app's workflow definition that vary based on those environments. That way, you can avoid hard-coded data by using an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy your logic app, protect sensitive data by defining secured parameters, and pass that data as separate inputs through the template's parameters by using a parameter file. You can use Key Vault to store sensitive data and use secured template parameters that retrieve those values from Key Vault at deployment. You can then reference the key vault and secrets in your parameter file.

When you create an integration service environment (ISE) for hosting your logic apps, and you want more control over the encryption keys used by Azure Storage, you can set up, use, and manage your own key by using Azure Key Vault. This capability is also known as "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK), and your key is called a "customer-managed key".

### 7.12: Manage identities securely and automatically

**Guidance**: To easily access other resources that are protected by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and authenticate your identity without signing in, your logic app can use a managed identity (formerly Managed Service Identity or MSI), rather than credentials or secrets. Azure manages this identity for you and helps secure your credentials because you don't have to provide or rotate secrets.

Currently, only specific built-in triggers and actions support managed identities, not managed connectors or connections, for example:
- HTTP
- Azure Functions
- Azure API Management
- Azure App Services

That way, you can avoid hard-coded data by using an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy your logic app, protect sensitive data by defining secured parameters, and pass that data as separate inputs through the template's parameters by using a parameter file. You can use Key Vault to store sensitive data and use secured template parameters that retrieve those values from Key Vault at deployment. You can then reference the key vault and secrets in your parameter file.

You can also implement Credential Scanner to identify credentials within code. Credential Scanner will also encourage moving discovered credentials to more secure locations such as Azure Key Vault.

## Data recovery

*For more information, see [Security control: Data recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back ups

**Guidance**: Implement a disaster recovery (DR) solution in place so that you can protect data, quickly restore the resources that support critical business functions, and keep operations running to maintain business continuity (BC).

This disaster recovery strategy focuses on setting up your primary logic app to failover onto a standby or backup logic app in an alternate location where Azure Logic Apps is also available. That way, if the primary suffers losses, disruptions, or failures, the secondary can take on the work. This strategy requires that your secondary logic app and dependent resources are already deployed and ready in the alternate location.

Additionally, you should expand your logic app's underlying workflow definition into an Azure Resource Manager template. This template defines the infrastructure, resources, parameters, and other information for provisioning and deploying your logic app.
