# Connect to SAP systems from Azure Logic Apps

This article explains how you can access your SAP resources from Logic Apps using the [SAP connector](/connectors/sap/).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* A logic app from which you want to access your SAP resources. If you're new to Logic Apps, see the [Logic Apps service overview](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) and the [quickstart for creating your first logic app in the Azure portal](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

    * If you've used a previous version of the SAP connector that has been deprecated, you must [migrate to the current connector](#migrate-to-current-connector) before you can connect to your SAP server.

    * If you're running your logic app in multi-tenant Azure, see the [multi-tenant prerequisites](#multi-tenant-azure-prerequisites).

    * If you're running your logic app in a Premium-level [integration service environment (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md), see the [ISE prerequisites](#ise-prerequisites).

* An [SAP application server](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/ABAP/ABAP+Application+Server) or [SAP message server](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/40/c235c15ab7468bb31599cc759179ef/frameset.htm) that you want to access from Logic Apps. For information about what SAP servers and SAP actions you can use with the connector, see [SAP compatibility](#sap-compatibility).

    * You must configure your SAP server to allow the use of RFC. For more information, see the following SAP note: [460089 - Minimum authorization profiles for external RFC programs](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/460089). 

* Message content to send to your SAP server, such as a sample IDoc file. This content must be in XML format and include the namespace of the SAP action you want to use. You can [send IDocs with a flat file schema by wrapping them in an XML envelope](#send-flat-file-idocs).

* If you want to use the **When a message is received from SAP** trigger, you must also do the following:

    * Set up your SAP gateway security permissions with this setting: 
    `"TP=Microsoft.PowerBI.EnterpriseGateway HOST=<gateway-server-IP-address> ACCESS=*"`

    * Set up your SAP gateway security logging to help find Access Control List (ACL). For more information, see the [SAP help topic for setting up gateway logging](https://help.sap.com/erp_hcm_ias2_2015_02/helpdata/en/48/b2a710ca1c3079e10000000a42189b/frameset.htm). Otherwise, you will receive this error:
    `"Registration of tp Microsoft.PowerBI.EnterpriseGateway from host <host-name> not allowed"`

    > [!NOTE]
    > This trigger uses the same URI location to both renew and unsubscribe from a webhook subscription. The renewal operation uses the HTTP `PATCH` method, while the unsubscribe operation uses the HTTP `DELETE` method. This behavior might make a renewal operation appear as an unsubscribe operation in your trigger's history, but the operation is still a renewal because the trigger uses `PATCH` as the HTTP method, not `DELETE`.

### SAP compatibility

The SAP connector is compatible with the following types of SAP systems:

* On-premises and cloud-based HANA-based SAP systems, such as S/4 HANA.

* Classic on-premises SAP systems, such as R/3 and ECC.

The SAP connector supports the following message and data integration types from SAP NetWeaver-based systems:

* Intermediate Document (IDoc)

* Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI)

* Remote Function Call (RFC) and Transactional RFC (tRFC)

The SAP connector uses the [SAP .NET Connector (NCo) library](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html). You can use the following SAP actions and trigger with the connector:

* **Send message to SAP** to [send IDocs over tRFC](#send-idoc-action) action, which you can use to:

    * [Call BAPI functions over RFC](#call-bapi-action)

    * Call RFC/tRFC in SAP systems

    * Create or close stateful sessions

    * Commit or roll back BAPI transactions

    * Confirm a transaction identifier

    * Send IDocs, get an IDoc's status from its number, and get a list of IDocs for a transaction

    * Read an SAP table

* **When a message is received from SAP** trigger, which you can use to:

    * Receive IDocs over tRFC

    * Call BAPI functions over tRFC

    * Call RFC/tRFC in SAP systems

* **Generate schemas** action, which you can use to generate schemas for the SAP artifacts for IDoc, BAPI, or RFC.

To use these SAP actions, you need to first authenticate your connection with a username and password. The SAP connector also supports [Secure Network Communications (SNC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw70/7.0.31/e6/56f466e99a11d1a5b00000e835363f/content.htm?no_cache=true). You can use SNC for SAP NetWeaver single sign-on (SSO), or for additional security capabilities from external products. If you use SNC, see the [SNC prerequisites](#snc-prerequisites).

### Migrate to current connector

The previous SAP Application Server and SAP Message server connectors were deprecated February 29, 2020. To migrate to the current SAP connector, follow these steps:

1. Update your [on-premises data gateway](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53127) to the current version. For more information, see [Install an on-premises data gateway for Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md).

1. In your logic app that uses the deprecated SAP connector, delete the **Send to SAP** action.

1. Add the **Send message to SAP** action from the current SAP connector.

1. Reconnect to your SAP system in the new action.

1. Save your logic app.

### Multi-tenant Azure prerequisites

These prerequisites apply if your logic app runs in multi-tenant Azure. The managed SAP connector doesn't run natively in an [ISE](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a Premium-level ISE, you can use the SAP ISE connector instead of the managed SAP connector. For more information, see the [ISE prerequisites](#ise-prerequisites).

The managed SAP connector integrates with SAP systems through your [on-premises data gateway](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md). For example, in send message scenarios, when a message is sent from a logic app to an SAP system, the data gateway acts as an RFC client and forwards the requests received from the logic app to SAP. Likewise, in receive message scenarios, the data gateway acts as an RFC server that receives requests from SAP and forwards them to the logic app.

* [Download and install the on-premises data gateway](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md) on a host computer or virtual machine that exists in the same virtual network as the SAP system to which you're connecting.

* [Create an Azure gateway resource](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md#create-azure-gateway-resource) for your on-premises data gateway in the Azure portal. This gateway helps you securely access on-premises data and resources. Make sure to use a supported version of the gateway.

    * If you experience an issue with your gateway, try [upgrading to the latest version](https://aka.ms/on-premises-data-gateway-installer), which might include updates to resolve your problem.

* [Download and install the latest SAP client library](#sap-client-library-prerequisites) on the same local computer as your on-premises data gateway.

### ISE prerequisites

These prerequisites apply if you're running your logic app in a Premium-level ISE. However, they don't apply to logic apps running in a Developer-level ISE. An ISE provides access to resources that are protected by an Azure virtual network and offers other ISE-native connectors that let logic apps directly access on-premises resources without using on-premises data gateway.

1. If you don't already have an Azure Storage account with a blob container, create a container using either the [Azure portal](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md) or [Azure Storage Explorer](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-storage-explorer.md).

1. [Download and install the latest SAP client library](#sap-client-library-prerequisites) on your local computer. You should have the following assembly files:

   * libicudecnumber.dll

   * rscp4n.dll

   * sapnco.dll

   * sapnco_utils.dll

1. Create a .zip file that includes these assembly files. Upload the package to your blob container in Azure Storage.

1. In either the Azure portal or Azure Storage Explorer, browse to the container location where you uploaded the .zip file.

1. Copy the URL of the container location. Make sure to include the Shared Access Signature (SAS) token, so the SAS token is authorized. Otherwise, deployment for the SAP ISE connector fails.

1. Install and deploy the SAP connector in your ISE. For more information, see [Add ISE connectors](../logic-apps/add-artifacts-integration-service-environment-ise.md#add-ise-connectors-environment).

   1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find and open your ISE.

   1. On the ISE menu, select **Managed connectors** &gt; **Add**. From the connectors list, find and select **SAP**.

   1. On the **Add a new managed connector** pane, in the **SAP package** box, paste the URL for the .zip file that has the SAP assemblies. Again, make sure to include the SAS token.
 
  1. Select **Create** to finish creating your  ISE connector.

1. If your SAP instance and ISE are in different virtual networks, you also need to [peer those networks](../virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks-portal.md) so they are connected.

### SAP client library prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for the SAP client library that you're using with the connector.

* Make sure that you install the latest version, [SAP Connector (NCo 3.0) for Microsoft .NET 3.0.22.0 compiled with .NET Framework 4.0  - Windows 64-bit (x64)](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html). Earlier versions of SAP NCo might experience issues when more than one IDoc message is sent at the same time. This condition blocks all later messages sent to the SAP destination, which causes the messages to time out.

* You must have the 64-bit version of the SAP client library installed, because the data gateway only runs on 64-bit systems. Installing the unsupported 32-bit version results in a "bad image" error.

* Copy the assembly files from the default installation folder to another location, based on your scenario as follows.

    * For logic apps running in an ISE, follow the [ISE prerequisites](#ise-prerequisites) instead.

    * For logic apps running in multi-tenant Azure and using your on-premises data gateway, copy the assembly files to the data gateway installation folder. 

        
        * If your SAP connection fails with the error message, **Please check your account info and/or permissions and try again**, make sure you copied the assembly files to the data gateway installation folder.
        
        * Troubleshoot further issues using the [.NET assembly binding log viewer](/dotnet/framework/tools/fuslogvw-exe-assembly-binding-log-viewer). This tool lets you check that your assembly files are in the correct location. 
        
        * Optionally, select the **Global Assembly Cache registration** option when you install the SAP client library.

Note the following relationships between the SAP client library, the .NET Framework, the .NET runtime, and the gateway:

* Both the Microsoft SAP Adapter and the gateway host service use .NET Framework 4.7.2.

* The SAP NCo for .NET Framework 4.0 works with processes that use .NET runtime 4.0 to 4.8.

* The SAP NCo for .NET Framework 2.0 works with processes that use .NET runtime 2.0 to 3.5, but no longer works with the latest gateway.

### SNC prerequisites

If you use an on-premises data gateway with optional SNC, which is only supported in multi-tenant Azure, you must configure these additional settings.

If you're using SNC with SSO, make sure the data gateway service is running as a user who is mapped against the SAP user. To change the default account, select **Change account**, and enter the user credentials.

![Screenshot of On-premises data gateway settings in the Azure Portal, showing Service Settings page with button to change the gateway service account selected.](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/gateway-account.png)

If you're enabling SNC through an external security product, copy the SNC library or files on the same computer where your data gateway is installed. Some examples of SNC products include [sapseculib](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw74/helpdata/en/7a/0755dc6ef84f76890a77ad6eb13b13/frameset.htm), Kerberos, and NTLM. For more information about enabling SNC for the data gateway, see [Enable Secure Network Communications](#enable-secure-network-communications).

## Send IDoc messages to SAP server

Follow these examples to create a logic app that sends an IDoc message to an SAP server and returns a response:

1. [Create a logic app that is triggered by an HTTP request.](#create-http-request-trigger)

1. [Create an action in your workflow to send a message to SAP.](#create-sap-action-to-send-message)

1. [Create an HTTP response action in your workflow.](#create-http-response-action)

1. [Create a remote function call (RFC) request-response pattern, if you're using an RFC to receive replies from SAP ABAP.](#create-rfc-request-response)

1. [Test your logic app.](#test-logic-app)

### Create HTTP request trigger

> [!NOTE]
> When a logic app receives IDocs from SAP, the [request trigger](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md) now supports the SAP plain XML format. To receive IDocs as plain XML, use the trigger **When a message is received from SAP**. Set the parameter **IDOC Format** to **SapPlainXml**.

First, create a logic app with an endpoint in Azure to send *HTTP POST* requests to your logic app. When your logic app receives these HTTP requests, the [trigger](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) fires and runs the next step in your workflow.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a blank logic app, which opens the **Logic Apps Designer**.

1. In the search box, enter `http request` as your filter. From the **Triggers** list, select **When a HTTP request is received**.

   ![Screenshot of Logic Apps Designer, showing a new HTTP request trigger being added to the logic app.](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/add-http-trigger-logic-app.png)

1. Save your logic app so that you can generate an endpoint URL for your logic app. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**. The endpoint URL now appears in your trigger. 

   ![Screenshot of Logic Apps Designer, showing HTTP request trigger with generated POST URL being copied.](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/generate-http-endpoint-url.png)

### Create SAP action to send message

Next, create an action to send your IDoc message to SAP when your [HTTP request trigger](#create-http-request-trigger) fires.

1. In the Logic Apps Designer, under the trigger, select **New step**.

   ![Screenshot of Logic Apps Designer, showing logic app being edited to add a new step.](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/add-sap-action-logic-app.png)

1. In the search box, enter `sap` as your filter. From the **Actions** list, select **Send message to SAP**.
  
   ![Screenshot of Logic Apps Designer, showing selection of "Send message to SAP" action.](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-sap-send-action.png)

   Or, you can select the **Enterprise** tab, and select the SAP action.

   ![Screenshot of Logic Apps Designer, showing selection of "Send message to SAP" action under Enterprise tab.](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-sap-send-action-ent-tab.png)

1. If your connection already exists, continue to the next step. If you're prompted to create a new connection, provide the following information to connect to your on-premises SAP server.

   1. Provide a name for the connection.

   1. If you're using the data gateway, follow these steps:
   
      1. In the **Data Gateway** section, under **Subscription**, first select the Azure subscription for the data gateway resource that you created in the Azure portal for your data gateway installation.
   
      1. Under **Connection Gateway**, select your data gateway resource in Azure.

   1. Continue providing connection information. For the **Logon Type** property, follow the step based on whether the property is set to **Application Server** or **Group**:
   
      * For **Application Server**, these properties, which usually appear optional, are required:

        ![Create SAP application server connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/create-SAP-application-server-connection.png)

      * For **Group**, these properties, which usually appear optional, are required:

        ![Create SAP message server connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/create-SAP-message-server-connection.png)  

      By default, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. The **Safe Typing** option is available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. Learn more about the [Safe Typing option](#safe-typing).

   1. When you're finished, select **Create**.

      Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection to make sure that the connection works properly.

    > [!NOTE]

    > If you receive the following error, there is a problem with your installation of the SAP NCo client library: 
    >
    > **Test connection failed. Error 'Failed to process request. Error details: 'could not load file or assembly 'sapnco, Version=3.0.0.42, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken 50436dca5c7f7d23' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.'.'**
    >
    > Make sure to [install the required version of the SAP NCo client library and meet all other prerequisites](#sap-client-library-prerequisites).

1. Now find and select an action from your SAP server.

   1. In the **SAP Action** box, select the folder icon. From the file list, find and select the SAP message you want to use. To navigate the list, use the arrows.

      This example selects an IDoc with the **Orders** type.

      ![Find and select IDoc action](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/SAP-app-server-find-action.png)

      If you can't find the action you want, you can manually enter a path, for example:

      ![Manually provide path to IDoc action](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/SAP-app-server-manually-enter-action.png)

      > [!TIP]
      > Provide the value for **SAP Action** through the expression editor. 
      > That way, you can use the same action for different message types.

      For more information about IDoc operations, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations).

   1. Click inside the **Input Message** box so that the dynamic content list appears. From that list, under **When a HTTP request is received**, select the **Body** field.

      This step includes the body content from your HTTP Request trigger and sends that output to your SAP server.

      ![Select the "Body" property from trigger](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/SAP-app-server-action-select-body.png)

      When you're finished, your SAP action looks like this example:

      ![Complete the SAP action](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/SAP-app-server-complete-action.png)

1. Save your logic app. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

#### Send flat file IDocs

You can use IDocs with a flat file schema if you wrap them in an XML envelope. To send a flat file IDoc, use the generic instructions to [create an SAP action to send your IDoc message](#create-sap-action-to-send-message) with the following changes.

1. For the **Send message to SAP** action, use SAP action URI `http://microsoft.lobservices.sap/2007/03/Idoc/SendIdoc`.

1. Format your input message with an XML envelope. For an example, see the following example XML payload:

```xml
<ReceiveIdoc xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/"><idocData>EDI_DC 3000000001017945375750 30INVOIC011BTSVLINV30KUABCABCFPPC LDCA X004010810 4 SAPMSX LSEDI ABCABCFPPC 000d3ae4-723e-1edb-9ca4-cc017365c9fd 20210217054521INVOICINVOIC01ZINVOIC2RE 20210217054520

### Create HTTP response action

Now add a response action to your logic app's workflow and include the output from the SAP action. That way, your logic app returns the results from your SAP server to the original requestor.

1. In the Logic Apps Designer, under the SAP action, select **New step**.

1. In the search box, enter `response` as your filter. From the **Actions** list, select **Response**.

1. Click inside the **Body** box so that the dynamic content list appears. From that list, under **Send message to SAP**, select the **Body** field.

   ![Complete SAP action](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-sap-body-for-response-action.png)

1. Save your logic app.

#### Create RFC request-response

> [!NOTE]
> The SAP trigger receives IDocs over tRFC, which doesn't have a response parameter by design. 

You must create a request and response pattern if you need to receive replies by using a remote function call (RFC) to Logic Apps from SAP ABAP. To receive IDocs in your logic app, you should make its first action an [HTTP request](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md#add-a-response-action) with a status code of `200 OK` and no content. This recommended step completes the SAP LUW asynchronous transfer over tRFC immediately, which leaves the SAP CPIC conversation available again. You can then add further actions in your logic app to process the received IDoc without blocking further transfers.

To implement a request and response pattern, you must first discover the RFC schema using the [`generate schema` command](#generate-schemas-for-artifacts-in-sap). The generated schema has two possible root nodes: 

1. The request node, which is the call that you receive from SAP.

1. The response node, which is your reply back to SAP.

In the following example, a request and response pattern is generated from the `STFC_CONNECTION` RFC module. The request XML is parsed to extract a node value in which SAP requests `<ECHOTEXT>`. The response inserts the current timestamp as a dynamic value. You receive a similar response when you send a `STFC_CONNECTION` RFC from a logic app to SAP.

```http

<STFC_CONNECTIONResponse xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
  <ECHOTEXT>@{first(xpath(xml(triggerBody()?['Content']), '/*[local-name()="STFC_CONNECTION"]/*[local-name()="REQUTEXT"]/text()'))}</ECHOTEXT>
  <RESPTEXT>Azure Logic Apps @{utcNow()}</RESPTEXT>


```

### Test logic app

1. If your logic app isn't already enabled, on your logic app menu, select **Overview**. On the toolbar, select **Enable**.

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run**. This step manually starts your logic app.

1. Trigger your logic app by sending an HTTP POST request to the URL in your HTTP Request trigger.
Include your message content with your request. To the send the request, you can use a tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps).

   For this article, the request sends an IDoc file, which must be in XML format and include the namespace for the SAP action you're using, for example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
   <Send xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/2/ORDERS05//720/Send">
      <idocData>
         <...>
      </idocData>
   </Send>
   ```

1. After you send your HTTP request, wait for the response from your logic app.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Your logic app might time out if all the steps 
   > required for the response don't finish within the 
   > [request timeout limit](./logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). 
   > If this condition happens, requests might get blocked. 
   > To help you diagnose problems, learn how you can 
   > [check and monitor your logic apps](../logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps.md).

You've now created a logic app that can communicate with your SAP server. Now that you've set up an SAP connection for your logic app, you can explore other available SAP actions, such as BAPI and RFC.

## Receive message from SAP

This example uses a logic app that triggers when the app receives a message from an SAP system.

### Add an SAP trigger

1. In the Azure portal, create a blank logic app, which opens the Logic Apps Designer.

1. In the search box, enter `sap` as your filter. From the **Triggers** list, select **When a message is received from SAP**.

   ![Add SAP trigger](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/add-sap-trigger-logic-app.png)

   Or, you can select the **Enterprise** tab, and then select the trigger:

   ![Add SAP trigger from Enterprise tab](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/add-sap-trigger-ent-tab.png)

1. If your connection already exists, continue with the next step so you can set up your SAP action. However, if you're prompted for connection details, provide the information so that you can create a connection to your on-premises SAP server now.

   1. Provide a name for the connection.

   1. If you're using the data gateway, follow these steps:

      1. In the **Data Gateway** section, under **Subscription**, first select the Azure subscription for the data gateway resource that you created in the Azure portal for your data gateway installation.

      1. Under **Connection Gateway**, select your data gateway resource in Azure.

   1. Continue providing information about the connection. For the **Logon Type** property, follow the step based on whether the property is set to **Application Server** or **Group**:

      * For **Application Server**, these properties, which usually appear optional, are required:

        ![Create SAP application server connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/create-SAP-application-server-connection.png)

      * For **Group**, these properties, which usually appear optional, are required:

        ![Create SAP message server connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/create-SAP-message-server-connection.png)

      By default, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. The **Safe Typing** option is available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. Learn more about the [Safe Typing option](#safe-typing).

   1. When you're finished, select **Create**.

      Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection to make sure that the connection works properly.

1. Provide the [required parameters](#parameters) based on your SAP system configuration. 

   You can [filter the messages that you receive from your SAP server by specifying a list of SAP actions](#filter-with-sap-actions).

   You can select an SAP action from the file picker:

   ![Add SAP action to logic app](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-SAP-action-trigger.png)  

   Or, you can manually specify an action:

   ![Manually enter SAP action that you want to use](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/manual-enter-SAP-action-trigger.png)

   Here's an example that shows how the action appears when you set up the trigger to receive more than one message.

   ![Trigger example that receives multiple messages](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/example-trigger.png)

   For more information about the SAP action, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations)

1. Now save your logic app so you can start receiving messages from your SAP system. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

Your logic app is now ready to receive messages from your SAP system.

> [!NOTE]
> The SAP trigger isn't a polling trigger but is a webhook-based trigger instead. 
> If you're using the data gateway, the trigger is called from the data gateway only when a message exists, so no polling is necessary.

If you receive a **500 Bad Gateway** error with a message similar to **service 'sapgw00' unknown**, replace your gateway service name in your API connection and trigger configuration with its port number. In the following example error, `sapgw00` needs to be replaced with a real port number, for example, `3300`. 

```json
{
	"body": {
		"error": {
			"code": 500,
			"source": "EXAMPLE-FLOW-NAME.eastus.environments.microsoftazurelogicapps.net",
			"clientRequestId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
			"message": "BadGateway",
			"innerError": {
				"error": {
					"code": "UnhandledException",
					"message": "\nERROR service 'sapgw00' unknown\nTIME Wed Nov 11 19:37:50 2020\nRELEASE 721\nCOMPONENT NI (network interface)\nVERSION 40\nRC -3\nMODULE ninti.c\nLINE 933\nDETAIL NiPGetServByName: 'sapgw00' not found\nSYSTEM CALL getaddrinfo\nCOUNTER 1\n\nRETURN CODE: 20"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Parameters

Along with simple string and number inputs, the SAP connector accepts the following table parameters (`Type=ITAB` inputs):

* Table direction parameters, both input and output, for older SAP releases.

* Changing parameters, which replace the table direction parameters for newer SAP releases.

You can optionally filter the messages that your logic app receives from your SAP server by providing a list, or array, with a single or multiple SAP actions. By default, this array is empty, which means that your logic app receives all the messages from your SAP server without filtering. 

When you set up the array filter, the trigger only receives messages from the specified SAP action types and rejects all other messages from your SAP server. However, this filter doesn't affect whether the typing of the received payload is weak or strong.

Any SAP action filtering happens at the level of the SAP adapter for your on-premises data gateway. For more information, see [how to send test IDocs to Logic Apps from SAP](#test-sending-idocs-from-sap).

If you can't send IDoc packets from SAP to your logic app's trigger, see the Transactional RFC (tRFC) call rejection message in the SAP tRFC dialog box (T-code SM58). In the SAP interface, you might get the following error messages, which are clipped due to the substring limits on the **Status Text** field.

##### The RequestContext on the IReplyChannel was closed without a reply being sent

This error message means unexpected failures happen when the catch-all handler for the channel terminates the channel due to an error, and rebuilds the channel to process other messages.

To acknowledge that your logic app received the IDoc, [add a Response action](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md#add-a-response-action) that returns a `200 OK` status code. Leave the body empty and don't change or add to the headers. The IDoc is transported through tRFC, which doesn't allow for a response payload.

To reject the IDoc instead, respond with any HTTP status code other than `200 OK`. The SAP Adapter then returns an exception back to SAP on your behalf. You should only reject the IDoc to signal transport errors back to SAP, such as a misrouted IDoc that your application can't process. You shouldn't reject an IDoc for application-level errors, such as issues with the data contained in the IDoc. If you delay transport acceptance for application-level validation, you might experience negative performance due to blocking your connection from transporting other IDocs.

If you're receiving this error message and experience systemic failures calling Logic Apps, check that you've configured the network settings for your on-premises data gateway service for your specific environment. For example, if your network environment requires the use of a proxy to call Azure endpoints, you need to configure your on-premises data gateway service to use your proxy. For more information, see [Proxy Configuration](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/proxy-configuration).

If you're receiving this error message and experience intermittent failures calling Logic Apps, you might need to increase your retry count and/or retry interval. 

1. Check SAP settings in your on-premises data gateway service configuration file, `Microsoft.PowerBI.EnterpriseGateway.exe.config`. The retry count setting looks like `WebhookRetryMaximumCount="2"`. The retry interval setting looks like `WebhookRetryDefaultDelay="00:00:00.10"` and the timespan format is `HH:mm:ss.ff`. 
    
1. Save your changes and restart your on-premises data gateway.

##### The segment or group definition E2EDK36001 was not found in the IDoc meta

This error message means expected failures happen with other errors. For example, the failure to generate an IDoc XML payload because its segments are not released by SAP. As a result, the segment type metadata required for conversion is missing.

To have these segments released by SAP, contact the ABAP engineer for your SAP system.
### Asynchronous request-reply for triggers

The SAP connector supports Azure's [asynchronous request-reply pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply) for Logic Apps triggers. You can use this pattern to create successful requests that would have otherwise failed with the default synchronous request-reply pattern. 

> [!TIP]
> In logic apps with multiple response actions, all response actions must use the same request-reply pattern. For example, if your logic app uses a switch control with multiple possible response actions, you must configure all the response actions to use the same request-reply pattern, either synchronous or asynchronous. 

Enabling asynchronous response for your response action allows your logic app to respond with a `202 Accepted` reply when a request has been accepted for processing. The reply contains a location header that you can use to retrieve the final state of your request.

To configure an asynchronous request-reply pattern for your logic app using the SAP connector:

1. Open your logic app in the **Logic Apps Designer**.

1. Confirm that the SAP connector is the trigger for your logic app.

1. Open your logic app's **Response** action. In the action's title bar, select the menu (**...**) &gt; **Settings**.

1. In the **Settings** for your response action, turn on the toggle under **Asynchronous Response**. Select done.

1. Save the changes to your logic app.

## Find extended error logs

For full error messages, check your SAP adapter's extended logs. You can also [enable an extended log file for the SAP connector](#extended-sap-logging-in-on-premises-data-gateway).

For on-premises data gateway releases from June 2020 and later, you can [enable gateway logs in the app settings](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-tshoot#collect-logs-from-the-on-premises-data-gateway-app). 

* The default logging level is **Warning**.

* If you enable  **Additional logging** in the **Diagnostics** settings of the on-premises data gateway app, the logging level is increased to **Informational**.

* To increase the logging level to **Verbose**, update the following setting in your configuration file. Typically, the configuration file is located at `C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway\Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config`.

```json
<setting name="SapTraceLevel" serializeAs="String">
   <value>Verbose</value>
</setting>
```

For on-premises data gateway releases from April 2020 and earlier, logs are disabled by default.

### Extended SAP logging in on-premises data gateway

If you use an [on-premises data gateway for Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md), you can configure an extended log file for the SAP connector. You can use your on-premises data gateway to redirect Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events into rotating log files that are included in your gateway's logging .zip files. 

You can [export all of your gateway's configuration and service logs](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-tshoot#collect-logs-from-the-on-premises-data-gateway-app) to a .zip file in from the gateway app's settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Extended logging might affect your logic apps' performance when always enabled. It's a best practice to turn off extended log files after you're finished with analyzing and troubleshooting an issue.

#### Capture ETW events

Optionally, advanced users can capture ETW events directly. You can then [consume your data in Azure Diagnostics in Event Hubs](../azure-monitor/agents/diagnostics-extension-stream-event-hubs.md) or [collect your data to Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/agents/diagnostics-extension-logs.md). For more information, see the [best practices for collecting and storing data](/azure/architecture/best-practices/monitoring#collecting-and-storing-data). You can use [PerfView](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/blob/master/README.md) to work with the resulting ETL files, or you can write your own program. This walkthrough uses PerfView:

1. In the PerfView menu, select **Collect** &gt; **Collect** to capture the events.

1. In the **Additional Provider** field, enter `*Microsoft-LobAdapter` to specify the SAP provider to capture SAP adapter events. If you don't specify this information, your trace only includes general ETW events.

1. Keep the other default settings. If you want, you can change the file name or location in the **Data File** field.

1. Select **Start Collection** to begin your trace.

1. After you've reproduced your issue or collected enough analysis data, select **Stop Collection**.

To share your data with another party, such as Azure support engineers, compress the ETL file.

To view the content of your trace:

1. In PerfView, select **File** &gt; **Open** and select the ETL file you just generated.

1. In the PerfView sidebar, the **Events** section under your ETL file.

1. Under **Filter**, filter by `Microsoft-LobAdapter` to only see relevant events and gateway processes.

### Test your logic app

1. To trigger your logic app, send a message from your SAP system.

1. On the logic app menu, select **Overview**. Review the **Runs history** for any new runs for your logic app.

1. Open the most recent run, which shows the message sent from your SAP system in the trigger outputs section.

### Test sending IDocs from SAP

To send IDocs from SAP to your logic app, you need the following minimum configuration:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The SAP **Program ID** is case-sensitive. Make sure you consistently use the same case format for your **Program ID** when you configure your logic app and SAP server. Otherwise, you might receive the following errors in the tRFC Monitor (T-Code SM58) when you attempt to send an IDoc to SAP:
    >
    > * **Function IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS not found**
    > * **Non-ABAP RFC client (partner type) not supported**
    >
    > For more information from SAP, see the following notes (login required) <https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2399329> and <https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/353597>.

1.  To check for processing errors, use the **sm58** transaction code (T-code) with the **/n** prefix.

## Receive IDoc packets from SAP

You can set up SAP to [send IDocs in packets](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8f3819b0c24149b5959ab31070b64058/7.4.16/4ab38886549a6d8ce10000000a42189c.html), which are batches or groups of IDocs. To receive IDoc packets, the SAP connector, and specifically the trigger, doesn't need extra configuration. However, to process each item in an IDoc packet after the trigger receives the packet, some additional steps are required to split the packet into individual IDocs.

Here's an example that shows how to extract individual IDocs from a packet by using the [`xpath()` function](./workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#xpath):

1. Before you start, you need a logic app with an SAP trigger. If you don't already have this in your logic app, follow the previous steps in this topic to [set up a logic app with an SAP trigger](#receive-message-from-sap).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The SAP **Program ID** is case-sensitive. Make sure you consistently use the same case format for your **Program ID** when you configure your logic app and SAP server. Otherwise, you might receive the following errors in the tRFC Monitor (T-Code SM58) when you attempt to send an IDoc to SAP:
    >
    > * **Function IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS not found**
    > * **Non-ABAP RFC client (partner type) not supported**
    >
    > For more information from SAP, see the following notes (login required) <https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2399329> and <https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/353597>.

   For example:

   ![Add SAP trigger to logic app](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/first-step-trigger.png)

1. [Add a response action to your logic app](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md#add-a-response-action) to reply immediately with the status of your SAP request. It's a best practice to add this action immediately after your trigger, to free up the communication channel with your SAP server. Choose one of the following status codes (`statusCode`) to use in your response action:

    * **202 Accepted**, which means the request has been accepted for processing but the processing isn't complete yet.

    * **204 No Content**, which means the server has successfully fulfilled the request and there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. 

    * **200 OK**. This status code always contains a payload, even if the server generates a payload body of zero length. 

1. Get the root namespace from the XML IDoc that your logic app receives from SAP. To extract this namespace from the XML document, add a step that creates a local string variable and stores that namespace by using an `xpath()` expression:

   `xpath(xml(triggerBody()?['Content']), 'namespace-uri(/*)')`

   ![Get root namespace from IDoc](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/get-namespace.png)

1. To extract an individual IDoc, add a step that creates an array variable and stores the IDoc collection by using another `xpath()` expression:

   `xpath(xml(triggerBody()?['Content']), '/*[local-name()="Receive"]/*[local-name()="idocData"]')`

   ![Get array of items](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/get-array.png)

   The array variable makes each IDoc available for your logic app to process individually by enumerating over the collection. In this example, the logic app transfers each IDoc to an SFTP server by using a loop:

   ![Send IDoc to SFTP server](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/loop-batch.png)

   Each IDoc must include the root namespace, which is the reason why the file content is wrapped inside a `<Receive></Receive` element along with the root namespace before sending the IDoc to the downstream app, or SFTP server in this case.

You can use the quickstart template for this pattern by selecting this template in the Logic Apps Designer when you create a new logic app.

![Select batch logic app template](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-batch-logic-app-template.png)

## Generate schemas for artifacts in SAP

This example uses a logic app that you can trigger with an HTTP request. To generate the schemas for the specified IDoc and BAPI, the SAP action **Generate schema** sends a request to an SAP system.

This SAP action returns an [XML schema](#sample-xml-schemas), not the contents or data of the XML document itself. Schemas returned in the response are uploaded to an integration account by using the Azure Resource Manager connector. Schemas contain the following parts:

* The request message's structure. Use this information to form your BAPI `get` list.

* The response message's structure. Use this information to parse the response. 

To send the request message, use the generic SAP action **Send message to SAP**, or the targeted **Call BAPI** actions.

### Sample XML schemas

If you're learning how to generate an XML schema for use in creating a sample document, see the following samples. These examples show how you can work with many types of payloads, including:

* [RFC requests](#xml-samples-for-rfc-requests)

* [BAPI requests](#xml-samples-for-bapi-requests)

* [IDoc requests](#xml-samples-for-idoc-requests)

* Simple or complex XML schema data types

* Table parameters

* Optional XML behaviors

You can begin your XML schema with an optional XML prolog. The SAP connector works with or without the XML prolog.

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8">

```

#### XML samples for RFC requests

The following example is a basic RFC call. The RFC name is `STFC_CONNECTION`. This request uses the default namespace `xmlns=`, however, you can assign and use namespace aliases such as `xmmlns:exampleAlias=`. The namespace value is the namespace for all RFCs in SAP for Microsoft services. There is a simple input parameter in the request, `<REQUTEXT>`.

```xml

<STFC_CONNECTION xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
  <REQUTEXT>exampleInput</REQUTEXT>
</STFC_CONNECTION>

```

The following example is an RFC call with a table parameter. This example call and its group of test RFCs are available as part of all SAP systems. The table parameter's name is `TCPICDAT`. The table line type is `ABAPTEXT`, and this element repeats for each row in the table. This example contains a single line, called `LINE`. Requests with a table parameter can contain any number of fields, where the number is a positive integer (*n*). 

```xml

<STFC_WRITE_TO_TCPIC xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
  <RESTART_QNAME>exampleQName</RESTART_QNAME>
    <TCPICDAT>
      <ABAPTEXT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
        <LINE>exampleFieldInput1</LINE>
      <ABAPTEXT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
        <LINE>exampleFieldInput2</LINE>
      <ABAPTEXT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
        <LINE>exampleFieldInput3</LINE>
      </ABAPTEXT>
    </TCPICDAT>
</STFC_WRITE_TO_TCPIC>

```

The following example is an RFC call with a table parameter that has an anonymous field. An anonymous field is when the field has no name assigned. Complex types are declared under a separate namespace, in which the declaration sets a new default for the current node and all its child elements. The example uses the hex code`x002F` as an escape character for the symbol */*, because this symbol is reserved in the SAP field name.

```xml

<RFC_XML_TEST_1 xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
  <IM_XML_TABLE>
    <RFC_XMLCNT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
      <_x002F_AnonymousField>exampleFieldInput</_x002F_AnonymousField>
    </RFC_XMLCNT>
  </IM_XML_TABLE>
</RFC_XML_TEST_1>

```

The following example includes prefixes for the namespaces. You can declare all prefixes at once, or you can declare any number of prefixes as attributes of a node. The RFC namespace alias `ns0` is used as the root and parameters for the basic type.

> [!NOTE]
> complex types are declared under a different namespace for RFC types with the alias `ns3` instead of the regular RFC namespace with the alias `ns0`.

```xml

<ns0:BBP_RFC_READ_TABLE xmlns:ns0="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/" xmlns:ns3="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc/">
  <ns0:DELIMITER>0</ns0:DELIMITER>
  <ns0:QUERY_TABLE>KNA1</ns0:QUERY_TABLE>
  <ns0:ROWCOUNT>250</ns0:ROWCOUNT>
  <ns0:ROWSKIPS>0</ns0:ROWSKIPS>
  <ns0:FIELDS>
    <ns3:RFC_DB_FLD>
      <ns3:FIELDNAME>KUNNR</ns3:FIELDNAME>
    </ns3:RFC_DB_FLD>
  </ns0:FIELDS>
</ns0:BBP_RFC_READ_TABLE>

```

#### XML samples for BAPI requests

The following XML samples are example requests to [call the BAPI method](#call-bapi-action).

> [!NOTE]
> SAP makes business objects available to external systems by describing them in response to RFC `RPY_BOR_TREE_INIT`, which Logic Apps issues with no input filter. Logic Apps inspects the output table `BOR_TREE`. The `SHORT_TEXT` field is used for names of business objects. Business objects not returned by SAP in the output table aren't accessible to Logic Apps.
> 
> If you use custom business objects, you must make sure to publish and release these business objects in SAP. Otherwise, SAP doesn't list your custom business objects in the output table `BOR_TREE`. You can't access your custom business objects in Logic Apps until you expose the business objects from SAP. 

The following example gets a list of banks using the BAPI method `GETLIST`. This sample contains the business object for a bank, `BUS1011`. 

```xml

<GETLIST xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Bapi/BUS1011">
  <BANK_CTRY>US</BANK_CTRY>
  <MAX_ROWS>10</MAX_ROWS>
</GETLIST>

```

The following example creates a bank object using the `CREATE` method. This example uses the same business object as the previous example, `BUS1011`. When you use the `CREATE` method to create a bank, be sure to commit your changes because this method isn't committed by default.

> [!TIP]
> Be sure that your XML document follows any validation rules configured in your SAP system. For example, in this sample document, the bank key (`<BANK_KEY>`) needs to be a bank routing number, also known as an ABA number, in the USA.

```xml

<CREATE xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Bapi/BUS1011">
  <BANK_ADDRESS>
    <BANK_NAME xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">ExampleBankName</BANK_NAME>
    <REGION xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">ExampleRegionName</REGION>
    <STREET xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">ExampleStreetAddress</STREET>
    <CITY xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">Redmond</CITY>
  </BANK_ADDRESS>
  <BANK_COUNTRY>US</BANK_COUNTRY>
  <BANK_KEY>123456789</BANK_KEY>
</CREATE>

```

The following example gets details for a bank using the bank routing number, the value for`<BANK_KEY>`. 

```xml

<GETDETAIL xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Bapi/BUS1011">
  <BANK_COUNTRY>US</BANK_COUNTRY>
  <BANK_KEY>123456789</BANK_KEY>
</GETDETAIL>

```

#### XML samples for IDoc requests

To generate a plain SAP IDoc XML schema, use the **SAP Logon** application and the T-code `WE-60`. Access the SAP documentation through the GUI and generate XML schemas in XSD format for your IDoc types and extensions. For an explanation of generic SAP formats and payloads, and their built-in dialogs, see the [SAP documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/index).

This example declares the root node and namespaces. The URI in the sample code, `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//700/Send`, declares the following configuration:

* `/IDoc` is the root note for all IDocs
* `/3` is the record types version for common segment definitions
* `/ORDERS05` is the IDoc type
* `//` is an empty segment, because there's no IDoc extension
* `/700` is the SAP version
* `/Send` is the action to send the information to SAP

```xml

<ns0:Send xmlns:ns0="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//700/Send" xmlns:ns3="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization" xmlns:ns1="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Idoc/Common/" xmlns:ns2="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//700">
  <ns0:idocData>

```

You can repeat the `idocData` node to send a batch of IDocs in a single call. In the example below, there is one control record, `EDI_DC40`, and multiple data records.

```xml

<...>
  <ns0:idocData>
    <ns2:EDI_DC40>
      <ns1:TABNAM>EDI_DC40</ns1:TABNAM>
<...>
      <ns1:ARCKEY>Cor1908207-5</ns1:ARCKEY>
    </ns2:EDI_DC40>
    <ns2:E2EDK01005>
      <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E23DK01005</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
      <ns2:CURCY>USD</ns2:CURCY>
    </ns2:E2EDK01005>
    <ns2:E2EDK03>
<...>
  </ns0:idocData>

```

The following example is a sample IDoc control record, which uses the prefix `EDI_DC`. You must update the values to match your SAP installation and IDoc type. For example, your IDoc client code may not be `800`. Contact your SAP team to make sure you're using the correct values for your SAP installation.

```xml

The following example is a sample data record with plain segments. This example uses the SAP date format. Strong-typed documents can use native XML date formats, such as `2020-12-31 23:59:59`.

```xml

<ns2:E2EDK01005>
  <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDK01005</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
    <ns2:CURCY>USD</ns2:CURCY>
    <ns2:BSART>OR</ns2:BSART>
    <ns2:BELNR>1908207-5</ns2:BELNR>
    <ns2:ABLAD>CC</ns2:ABLAD>
  </ns2>
  <ns2:E2EDK03>
    <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDK03</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
      <ns2:IDDAT>002</ns2:IDDAT>
      <ns2:DATUM>20160611</ns2:DATUM>
  </ns2:E2EDK03>

```

The following example is a data record with grouped segments. The record includes a group parent node, `E2EDKT1002GRP`, and multiple child nodes, including `E2EDKT1002` and `E2EDKT2001`. 

```xml

<ns2:E2EDKT1002GRP>
  <ns2:E2EDKT1002>
    <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDKT1002</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
      <ns2:TDID>ZONE</ns2:TDID>
  </ns2:E2EDKT1002>
  <ns2:E2EDKT2001>
    <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDKT2001</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
      <ns2:TDLINE>CRSD</ns2:TDLINE>
  </ns2:E2EDKT2001>
</ns2:E2EDKT1002GRP>

```


The recommended method is to create an IDoc identifier for use with tRFC. You can set this transaction identifier, `tid`, using the [Send IDoc operation](/connectors/sap/#send-idoc) in the SAP connector API.

The following example is an alternative method to set the transaction identifier, or `tid`. In this example, the last data record segment node and the IDoc data node are closed. Then, the GUID, `guid`, is used as the tRFC identifier to detect duplicates. 

```xml

    </E2STZUM002GRP>
  </idocData>
  <guid>8820ea40-5825-4b2f-ac3c-b83adc34321c</guid>
</Send>

```

### Add an HTTP Request trigger

1. In the Azure portal, create a blank logic app, which opens the Logic Apps Designer.

1. In the search box, enter `http request` as your filter. From the **Triggers** list, select **When a HTTP request is received**.

   ![Add HTTP Request trigger](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/add-http-trigger-logic-app.png)

1. Now save your logic app so you can generate an endpoint URL for your logic app.
On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   The endpoint URL now appears in your trigger, for example:

   ![Generate URL for endpoint](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/generate-http-endpoint-url.png)

### Add an SAP action to generate schemas

1. In the Logic Apps Designer, under the trigger, select **New step**.

   ![Add new step to logic app](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/add-sap-action-logic-app.png)

1. In the search box, enter `sap` as your filter. From the **Actions** list, select **Generate schemas**.
  
   ![Add "Generate schemas" action to logic app](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-sap-schema-generator-action.png)

   Or, you can select the **Enterprise** tab, and select the SAP action.

   ![Select SAP send action from Enterprise tab](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-sap-schema-generator-ent-tab.png)

1. If your connection already exists, continue with the next step so you can set up your SAP action. However, if you're prompted for connection details, provide the information so that you can create a connection to your on-premises SAP server now.

   1. Provide a name for the connection.

   1. In the **Data Gateway** section, under **Subscription**, first select the Azure subscription for the data gateway resource that you created in the Azure portal for your data gateway installation. 
   
   1. Under **Connection Gateway**, select your data gateway resource in Azure.

   1. Continue providing information about the connection. For the **Logon Type** property, follow the step based on whether the property is set to **Application Server** or **Group**:
   
      * For **Application Server**, these properties, which usually appear optional, are required:

        ![Create SAP application server connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/create-SAP-application-server-connection.png)

      * For **Group**, these properties, which usually appear optional, are required:

        ![Create SAP message server connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/create-SAP-message-server-connection.png)  

      By default, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. The **Safe Typing** option is available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. Learn more about the [Safe Typing option](#safe-typing).

   1. When you're finished, select **Create**.

      Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection to make sure that the connection works properly.

1. Provide the path to the artifact for which you want to generate the schema.

   You can select the SAP action from the file picker:

   ![Select SAP action](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-SAP-action-schema-generator.png)  

   Or, you can manually enter the action:

   ![Manually enter SAP action](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/manual-enter-SAP-action-schema-generator.png)

   To generate schemas for more than one artifact, provide the SAP action details for each artifact, for example:

   ![Select Add new item](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/schema-generator-array-pick.png)

   ![Show two items](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/schema-generator-example.png)

   For more information about the SAP action, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations).

1. Save your logic app. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### Test your logic app

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run** to trigger a run for your logic app.

1. Open the run, and check the outputs for the **Generate schemas** action.

   The outputs show the generated schemas for the specified list of messages.

### Upload schemas to an integration account

Optionally, you can download or store the generated schemas in repositories, such as a blob, storage, or integration account. Integration accounts provide a first-class experience with other XML actions, so this example shows how to upload schemas to an integration account for the same logic app by using the Azure Resource Manager connector.

1. In the Logic Apps Designer, under the trigger, select **New step**.

1. In the search box, enter `Resource Manager` as your filter. Select **Create or update a resource**.

   ![Select Azure Resource Manager action](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/select-azure-resource-manager-action.png)

1. Enter the details for the action, including your Azure subscription, Azure resource group, and integration account. To add SAP tokens to the fields, click inside the boxes for those fields, and select from the dynamic content list that appears.

   1. Open the **Add new parameter** list, and select the **Location** and **Properties** fields.

   1. Provide details for these new fields as shown in this example.

      ![Enter details for Azure Resource Manager action](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/azure-resource-manager-action.png)

   The SAP **Generate schemas** action generates schemas as a collection, so the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop to the action. Here's an example that shows how this action appears:

   ![Azure Resource Manager action with "for each" loop](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/azure-resource-manager-action-foreach.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The schemas use base64-encoded format. 
   > To upload the schemas to an integration account, 
   > they must be decoded by using the `base64ToString()` function. 
   > Here's an example that shows the code for the `"properties"` element:
   >
   > ```json
   > "properties": {
   >    "Content": "@base64ToString(items('For_each')?['Content'])",
   >    "ContentType": "application/xml",
   >    "SchemaType": "Xml"
   > }
   > ```

1. Save your logic app. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### Test your logic app

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run** to manually trigger your logic app.

1. After a successful run, go to the integration account, and check that the generated schemas exist.

## Enable Secure Network Communications

Before you start, make sure that you met the previously listed [prerequisites](#prerequisites), which apply only when you use the data gateway and your logic apps run in multi-tenant Azure:

* Make sure the on-premises data gateway is installed on a computer that's in the same network as your SAP system.

* For SSO, the data gateway is running as a user that's mapped to an SAP user.

* The SNC library that provides the additional security functions is installed on the same machine as the data gateway. Some examples include [sapseculib](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw74/helpdata/en/7a/0755dc6ef84f76890a77ad6eb13b13/frameset.htm), Kerberos, and NTLM.

   To enable SNC for your requests to or from the SAP system, select the **Use SNC** check box in the SAP connection and provide these properties:

   ![Configure SAP SNC in connection](media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/configure-sapsnc.png)

   | Property | Description |
   |----------| ------------|
   | **SNC Library Path** | The SNC library name or path relative to NCo installation location or absolute path. Examples are `sapsnc.dll` or `.\security\sapsnc.dll` or `c:\security\sapsnc.dll`. |
   | **SNC SSO** | When you connect through SNC, the SNC identity is typically used for authenticating the caller. Another option is to override so that user and password information can be used for authenticating the caller, but the line is still encrypted. |
   | **SNC My Name** | In most cases, this property can be omitted. The installed SNC solution usually knows its own SNC name. Only for solutions that support multiple identities, you might need to specify the identity to be used for this particular destination or server. |
   | **SNC Partner Name** | The name for the back-end SNC. |
   | **SNC Quality of Protection** | The quality of service to be used for SNC communication of this particular destination or server. The default value is defined by the back-end system. The maximum value is defined by the security product used for SNC. |
   |||

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't set the environment variables SNC_LIB and SNC_LIB_64 on the machine where you have the data gateway and the SNC library. If set, they take precedence over the SNC library value passed through the connector.

## Safe typing

By default, when you create your SAP connection, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. The **Safe Typing** option is available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. If you choose **Safe Typing**, the DATS type and TIMS type in SAP are treated as strings rather than as their XML equivalents, `xs:date` and `xs:time`, where `xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"`. Safe typing affects the behavior for all schema generation, the send message for both the "been sent" payload and the "been received" response, and the trigger. 

When strong typing is used (**Safe Typing** isn't enabled), the schema maps the DATS and TIMS types to more straightforward XML types:

```xml
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDDAT" nillable="true" type="xs:date"/>
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDTIM" nillable="true" type="xs:time"/>
```

When you send messages using strong typing, the DATS and TIMS response complies to the matching XML type format:

```xml
<DATE>9999-12-31</DATE>
<TIME>23:59:59</TIME>
```

When **Safe Typing** is enabled, the schema maps the DATS and TIMS types to XML string fields with length restrictions only, for example:

```xml
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDDAT" nillable="true">
  <xs:simpleType>
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
      <xs:maxLength value="8" />
    </xs:restriction>
  </xs:simpleType>
</xs:element>
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDTIM" nillable="true">
  <xs:simpleType>
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
      <xs:maxLength value="6" />
    </xs:restriction>
  </xs:simpleType>
</xs:element>
```

When messages are sent with **Safe Typing** enabled, the DATS and TIMS response looks like this example:

```xml
<DATE>99991231</DATE>
<TIME>235959</TIME>
```

## Advanced scenarios

### Change language headers

When you connect to SAP from Logic Apps, the default language for the connection is English. You can set the language for your connection by using [the standard HTTP header `Accept-Language`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4) with your inbound requests.

> [!TIP]
> Most web browsers add an `Accept-Language` header based on the user's settings. The web browser applies this header when you create a new SAP connection in the Logic Apps designer. If you don't want to create SAP connections in your web browser's preferred language, either update your web browser's settings to use your preferred language, or create your SAP connection using Azure Resource Manager instead of the Logic Apps designer. 

For example, you can send a request with the `Accept-Language` header to your logic app by using the **HTTP Request** trigger. All the actions in your logic app receive the header. Then, SAP uses the specified languages in its system messages, such as BAPI error messages.

The SAP connection parameters for a logic app don't have a language property. So, if you use the `Accept-Language` header, you might get the following error: **Please check your account info and/or permissions and try again.** In this case, check the SAP component's error logs instead. The error actually happens in the SAP component that uses the header, so you might get one of these error messages:

* `"SAP.Middleware.Connector.RfcLogonException: Select one of the installed languages"`
* `"SAP.Middleware.Connector.RfcAbapMessageException: Select one of the installed languages"`

### Confirm transaction explicitly

When you send transactions to SAP from Logic Apps, this exchange happens in two steps as described in the SAP document, [Transactional RFC Server Programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nwpi71/7.1/22/042ad7488911d189490000e829fbbd/content.htm?no_cache=true). By default, the **Send to SAP** action handles both the steps for the function transfer and for the transaction confirmation in a single call. The SAP connector gives you the option to decouple these steps. You can send an IDoc and rather than automatically confirm the transaction, you can use the explicit **Confirm transaction ID** action.

This capability to decouple the transaction ID confirmation is useful when you don't want to duplicate transactions in SAP, for example, in scenarios where failures might happen due to causes such as network issues. By confirming the transaction ID separately, the transaction is only completed one time in your SAP system.

Here is an example that shows this pattern:

1. Create a blank logic app and add an HTTP trigger.

1. From the SAP connector, add the **Send IDOC** action. Provide the details for the IDoc that you send to your SAP system.

1. To explicitly confirm the transaction ID in a separate step, in the **Confirm TID** field, select **No**. For the optional **Transaction ID GUID** field, you can either manually specify the value or have the connector automatically generate and return this GUID in the response from the Send IDOC action.

   ![Send IDOC action properties](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/send-idoc-action-details.png)

1. To explicitly confirm the transaction ID, add the **Confirm transaction ID** action, making sure to [avoid sending duplicate IDocs to SAP](#avoid-sending-duplicate-idocs). Click inside the **Transaction ID** box so that the dynamic content list appears. From that list, select the **Transaction ID** value that's returned from the **Send IDOC** action.

   ![Confirm transaction ID action](./media/logic-apps-using-sap-connector/explicit-transaction-id.png)

   After this step runs, the current transaction is marked complete at both ends, on the SAP connector side and on SAP system side.

#### Avoid sending duplicate IDocs

If you experience an issue with duplicate IDocs being sent to SAP from your logic app, follow these steps to create a string variable to serve as your IDoc transaction identifier. Creating this transaction identifier helps prevent duplicate network transmissions when there are issues such as temporary outages, network issues, or lost acknowledgments.

> [!NOTE]
> SAP systems forget a transaction identifier after a specified time, or 24 hours by default. As a result, SAP never fails to confirm a transaction identifier if the ID or GUID is unknown.
> If confirmation for a transaction identifier fails, this failure indicates that communcation with the SAP system failed before SAP was able to acknowledge the confirmation.

1. In the Logic Apps designer, add the action **Initialize variable** to your logic app. 

1. In the editor for the action **Initialize variable**, configure the following settings. Then, save your changes.

    1. For **Name**, enter a name for your variable. For example, `IDOCtransferID`.

    1. For **Type**, select **String** as the variable type.

    1. For **Value**, select the text box **Enter initial value** to open the dynamic content menu. Select the **Expressions** tab. In the list of functions, enter the function `guid()`. Then, select **OK** to save your changes. The **Value** field is now set to the `guid()` function, which generates a GUID.

1. After the **Initialize variable** action, add the action **Send IDOC**.

1. In the editor for the action **Send IDOC**, configure the following settings. Then, save your changes.

    1. For **IDOC type** select your message type, and for **Input IDOC message**, specify your message.

    1. For **SAP release version**, select your SAP configuration's values.

    1. For **Record types version**, select your SAP configuration's values.

    1. For **Confirm TID**, select **No**.

    1. Select **Add new parameter list** > **Transaction ID GUID**. Select the text box to open the dynamic content menu. Under the **Variables** tab, select the name of the variable that you created. For example, `IDOCtransferID`.

1. On the title bar of the action **Send IDOC**, select **...** > **Settings**. For **Retry Policy**, it's recommended to select **Default** &gt; **Done**. However, you can instead configure a custom policy for your specific needs. For custom policies, it's recommended to configure at least one retry to overcome temporary network outages.

1. After the action **Send IDOC**, add the action **Confirm transaction ID**.

1. In the editor for the action **Confirm transaction ID**, configure the following settings. Then, save your changes.

    1. For **Transaction ID**, enter the name of your variable again. For example, `IDOCtransferID`.

1. Optionally, validate the deduplication in your test environment. Repeat the **Send IDOC** action with the same **Transaction ID** GUID that you used in the previous step. When you send the same IDoc twice, you can validate that SAP is able to identify the duplication of the tRFC call and resolve the two calls to a single inbound IDoc message.

## Known issues and limitations

Here are the currently known issues and limitations for the managed (non-ISE) SAP connector: 

* In general, the SAP trigger doesn't support data gateway clusters. In some failover cases, the data gateway node that communicates with the SAP system might differ from the active node, which results in unexpected behavior.

  * For send scenarios, data gateway clusters in failover mode are supported. 

  * Data gateway clusters in load balancing mode aren't supported by stateful SAP actions. These actions include **Create stateful session**, **Commit BAPI transaction**, **Rollback BAPI transaction**, **Close stateful session**, and all actions that specify a **Session ID** value. Stateful communications must remain on the same data gateway cluster node. 

  * For stateful SAP actions, use the data gateway either in non-cluster mode or in a cluster that's set up for failover only.

* The SAP connector currently doesn't support SAP router strings. The on-premises data gateway must exist on the same LAN as the SAP system you want to connect.

## Connector reference

For more technical details about this connector, such as triggers, actions, and limits as described by the connector's Swagger file, see the [connector's reference page](/connectors/sap/). Additional documentation for Logic Apps is provided for the following actions:

* [Call BAPI](#call-bapi-action)

* [Send IDOC](#send-idoc-action)

> [!NOTE]
> For logic apps in an [integration service environment (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md), 
> this connector's ISE-labeled version uses the [ISE message limits](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#message-size-limits) instead.

### Call BAPI action

The [Call BAPI (`CallBapi`)](
https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/sap/#call-bapi-(preview)) action calls the BAPI method on your SAP server. 

You must use the following parameters with your call: 

* **Business Object** (`businessObject`), which is a searchable drop-down menu.

* **Method** (`method`), which populates the available methods after you've selected a **Business Object**. The available methods vary depending on the selected **Business Object**.

* **Input BAPI parameters** (`body`), in which you call the XML document that contains the BAPI method input parameter values for the call, or the URI of the storage blob that contains your BAPI parameters.

For detailed examples of how to use the Call BAPI action, see the [XML samples of BAPI requests](#xml-samples-for-bapi-requests).

> [!TIP]
> If you're using the Logic Apps designer to edit your BAPI request, you can use the following search functions: 
> 
> * Select an object in the designer to see a drop-down menu of available methods.
> * Filter business object types by keyword using the searchable list provided by the BAPI API call.

### Send IDoc action

The [Send IDoc (`SendIDoc`)](/connectors/sap/) action sends the IDoc message to your SAP server.

You must use the following parameters with your call: 

* **IDOC type with optional extension** (`idocType`), which is a searchable drop-down menu.

    * The optional parameter **SAP release version** (`releaseVersion`) populates values after you select the IDoc type, and depends on the selected IDoc type.

* **Input IDOC message** (`body`), in which you call the XML document containing the IDoc payload, or the URI of the storage blob that contains your IDoc XML document. This document must comply with either the SAP IDOC XML schema according to the WE60 IDoc Documentation, or the generated schema for the matching SAP IDoc action URI.

For detailed examples of how to use the Send IDoc action, see the [walkthrough for sending IDoc messages to your SAP server](#send-idoc-messages-to-sap-server).

For how to use optional parameter **Confirm TID** (`confirmTid`), see the [walkthrough for confirming the transaction explicitly](#confirm-transaction-explicitly).
