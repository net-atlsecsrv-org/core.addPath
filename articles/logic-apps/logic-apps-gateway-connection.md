# Connect to on-premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps

To access data sources on premises from your logic apps, create an on-premises data gateway resource in the Azure portal. Your logic apps can then use the [on-premises connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md#on-premises-connectors). Azure Logic Apps supports write operations, including inserts and updates, through the gateway. However, these operations have [limits on their payload size](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem#considerations).

This article shows how to create your Azure gateway resource *after* you [download and install the gateway on a local computer](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md). For more information about the gateway, see [How the gateway works](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md#gateway-cloud-service). 

> [!TIP]
> To connect to Azure virtual networks, consider creating an 
> [*integration service environment*](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) instead. 

For information about how to use the gateway with other services, see these articles:

* [Microsoft Power BI on-premises data gateway](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-gateway-onprem/)
* [Microsoft Flow on-premises data gateway](https://flow.microsoft.com/documentation/gateway-manage/)
* [Microsoft PowerApps on-premises data gateway](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/gateway-management/)
* [Azure Analysis Services on-premises data gateway](../analysis-services/analysis-services-gateway.md)

## Supported data sources

For Azure Logic Apps, the on-premises data gateway supports [on-premises connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md#on-premises-connectors) for these data sources:

* BizTalk Server 2016
* File System
* IBM DB2  
* IBM Informix
* IBM MQ
* MySQL
* Oracle Database
* PostgreSQL
* SAP
* SharePoint Server
* SQL Server
* Teradata

Although the gateway itself doesn't incur additional costs, the [Logic Apps pricing model](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md) applies to these connectors and other operations in Azure Logic Apps.

## Prerequisites

* You've already [installed the on-premises data gateway on a local computer](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md).

* You have the [same Azure account and Azure subscription](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md#requirements) that you used when you installed the on-premises data gateway.

* You haven't previously linked your gateway installation to another gateway resource in Azure.

  When you create a gateway resource, you select a gateway installation to associate with your gateway resource. An already linked gateway installation isn't available for you to select when creating gateway resources.

## Create Azure gateway resource

After you install the gateway on a local computer, create the Azure resource for your gateway. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with the same Azure account that was used to install the gateway.

1. In the Azure portal search box, enter "on-premises data gateway", and select **On-premises Data Gateways**.

   ![Find "On-premises data gateway"](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/find-on-premises-data-gateway.png)

1. Under **On-premises Data Gateways**, select **Add**.

   ![Add data gateway](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/add-gateway.png)

1. Under **Create connection gateway**, provide this information for your gateway resource. When you're done, select **Create**.

   | Property | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | **Resource Name** | Your gateway resource name, which can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), parentheses (`(`, `)`), and periods (`.`). |
   | **Subscription** | Your Azure subscription, which must be the same as gateway installation and logic app. The default subscription is based on the Azure account that you used to sign in. |
   | **Resource group** | The [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md) that you want to use |
   | **Location** | The same region as the location that was selected for the gateway cloud service during [gateway installation](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md). Otherwise, your gateway installation won't appear in the **Installation Name** list for you to select. Your logic app location can differ from your gateway resource location. |
   | **Installation Name** | If your gateway installation isn't already selected, select the gateway that you previously installed. Previously linked gateway installations won't appear in this list for you to select. |

## Connect to on-premises data

After you create your gateway resource and associate your Azure subscription with this resource, you can now create a connection between your logic app and your on-premises data source by using the gateway.

1. In the Azure portal, create or open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. Add a connector that supports on-premises connections, for example, **SQL Server**.

1. Select **Connect via on-premises data gateway**. 

1. For **Gateways**, select the gateway resource that you created.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The gateways list includes gateway resources in other regions because your 
   > logic app's location can differ from your gateway resource's location.

1. Provide a unique connection name and other required information, which depends on the connection that you want to create.

   A unique connection name helps you easily find that connection later, especially if you create multiple connections. If applicable, also include the qualified domain for your username.
   
   Here is an example:

   ![Create connection between logic app and data gateway](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/logic-app-gateway-connection.png)

1. When you're done, select **Create**. 

Your gateway connection is now ready for your logic app to use.

## Edit connection

To update the settings for a gateway connection, you can edit your connection.

1. To find all API connections for just your logic app, on your logic app's menu, under **Development Tools**, select **API connections**.
   
   ![On your logic app menu, select "API Connections"](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/logic-app-find-api-connections.png)

1. Select the gateway connection you want, and then select **Edit API connection**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If your updates don't take effect, 
   > try [stopping and restarting the gateway Windows service account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md#restart-gateway) for your gateway installation.

To find all API connections associated with your Azure subscription: 

* From the main Azure menu, go to **All services** > **Web** > **API Connections**.
* Or, from the main Azure menu, go to **All resources**. Set the **Type** filter to **API Connection**.

## Delete gateway resource

To create a different gateway resource, link your gateway installation to a different gateway resource, or remove the gateway resource, you can delete the gateway resource without affecting the gateway installation. 

1. From the main Azure menu, select **All resources**. Find and select your gateway resource.

1. If not already selected, on your gateway resource menu, select **On-premises Data Gateway**. On the gateway resource toolbar, select **Delete**.

   For example:

   ![Delete gateway](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/gateway-delete.png)

## Frequently asked questions

**Q**: Why don't I see my gateway installation when I create the gateway resource in Azure? <br/>
**A**: This issue can happen for these reasons:

* Your gateway installation is already registered and claimed by another gateway resource in Azure. Gateway installations don't appear in the instances list after gateway resources are created for them. To check your gateway registrations in the Azure portal, review all your Azure resources with the **On-premises Data Gateways** type for *all* Azure subscriptions.

* The Azure AD identity for the person who installed the gateway differs from the person who signed in to the Azure portal. Check that you're signed in with the same identity that installed the gateway.
