# Call logic apps from Power Automate and Power Apps

To call your logic apps from Microsoft Power Automate and Microsoft Power Apps, you can export your logic apps as connectors. When you expose a logic app as a custom connector in a Power Automate or Power Apps environment, you can then call your logic app from flows there.

If you want to migrate your flow from Power Automate or Power to Logic Apps instead, see [Export flows from Power Automate and deploy to Azure Logic Apps](export-from-microsoft-flow-logic-app-template.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Power Automate connectors are available in Azure Logic Apps. You can migrate only Power Automate flows 
> that have the equivalent connectors in Azure Logic Apps. For example, the Button trigger, the Approval connector, 
> and Notification connector are specific to Power Automate. Currently, OpenAPI-based flows in Power Automate aren't 
> supported for export and deployment as logic app templates.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* A Power Automate or Power Apps license.

* A logic app with a request trigger to export.

* A flow in Power Automate or Power Apps from which you want to call your logic app.

## Export your logic app as a custom connector

Before you can call your logic app from Power Automate or Power Apps, you must first export your logic app as a custom connector.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal search box, enter `Logic Apps`. In the results, under **Services**, select **Logic Apps**.

1. Select the logic app that you want to export.

1. From your logic app's menu, select **Export**.

1. On the **Export** pane, for **Name**, enter a name for the custom connector to your logic app. From the **Environment** list, select the Power Automate or Power Apps environment from which you want to call your logic app. When you're done, select **OK**.

1. To confirm that your logic app was successfully exported, check the notifications pane.

### Exporting errors

Here are errors that might happen when you export your logic app as a custom connector and their suggested solutions:

* **Failed to get environments. Make sure your account is configured for Power Automate, then try again.**: Check that your Azure account has a Power Automate plan.

* **The current Logic App cannot be exported. To export, select a Logic App that has a request trigger.**: Check that your logic app begins with a [request trigger](./logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#request-trigger).

## Connect to your logic app from Power Automate

To connect to the logic app that you exported with your Power Automate flow:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).

1. From the **Power Automate** home page menu, select **My flows**.

1. On the **Flows** page, select the flow that you want to connect to your logic app.

1. From your flow page's menu, select **Edit**.

1. In the flow editor, select **&#43; New step**.

1. Under **Choose an action**, in the search box, enter the name of your logic app connector. Optionally, to show only the custom connectors in your environment, filter the results by selecting the **Custom** tab.
