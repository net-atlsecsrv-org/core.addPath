# Custom connectors in Logic Apps

Without writing any code, you can build workflows and apps with 
[Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps), 
[Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com), 
and [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com). 
To help you integrate apps, data, and business processes, 
these services offer [~200 connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/) - 
for Microsoft services and products, as well as other services, 
like GitHub, Salesforce, Twitter, and more.

Sometimes though, you might want to call APIs, services, and systems that aren't available as prebuilt connectors. 
To support more tailored scenarios, you can build *custom connectors* with their own triggers and actions. 
The Connectors documentation site has complete basic and advanced tutorials about custom connectors. 
You can start with the [custom connector overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/), 
but you can also go directly to these topics for details about a specific area:
