# Quickstart: Create and manage logic apps using the Azure CLI

This quickstart shows you how to create and manage logic apps by using the [Azure CLI Logic Apps extension](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic?view=azure-cli-latest) (`az logic`). From the command line, you can create a logic app by using the JSON file for a logic app workflow definition. You can then manage your logic app by running operations such as `list`, `show` (`get`), `update`, and `delete` from the command line.

> [!WARNING]
> The Azure CLI Logic Apps extension is currently *experimental* and *not covered by customer support*. Use this CLI extension with caution, especially if you choose to use the extension in production environments.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed on your local computer.
* The [Logic Apps Azure CLI extension](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-list?view=azure-cli-latest) installed on your computer. To install this extension, use this command: `az extension add --name logic`
* An [Azure resource group](#example---create-resource-group) in which to create your logic app.

### Prerequisite check

Validate your environment before you begin:

* Sign in to the Azure portal and check that your subscription is active by running `az login`.
* Check your version of the Azure CLI in a terminal or command window by running `az --version`. For the latest version, see the [latest release notes](/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli?tabs=azure-cli&view=azure-cli-latest).
  * If you don't have the latest version, update your installation by following the [installation guide for your operating system or platform](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

### Example - create resource group

If you don't already have a resource group for your logic app, create the group with the command `az group create`. For example, the following command creates a resource group named `testResourceGroup` in the location `westus`.

```azurecli-interactive

az group create --name testResourceGroup --location westus

```

The output shows the `provisioningState` as `Succeeded` when your resource group is successfully created:

```output

<...>
  "name": "testResourceGroup",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
<...>

```

## Workflow definition

Before you [create a new logic app](#create-logic-apps-from-cli) or [update an existing logic app](#update-logic-apps-from-cli) by using the Azure CLI, you need a workflow definition for your logic app. In the Azure portal, you can view your logic app's underlying workflow definition in JSON format by switching from **Designer** view to **Code view**.

When you run the commands to create or update your logic app, your workflow definition is uploaded as a required parameter (`--definition`). You must create your workflow definition as a JSON file that follows the [Workflow Definition Language schema](./logic-apps-workflow-definition-language.md).

## Create logic apps from CLI

You can create a logic app workflow from the Azure CLI using the command [`az logic workflow create`](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-create) with a JSON file for the definition.

```azurecli

az logic workflow create --definition
                         --location
                         --name
                         --resource-group
                         [--access-control]
                         [--endpoints-configuration]
                         [--integration-account]
                         [--integration-service-environment]
                         [--state {Completed, Deleted, Disabled, Enabled, NotSpecified, Suspended}]
                         [--tags]

```

Your command must include the following [required parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-create-required-parameters):

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Workflow definition | `--definition` | A JSON file with your logic app's [workflow definition](#workflow-definition). |
| Location | `--location -l` | The Azure region in which your logic app is located. |
| Name | `--name -n` | The name of your logic app. The name can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), parentheses (`()`), and periods (`.`). The name must also be unique across regions. |
| Resource group name | `--resource-group -g` | The [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) in which you want to create your logic app. [Create a resource group](#example---create-resource-group) before you begin if you don't already have one for your logic app. |

You can also include additional [optional parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-create-optional-parameters) to configure your logic app's access controls, endpoints, integration account, integration service environment, state, and resource tags.

### Example - create logic app

In this example, a workflow named `testLogicApp` is created in the resource group `testResourceGroup` in the location `westus`. The JSON file `testDefinition.json` contains the workflow definition.

```azurecli-interactive

az logic workflow create --resource-group "testResourceGroup" --location "westus" --name "testLogicApp" --definition "testDefinition.json"

```

When your workflow is successfully created, the CLI shows your new workflow definition's JSON code. If your workflow creation fails, see the [list of possible errors](#errors).

## Update logic apps from CLI

You can also update a logic app's workflow from the Azure CLI using the command [`az logic workflow create`](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-create).

Your command must include the same [required parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-create-required-parameters) as when you [create a logic app](#create-logic-apps-from-cli). You can also add the same [optional parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-create-optional-parameters) as when creating a logic app.

```azurecli

az logic workflow create --definition
                         --location
                         --name
                         --resource-group
                         [--access-control]
                         [--endpoints-configuration]
                         [--integration-account]
                         [--integration-service-environment]
                         [--state {Completed, Deleted, Disabled, Enabled, NotSpecified, Suspended}]
                         [--tags]

```

### Example - update logic app

In this example, the [sample workflow created in the previous section](#example---create-logic-app) is updated to use a different JSON definition file, `newTestDefinition.json`, and add two resource tags, `testTag1` and `testTag2` with description values.

```azurecli-interactive

az logic workflow create --resource-group "testResourceGroup" --location "westus" --name "testLogicApp" --definition "newTestDefinition.json" --tags "testTag1=testTagValue1" "testTag2=testTagValue"

```

When your workflow is successfully updated, the CLI shows your logic app's updated workflow definition. If your update fails, see the [list of possible errors](#errors).

## Delete logic apps from CLI

You can delete a logic app's workflow from the Azure CLI using the command [`az logic workflow delete`](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-delete).

Your command must include the following [required parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-delete-required-parameters):

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Name | `--name -n` | The name of your logic app. |
| Resource group name | `-resource-group -g` | The resource group in which your logic app is located. |

You can also include an [optional parameter](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-delete-optional-parameters) to skip confirmation prompts, `--yes -y`.

```azurecli

az logic workflow delete --name
                         --resource-group
                         [--yes]

```

The CLI then prompts you to confirm the deletion of your logic app. You can skip the confirmation prompt by using the optional parameter `--yes -y` with your command.

```azurecli

Are you sure you want to perform this operation? (y/n):

```

You can confirm a logic app's deletion by [listing your logic apps in the CLI](#list-logic-apps-in-cli), or by viewing your logic apps in the Azure portal.

### Example - delete logic app

In this example, the [sample workflow created in a previous section](#example---create-logic-app) is deleted.

```azurecli-interactive

az logic workflow delete --resource-group "testResourceGroup" --name "testLogicApp"

```

After you respond to the confirmation prompt with `y`, the logic app is deleted.

## Show logic apps in CLI

You can get a specific logic app workflow using the command [`az logic workflow show`](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-show).

```azurecli

az logic workflow show --name
                       --resource-group

```

Your command must include the following [required parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-show-required-parameters)

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Name | `--name -n` | The name of your logic app. |
| Resource group name | `--resource-group -g` | The name of the resource group in which your logic app is located. |

### Example - get logic app

In this example, the logic app `testLogicApp` in the resource group `testResourceGroup` is returned with full logs for debugging.

```azurecli-interactive

az logic workflow show --resource-group "testResourceGroup" --name "testLogicApp" --debug

```

## List logic apps in CLI

You can list your logic apps by subscription using the command [`az logic workflow list`](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-list). This command returns the JSON code for your logic apps' workflows.

You can filter your results by the following [optional parameters](/cli/azure/ext/logic/logic/workflow?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-logic-az-logic-workflow-list-optional-parameters):

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Resource group name | `--resource-group -g` | The name of the resource group by which you want to filter your results. |
| Number of items | `--top` | The number of items that are included in your results. |
| Filter | `--filter` | The type of filter that you're using on your list. You can filter by state (`State`), trigger (`Trigger`), and the identifier of the referenced resource (`ReferencedResourceId`). |

```azurecli

az logic workflow list [--filter]
                       [--resource-group]
                       [--top]

```

### Example - list logic apps

In this example, all enabled workflows in the resource group `testResourceGroup` are returned in an ASCII table format.

```azurecli-interactive

az logic workflow list --resource-group "testResourceGroup" --filter "(State eq 'Enabled')" --output "table"

```

## Errors

The following error indicates that the Azure Logic Apps CLI extension isn't installed. Follow the steps in the prerequisites to [install the Logic Apps extension](#prerequisites) on your computer.
