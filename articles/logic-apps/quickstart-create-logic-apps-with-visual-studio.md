# Quickstart: Create automated tasks, processes, and workflows with Azure Logic Apps - Visual Studio

With [Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) and Visual Studio, you can create workflows for automating tasks and processes that integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises and organizations. This quickstart shows how you can design and build these workflows by creating logic apps in Visual Studio and deploying those apps to Azure. Although you can perform these tasks in the Azure portal, Visual Studio lets you add your logic apps to source control, publish different versions, and create Azure Resource Manager templates for different deployment environments.

If you're new to Azure Logic Apps and just want the basic concepts, try the [quickstart for creating a logic app in the Azure portal](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md). The Logic App Designer works similarly in both the Azure portal and Visual Studio.

In this quickstart, you create the same logic app with Visual Studio as the Azure portal quickstart. This logic app monitors a website's RSS feed and sends email for each new item in that feed. Your finished logic app looks like this high-level workflow:

<a name="prerequisites"></a>

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* Download and install these tools, if you don't have them already:

  * [Visual Studio 2019, 2017, or 2015 - Community edition or greater](https://aka.ms/download-visual-studio). This quickstart uses Visual Studio Community 2017.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you install Visual Studio 2019 or 2017, make sure 
    > that you select the **Azure development** workload.

  * [Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET (2.9.1 or later)](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/). Learn more about [Azure SDK for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/dotnet-tools?view=azure-dotnet).

  * [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell#installation)

  * The latest Azure Logic Apps Tools for the Visual Studio extension for the version that you want:

    * [Visual Studio 2019](https://aka.ms/download-azure-logic-apps-tools-visual-studio-2019)

    * [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/download-azure-logic-apps-tools-visual-studio-2017)

    * [Visual Studio 2015](https://aka.ms/download-azure-logic-apps-tools-visual-studio-2015)
  
    You can either download and install Azure Logic Apps Tools directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace, or learn [how to install this extension from inside Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions). Make sure that you restart Visual Studio after you finish installing.

* Access to the web while using the embedded Logic App Designer

  The designer needs an internet connection to create resources in Azure and to read properties and data from connectors in your logic app. For example, for Dynamics CRM Online connections, the designer checks your CRM instance for default and custom properties.

* An email account that's supported by Logic Apps, such as Office 365 Outlook, Outlook.com, or Gmail. For other providers, review the [connectors list here](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/). This example uses Office 365 Outlook. If you use a different provider, the overall steps are the same, but your UI might slightly differ.

## Create Azure resource group project

To get started, create an [Azure Resource Group project](../azure-resource-manager/vs-azure-tools-resource-groups-deployment-projects-create-deploy.md). Learn more about [Azure resource groups and resources](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md).

1. Start Visual Studio. Sign in with your Azure account.

1. On the **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**. (Keyboard: Ctrl + Shift + N)

   ![On "File" menu, select "New" > "Project"](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/create-new-visual-studio-project.png)

1. Under **Installed**, select **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**. Select **Cloud** > **Azure Resource Group**. Name your project, for example:

   ![Create Azure Resource Group project](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/create-azure-cloud-service-project.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Resource group names can contain only letters, numbers, 
   > periods (`.`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), and 
   > parentheses (`(`, `)`), but can't *end* with periods (`.`).
   >
   > If **Cloud** or **Azure Resource Group** doesn't appear, 
   > make sure you install the Azure SDK for Visual Studio.

   If you're using Visual Studio 2019, follow these steps:

   1. In the **Create a new project** box, select the **Azure Resource Group** project for Visual C# or Visual Basic. Select **Next**.

   1. Provide a name for the Azure resource group you want to use and other project information. Select **Create**.

1. From the template list, select the **Logic App** template. Select **OK**.

   ![Select Logic App template](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/select-logic-app-template.png)

   After Visual Studio creates your project, Solution Explorer opens and shows your solution. In your solution, the **LogicApp.json** file not only stores your logic app definition but is also an Azure Resource Manager template that you can use for deployment.

   ![Solution Explorer shows new logic app solution and deployment file](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/logic-app-solution-created.png)

## Create blank logic app

When you have your Azure Resource Group project, create your logic app with the **Blank Logic App** template.

1. In Solution Explorer, open the **LogicApp.json** file's shortcut menu. Select **Open With Logic App Designer**. (Keyboard: Ctrl + L)

   ![Open logic app .json file with Logic App Designer](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/open-logic-app-designer.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > If you don't have this command in Visual Studio 2019, check that you have the latest updates for Visual Studio.

   Visual Studio prompts you for your Azure subscription and an Azure resource group for creating and deploying resources for your logic app and connections.

1. For **Subscription**, select your Azure subscription. For **Resource group**, select **Create New** to create another Azure resource group.

   ![Select Azure subscription, resource group, and resource location](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/select-azure-subscription-resource-group-location.png)

   | Setting | Example value | Description |
   | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
   | User account | Fabrikam <br> sophia-owen@fabrikam.com | The account that you used when you signed in to Visual Studio |
   | **Subscription** | Pay-As-You-Go <br> (sophia-owen@fabrikam.com) | The name for your Azure subscription and associated account |
   | **Resource Group** | MyLogicApp-RG <br> (West US) | The Azure resource group and location for storing and deploying your logic app's resources |
   | **Location** | **Same as Resource Group** | The location type and specific location for deploying your logic app. The location type is either an Azure region or an existing [integration service environment (ISE)](connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment.md). <p>For this quickstart, keep the location type set to **Region** and the location set to **Same as Resource Group**. <p>**Note**: After you create your resource group project, you can [change the location type and the location](manage-logic-apps-with-visual-studio.md#change-location), but different location type affects your logic app in various ways. |

1. The Logic Apps Designer opens a page that shows an introduction video and commonly used triggers. Scroll down past the video and triggers to **Templates**, and select **Blank Logic App**.

   ![Select "Blank Logic App"](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/choose-blank-logic-app-template.png)

## Build logic app workflow

Next, add an RSS [trigger](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) that fires when a new feed item appears. Every logic app starts with a trigger, which fires when specific criteria is met. Each time the trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a logic app instance that runs your workflow.

1. In Logic App Designer, under the search box, select **All**. In the search box, enter "rss". From the triggers list, select this trigger: **When a feed item is published**

   ![Build your logic app by adding a trigger and actions](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/add-trigger-logic-app.png)

1. After the trigger appears in the designer, finish building the logic app by following the workflow steps in the [Azure portal quickstart](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md#add-rss-trigger), then return to this article. When you're done, your logic app looks like this example:

   ![Finished logic app](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/finished-logic-app-workflow.png)

1. Save your Visual Studio solution. (Keyboard: Ctrl + S)

<a name="deploy-to-Azure"></a>

## Deploy logic app to Azure

Before you can run and test your logic app, deploy the app to Azure from Visual Studio.

1. In Solution Explorer, on your project's shortcut menu, select **Deploy** > **New**. If prompted, sign in with your Azure account.

   ![Create logic app deployment](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/create-logic-app-deployment.png)

1. For this deployment, keep the default Azure subscription, resource group, and other settings. Select **Deploy**.

   ![Deploy logic app to Azure resource group](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/select-azure-subscription-resource-group-deployment.png)

1. If the **Edit Parameters** box appears, provide a resource name for your logic app. Save your settings.

   ![Provide deployment name for logic app](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/edit-parameters-deployment.png)

   When deployment starts, your app's deployment status appears in the Visual Studio **Output** window. If the status doesn't appear, open the **Show output from** list, and select your Azure resource group.

   ![Deployment status output](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/logic-app-output-window.png)

   If your selected connectors need input from you, a PowerShell window opens in the background and prompts for any necessary passwords or secret keys. After you enter this information, deployment continues.

   ![PowerShell window](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/logic-apps-powershell-window.png)

   After deployment finishes, your logic app is live in the Azure portal and runs on your specified schedule (every minute). If the trigger finds new feed items, the trigger fires, which creates a workflow instance that runs your logic app's actions. Your logic app sends email for each new item. Otherwise, if the trigger doesn't find new items, the trigger doesn't fire and "skips" instantiating the workflow. Your logic app waits until the next interval before checking.

   Here are sample emails that this logic app sends. If you don't get any emails, check your junk email folder.

   ![Outlook sends email for each new RSS item](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/outlook-email.png)

Congratulations, you've successfully built and deployed your logic app with Visual Studio. To manage your logic app and review its run history, see [Manage logic apps with Visual Studio](../logic-apps/manage-logic-apps-with-visual-studio.md).

## Add new logic app

When you have an existing Azure Resource Group project, you can add a new blank logic app to that project by using the JSON Outline window.

1. In Solution Explorer, open the `<logic-app-name>.json` file.

1. From the **View** menu, select **Other Windows** > **JSON Outline**.

1. To add a resource to the template file, select **Add Resource** at the top of the JSON Outline window. Or in the JSON Outline window, open the **resources** shortcut menu, and select **Add New Resource**.

   ![JSON Outline window](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/json-outline-window-add-resource.png)

1. In the **Add Resource** dialog box, in the search box, find `logic app`, and select **Logic App**. Name your logic app, and select **Add**.

   ![Add resource](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/add-logic-app-resource.png)

## Clean up resources

When you're done with your logic app, delete the resource group that contains your logic app and related resources.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with the same account used to create your logic app.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **Resource groups**, or search for and select **Resource groups** from any page. Select your logic app's resource group.

1. On the **Overview** page, select **Delete resource group**. Enter the resource group name as confirmation, and select **Delete**.

   !["Resource groups" > "Overview" > "Delete resource group"](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/clean-up-resources.png)

1. Delete the Visual Studio solution from your local computer.
