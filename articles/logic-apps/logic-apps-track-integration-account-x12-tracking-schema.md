# Create schemas for tracking X12 messages in integration accounts for Azure Logic Apps

To help you monitor success, errors, and message 
properties for business-to-business (B2B) transactions, 
you can use these X12 tracking schemas in your integration account:

* X12 transaction set tracking schema
* X12 transaction set acknowledgement tracking schema
* X12 interchange tracking schema
* X12 interchange acknowledgement tracking schema
* X12 functional group tracking schema
* X12 functional group acknowledgement tracking schema
