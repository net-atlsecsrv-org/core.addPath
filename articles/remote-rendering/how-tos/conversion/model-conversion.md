# Convert models

Azure Remote Rendering allows you to render very complex models. To achieve maximum performance, the data must be preprocessed to be in an optimal format. Depending on the amount of data, this step might take a while. It would be impractical, if this time was spent during model loading. Also, it would be wasteful to repeat this process for multiple sessions. 
For these reasons, ARR service provides a dedicated *conversion service*, which you can run ahead of time.
Once converted, a model can be loaded from an Azure Storage Account.

## Supported source formats

The conversion service supports these formats:

- **FBX**  (version 2011 to version 2020)
- **GLTF**/**GLB** (version 2.x)

There are minor differences between the formats with regard to material property conversion, as listed in chapter [material mapping for model formats](../../reference/material-mapping.md).

## The conversion process

1. [Prepare two Azure Blob Storage containers](blob-storage.md): one for input, one for output
1. Upload your model to the input container (optionally under a subpath)
1. Trigger the conversion process through [the model conversion REST API](conversion-rest-api.md)
1. Poll the service for conversion progress
1. Once finished, load a model
    - from a linked storage account (see the "Link storage accounts" steps on [Create an Account](../create-an-account.md#link-storage-accounts) to link your storage account)
    - or by providing a *Shared Access Signature (SAS)*.

All model data (input and output) is stored in user provided Azure blob storage. Azure Remote Rendering gives you full control over your asset management.

## Pricing

For information about pricing for conversion, refer to the [Remote Rendering pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/remote-rendering) page.


## Conversion parameters

For the various conversion options, see [this chapter](configure-model-conversion.md).

## Examples

- [Quickstart: Convert a model for rendering](../../quickstarts/convert-model.md) is a step-by-step introduction how to convert a model.
- [Example PowerShell scripts](../../samples/powershell-example-scripts.md), which demonstrate the use of the conversion service, can be found in the [ARR samples repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-remote-rendering) in the *Scripts* folder.
