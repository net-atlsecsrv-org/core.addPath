# Install the Remote Rendering package for Unity

Azure Remote Rendering uses a Unity package to encapsulate the integration into Unity.

## Manage the remote rendering packages in Unity

Unity packages are containers that can be managed via Unity's [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html).
This package contains the entire C# API as well as all plugin binaries required to use Azure Remote Rendering with Unity.
Following Unity's naming scheme for packages, the package is called **com.microsoft.azure.remote-rendering**.

The package is not part of the [ARR samples repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-remote-rendering), and it is not available from Unity's internal package registry. To add it to a project, you have to manually edit the project's `manifest.md` file to add the following:
```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "Azure Mixed Reality Services",
      "url": "https://api.bintray.com/npm/microsoft/AzureMixedReality-NPM/",
      "scopes": ["com.microsoft.azure"]
    }
   ],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.microsoft.azure.remote-rendering": "0.1.11",
    ...existing dependencies...
  }
}
```
Once this has been added, you can use the Unity Package Manager to ensure you have the latest version.
More comprehensive instructions are given in the [Tutorial: Setting up a Unity project from scratch](../../tutorials/unity/project-setup.md).

## Unity render pipelines

Remote Rendering works with both the **Universal render pipeline** and the **Standard render pipeline**. For performance reasons, the Universal render pipeline is recommended.

To use the **Universal render pipeline**, its package has to be installed in Unity. This can either be done in Unity's **Package Manager** UI (package name **Universal RP**, version 7.2.1 or newer), or through the `Packages/manifest.json` file, as described in the [Unity project setup tutorial](../../tutorials/unity/project-setup.md#configure-the-projects-manifest).
