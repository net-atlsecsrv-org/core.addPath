# Stage space

When running ARR on a device that provides head-tracking data like the HoloLens 2, the head pose is sent to both the user application and the server. The space in which the head transform is defined in is called the *stage space*.

To align local and remote content, it is assumed that the stage space and the world space are identical on both client and server. If the user decides to add an additional transform on top of the camera, it needs to be sent to the server as well to align local and remote content correctly.

Typical reasons for moving the stage space are [world locking tools](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedReality-WorldLockingTools-Unity/README.html) or other real world anchoring techniques as well as moving a virtual character in VR.

## Stage space settings

> [!CAUTION]
> EXPERIMENTAL: This feature is experimental and will change over time. Thus updating to newer client SDK versions may require additional work to upgrade the code. The current implementation will break local/remote content alignment for a brief moment when changing the stage space origin.
Thus, it is currently only intended to be used for world locking purposes like anchors that exhibit only very small changes over time.

To inform the server that an additional transform is applied to the stage space, its origin defined by a position and a rotation in world space need to be sent over. This setting can be accessed via *stage space setting*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the [desktop simulation](../../concepts/graphics-bindings.md) the world-space location of the camera is provided by the user application. In this case, setting the stage space origin must be skipped as it is already multiplied into the camera transform.

```cs
void ChangeStageSpace(AzureSession session)
{
    StageSpaceSettings settings = session.Actions.StageSpaceSettings;

    // Set position and rotation to the world-space transform of the stage space.
    settings.Position = new Double3(0, 0, 0);
    settings.Rotation = new Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

```cpp
void ChangeStageSpace(ApiHandle<AzureSession> session)
{
    ApiHandle<StageSpaceSettings> settings = *session->Actions()->StageSpaceSettings();

    // Set position and rotation to the world-space transform of the stage space.
    settings->Position({0, 0, 0});
    settings->Rotation({0, 0, 0, 1});
}
```

## Unity stage space script

The Unity integration provides a script called **StageSpace** that can be added to the camera's parent GameObject. Once present, this script will take care of setting the stage space origin.

## Next steps

* [Graphics binding](../../concepts/graphics-bindings.md)
* [Late stage reprojection](late-stage-reprojection.md)
