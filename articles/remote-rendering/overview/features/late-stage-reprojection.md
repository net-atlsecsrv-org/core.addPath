# Late stage reprojection

*Late Stage Reprojection* (LSR) is a hardware feature that helps stabilize holograms when the user moves.

Static models are expected to visually maintain their position when you move around them. If they appear to be unstable, this behavior may hint at LSR issues. Mind that additional dynamic transformations, like animations or explosion views, might mask this behavior.

You may choose between two different LSR modes, namely **Planar LSR** or **Depth LSR**. Which one is active is determined by whether the client application submits a depth buffer.

Both LSR modes improve hologram stability, although they have their distinct limitations. Start by trying Depth LSR, as it is arguably giving better results in most cases.

## Choose LSR mode in Unity

In the Unity editor, go to *File > Build Settings*. Select *Player Settings* in the lower left, then check under *Player > XR Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs > Windows Mixed Reality* whether **Enable Depth Buffer Sharing** is checked:

If it is, your app will use Depth LSR, otherwise it will use Planar LSR.

## Depth LSR

For Depth LSR to work, the client application must supply a valid depth buffer that contains all the relevant geometry to consider during LSR.

Depth LSR attempts to stabilize the video frame based on the contents of the supplied depth buffer. As a consequence, content that hasn't been rendered to it, such as transparent objects, can't be adjusted by LSR and may show instability and reprojection artifacts.

## Planar LSR

Planar LSR does not have per-pixel depth information, as Depth LSR does. Instead it reprojects all content based on a plane that you must provide each frame.

Planar LSR reprojects those objects best that lie close to the supplied plane. The further away an object is, the more unstable it will look. While Depth LSR is better at reprojecting objects at different depths, Planar LSR may work better for content aligning well with a plane.

### Configure Planar LSR in Unity

The plane parameters are derived from a so called *focus point*, which you have to provide every frame through `UnityEngine.XR.WSA.HolographicSettings.SetFocusPointForFrame`. See the [Unity Focus Point API](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/focus-point-in-unity) for details. If you don't set a focus point, a fallback will be chosen for you. However that automatic fallback often leads to suboptimal results.

You can calculate the focus point yourself, though it might make sense to base it on the one calculated by the Remote Rendering host. Call `RemoteManagerUnity.CurrentSession.GraphicsBinding.GetRemoteFocusPoint` to obtain that. You are asked to provide a coordinate frame in which to express the focus point. In most cases, you'll just want to provide the result from `UnityEngine.XR.WSA.WorldManager.GetNativeISpatialCoordinateSystemPtr` here.

Usually both the client and the host render content that the other side isn't aware of, such as UI elements on the client. Therefore, it might make sense to combine the remote focus point with a locally calculated one.

The focus points calculated in two successive frames can be quite different. Simply using them as-is can lead to holograms appearing to be jumping around. To prevent this behavior, interpolating between the previous and current focus points is advisable.
