# TexConv - Texture conversion tool

The TexConv tool is an external command-line tool to perform batched texture conversions.
The tool can be found in this git repository: [GitHub repository for TexConv tool](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv).

For Remote Rendering, textures do not have to be converted, because the conversion step can deal with common image file formats and converts textures to the appropriate runtime format. However, this tool can be helpful to convert textures locally with custom settings.
