# Add assessment tools

This article describes how to add assessment tools in [Azure Migrate](./migrate-services-overview.md). 

- If you want to add an assessment tool and you don't yet have an Azure Migrate project, follow this [article](create-manage-projects.md).
- If you've added an ISV tool, or Movere, for assessment, [follow the steps](prepare-isv-movere.md), to prepare to work with the tool.

## Select an assessment scenario

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click **Overview**.
2. Select the assessment scenario:

    - To discover and assess machines and workloads for migration to Azure, select **Assess and migrate servers**.
    - To assess on-premises SQL Server databases, select **Assess and migrate databases**.
    - To assess or migrate on-premises web apps,  select **Explore more** > **Web Apps**.
    - To assess your virtual desktop infrastructure, select **Explore more** > **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure**.
