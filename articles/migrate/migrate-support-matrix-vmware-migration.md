# Support matrix for VMware migration

This article summarizes support settings and limitations for migrating VMware VMs with [Azure Migrate: Server Migration](migrate-services-overview.md#azure-migrate-server-migration-tool) . If you're looking for information about assessing VMware VMs for migration to Azure, review the [assessment support matrix](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md).


## Migration options

You can migrate VMware VMs in a couple of ways:

- With agentless migration: Migrate VMs without needing to install anything on them. You deploy the [Azure Migrate appliance](migrate-appliance.md) for agentless migration.
- With agent-based migration: Install an agent on the VM for replication. For agent-based migration, you need to deploy a [replication appliance](migrate-replication-appliance.md).

Review [this article](server-migrate-overview.md) to figure out which method you want to use.

## Migration limitations

- You can select up to 10 VMs at once for replication. If you want to migrate more machines, then replicate in groups of 10.
- For VMware agentless migration, you can run up to 100 replications simultaneously.

## Agentless-VMware servers

**VMware** | **Details**
--- | ---
**VMware vCenter Server** | Version 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, or 6.7.
**VMware vSphere ESXI host** | Version 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, or 6.7.
**vCenter Server permissions** | Agentless migration uses the [Migrate Appliance](migrate-appliance.md). The appliance needs these permissions:<br/><br/> - **Datastore.Browse**: Allow browsing of VM log files to troubleshoot snapshot creation and deletion.<br/><br/> - **Datastore.LowLevelFileOperations**: Allow read/write/delete/rename operations in the datastore browser, to troubleshoot snapshot creation and deletion.<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.Configuration.DiskChangeTracking**: Allow enable or disable change tracking of VM disks, to pull changed blocks of data between snapshots.<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.Configuration.DiskLease**: Allow disk lease operations for a VM, to read the disk using the VMware vSphere Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK).<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.Provisioning.AllowDiskAccess**: (specifically for vSphere 6.0 and above) Allow opening a disk on a VM for random read access on the disk using the VDDK.<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.Provisioning.AllowReadOnlyDiskAccess**: Allow opening a disk on a VM, to read the disk using the VDDK.<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.Provisioning.AllowDiskRandomAccess**: Allow opening a disk on a VM, to read the disk using the VDDK.<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.Provisioning.AllowVirtualMachineDownload**: Allows read operations on files associated with a VM, to download the logs and troubleshoot if failure occurs.<br/><br/> - **VirtualMachine.SnapshotManagement.***: Allow creation and management of VM snapshots for replication.<br/><br/> - **Virtual Machine.Interaction.Power Off**: Allow the VM to be powered off during migration to Azure.



## Agentless-VMware VMs

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Supported operating systems** | [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) operating systems that are supported by Azure can be migrated using agentless migration.
**Required changes for Azure** | Some VMs might require changes so that they can run in Azure. Azure Migrate makes these changes automatically for the following operating systems:<br/> - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5+, 7.0+<br/> - CentOS 6.5+, 7.0+</br> - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1+<br/> - Ubuntu 14.04LTS, 16.04LTS, 18.04LTS<br/> - Debian 7, 8<br/><br/> For other operating systems, you need to make adjustments manually before migration. The relevant articles contain instructions about how to do this.
**Linux boot** | If /boot is on a dedicated partition, it should reside on the OS disk, and not be spread across multiple disks.<br/> If /boot is part of the root (/) partition, then the '/' partition should be on the OS disk, and not span other disks.
**UEFI boot** | VMs with UEFI boot aren't supported for migration.
**Disk size** | 2 TB OS disk; 8 TB for data disks.
**Disk limits** |  Up to 60 disks per VM.
**Encrypted disks/volumes** | VMs with encrypted disks/volumes aren't supported for migration.
**Shared disk cluster** | Not supported.
**Independent disks** | Not supported.
**RDM/passthrough disks** | If VMs have RDM or passthrough disks, these disks won't be replicated to Azure.
**NFS** | NFS volumes mounted as volumes on the VMs won't be replicated.
**iSCSI targets** | VMs with iSCSI targets aren't supported for agentless migration.
**Multipath IO** | Not supported.
**Storage vMotion** | Not supported. Replication won't work if a VM uses storage vMotion.
**Teamed NICs** | Not supported.
**IPv6** | Not supported.
**Target disk** | VMs can only be migrated to managed disks (standard HDD, premium SSD) in Azure.
**Simultaneous replication** | 100 VMs per vCenter Server. If you have more, migrate them in batches of 100.

## Agent-based-replication appliance 

When you set up the replication appliance using the OVA template provided in the Azure Migrate hub, the appliance runs Windows Server 2016 and complies with the support requirements. If you set up the replication appliance manually on a physical server, then make sure that it complies with the requirements.

- Learn about [replication appliance requirements](migrate-replication-appliance.md#appliance-requirements) for VMware.
- MySQL must be installed on the appliance. Learn about [installation options](migrate-replication-appliance.md#mysql-installation).
- Learn about [URLs](migrate-replication-appliance.md#url-access) and [ports](migrate-replication-appliance.md#port-access) the replication appliance needs to access.

## Agent-based-ports

**Device** | **Connection**
--- | ---
VMs | The Mobility service running on VMs communicates with the on-premises replication appliance (configuration server) on port HTTPS 443 inbound, for replication management.<br/><br/> VMs send replication data to the process server (running on the configuration server machine) on port HTTPS 9443 inbound. This port can be modified.
Replication appliance | The replication appliance orchestrates replication with Azure over port HTTPS 443 outbound.
Process server | The process server receives replication data, optimizes, and encrypts it, and sends it to Azure storage over port 443 outbound.<br/> By default the process server runs on the replication appliance.

## Azure VM requirements

All on-premises VMs replicated to Azure must meet the Azure VM requirements summarized in this table. When Site Recovery runs a prerequisites check for replication, the check will fail if some of the requirements aren't met.
