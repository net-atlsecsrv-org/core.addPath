# Discover machine apps, roles, and features

This article describes how to discover applications, roles, and features on on-premises servers, using Azure Migrate: Server Assessment.

Discovering the inventory of apps, and roles/features running on your on-premises machines helps you to identify and plan a migration path to Azure that's tailored for your workloads.

> [!NOTE]
> App discovery is currently supported for VMware VMs only, and is limited to discovery only. We don't yet offer app-based assessment.  Right now Server Assessment currently assesses on-premises VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, and physical servers at the machine level, for lift-and-shift migrations.

App discovery using Azure Migrate: Server Assessment is agentless. Nothing needs to be installed on machines and VMs. Server Assessment uses the Azure Migrate appliance to perform discovery along with machine guest credentials. The appliance remotely accesses the VMware machines using VMware APIs.


## Before you start

1. Review the [support limitations](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#application-discovery) for app-level discovery.
2. Make sure you've [created](how-to-add-tool-first-time.md) an Azure Migrate project.
3. If you've already created a project, make sure you've [added](how-to-assess.md) the Azure Migrate: Server Assessment tool.
4. Check the [VMware requirements](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#assessment-vcenter-server-requirements) for discovering and assessing VMware VMs with the Azure Migrate appliance.
4. Check the [requirements](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#assessment-appliance-requirements) for deploying the Azure Migrate appliance.

## Prepare for app discovery

1. [Prepare for appliance deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-prepare-vmware). Preparation includes verifying appliance settings, and setting up an account that the appliance will use to access vCenter Server.
2. Make sure you have a user account (one each for Windows and Linux servers) with administrator permissions for machines on which you want to discover apps, roles, and features.
3. [Deploy the VMware appliance](how-to-set-up-appliance-vmware.md) to start discovery. To deploy the appliance, you download and import an OVA template into VMware to create the appliance as a VMware VM. You configure the appliance and then register it with Azure Migrate.
2. As you deploy the appliance, to start continuous discovery you specify the following:
    - The name of the vCenter Server to which you want to connect.
    - Credentials that you created for the appliance to connect to vCenter Server.
    - The account credentials you created for the appliance to connect to Windows/Linux VMs.

After the appliance is deployed and you've provided credentials, the appliance starts continuous discovery of VM metadata and performance data, along with and discovery of apps, features, and roles.  The duration of app discovery depends on how many VMs you have. It typically takes an hour for app-discovery of 500 VMs.

## Review and export the inventory

After discovery finishes, if you provided credentials for app discovery, you can review and export the app inventory in the Azure portal.

1. In **Azure Migrate - Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, click the displayed count to open the **Discovered servers** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > At this stage you can also optionally set up dependency mapping for discovered machines, so that you can visualize dependencies across machines you want to assess. [Learn more](how-to-create-group-machine-dependencies.md).

2. In **Applications discovered**, click the displayed count.
3. In **Application inventory**, you can review the discovered apps, roles, and features.
4. To export the inventory, in **Discovered Servers**, click **Export app inventory**.

The app inventory is exported and downloaded in Excel format. The **Application Inventory** sheet displays all the apps discovered across all the machines.
