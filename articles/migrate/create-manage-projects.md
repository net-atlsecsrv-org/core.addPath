# Create and manage Azure Migrate projects

This article describes how to create, manage, and delete [Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md) projects.

An Azure Migrate project is used to store discovery, assessment, and migration metadata collected from the environment you're assessing or migrating. In a project you can track discovered assets, create assessments, and orchestrate migrations to Azure.  

## Verify permissions

Check you have the correct permissions to create an Azure Migrate project:

1. In the Azure portal, open the relevant subscription, and selectâ€¯**Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and select it view permissions. You should have *Contributor* or *Owner* permissions. 


## Create a project for the first time

Set up a new Azure Migrate project in an Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, search for *Azure Migrate*.
2. In **Services**, select **Azure Migrate**.
3. In **Overview**, select **Assess and migrate servers**.

4. In **Servers**, select **Create project**.

5. In **Create project**, select the Azure subscription and resource group. Create a resource group if you don't have one.
6. In **Project Details**, specify the project name and the geography in which you want to create the project.
    - The geography is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises machines. You can select any target region for migration. 
    - Review supported geographies for [public](migrate-support-matrix.md#supported-geographies-public-cloud) and [government clouds](migrate-support-matrix.md#supported-geographies-azure-government).

8. Select **Create**.

Wait a few minutes for the Azure Migrate project to deploy.

## Create a project in a specific region

In the portal, you can select the geography in which you want to create the project. If you want to create the project within a specific Azure region, using the following API command to create the  project.

```rest
PUT /subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Migrate/MigrateProjects/<mymigrateprojectname>?api-version=2018-09-01-preview "{location: 'centralus', properties: {}}"
``````


## Create additional projects

If you already have an Azure Migrate project and you want to create an additional project, do the following:  

1. In the [Azure public portal](https://portal.azure.com) or [Azure Government](https://portal.azure.us), search for **Azure Migrate**.
2. On the Azure Migrate dashboard > **Servers**, select **change** in the upper-right corner.

   ![Change Azure Migrate project](./media/create-manage-projects/switch-project.png)

3. To create a new project, select **click here**.


## Find a project

Find a project as follows:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for *Azure Migrate*.
2. In the Azure Migrate dashboard > **Servers**, select **change** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Switch to an existing Azure Migrate project](./media/create-manage-projects/switch-project.png)

3. Select the appropriate subscription and Azure Migrate project.


### Find a legacy project

If you created the project in the [previous version](migrate-services-overview.md#azure-migrate-versions) of Azure Migrate, find it as follows:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for *Azure Migrate*.
2. In the Azure Migrate dashboard, if you've created a project in the previous version, a banner referencing older projects appears. Select the banner.

    ![Access existing projects](./media/create-manage-projects/access-existing-projects.png)

3. Review the list of old projects.


## Delete a project

Delete as follows:

1. Open the Azure resource group in which the project was created.
2. In the resource group page, select **Show hidden types**.
3. Select the migrate project you want to delete, and its associated resources.
    - The resource type is **Microsoft.Migrate/migrateprojects**.
    - If the resource group is exclusively used by the Azure Migrate project, you can delete the entire resource group.

Note that:

- When you delete, both the project and the metadata about discovered machines are deleted.
- If you're using the older version of Azure Migrate, open the Azure resource group in which the project was created. Select the migrate project you want to delete (the resource type is **Migration project**).
- If you're using dependency analysis with an Azure Log Analytics workspace:
    - If you've attached a Log Analytics workspace to the Server Assessment tool, the workspace isn't automatically deleted. The same Log Analytics workspace can be used for multiple scenarios.
    - If you want to delete the Log Analytics workspace, do that manually.
- Project deletion is irreversible. Deleted objects can't be recovered.

### Delete a workspace manually

1. Browse to the Log Analytics workspace attached to the project.

    - If you haven't deleted the Azure Migrate project, you can find the link to the workspace in **Essentials** > **Server Assessment**.
       ![LA Workspace](./media/create-manage-projects/loganalytics-workspace.png).
       
    - If you've already deleted the Azure Migrate project, select **Resource Groups** in the left pane of the Azure portal and find the workspace.
       
2. [Follow the instructions](../azure-monitor/platform/delete-workspace.md) to delete the workspace.

## Next steps

Add [assessment](how-to-assess.md) or [migration](how-to-migrate.md) tools to Azure Migrate projects.
