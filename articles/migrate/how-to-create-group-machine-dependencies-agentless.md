# Set up agentless dependency visualization 

This article describes how to set up dependency visualization in Azure Migrate:Server Assessment. [Dependency visualization](concepts-dependency-visualization.md#what-is-dependency-visualization) helps you to identify and understand dependencies across machines you want to assess and migrate to Azure.

Agentless dependency visualization helps you to identify machine dependencies without install any agents on machines. It works by capturing the TCP connection data from machines for which it's enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agentless dependency visualization is currently in preview for Azure VMware VMs only, discovered with the Azure Migrate:Server Assessment tool.
> Features might be limited or incomplete.
> This preview is covered by customer support and can be used for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Current limitations

- Right now you can't add or remove a server from a group, in the dependency analysis view.
- A dependency map for a group of servers isn't currently not available.
- Currently, the dependency data can't be downloaded in tabular format.

## Before you start

- [Review](concepts-dependency-visualization.md#agentless-visualization) the requirements and costs associated with agentless dependency visualization.
- Review the [support requirements](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#agentless-dependency-visualization) for setting up agentless dependency visualization.
- Make sure you've [created](how-to-add-tool-first-time.md) an Azure Migrate project.
- If you've already created a project, make sure you've [added](how-to-assess.md) the Azure Migrate:Server Assessment tool.
- Make sure you've set up an [Azure Migrate appliance](migrate-appliance.md) to discover your on-premises machines. Learn how to set up an appliance for [VMware](how-to-set-up-appliance-vmware.md) VMs. The appliance discovers on-premises machines, and sends metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate:Server Assessment.


## Create a user account for discovery

Set up a user account so that Server Assessment can access the VM for discovery. You can specify one user account.

- **Windows VMs**: The user account needs to be a local or a domain administrator.
- **Linux VMs**: The root privilege is required on the account. Alternately, the user account requires these two capabilities on /bin/netstat and /bin/ls files: CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH and CAP_SYS_PTRACE.

## Add the user account to the appliance

Add the user account to the appliance.

1. Open the appliance management app. 
2. Navigate to the **Provide vCenter details** panel.
3. In **Discover application and dependencies on VMs**, click **Add credentials**
3. Choose the **Operating system**, provide a friendly name for the account, and the **User name**/**Password**
6. Click **Save**.
7. Click **Save and start discovery**.

## Start dependency discovery

Choose the machines on which you want to enable dependency discovery.

1. In **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, click **Discovered servers**.
2. Click the **Dependency analysis** icon.
3. Click **Add servers**.
3. In the **Add servers** page, choose the appliance that's discovering the relevant machines.
4. From the machine list, select the machines.
5. Click **Add servers**.

You can visualize dependencies around six hours after starting dependency discovery.

## Visualize dependencies

1. In **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, click **Discovered servers**.
2. Search for the machine you want to view.
3. In the **Dependencies** column, click **View dependencies**
4. Change the time period for which you want to view the map using the **Time duration** dropdown.
5. Expand the **Client** group to list the machines with a dependency on the selected machine.
6. Expand the **Port** group to list the machines that have a dependency from the selected machine.
7. To navigate to the map view of any of the dependent machines, click on the machine name > **Load server map**

    ![Expand client group ](./media/how-to-create-group-machine-dependencies-agentless/expand-client-group.png)

8. Expand the selected machine to view process-level details for each dependency.

> [!NOTE]
> Process information for a dependency is not always available. If it's not available, the dependency is depicted with the process marked as "Unknown process".

## Stop dependency discovery

Choose the machines on which you want to stop dependency discovery.

1. In **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, click **Discovered servers**.
2. Click the **Dependency analysis** icon.
3. Click **Remove servers**.
3. In the **Remove servers** page, choose the **appliance** that is discovering the VMs on which you look to stop dependency discovery.
4. From the machine list, select the machines.
5. Click **Remove servers**.
