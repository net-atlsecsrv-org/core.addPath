# Prepare VMware VMs for assessment and migration to Azure

This article helps you to prepare for assessment and/or migration of on-premises VMware VMs to Azure using [Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md).

[Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) provides a hub of tools that help you to discover, assess, and migrate apps, infrastructure, and workloads to Microsoft Azure. The hub includes Azure Migrate tools, and third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.


This tutorial is the first in a series that shows you how to assess and migrate VMware VMs. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prepare Azure to work with Azure Migrate.
> * Prepare VMware for VM assessment.
> * Prepare VMware for VM migration.

> [!NOTE]
> Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario. They're useful when you learn how to set up a deployment, and as a quick proof-of-concept. Tutorials use default options where possible, and don't show all possible settings and paths. For detailed instructions, review the how-tos for VMware assessment and migration.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) before you begin.


## Prepare Azure

You need these permissions.

**Task** | **Permissions**
--- | ---
**Create an Azure Migrate project** | Your Azure account needs permissions to create a project.
**Register the Azure Migrate appliance** | Azure Migrate uses a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance to assess VMware VMs with Azure Migrate Server Assessment, and to run [agentless migration](server-migrate-overview.md) of VMware VMs with Azure Migrate Server Migration. This appliance discovers VMs, and sends VM metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate.<br/><br/>During appliance registration, the following Resource Providers are registered with the subscription chosen in the appliance- Microsoft.OffAzure, Microsoft.Migrate and Microsoft.KeyVault. Registering a resource provider configures your subscription to work with the resource provider. To register the resource providers, you need a Contributor or Owner role on the subscription.<br/><br/> As part of onboarding, Azure Migrate creates two Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) apps:<br/> -    The first app is used for communication (authentication and authorization) between the agents running on the appliance with their respective services running on Azure. This app does not have privileges to make ARM calls or RBAC access on any resource.<br/> - The second app is used exclusively to access KeyVault created in the user's subscription for agentless migration. It is provided with an RBAC access on the Azure Key Vault (created in customer's tenant) when discovery is initiated from the appliance.
**Create a Key Vault** | To migrate VMware VMs with Azure Migrate Server Migration, Azure Migrate creates a Key Vault to manage access keys to the replication storage account in your subscription. To create the vault, you need role assignment permissions on the resource group in which the Azure Migrate project resides.






### Assign permissions to create project

1. In the Azure portal, open the subscription, and select **Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and click it to view permissions.
3. You should have **Contributor** or **Owner** permissions.
    - If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
    - If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.

### Assign permissions to register the appliance

To register the appliance, you assign permissions for Azure Migrate to create the Azure AD apps during appliance registration. The permissions can be assigned using one of the following methods:

- A tenant/global admin can grant permissions to users in the tenant, to create and register Azure AD apps.
- A tenant/global admin can assign the Application Developer role (that has the permissions) to the account.

> [!NOTE]
> - The apps don't have any other access permissions on the subscription other than those described above.
> - You only need these permissions when you register a new appliance. You can remove the permissions after the appliance is set up.


#### Grant account permissions

The tenant/global admin can grant permissions as follows

1. In Azure AD, the tenant/global admin should navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **User Settings**.
2. The admin should set **App registrations** to **Yes**. This is a default setting that isn't sensitive. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-how-applications-are-added#who-has-permission-to-add-applications-to-my-azure-ad-instance).

#### Assign Application Developer role

The tenant/global admin can assign the Application Developer role to an account. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal).

### Assign permissions to create a Key Vault

To enable Azure Migrate to create a Key Vault, assign permissions as follows:

1. In the resource group in the Azure portal, select **Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and click it to view permissions.

    - To run server assessment, **Contributor** permissions are enough.
    - To run agentless server migration, you should have **Owner** (or **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator**) permissions.

3. If you don't have the required permissions, request them from the resource group owner.



## Prepare for VMware VM assessment

To prepare for VMware VM assessment, you need to:

- **Verify VMware settings**. Make sure that the vCenter Server and VMs you want to migrate meet requirements.
- **Set up an assessment account**. Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server to discover VMs for assessment.
- **Verify appliance requirements**. Verify deployment requirements for the Azure Migrate appliance used for assessment.

### Verify VMware settings

1. [Check](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#vmware-requirements) VMware server requirements for assessment.
2. [Make sure](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#port-access) that the  ports you need are open on vCenter Server.
3. On vCenter Server, make sure that your account has permissions to create a VM using an OVA file. You deploy the Azure Migrate appliance as a VMware VM, using an OVA file.


### Set up an account for assessment

Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server to discover VMs for assessment and agentless migration.

- If you plan to discover applications or visualize dependency in an agentless manner, create a vCenter Server account with read-only access along with privileges enabled for **Virtual machines** > **Guest Operations**.

  ![vCenter Server account privileges](./media/tutorial-prepare-vmware/vcenter-server-permissions.png)

- If you are not planning to do application discovery and agentless dependency visualization, set up a read-only account for the vCenter Server.

### Verify appliance settings for assessment

Before setting up the Azure Migrate appliance and beginning assessment in the next tutorial, prepare for appliance deployment.

1. [Verify](migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) appliance requirements for VMware VMs.
2. [Review](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) the Azure URLs that the appliance will need to access. If you're using a URL-based firewall or proxy, ensure it allows access to the required URLs.
3. [Review](migrate-appliance.md#collected-data---vmware) that that the appliance will collect during discovery and assessment.
4. [Note](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#port-access) port access requirements for the appliance.




## Prepare for agentless VMware migration

Review the requirements for agentless migration of VMware VMs.

1. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-vmware-servers) VMware server requirements, and the [permissions](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-vmware-servers) that Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server for agentless migration using Azure Migrate Server Migration.
2. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-vmware-vms) the requirements for VMware VMs that you want to migrate to Azure using agentless migration.
4. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-azure-migrate-appliance) the requirements for using the Azure Migrate appliance for agentless migration.
5. Note the [URL access](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) and [port access](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-ports) needed for agentless migration.


## Prepare for agent-based VMware migration

Review the requirements for [agent-based migration](server-migrate-overview.md) of VMware VMs.

1. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agent-based-vmware-servers) VMware server requirements, and the permissions Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server for agent-based migration using Azure Migrate Server Migration.
2. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agent-based-vmware-vms) the requirements for VMware VMs that you want to migrate to Azure using agent-based migration, including installation of the Mobility service on each VM you want to migrate.
3. Agent-based migrations uses a replication appliance:
    - [Review](migrate-replication-appliance.md#appliance-requirements) the deployment requirements for the replication appliance, and the [options](migrate-replication-appliance.md#mysql-installation) for installing MySQL on the appliance.
    - Review the [URL](migrate-replication-appliance.md#url-access) and [port](migrate-replication-appliance.md#port-access) access requirements for the replication appliance.
