# Prepare VMware VMs for assessment and migration to Azure

This article helps you to prepare for assessment and/or migration of on-premises VMware VMs to Azure using [Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md).



This tutorial is the first in a series that shows you how to assess and migrate VMware VMs. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prepare Azure to work with Azure Migrate.
> * Prepare VMware for VM assessment with the Azure Migrate:Server Assessment tool.
> * Prepare VMware for VM migration with the Azure Migrate:Server Migration tool. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario. They're useful when you learn how to set up a deployment, and as a quick proof-of-concept. Tutorials use default options where possible, and don't show all possible settings and paths. 

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) before you begin.


## Prepare Azure

You need these permissions for these tasks in Azure, before you can assess or migrate VMware VMs.

**Permissions** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Permissions to create a project** | Your Azure account needs permissions to create an Azure Migrate project.
**Permissions to register the Azure Migrate appliance** | Azure Migrate uses a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance to discover VMs, and to send VM metadata/performance data to Azure Migrate. The appliance is used when assessing VMware VMs with Azure Migrate Server Assessment, and when migrating VMware VMs using [agentless migration](server-migrate-overview.md) with Azure Migrate:Server Migration. You need a couple of permissions to set up and register the appliance: <br/><br/> - **Register resource providers**: After deploying the appliance, you register these resource providers so that your Azure subscription can work with them: Microsoft.OffAzure, Microsoft.Migrate and Microsoft.KeyVault. To register the resource providers, you need a Contributor or Owner role on the subscription.<br/>- **Create Azure AD apps**: During onboarding, you need permissions for Azure Migrate to create two Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) apps.<br/><br/> - The first app is used for communication (authentication and authorization) between the agents running on the appliance with their respective services running on Azure. This app does not have privileges to make Azure Resource Manager calls, or RBAC access on any resource.<br/> - The second app is used exclusively to access KeyVault created in the user's subscription for agentless migration. It is provided with an RBAC access on the Azure Key Vault (created in customer's tenant) when discovery is initiated from the appliance.
**Permissions to create a Key Vault** | To migrate VMware VMs using agentless migration, Azure Migrate creates a Key Vault to manage access keys to the replication storage account in your subscription. To create the vault, you need role assignment permissions on the resource group in which the Azure Migrate project resides.


### Assign permissions to create project

1. In the Azure portal, open the subscription, and select **Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and click it to view permissions.
3. You should have **Contributor** or **Owner** permissions.
    - If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
    - If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.

### Assign permissions to register the appliance

To register the appliance, you assign permissions for Azure Migrate to create the Azure AD apps during appliance registration. The permissions can be assigned using one of the following methods:

- **Grant permissions**: A tenant/global admin can grant permissions to users in the tenant, to create and register Azure AD apps.
- **Assign application developer role**: A tenant/global admin can assign the Application Developer role (that has the permissions) to the account.

> [!NOTE]
> - The apps don't have any other access permissions on the subscription other than those described above.
> - You only need these permissions when you register a new appliance. You can remove the permissions after the appliance is set up.


#### Grant account permissions

If you want tenant/global admin to grant permissions, do this as follows:

1. In Azure AD, the tenant/global admin should navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **User Settings**.
2. The admin should set **App registrations** to **Yes**. This is a default setting that isn't sensitive. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-how-applications-are-added#who-has-permission-to-add-applications-to-my-azure-ad-instance).

    ![Azure AD permissions](./media/tutorial-prepare-vmware/aad.png)



#### Assign Application Developer role

Alternatively, the tenant/global admin can assign the Application Developer role to an account. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal) about assigning a role.

### Assign permissions to create a Key Vault

To enable Azure Migrate to create a Key Vault, assign permissions as follows:

1. In the resource group in the Azure portal, select **Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and click it to view permissions.

    - To run server assessment, **Contributor** permissions are enough.
    - To run agentless server migration, you should have **Owner** (or **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator**) permissions.

3. If you don't have the required permissions, request them from the resource group owner.



## Prepare for VMware VM assessment

To prepare for VMware VM assessment, you need to:

- **Verify VMware settings**. Make sure that the vCenter Server and VMs you want to migrate meet requirements.
- **Set up an account for assessment**. Azure Migrate uses this account to access the vCenter Server, to discover VMs for assessment.
- **Verify appliance requirements**. Verify deployment requirements for the Azure Migrate appliance, before you deploy it.

### Verify VMware settings

1. [Check](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#vmware-requirements) VMware server requirements for assessment.
2. [Make sure](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#port-access) that the  ports you need are open on vCenter Server.
3. On vCenter Server, make sure that your account has permissions to create a VM using an OVA file. You deploy the Azure Migrate appliance as a VMware VM, using an OVA file.


### Set up an account for assessment

Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server to discover VMs for assessment and agentless migration.

- If you plan to discover applications or visualize dependency in an agentless manner, create a vCenter Server account with read-only access along with privileges enabled for **Virtual machines** > **Guest Operations**.

  ![vCenter Server account privileges](./media/tutorial-prepare-vmware/vcenter-server-permissions.png)

- If you are not planning to do application discovery and agentless dependency visualization, set up a read-only account for the vCenter Server.

### Verify appliance settings for assessment

Before setting up the Azure Migrate appliance and beginning assessment in the next tutorial, prepare for appliance deployment.

1. [Verify](migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) Azure Migrate appliance requirements.
2. [Review](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) the Azure URLs that the appliance will need to access. If you're using a URL-based firewall or proxy, ensure it allows access to the required URLs.
3. [Review data](migrate-appliance.md#collected-data---vmware) that the appliance collects during discovery and assessment.
4. [Note](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#port-access) port access requirements for the appliance.




## Prepare for agentless VMware migration

Review the requirements for [agentless migration](server-migrate-overview.md) of VMware VMs.

1. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-vmware-servers) VMware server requirements.
2. [Review the permissions](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-vmware-servers) that Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server.
3. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-vmware-vms) VMware VMs requirements.
4. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-azure-migrate-appliance) the Azure Migrate appliance requirements.
5. Note the [URL access](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) and [port access](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agentless-ports) requirements.

## Prepare for agent-based VMware migration

Review the requirements for [agent-based migration](server-migrate-overview.md) of VMware VMs.

1. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agent-based-vmware-servers) VMware server requirements.
2. [Review the permissions](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agent-based-vmware-servers) Azure Migrate needs to access the vCenter Server.
2. [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware-migration.md#agent-based-vmware-vms) VMware VMs requirements, including installation of the Mobility service on each VM you want to migrate.
3. Agent-based migration uses a replication appliance:
    - [Review](migrate-replication-appliance.md#appliance-requirements) the deployment requirements for the replication appliance.
    - [Review the options](migrate-replication-appliance.md#mysql-installation) for installing MySQL on the appliance.
    - Review the [URL](migrate-replication-appliance.md#url-access) and [port](migrate-replication-appliance.md#port-access) access requirements for the replication appliance.
