# Support matrix for Hyper-V assessment and migration

You can use the [Azure Migrate service](migrate-overview.md) to assess and migrate machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This article summarizes support settings and limitations for assessing and migrating on-premises Hyper-V VMs.



## Hyper-V scenarios

The table summarizes supported scenarios for Hyper-V VMs.

**Deployment** | **Details***
--- | ---
**Assess on-premises Hyper-V VMs** | [Set up](tutorial-prepare-hyper-v.md) your first assessment.<br/><br/> [Run](scale-hyper-v-assessment.md) a large-scale assessment.
**Migrate Hyper-V VMs to Azure** | [Try out](tutorial-migrate-hyper-v.md) migration to Azure. 

Migration of Hyper-V servers managed with System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) isn't supported by Azure Migrate Server Migration. 

## Azure Migrate projects

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
Azure permissions | You need Contributor or Owner permissions in the subscription to create an Azure Migrate project.
Hyper-V VMs | Assess up to 35,000 Hyper-V VMs in a single project. You can have multiple projects in an Azure subscription. A project can include both VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs, up to the assessment limits.
Geography | You can create Azure Migrate projects in a number of geographies. Although you can create projects in specific ographies, you can assess or migrate machines for other target locations. The project geography is only used to store the discovered metadata.

  **Geography** | **Metadata storage location**
  --- | ---
  Azure Government | US Gov Virginia
  Asia Pacific | East Asia or Southeast Asia
  Australia | Australia East or Australia Southeast
  Canada | Canada Central or Canada East
  Europe | North Europe or West Europe
  India | Central India or South India
  Japan |  Japan East or Japan West
  United Kingdom | UK South or UK West
  United States | Central US or West US 2


 > [!NOTE]
 > Support for Azure Government is currently only available for the [older version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview#azure-migrate-versions) of Azure Migrate.


## Assessment-Hyper-V host requirements

| **Support**                | **Details**               
| :-------------------       | :------------------- |
| **Host deployment**       | The Hyper-V host can be standalone or deployed in a cluster. |
| **Permissions**           | You need administrator permissions on the Hyper-V host. <br/> Alternatively, if you don't want to assign Administrator permissions, create a local or domain user account and add the user to these groups- Remote Management Users, Hyper-V Administrators and Performance Monitor Users. |
| **Host operating system** | Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2.<br/> You can't assess VMs located on Hyper-V hosts running Windows Server 2012. |
| **PowerShell Remoting**   | Must be enabled on each host. |
| **Hyper-V Replica**       | If you use Hyper-V Replica (or you have multiple VMs with the same VM identifiers), and discover both the original and replicated VMs using Azure Migrate, the assessment generated by Azure Migrate might not be accurate. |


## Assessment-Hyper-V VM requirements

| **Support**                  | **Details**               
| :----------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Operating system** | All [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) operating systems that are supported by Azure. |
| **Integration Services**       | [Hyper-V Integration Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/integration-services) must be running on VMs that you assess, in order to capture operating system information. |



## Assessment-appliance requirements

For assessment, Azure Migrate runs a lightweight appliance to discover Hyper-V VMs, and send VM metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate. The appliance runs on a Hyper-V VM, and you set up using a compressed Hyper-V VHD that you download from the Azure portal. The following table summarizes the appliance requirements.

| **Support**                | **Details**               
| :-------------------       | :------------------- |
| **Azure Migrate project**  |  An appliance can be associated with a single project.<br/> You can discover up to 5000 Hyper-V VMs with a single appliance.
| **Hyper-V**    |  You deploy the appliance as a Hyper-V VM.<br/> The appliance VM provided is Hyper-V VM version 5.0.<br/> The VM host must be running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later.<br/> It needs sufficient space to allocate 16 GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, and 1 external switch for the appliance VM.<br/> Appliance requires a static or dynamic IP address, and internet access.


## Assessment-appliance URL access

To assess VMs, the Azure Migrate appliance needs internet connectivity.

- When you deploy the appliance, Azure Migrate does a connectivity check to the URLs summarized in the table below.
- If you're using a URL-based proxy, allow access to the URLs in the table, making sure that the proxy resolves any CNAME records received while looking up the URLs.
- If you have an intercepting proxy, you might need to import the server certificate from the proxy server to the appliance.


**URL** | **Details**  
--- | ---
*.portal.azure.com | Navigation to the Azure portal
*.windows.net <br/> *.msftauth.net <br/> *.msauth.net <br/> *.microsoft.com <br/> *.live.com  | Sign in to your Azure subscription
*.microsoftonline.com <br/> *.microsoftonline-p.com | Creation of Azure Active Directory applications for appliance to service communications.
management.azure.com | Creation of Azure Active Directory applications for appliance to service communications.
dc.services.visualstudio.com | Logging and monitoring
*.vault.azure.net | Manage secrets in Azure Key Vault when communicating between the appliance and service.
aka.ms/* | Allow access to aka links.
https://download.microsoft.com/download/* | Allows downloads from the Microsoft Download site.



## Assessment-port requirements

The following table summarizes port requirements for assessment.

**Device** | **Connection**
--- | ---
**Appliance** | Inbound connections on TCP port 3389 to allow remote desktop connections to the appliance.<br/> Inbound connections on port 44368 to remotely access the appliance management app using the URL: ``` https://<appliance-ip-or-name>:44368 ```<br/> Outbound connections on ports 443, 5671 and 5672 to send discovery and performance metadata to Azure Migrate.
**Hyper-V host/cluster** | Inbound connections on WinRM ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS) to pull configuration and performance metadata of the Hyper-V VMs using a Common Information Model (CIM) session.
