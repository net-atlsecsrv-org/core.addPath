# Customize an assessment

This article describes how to customize assessments created by Azure Migrate Server Assessment.

[Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md) provides a central hub to track discovery, assessment, and migration of your on-premises apps and workloads, and private/public cloud VMs, to Azure. The hub provides Azure Migrate tools for assessment and migration, as well as third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.

You can use the Azure Migrate Server Assessment tool to create assessments for on-premises VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs, in preparation for migration to Azure.

## About assessments

There are two types of assessments you can run using Azure Migrate Server Assessment.

**Assessment** | **Details** | **Data**
--- | --- | ---
**Performance-based** | Assessments based on collected performance data | **Recommended VM size**: Based on CPU and memory utilization data.<br/><br/> **Recommended disk type (standard or premium managed disk)**: Based on the IOPS and throughput of the on-premises disks.
**As on-premises** | Assessments based on on-premises sizing. | **Recommended VM size**: Based on the on-premises VM size<br/><br> **Recommended disk type**: Based on the storage type setting you select for the assessment.


## How is an assessment done?

An assessment done in Azure Migrate Server Assessment has three stages. Assessment starts with a suitability analysis, followed by sizing, and lastly, a monthly cost estimation. A machine only moves along to a later stage if it passes the previous one. For example, if a machine fails the Azure suitability check, itâ€™s marked as unsuitable for Azure, and sizing and costing won't be done.

## What's in an assessment?

**Property** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Target location** | The Azure location to which you want to migrate.<br/> Server Assessment currently supports these target regions: Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Canada Central, Canada East, Central India, Central US, China East, China North, East Asia, East US, East US2, Germany Central, Germany Northeast, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Korea South, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, South India, UK South, UK West, US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, US Gov Virginia, West Central US, West Europe, West India, West US, and West US2.
**Storage type** | You can use this property to specify the type of disks you want to move to, in Azure.<br/><br/> For as-on premises sizing, you can specify the target storage type either as Premium-managed disks, Standard SSD-managed disks or Standard HDD-managed disks. For performance-based sizing, you can specify the target disk type either as Automatic, Premium-managed disks, Standard HDD-managed disks, or Standard SSD-managed disks.<br/><br/> When you specify the storage type as automatic, the disk recommendation is done based on the performance data of the disks (IOPS and throughput). If you specify the storage type as premium/standard, the assessment will recommend a disk SKU within the storage type selected. If you want to achieve a single instance VM SLA of 99.9%, you may want to specify the storage type as Premium-managed disks. This ensures that all disks in the assessment are recommended as Premium-managed disks. Azure
**Reserved Instances (RI)** | This property helps you specify if you have [Reserved Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/) in Azure, cost estimations in the assessment are then done taking into RI discounts. Reserved instances are currently only supported for Pay-As-You-Go offer in Azure Migrate.
**Sizing criterion** | The criterion to be used to right-size VMs for Azure. You can either do *performance-based* sizing or size the VMs *as on-premises*, without considering the performance history.
**Performance history** | The duration to consider for evaluating the performance data of machines. This property is only applicable when sizing criterion is *performance-based*.
**Percentile utilization** | The percentile value of the performance sample set to be considered for right-sizing. This property is only applicable when sizing is *performance-based*.
**VM series** | 	You can specify the VM series that you would like to consider for right-sizing. For example, if you have a production environment that you do not plan to migrate to A-series VMs in Azure, you can exclude A-series from the list or series and the right-sizing is done only in the selected series.
**Comfort factor** | Azure Migrate Server Assessment considers a buffer (comfort factor) during assessment. This buffer is applied on top of machine utilization data for VMs (CPU, memory, disk, and network). The comfort factor accounts for issues such as seasonal usage, short performance history, and likely increases in future usage.<br/><br/> For example, a 10-core VM with 20% utilization normally results in a 2-core VM. However, with a comfort factor of 2.0x, the result is a 4-core VM instead.
**Offer** | The [Azure offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/) you're enrolled to. Azure Migrate estimates the cost accordingly.
**Currency** | Billing currency.
**Discount (%)** | Any subscription-specific discount you receive on top of the Azure offer.<br/> The default setting is 0%.
**VM uptime** | If your VMs are not going to be running 24x7 in Azure, you can specify the duration (number of days per month and number of hours per day) for which they would be running and the cost estimations would be done accordingly.<br/> The default value is 31 days per month and 24 hours per day.
**Azure Hybrid Benefit** | Specify whether you have software assurance and are eligible for [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/). If set to Yes, non-Windows Azure prices are considered for Windows VMs. Default is Yes.


## Edit assessment properties

To edit assessment properties after creating an assessment, do the following:

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click **Servers**.
2. In **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, click the assessments count.
3. In **Assessment**, click the relevant assessment > **Edit properties**.
5. Customize the assessment properties in accordance with the table above.
6. Click **Save** to update the assessment.


You can also edit assessment properties when you're creating an assessment.
