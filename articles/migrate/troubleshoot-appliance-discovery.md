# Troubleshoot the Azure Migrate appliance and discovery

This article helps you troubleshoot issues when deploying the [Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md) appliance, and using the appliance to discover on-premises servers.

## What's supported?

[Review](migrate-appliance.md) the appliance support requirements.

## "Invalid OVF manifest entry"

If you receive the error "The provided manifest file is invalid: Invalid OVF manifest entry", do the following:

1. Verify that the Azure Migrate appliance OVA file is downloaded correctly by checking its hash value. [Learn more](./tutorial-discover-vmware.md). If the hash value doesn't match, download the OVA file again and retry the deployment.
2. If deployment still fails, and you're using the VMware vSphere client to deploy the OVF file, try deploying it through the vSphere web client. If deployment still fails, try using a different web browser.
3. If you're using the vSphere web client and trying to deploy it on vCenter Server 6.5 or 6.7, try to deploy the OVA directly on the ESXi host:
   - Connect to the ESXi host directly (instead of vCenter Server) with the web client (https://<*host IP Address*>/ui).
   - In **Home** > **Inventory**, select **File** > **Deploy OVF template**. Browse to the OVA and complete the deployment.
4. If the deployment still fails, contact Azure Migrate support.

## Can't connect to the internet

This can happen if the appliance server is behind a proxy.

- Make sure you provide the authorization credentials if the proxy needs them.
- If you're using a URL-based firewall proxy to control outbound connectivity, add [these URLs](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) to an allowlist.
- If you're using an intercepting proxy to connect to the internet, import the proxy certificate onto the appliance using [these steps](./migrate-appliance.md).

## Can't sign into Azure from the appliance web app

The error "Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in" appears if you're using the incorrect Azure account to sign into Azure. This error occurs for a couple of reasons:

- If you sign into the appliance web application for the public cloud, using user account credentials for the Government cloud portal.
- If you sign into the appliance web application for the government cloud using user account credentials for the private cloud portal.

Ensure you're using the correct credentials.

## Date/time synchronization error

An error about date and time synchronization (802) indicates that the server clock might be out of synchronization with the current time by more than five minutes. Change the clock time on the collector server to match the current time:

1. Open an admin command prompt on the server.
2. To check the time zone, run **w32tm /tz**.
3. To synchronize the time, run **w32tm /resync**.

## "UnableToConnectToServer"

If you get this connection error, you might be unable to connect to vCenter Server *Servername*.com:9443. The error details indicate that there's no endpoint listening at `https://\*servername*.com:9443/sdk` that can accept the message.

- Check whether you're running the latest version of the appliance. If you're not, upgrade the appliance to the [latest version](./migrate-appliance.md).
- If the issue still occurs in the latest version, the appliance might be unable to resolve the specified vCenter Server name, or the specified port might be wrong. By default, if the port is not specified, the collector will try to connect to port number 443.

    1. Ping *Servername*.com from the appliance.
    2. If step 1 fails, try to connect to the vCenter server using the IP address.
    3. Identify the correct port number to connect to vCenter Server.
    4. Verify that vCenter Server is up and running.

## Error 60052/60039: Appliance might not be registered

- Error 60052, "The appliance might not be registered successfully to the project" occurs if the Azure account used to register the appliance has insufficient permissions.
    - Make sure that the Azure user account used to register the appliance has at least Contributor permissions on the subscription.
    - [Learn more](./migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) about required Azure roles and permissions.
- Error 60039, "The appliance might not be registered successfully to the project" can occur if registration fails because the project used to the register the appliance can't be found.
    - In the Azure portal and check whether the project exists in the resource group.
    - If the project doesn't exist, create a new project in your resource group and register the appliance again. [Learn how to](./create-manage-projects.md#create-a-project-for-the-first-time) create a new project.

## Error 60030/60031: Key Vault management operation failed

If you receive the error 60030 or 60031, "An Azure Key Vault management operation failed", do the following:

- Make sure the Azure user account used to register the appliance has at least Contributor permissions on the subscription.
- Make sure the account has access to the key vault specified in the error message, and then retry the operation.
- If the issue persists, contact Microsoft support.
- [Learn more](./migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) about the required Azure roles and permissions.

## Error 60028: Discovery couldn't be initiated

Error 60028: "Discovery couldn't be initiated because of an error. The operation failed for the specified list of hosts or clusters" indicates that discovery couldn't be started on the hosts listed in the error because of a problem in accessing or retrieving server information. The rest of the hosts were successfully added.

- Add the hosts listed in the error again, using the **Add host** option.
- If there's a validation error, review the remediation guidance to fix the errors, and then try the **Save and start discovery** option again.

## Error 60025: Azure AD operation failed

Error 60025: "An Azure AD operation failed. The error occurred while creating or updating the Azure AD application" occurs when the Azure user account used to initiate the discovery is different from the account used to register the appliance. Do one of the following:

- Ensure that the user account initiating the discovery is same as the one used to register the appliance.
- Provide Azure Active Directory application access permissions to the user account for which the discovery operation is failing.
- Delete the resource group previously created for the project. Create another resource group to start again.
- [Learn more](./migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) about Azure Active Directory application permissions.

## Error 50004: Can't connect to host or cluster

Error 50004: "Can't connect to a host or cluster because the server name can't be resolved. WinRM error code: 0x803381B9" might occur if the Azure DNS service for the appliance can't resolve the cluster or host name you provided.

- If you see this error on the cluster, cluster FQDN.
- You might also see this error for hosts in a cluster. This indicates that the appliance can connect to the cluster, but the cluster returns host names that aren't FQDNs. To resolve this error, update the hosts file on the appliance by adding a mapping of the IP address and host names:
    1. Open Notepad as an admin.
    2. Open the C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts file.
    3. Add the IP address and host name in a row. Repeat for each host or cluster where you see this error.
    4. Save and close the hosts file.
    5. Check whether the appliance can connect to the hosts, using the appliance management app. After 30 minutes, you should see the latest information for these hosts in the Azure portal.

## Error 60001: Unable to connect to server

- Ensure there is connectivity from the appliance to the server
- If it is a linux server, ensure password-based authentication is enabled using the following steps:
    1. Log in to the linux server and open the ssh configuration file using the command 'vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
    2. Set "PasswordAuthentication" option to yes. Save the file.
    3. Restart ssh service by running "service sshd restart"
- If it is a windows server, ensure the port 5985 is open to allow for remote WMI calls.
- If you are discovering a GCP linux server and using a root user, use the following commands to change the default setting for root login
    1. Log in to the linux server and open the ssh configuration file using the command 'vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
    2. Set "PermitRootLogin" option to yes.
    3. Restart ssh service by running "service sshd restart"

## Error: No suitable authentication method found

Ensure password-based authentication is enabled on the linux server using the following steps:
    1. Log in to the linux server and open the ssh configuration file using the command 'vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
    2. Set "PasswordAuthentication" option to yes. Save the file.
    3. Restart ssh service by running "service sshd restart"

## Discovered servers not in portal

If discovery state is "Discovery in progress", but don't yet see the servers in the portal, wait a few minutes:

- It takes around 15 minutes for a server on VMware.
- It takes around two minutes for each added host for servers on Hyper-V discovery.

If you wait and the state doesn't change, select **Refresh** on the **Servers** tab. This should show the count of the discovered servers in Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration.

If this doesn't work and you're discovering VMware servers:

- Verify that the vCenter account you specified has permissions set correctly, with access to at least one server.
- Azure Migrate can't discover servers on VMware if the vCenter account has access granted at vCenter VM folder level. [Learn more](set-discovery-scope.md) about scoping discovery.

## Server data not in portal

If discovered servers don't appear in the portal or if the server data is outdated, wait a few minutes. It takes up to 30 minutes for changes in discovered server configuration data to appear in the portal. It may take a few hours for changes in software inventory data to appear. If there's no data after this time, try refreshing, as follows

1. In **Windows, Linux and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Agent Health**.
3. Select **Refresh agent**.
4. Wait for the refresh operation to complete. You should now see up-to-date information.

## Deleted servers appear in portal

If you delete servers and they still appear in the portal, wait 30 minutes. If they still appear, refresh as described above.

## Discovered software inventory and SQL Server instances and databases not in portal

After you have initiated discovery on the appliance, it may take up to 24 hours to start showing the inventory data in the portal.

If you have not provided Windows authentication or SQL Server authentication credentials on the appliance configuration manager, then add the credentials so that the appliance can use them to connect to respective SQL Server instances.

Once connected, appliance gathers configuration and performance data of SQL Server instances and databases. The SQL Server configuration data is updated once every 24 hours and the performance data is captured every 30 seconds. Hence any change to the properties of the SQL Server instance and databases such as database status, compatibility level etc. can take up to 24 hours to update on the portal.

## SQL Server instance is showing up in "Not connected" state on portal

To view the issues encountered during discovery of SQL Server instances and databases please click on "Not connected" status in connection status column on 'Discovered servers' page in your project.

Creating assessment on top of servers containing SQL instances that were not discovered completely or are in not connected state, may lead to readiness being marked as "unknown".

## I do not see performance data for some network adapters on my physical servers

This can happen if the physical server has Hyper-V virtualization enabled. Due to a product gap, the network throughput is captured on the virtual network adapters discovered.

## Error: The file uploaded is not in the expected format

Some tools have regional settings that create the CSV file with semi-colon as a delimiter. Please change the settings to ensure the delimiter is a comma.

## I imported a CSV but I see "Discovery is in progress"

This status appears if your CSV upload failed due to a validation failure. Try to import the CSV again. You can download the error report of the previous upload and follow the remediation guidance in the file to fix the errors. The error report can be downloaded from the 'Import Details' section on 'Discover servers' page.

## Do not see software inventory details even after updating guest credentials

The software inventory discovery runs once every 24 hours. If you would like to see the details immediately, refresh as follows. This may take a few minutes depending on the no. of servers discovered.

1. In **Windows, Linux and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Agent Health**.
3. Select **Refresh agent**.
4. Wait for the refresh operation to complete. You should now see up-to-date information.

## Unable to export software inventory

Ensure the user downloading the inventory from the portal has Contributor privileges on the subscription.

## No suitable authentication method found to complete authentication (publickey)

Key based authentication will not work, use password authentication.

## Common app discovery errors

Azure Migrate supports discovery of software inventory, using Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment. App discovery is currently supported for VMware only. [Learn more](how-to-discover-applications.md) about the requirements and steps for setting up app discovery.

## Next steps

Set up an appliance for [VMware](how-to-set-up-appliance-vmware.md), [Hyper-V](how-to-set-up-appliance-hyper-v.md), or [physical servers](how-to-set-up-appliance-physical.md).
