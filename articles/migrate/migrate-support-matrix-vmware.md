# Support matrix for VMware assessment and migration

You can use [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) to assess and migrate machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This article summarizes support settings and limitations for assessing and migrating on-premises VMware VMs.


## VMware scenarios

The table summarizes supported scenarios for VMware VMs.

**Deployment** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Assess on-premises VMware VMs** | [Set up](tutorial-prepare-vmware.md) your first assessment.<br/><br/> [Run](scale-vmware-assessment.md) a large-scale assessment.
**Migrate VMware VMs** | You can migrate using agentless migration, or use an agent-based migration. [Learn more](server-migrate-overview.md)


## Azure Migrate projects

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Azure permissions** | You need Contributor or Owner permissions in the subscription to create an Azure Migrate project.
**VMware limitations**  | Assess up to 35,000 VMware VMs in a single project. You can create multiple projects in an Azure subscription. A project can include both VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs, up to the assessment limits.
**Geography** | You can create an Azure Migrate project in a number of geographies. Although you can only create projects in these geographies, you can assess or migrate machines for other target locations. The project geography is only used to store the discovered metadata.

**Geography** | **Metadata storage location**

## Assessment-vCenter Server requirements

This table summarizes assessment support and limitations for VMware virtualization servers.

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**vCenter server** | VMware VMs you want to assess must be managed by one or more vCenter Servers running 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, or 6.7.

## Assessment-vCenter Server permissions

For assessment, you need a read-only account for the vCenter Server.

## Assessment-appliance requirements

Azure Migrate runs a lightweight appliance to discover VMware VMs, and send VM metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate. Appliance for VMware is deployed using an OVA template imported into vCenter Server. The following table summarizes the appliance requirements.

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Appliance deployment** | You deploy the appliance as a VMware VM. You need enough resources on the vCenter Server to allocate a VM with 32 GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, around 80 GB of disk storage, and an external virtual switch.<br/><br/> The appliance requires internet access, either directly or through a proxy.<br/> The appliance VM must be deployed on an ESXi host running version 5.5 or later.
**Azure Migrate project** | An appliance can be associated with a single project. <br/> Any number of appliances can be associated with a single project.<br/> You can assess up to 35,000 VMs in a project.
**Discovery** | An appliance can discover up to 10,000 VMware VMs on a vCenter Server.<br/> An appliance can connect to a single vCenter Server.
**Assessment group** | You can add up to 35,000 machines in a single group.
**Assessment** | You can assess up to 35,000 VMs in a single assessment.


## Assessment-URL access requirements

The Azure Migrate appliance needs connectivity to the internet.

- When you deploy the appliance, Azure Migrate does a connectivity check to the URLs summarized in the table below.
- If you're using a URL-based proxy to connect to the internet, allow access to these URLs, making sure that the proxy resolves any CNAME records received while looking up the URLs.

**URL** | **Details**  
--- | --- |
*.portal.azure.com  | Navigate to the Azure Migrate in the Azure portal.
*.windows.net <br/> *.msftauth.net <br/> *.msauth.net <br/> *.microsoft.com <br/> *.live.com | Log into your Azure subscription.

vCenter server | Inbound connections on TCP port 443 to allow the appliance to collect configuration and performance metadata for assessments. <br/><br/> The appliance connects to vCenter on port 443 by default. If the vCenter server listens on a different port, you can modify the port when you set up discovery.

## Migration - limitations
You can select up to 10 VMs at once for replication. If you want to migrate more machines, then replicate in groups of 10. For VMware agentless migration, you can run up to 100 replications simultaneously.
