# Azure security baseline for Azure Migrate

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Migrate. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Migrate. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Migrate have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Migrate completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Migrate security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate uses Azure Active Directory (Azure
AD) as the default identity and access management service. You should
standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access
management in:

- Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the
     Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machine (Linux and Windows),
     Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.

- Your organization's resources, such as
     applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Securing Azure AD should be a high priority in your organization’s
cloud security practice. Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you
assess identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice
recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches
best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security
posture.

Azure AD supports external identity that allows users
without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with
their external identity.

- [Tenancy in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps.md) 

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) 

- [Use external identity providers for application](/azure/active-directory/b2b/identity-providers) 

- [What is the identity secure score in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/identity-secure-score.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate uses Azure Active Directory to provide identity and access management to Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. This enables single sign-on (SSO) to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications, and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility and control.

- [Understand Application SSO with Azure AD](../active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate uses Azure Active Directory that supports strong authentication controls through multifactor authentication, and strong passwordless methods.

Multifactor authentication - Enable Azure AD multifactor authentication and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your multifactor authentication setup. Multifactor authentication can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.

Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method is used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

- [Eliminate bad passwords using Azure AD Password Protection](../active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate is integrated with Azure Active Directory in which provides the following data sources:

- Sign-ins - The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

- Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

- Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone      who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

These data sources can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third-party SIEM systems.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate uses Azure RBAC to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged access to the subscriptions and management groups they are in.

Ensure that you also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

- [Management Group Access](../governance/management-groups/overview.md#management-group-access) 

- [Azure subscription administrators](../cost-management-billing/manage/add-change-subscription-administrator.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate uses Azure Active Directory accounts to manage its resources, review user accounts and access assignment regularly to ensure the accounts and their access are valid. You can use Azure AD access reviews to review group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. Azure AD reporting can provide logs to help discover stale accounts. You can also use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to create access review report workflow to facilitate the review process.

In addition, Azure Privileged Identity Management can also be configured to alert when an excessive number of administrator accounts are created, and to identify administrator accounts that are stale or improperly configured.

Some Azure services support local users and roles which not managed through Azure AD. You will need to manage these users separately.

- [How to use Azure AD identity and access reviews](../active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-4: Set up emergency access in Azure AD

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate uses Azure Active Directory to manage its resources. To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.

- [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-5: Automate entitlement management 

**Guidance**: Azure
Migrate is integrated with Azure Active Directory to manage its resources. Use
Azure AD entitlement management features to automate access request workflows,
including access assignments, reviews, and expiration. Dual or multi-stage
approval is also supported.

- [What is Azure AD entitlement management](../active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. Use highly secured user workstations and/or Azure Bastion for administrative tasks. Use Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and/or Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, restricted logical and network access.

- [Deploy a privileged access workstation](../active-directory/devices/howto-azure-managed-workstation.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate is integrated with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-data-protection).*

### DP-2: Protect sensitive data

**Guidance**: The Server Migration tool in Azure Migrate replicates data from the disks of servers being migrated to storage accounts and managed disks in your Azure subscription. Data handling is transient till it is written to storage accounts or managed disks in the subscription, and is not persisted in Azure Migrate

Protect sensitive data stored on storage accounts and managed disks by restricting access using Azure Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC) and network-based access controls, and specific controls in Azure services (such as Storage Service Encryption for Managed Disks). 

For the underlying platform, which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guards against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented some default data protection controls and capabilities.

- [Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md) 

- [Understand customer data protection in Azure](../security/fundamentals/protection-customer-data.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### DP-5: Encrypt sensitive data at rest

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate does not persist any sensitive data. All data persisted in Azure Migrate is encrypted at rest with Microsoft-managed keys.

The Server Migration tool in Azure Migrate replicates data from the disks of servers being migrated to storage accounts and managed disks in your Azure subscription. The disks may or may not contain sensitive data. Data handling is transient till it is written to storage accounts or managed disks in the subscription, and is not persisted in Azure Migrate. Replicated data on the storage account and managed disks is encrypted at rest with Microsoft-managed keys. For highly sensitive data, you have options to implement additional encryption at rest with customer-managed keys on the storage account and managed disks.

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

- [Overview of Azure Management Groups](../governance/management-groups/overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-2: Ensure security team has access to asset inventory and metadata

**Guidance**: Apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production.

Azure Migrate does not allow running an application or installation of software on its resources.

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-protection).*

### LT-2: Enable threat detection for Azure identity and access management

**Guidance**: Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

- Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

- Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you to have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

- [Threat protection in Azure Security Center](/azure/security-center/threat-protection)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-4: Enable logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Azure Migrate currently does not produce Azure resource logs.

Activity logs, which are automatically available, contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your Azure Migrate resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

- [Understand logging and different log types in Azure](../azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-5: Centralize security log management and analysis

**Guidance**: Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation. For each log source, ensure you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements.

Ensure you are integrating Azure activity logs into your central logging. Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

In addition, enable and onboard data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

Many organizations choose to use Azure Sentinel for “hot” data that is used frequently and Azure Storage for “cold” data that is used less frequently.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-2: Preparation – setup incident notification

**Guidance**: Set up security incident contact information in Azure Security Center. This contact information is used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. You also have options to customize incident alert and notification in different Azure services based on your incident response needs. 

- [How to set the Azure Security Center security contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high-quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High-quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high-quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

- [How to configure export](../security-center/continuous-export.md)

- [How to stream alerts into Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/connect-azure-security-center.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

### GS-6: Define identity and privileged access strategy

**Guidance**: Establish an Azure identity and privileged access approaches as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	A centralized identity and authentication system and its interconnectivity with other internal and external identity systems

-	Strong authentication methods in different use cases and conditions

-	Protection of highly privileged users

-	Anomaly user activities monitoring and handling  

-	User identity and access review and reconciliation process

### GS-7: Define logging and threat response strategy

**Guidance**: Establish a logging and threat response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats while meeting compliance requirements. Prioritize providing analysts with high-quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than integration and manual steps. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs

-	Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native Azure capabilities, and other sources 

-	Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest

-	Use of Azure native and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication

-	Processes for handling incidents and post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention
