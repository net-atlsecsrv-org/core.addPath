# Azure security baseline for Azure Database for MariaDB

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Database for MariaDB. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Database for MariaDB. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Database for MariaDB, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Azure Database for MariaDB completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Database for MariaDB security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Configure Private Link for Azure Database for MariaDB with Private Endpoints. Private Link allows you to connect to various PaaS services in Azure via a private endpoint. Azure Private Link essentially brings Azure services inside your private Virtual Network (VNet). Traffic between your virtual network and MariaDB instance travels the Microsoft backbone network.

Alternatively, you may use Virtual Network Service Endpoints to protect and limit network access to your Azure Database for MariaDB implementations. Virtual network rules are one firewall security feature that controls whether your Azure Database for MariaDB accepts communications that are sent from particular subnets in virtual networks.

You may also secure your Azure Database for MariaDB with firewall rules. The server firewall prevents all access to your database server until you specify which computers have permission. To configure your firewall, you create firewall rules that specify ranges of acceptable IP addresses. You can create firewall rules at the server level.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: The [Azure Security Benchmark](/azure/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark) is the default policy initiative for Security Center and is the foundation for [Security Center's recommendations](/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations). The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/azure/security-center/azure-defender) plan for the related services.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: When your Azure Database for MariaDB server is secured to a private endpoint, you can deploy virtual machines in the same virtual network. You can use a network security group (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: For resources that need access to your Azure Database for MariaDB instances, use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., SQL.WestUs) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

Azure Database for MariaDB uses the "Microsoft.Sql" service tag.

### 7.12: Manage identities securely and automatically

**Guidance**: Azure Database for MariaDB server currently does not support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication to access databases. While creating the Azure Database for MariaDB server, you provide credentials for an administrator user. This administrator can be used to create additional MariaDB users.

For Azure Virtual Machines or web applications running on Azure App Service being used to access your Azure Database for MariaDB server, use Managed Identities in conjunction with Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve credentials for Azure Database for MariaDB server. Ensure Key Vault Soft Delete is enabled.

Use Managed Identities to provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. Managed Identities allows you to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

**Guidance**: Azure Database for MariaDB takes full, differential, and transaction log backups.  Azure Database for MariaDB automatically creates server backups and stores them in user configured locally redundant or geo-redundant storage. Backups can be used to restore your server to a point-in-time. Backup and restore are an essential part of any business continuity strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion.  The default backup retention period is seven days. You can optionally configure it up to 35 days. All backups are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption.

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Azure Database for MariaDB automatically creates server backups and stores them in user configured locally redundant or geo-redundant storage. Backups can be used to restore your server to a point-in-time.  Backup and restore are an essential part of any business continuity strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion.

If using Key Vault for client-side data encryption for data stored in your MariaDB server, ensure regular automated backups of your keys.

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: In Azure Database for MariaDB, perform a restore from the original server's backups for periodic testing of backups. There are two types of restore available: Point-in-time restore and Geo-restore. Point-in-time restore is available with either backup redundancy option and creates a new server in the same region as your original server. Geo-restore is available only if you configured your server for geo-redundant storage and it allows you to restore your server to a different region.

The estimated time of recovery depends on several factors including the database sizes, the transaction log size, the network bandwidth, and the total number of databases recovering in the same region at the same time. The recovery time is usually less than 12 hours.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the metric used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions using tags, and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
