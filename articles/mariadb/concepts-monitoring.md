# Monitoring in Azure Database for MariaDB
Monitoring data about your servers helps you troubleshoot and optimize for your workload. Azure Database for MariaDB provides various metrics that give insight into the behavior of your server.

## Metrics
All Azure metrics have a one-minute frequency, and each metric provides 30 days of history. You can configure alerts on the metrics. Other tasks include setting up automated actions, performing advanced analytics, and archiving history. For more information, see the [Azure Metrics Overview](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics.md).

For step by step guidance, see [How to set up alerts](howto-alert-metric.md).

### List of metrics
These metrics are available for Azure Database for MariaDB:

|Metric|Metric Display Name|Unit|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|cpu_percent|CPU percent|Percent|The percentage of CPU in use.|
|memory_percent|Memory percent|Percent|The percentage of memory in use.|
|io_consumption_percent|IO percent|Percent|The percentage of IO in use. (Not applicable for Basic tier servers)|
|storage_percent|Storage percentage|Percent|The percentage of storage used out of the server's maximum.|
|storage_used|Storage used|Bytes|The amount of storage in use. The storage used by the service may include the database files, transaction logs, and the server logs.|
|serverlog_storage_percent|Server Log storage percent|Percent|The percentage of server log storage used out of the server's maximum server log storage.|
|serverlog_storage_usage|Server Log storage used|Bytes|The amount of server log storage in use.|
|serverlog_storage_limit|Server Log storage limit|Bytes|The maximum server log storage for this server.|
|storage_limit|Storage limit|Bytes|The maximum storage for this server.|
|active_connections|Active Connections|Count|The number of active connections to the server.|
|connections_failed|Failed Connections|Count|The number of failed connections to the server.|
|seconds_behind_master|Replication lag in seconds|Count|The number of seconds the replica server is lagging against the master server. (Not applicable for Basic tier servers)|
|network_bytes_egress|Network Out|Bytes|Network Out across active connections.|
|network_bytes_ingress|Network In|Bytes|Network In across active connections.|
|backup_storage_used|Backup Storage Used|Bytes|The amount of backup storage used. This metric represents the sum of storage consumed by all the full database backups, differential backups, and log backups retained based on the backup retention period set for the server. The frequency of the backups is service managed and explained in the [concepts article](concepts-backup.md). For geo-redundant storage, backup storage usage is twice that of the locally redundant storage.|

## Server logs

You can enable slow query logging on your server. These logs are also available through Azure Diagnostic Logs in Azure Monitor logs, Event Hubs, and Storage Account. To learn more about logging, visit theÂ [server logs](concepts-server-logs.md) page.

## Query Store

[Query Store](concepts-query-store.md) keeps track of query performance over time including query runtime statistics and wait events. The feature persists query runtime performance information in the **mysql** schema. You can control the collection and storage of data via various configuration knobs.

## Query Performance Insight

[Query Performance Insight](concepts-query-performance-insight.md) works in conjunction with Query Store to provide visualizations accessible from the Azure portal. These charts enable you to identify key queries that impact performance. Query Performance Insight is accessible in the **Intelligent Performance** section of your Azure Database for MariaDB server's portal page.

## Performance Recommendations

The [Performance Recommendations](concepts-performance-recommendations.md) feature identifies opportunities to improve workload performance. Performance Recommendations provides you with recommendations for creating new indexes that have the potential to improve the performance of your workloads. To produce index recommendations, the feature takes into consideration various database characteristics, including its schema and the workload as reported by Query Store. After implementing any performance recommendation, customers should test performance to evaluate the impact of those changes.

## Planned maintenance notification

**Planned maintenance notifications** allow you to receive alerts for upcoming planned maintenance to your Azure Database for MariaDB. These notifications are integrated with [Service Health's](../service-health/overview.md) planned maintenance and allow you to view all scheduled maintenance for your subscriptions in one place. It also helps to scale the notification to the right audiences for different resource groups, as you may have different contacts responsible for different resources. You will receive the notification about the upcoming maintenance 72 hours before the event.

> [!Note]
> We will make every attempt to provide **Planned maintenance notification** 72 hours notice for all events. However, in cases of critical or security patches, notifications might be sent closer to the event or be omitted.

### To receive planned maintenance notification

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Service Health**.
2. In the **Alerts** section, select **Health alerts**.
3. Select **+ Add service health alert** and fill in the fields.
4. Fill out the required fields. 
5. Choose the **Event type**, select **Planned maintenance** or **Select all**
6. In **Action groups** define how you would like to receive the alert (get an email, trigger a logic app etc.)  
7. Ensure Enable rule upon creation is set to Yes.
8. Select **Create alert rule** to complete your alert

For detailed steps on how to create **service health alerts**, refer to [Create activity log alerts on service notifications](../service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Planned maintenance notifications are currently available in preview in all regions **except** West Central US
