# What is Azure Database for MariaDB?

Azure Database for MariaDB is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud. Azure Database for MariaDB is based on the [MariaDB community edition](https://mariadb.org/download/) (available under the GPLv2 license) database engine, version 10.2 and 10.3.

Azure Database for MariaDB delivers:

- Built-in high availability with no additional cost.
- Predictable performance, using inclusive pay-as-you-go pricing.

- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

These capabilities require almost no administration. They're provided at no additional cost. Azure Database for MariaDB can help you rapidly develop your app and accelerate your time to market. You don't have to allocate precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure. You can also continue to develop your application by using the open-source tools and platform of your choice.

## Adjust performance and scale within seconds

The Azure Database for MariaDB service offers several service tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier offers different performance and capabilities to support lightweight to heavyweight database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, and then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability helps your database transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You pay only for the resources you need, and only when you need them. SeeÂ [Pricing tiers](concepts-pricing-tiers.md) for details.

## Monitoring and alerting

How do you decide when to scale up or down? You can use the built-in performance monitoring and alerting features of Azure Database for MariaDB, combined with the performance ratings based on vCores. By using these tools, you can quickly assess the effect of scaling vCores up or down based on your current or projected performance needs. See [Alerts](howto-alert-metric.md) for details.

## Keep your app and business running

Azure's industry-leading 99.99% availability SLA is powered by a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. The network helps keep your app running 24/7. You benefit from the built-in security, fault tolerance, and data protection in Azure Database for MariaDB. With Azure Database for MariaDB, you can use point-in-time restore to recover a server to an earlier state, as far back as 35 days.
