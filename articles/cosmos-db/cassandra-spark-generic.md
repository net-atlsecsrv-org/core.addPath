# Connect to Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API from Spark
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-cassandra-api](includes/appliesto-cassandra-api.md)]

This article is one among a series of articles on Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API integration from Spark. The articles cover connectivity, Data Definition Language(DDL) operations, basic Data Manipulation Language(DML) operations, and advanced Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API integration from Spark. 

## Prerequisites
* [Provision an Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API account.](create-cassandra-dotnet.md#create-a-database-account)

* Provision your choice of Spark environment [[Azure Databricks](/azure/databricks/scenarios/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal) | [Azure HDInsight-Spark](../hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql.md) | Others].

## Dependencies for connectivity
* **Spark connector for Cassandra:**
  Spark connector is used to connect to Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API.  Identify and use the version of the connector located in [Maven central]( https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.datastax.spark/spark-cassandra-connector) that is compatible with the Spark and Scala versions of your Spark environment.

* **Azure Cosmos DB helper library for Cassandra API:**
  In addition to the Spark connector, you need another library called [azure-cosmos-cassandra-spark-helper]( https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb/azure-cosmos-cassandra-spark-helper/1.0.0/jar) from Azure Cosmos DB. This library contains custom connection factory and retry policy classes.

  The retry policy in Azure Cosmos DB is configured to handle HTTP status code 429("Request Rate Large") exceptions. The Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API translates these exceptions into overloaded errors on the Cassandra native protocol, and you can retry with back-offs. Because Azure Cosmos DB uses provisioned throughput model, request rate limiting exceptions occur when the ingress/egress rates increase. The retry policy protects your spark jobs against data spikes that momentarily exceed the throughput allocated for your container.

  > [!NOTE] 
  > The retry policy can protect your spark jobs against momentary spikes only. If you have not configured enough RUs required to run your workload, then the retry policy is not applicable and the retry policy class rethrows the exception.

* **Azure Cosmos DB account connection details:** Your Azure Cassandra API account name, account endpoint, and key.
    
## Spark connector throughput configuration parameters

The following table lists Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API-specific throughput configuration parameters provided by the connector. For a detailed list of all configuration parameters, see [configuration reference](https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/blob/master/doc/reference.md) page of the Spark Cassandra Connector GitHub repository.

| **Property Name** | **Default value** | **Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| spark.cassandra.output.batch.size.rows |  1 |Number of rows per single batch. Set this parameter to 1. This parameter is used to achieve higher throughput for heavy workloads. |
| spark.cassandra.connection.connections_per_executor_max  | None | Maximum number of connections per node per executor. 10*n is equivalent to 10 connections per node in an n-node Cassandra cluster. So, if you require 5 connections per node per executor for a 5 node Cassandra cluster, then you should set this configuration to 25. Modify this value based on the degree of parallelism or the number of executors that your spark jobs are configured for.   |
| spark.cassandra.output.concurrent.writes  |  100 | Defines the number of parallel writes that can occur per executor. Because you set "batch.size.rows" to 1, make sure to scale up this value accordingly. Modify this value based on the degree of parallelism or the throughput that you want to achieve for your workload. |
| spark.cassandra.concurrent.reads |  512 | Defines the number of parallel reads that can occur per executor. Modify this value based on the degree of parallelism or the throughput that you want to achieve for your workload  |
| spark.cassandra.output.throughput_mb_per_sec  | None | Defines the total write throughput per executor. This parameter can be used as an upper limit for your spark job throughput, and base it on the provisioned throughput of your Cosmos container.   |
| spark.cassandra.input.reads_per_sec| None   | Defines the total read throughput per executor. This parameter can be used as an upper limit for your spark job throughput, and base it on the provisioned throughput of your Cosmos container.  |
| spark.cassandra.output.batch.grouping.buffer.size |  1000  | Defines the number of batches per single spark task that can be stored in memory before sending to Cassandra API |
| spark.cassandra.connection.keep_alive_ms | 60000 | Defines the period of time until which unused connections are available. | 

Adjust the throughput and degree of parallelism of these parameters based on the workload you expect for your spark jobs, and the throughput you have provisioned for your Cosmos DB account.

## Connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API from Spark

### cqlsh
The following commands detail how to connect to Azure CosmosDB Cassandra API from cqlsh.  This is useful for validation as you run through the samples in Spark.<br>
**From Linux/Unix/Mac:**

```bash
export SSL_VERSION=TLSv1_2
export SSL_VALIDATE=false
cqlsh.py YOUR-COSMOSDB-ACCOUNT-NAME.cassandra.cosmosdb.azure.com 10350 -u YOUR-COSMOSDB-ACCOUNT-NAME -p YOUR-COSMOSDB-ACCOUNT-KEY --ssl
```

### 3.  Spark environment in general
While the sections above were specific to Azure Spark-based PaaS services, this section covers any general Spark environment.  Connector dependencies, imports, and Spark session configuration are detailed below. The "Next steps" section covers code samples for DDL operations, DML operations and more.  

#### Connector dependencies:

1. Add the maven coordinates to get the [Cassandra connector for Spark](cassandra-spark-generic.md#dependencies-for-connectivity)
2. Add the maven coordinates for the [Azure Cosmos DB helper library](cassandra-spark-generic.md#dependencies-for-connectivity) for Cassandra API

#### Imports:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra._
//Spark connector
import com.datastax.spark.connector._
import com.datastax.spark.connector.cql.CassandraConnector

//CosmosDB library for multiple retry
import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.cassandra
```

#### Spark session configuration:

```scala
//Connection-related
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.host","YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME.cassandra.cosmosdb.azure.com")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.port","10350")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.ssl.enabled","true")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.auth.username","YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.auth.password","YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.factory", "com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.cassandra.CosmosDbConnectionFactory")

//Throughput-related. You can adjust the values as needed
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.output.batch.size.rows", "1")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.connections_per_executor_max", "10")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.output.concurrent.writes", "1000")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.concurrent.reads", "512")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.output.batch.grouping.buffer.size", "1000")
spark.conf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.keep_alive_ms", "600000000")
```
