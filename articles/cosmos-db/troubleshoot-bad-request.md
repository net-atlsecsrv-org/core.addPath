# Diagnose and troubleshoot bad request exceptions in Azure Cosmos DB
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

The HTTP status code 400 represents the request contains invalid data or it's missing required parameters.

## <a name="missing-id-property"></a>Missing the ID property
On this scenario, it's common to see the error:

*The input content is invalid because the required properties - 'id; ' - are missing*

A response with this error means the JSON document that is being sent to the service is lacking the required ID property.

### Solution
Specify an `id` property with a string value as per the [REST specification](/rest/api/cosmos-db/documents) as part of your document, the SDKs do not autogenerate values for this property.

## <a name="invalid-partition-key-type"></a>Invalid partition key type
On this scenario, it's common to see errors like:

*Partition key ... is invalid.*

A response with this error means the partition key value is of an invalid type.

### Solution
The value of the partition key should be a string or a number, make sure the value is of the expected types.

## <a name="wrong-partition-key-value"></a>Wrong partition key value
On this scenario, it's common to see the error:

*PartitionKey extracted from document doesnâ€™t match the one specified in the header*

A response with this error means you are executing an operation and passing a partition key value that does not match the document's body value for the expected property. If the collection's partition key path is `/myPartitionKey`, the document has a property called `myPartitionKey` with a value that does not match what was provided as partition key value when calling the SDK method.

### Solution
Send the partition key value parameter that matches the document property value.
