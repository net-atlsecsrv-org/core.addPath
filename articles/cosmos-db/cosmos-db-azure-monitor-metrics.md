# Monitor and debug Azure Cosmos DB metrics from Azure Monitor

You can view Azure Cosmos DB metrics from Azure Monitor API. Azure Monitor provides several ways to interact with metrics, including the Azure portal, accessing them through the REST API, or querying them using PowerShell or CLI. Azure Cosmos DB metrics are low-latency numerical values, collected at one-minute frequency by default, you can also aggregate these metrics. These metrics are capable of supporting real-time scenarios.  

This article describes different Azure Cosmos DB metrics you can view from Azure Monitor using Azure portal. If you are interested in common use cases and how Azure Cosmos DB metrics re used to analyze and debug these issues see [Monitor and debug with metrics in Azure Cosmos DB](use-metrics.md) article. You will use one of your existing Azure Cosmos accounts and view the different metrics at the database, container, region, request, or operation levels. So, make sure you have an Azure Cosmos account with sample data and perform CRUD operations on that data.

## View metrics from Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **Monitor** from the left-hand navigation bar, and select **Metrics**.

   ![Metrics pane in Azure Monitor](./media/cosmos-db-azure-monitor-metrics/monitor-metrics-blade.png)

1. From the **Metrics** pane > **Select a resource** > choose the required **subscription**, and **resource group**. For the **Resource type**, select **Azure Cosmos DB accounts**, choose one of your existing Azure Cosmos accounts, and select **Apply**.

1. Next you can select a metric from the list of available metrics. You can select metrics specific to request units, storage, latency, availability, Cassandra, and others. To learn in detail about all the available metrics in this list, see the [Metrics by category](#metrics-by-category) section of this article. In this example, letâ€™s select **Request units** and **Avg** as the aggregation value. 

   In addition to these details, you can also select the **Time range** and **Time granularity** of the metrics. At max, you can view metrics for the past 30 days.  After you apply the filter, a chart is displayed based on your filter. You can see the average number of request units consumed per minute for the selected period.

## Add filters to metrics

You can also filter metrics and the chart displayed by a specific **CollectionName**, **DatabaseName**, **OperationType**, **Region**, and **StatusCode**. To filter the metrics, select **Add filter** and choose the required property such as **OperationType** and select a value such as **Query**. The graph then displays the request units consumed for the query operation for the selected period. The operations executed via Stored procedure are not logged so they are not available under the OperationType metric.

You can group metrics by using the **Apply splitting** option. For example, you can group the request units per operation type and view the graph for all the operations at once as shown in the following image:

### Request metrics
			
|Metric (Metric Display Name)|Unit (Aggregation Type) |Description|Dimensions| Time granularities| Legacy metric mapping | Usage |
|---|---|---|---| ---| ---| ---|
| TotalRequests (Total Requests) | Count (Count) | Number of requests made| DatabaseName, CollectionName, Region, StatusCode| All | TotalRequests, Http 2xx, Http 3xx, Http 400, Http 401, Internal Server error, Service Unavailable, Throttled Requests, Average Requests per Second | Used to monitor requests per status code, container at a minute granularity. To get average requests per second, use Count aggregation at minute and divide by 60. |
| MetadataRequests (Metadata Requests) |Count (Count) | Count of metadata requests. Azure Cosmos DB maintains system metadata container for each account, that allows you to enumerate collections, databases, etc., and their configurations, free of charge. | DatabaseName, CollectionName, Region, StatusCode| All| |Used to monitor throttles due to metadata requests.|
| MongoRequests (Mongo Requests) | Count (Count) | Number of Mongo Requests Made | DatabaseName, CollectionName, Region, CommandName, ErrorCode| All |Mongo Query Request Rate, Mongo Update Request Rate, Mongo Delete Request Rate, Mongo Insert Request Rate, Mongo Count Request Rate| Used to monitor Mongo request errors, usages per command type. |
