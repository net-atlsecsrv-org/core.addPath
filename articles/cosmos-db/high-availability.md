# How does Azure Cosmos DB provide high availability? 

Azure Cosmos DB transparently replicates your data across all the Azure regions associated with your Azure Cosmos account. Azure Cosmos DB employs multiple layers of redundancy for your data as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="./media/high-availability/cosmosdb-data-redundancy.png" alt-text="Physical partitioning" border="false":::

- The data within Azure Cosmos containers is [horizontally partitioned](partitioning-overview.md).

- A partition-set is a collection of multiple replica-sets. Within each region, every partition is protected by a replica-set with all writes replicated and durably committed by a majority of replicas. Replicas are distributed across as many as 10-20 fault domains.

- Each partition across all the regions is replicated. Each region contains all the data partitions of an Azure Cosmos container and can accept writes and serve reads.  

If your Azure Cosmos account is distributed across *N* Azure regions, there will be at least *N* x 4 copies of all your data. Generally having an Azure Cosmos account in more than 2 regions improves the availability of your application and provides low latency across the associated regions. 

## SLAs for availability

As a globally distributed database, Azure Cosmos DB provides comprehensive SLAs that encompass throughput, latency at the 99th percentile, consistency, and high availability. The table below shows the guarantees for high availability provided by Azure Cosmos DB for single and multi-region accounts. For high availability, always configure your Azure Cosmos accounts to have multiple write regions.

|Operation type  | Single region |Multi-region (single region writes)|Multi-region (multi-region writes) |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
|Writes    | 99.99    |99.99   |99.999|
|Reads     | 99.99    |99.999  |99.999|

> [!NOTE]
> In practice, the actual write availability for bounded staleness, session, consistent prefix and eventual consistency models is significantly higher than the published SLAs. The actual read availability for all consistency levels is significantly higher than the published SLAs.

## High availability with Azure Cosmos DB in the event of regional outages

For the rare cases of regional outage, Azure Cosmos DB makes sure your database is always highly available. The following details capture Azure Cosmos DB behavior during an outage, depending on your Azure Cosmos account configuration:

- With Azure Cosmos DB, before a write operation is acknowledged to the client, the data is durably committed by a quorum of replicas within the region that accepts the write operations.

- Multi-region accounts configured with multiple-write regions will be highly available for both writes and reads. Regional failovers are instantaneous and don't require any changes from the application.

- Single-region accounts may lose availability following a regional outage. It's always recommended to set up **at least two regions** (preferably, at least two write regions) with your Azure Cosmos account to ensure high availability at all times.

### Multi-region accounts with a single-write region (write region outage)

- During a write region outage, the Azure Cosmos account will automatically promote a secondary region to be the new primary write region when **enable automatic failover** is configured on the Azure Cosmos account. When enabled, the failover will occur to another region in the order of region priority you've specified.
- When the previously impacted region is back online, any write data that was not replicated when the region failed, is made available through the [conflicts feed](how-to-manage-conflicts.md#read-from-conflict-feed). Applications can read the conflicts feed, resolve the conflicts based on the application-specific logic, and write the updated data back to the Azure Cosmos container as appropriate.
- Once the previously impacted write region recovers, it becomes automatically available as a read region. You can switch back to the recovered region as the write region. You can switch the regions by using [PowerShell, Azure CLI or Azure portal](how-to-manage-database-account.md#manual-failover). There is **no data or availability loss** before, during or after you switch the write region and your application continues to be highly available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is strongly recommended that you configure the Azure Cosmos accounts used for production workloads to **enable automatic failover**. Manual failover requires connectivity between secondary and primary write region to complete a consistency check to ensure there is no data loss during the failover. If the primary region is unavailable, this consistency check cannot complete and the manual failover will not succeed, resulting in loss of write availability.

### Multi-region accounts with a single-write region (read region outage)

- During a read region outage, Azure Cosmos accounts using any consistency level or strong consistency with three or more read regions will remain highly available for reads and writes.
- Azure Cosmos accounts using strong consistency with two or fewer read regions (which includes the read & write region) will lose read write availability during a read region outage.
- The impacted region is automatically disconnected and will be marked offline. The [Azure Cosmos DB SDKs](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) will redirect read calls to the next available region in the preferred region list.
- If none of the regions in the preferred region list is available, calls automatically fall back to the current write region.
- No changes are required in your application code to handle read region outage. When the impacted read region is back online it will automatically sync with the current write region and will be available again to serve read requests.
- Subsequent reads are redirected to the recovered region without requiring any changes to your application code. During both failover and rejoining of a previously failed region, read consistency guarantees continue to be honored by Azure Cosmos DB.
- Even in a rare and unfortunate event when the Azure region is permanently irrecoverable, there is no data loss if your multi-region Azure Cosmos account is configured with *Strong* consistency. In the event of a permanently irrecoverable write region, a multi-region Azure Cosmos account configured with bounded-staleness consistency, the potential data loss window is restricted to the staleness window (*K* or *T*) where K=100,000 updates and T=5 minutes. For session, consistent-prefix and eventual consistency levels, the potential data loss window is restricted to a maximum of 15 minutes. For more information on RTO and RPO targets for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Consistency levels and data durability](consistency-levels-tradeoffs.md#rto)

## Availability Zone support

In addition to cross region resiliency, you can now enable **zone redundancy** when selecting a region to associate with your Azure Cosmos database.

With Availability Zone support, Azure Cosmos DB will ensure replicas are placed across multiple zones within a given region to provide high availability and resiliency during zonal failures. There are no changes to latency and other SLAs in this configuration. In the event of a single zone failure, zone redundancy provides full data durability with RPO=0 and availability with RTO=0.

Zone redundancy is a *supplemental capability* to the [replication in multi-region writes](how-to-multi-master.md) feature. Zone redundancy alone cannot be relied upon to achieve regional resiliency. For example, in the event of regional outages or low latency access across the regions, it's advised to have multiple write regions in addition to zone redundancy.

When configuring multi-region writes for your Azure Cosmos account, you can opt into zone redundancy at no extra cost. Otherwise, please see the note below regarding the pricing for zone redundancy support. You can enable zone redundancy on an existing region of your Azure Cosmos account by removing the region and adding it back with the zone redundancy enabled.

This feature is available in: *UK South, Southeast Asia, East US, East US 2, Central US, West Europe, West US 2, Japan East, North Europe, France Central,Australia East, East US 2 EUAP* regions.

The following table summarizes the high availability capability of various account configurations:

|KPI  |Single region without Availability Zones (Non-AZ)  |Single region with Availability Zones (AZ)  |Multi-region writes with Availability Zones (AZ, 2 regions) – Most recommended setting |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Write availability SLA | 99.99% | 99.99% | 99.999% |
|Read availability SLA  | 99.99% | 99.99% | 99.999% |
|Price | Single region billing rate | Single region Availability Zone billing rate | Multi-region billing rate |
|Zone failures – data loss | Data loss | No data loss | No data loss |
|Zone failures – availability | Availability loss | No availability loss | No availability loss |
|Read latency | Cross region | Cross region | Low |
|Write latency | Cross region | Cross region | Low |
|Regional outage – data loss | Data loss |  Data loss | Data loss <br/><br/> When using bounded staleness consistency with multiple write regions and more than one region, data loss is limited to the bounded staleness configured on your account <br /><br />You can avoid data loss during a regional outage by configuring strong consistency with multiple regions. This option comes with trade-offs that affect availability and performance. It can be configured only on accounts that are configured for single-region writes. |
|Regional outage – availability | Availability loss | Availability loss | No availability loss |
|Throughput | X RU/s provisioned throughput | X RU/s provisioned throughput * 1.25 | 2X RU/s provisioned throughput <br/><br/> This configuration mode requires twice the amount of throughput when compared to a single region with Availability Zones because there are two regions. |

> [!NOTE]
> To enable Availability Zone support for a multi region Azure Cosmos account, the account must have multi-region writes enabled.

You can enable zone redundancy when adding a region to new or existing Azure Cosmos accounts. To enable zone redundancy on your Azure Cosmos account, you should set the `isZoneRedundant` flag to `true` for a specific location. You can set this flag within the locations property. For example, the following PowerShell snippet enables zone redundancy for the "Southeast Asia" region:

```powershell
$locations = @(
    @{ "locationName"="Southeast Asia"; "failoverPriority"=0; "isZoneRedundant"= "true" },
    @{ "locationName"="East US"; "failoverPriority"=1; "isZoneRedundant"= "true" }
)
```

The following command shows how to enable zone redundancy for the "EastUS" and "WestUS2" regions:

```azurecli-interactive
az cosmosdb create \
  --name mycosmosdbaccount \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --kind GlobalDocumentDB \
  --default-consistency-level Session \
  --locations regionName=EastUS failoverPriority=0 isZoneRedundant=True \
  --locations regionName=WestUS2 failoverPriority=1 isZoneRedundant=True
```

You can enable Availability Zones by using Azure portal when creating an Azure Cosmos account. When you create an account, make sure to enable the **Geo-redundancy**, **Multi-region Writes**, and choose a region where Availability Zones are supported:

## Building highly available applications

- Review the expected [behavior of the Azure Cosmos SDKs](troubleshoot-sdk-availability.md) during these events and which are the configurations that affect it.

- To ensure high write and read availability, configure your Azure Cosmos account to span at least two regions with multiple-write regions. This configuration will provide the highest availability, lowest latency, and best scalability for both reads and writes backed by SLAs. To learn more, see how to [configure your Azure Cosmos account with multiple write-regions](tutorial-global-distribution-sql-api.md).

- For multi-region Azure Cosmos accounts that are configured with a single-write region, [enable automatic-failover by using Azure CLI or Azure portal](how-to-manage-database-account.md#automatic-failover). After you enable automatic failover, whenever there is a regional disaster, Cosmos DB will automatically failover your account.  

- Even if your Azure Cosmos account is highly available, your application may not be correctly designed to remain highly available. To test the end-to-end high availability of your application, as a part of your application testing or disaster recovery (DR) drills, temporarily disable automatic-failover for the account, invoke the [manual failover by using PowerShell, Azure CLI or Azure portal](how-to-manage-database-account.md#manual-failover), then monitor your application's failover. Once complete, you can fail back over to the primary region and restore automatic-failover for the account.

- Within a globally distributed database environment, there is a direct relationship between the consistency level and data durability in the presence of a region-wide outage. As you develop your business continuity plan, you need to understand the maximum acceptable time before the application fully recovers after a disruptive event. The time required for an application to fully recover is known as recovery time objective (RTO). You also need to understand the maximum period of recent data updates the application can tolerate losing when recovering after a disruptive event. The time period of updates that you might afford to lose is known as recovery point objective (RPO). To see the RPO and RTO for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Consistency levels and data durability](consistency-levels-tradeoffs.md#rto)
