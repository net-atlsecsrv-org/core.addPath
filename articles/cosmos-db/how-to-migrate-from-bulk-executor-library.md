# Migrate from the bulk executor library to the bulk support in Azure Cosmos DB .NET V3 SDK

This article describes the required steps to migrate an existing application's code that uses the [.NET bulk executor library](bulk-executor-dot-net.md) to the [bulk support](tutorial-sql-api-dotnet-bulk-import.md) feature in the latest version of the .NET SDK.

## Enable bulk support

Enable bulk support on the `CosmosClient` instance through the [AllowBulkExecution](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution) configuration:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="Initialization":::

## Create Tasks for each operation

Bulk support in the .NET SDK works by leveraging the [Task Parallel Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) and grouping operations that occur concurrently. 

There is no single method in the SDK that will take your list of documents or operations as an input parameter, but rather, you need to create a Task for each operation you want to execute in bulk, and then simply wait for them to complete.

For example, if your initial input is a list of items where each item has the following schema:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="Model":::

If you want to do bulk import (similar to using BulkExecutor.BulkImportAsync), you need to have concurrent calls to `CreateItemAsync`. For example:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkImport":::

If you want to do bulk *update* (similar to using [BulkExecutor.BulkUpdateAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.bulkexecutor.bulkexecutor.bulkupdateasync)), you need to have concurrent calls to `ReplaceItemAsync` method after updating the item value. For example:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkUpdate":::

And if you want to do bulk *delete* (similar to using [BulkExecutor.BulkDeleteAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.bulkexecutor.bulkexecutor.bulkdeleteasync)), you need to have concurrent calls to `DeleteItemAsync`, with the `id` and partition key of each item. For example:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkDelete":::

## Capture task result state

In the previous code examples, we have created a concurrent list of tasks, and called the `CaptureOperationResponse` method on each of those tasks. This method is an extension that lets us maintain a *similar response schema* as BulkExecutor, by capturing any errors and tracking the [request units usage](request-units.md).

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="CaptureOperationResult":::

Where the `OperationResponse` is declared as:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="OperationResult":::

## Execute operations concurrently

To track the scope of the entire list of Tasks, we use this helper class:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkOperationsHelper":::

The `ExecuteAsync` method will wait until all operations are completed and you can use it like so:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="WhenAll":::

## Capture statistics

The previous code waits until all operations are completed and calculates the required statistics. These statistics are similar to that of the bulk executor library's [BulkImportResponse](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.bulkexecutor.bulkimport.bulkimportresponse).

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="ResponseType":::

The `BulkOperationResponse` contains:

1. The total time taken to process the list of operations through bulk support.
1. The number of successful operations.
1. The total of request units consumed.
1. If there are failures, it displays a list of tuples that contain the exception and the associated item for logging and identification purpose.

## Retry configuration

Bulk executor library had [guidance](bulk-executor-dot-net.md#bulk-import-data-to-an-azure-cosmos-account) that mentioned to set the `MaxRetryWaitTimeInSeconds` and `MaxRetryAttemptsOnThrottledRequests` of [RetryOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.connectionpolicy.retryoptions) to `0` to delegate control to the library.

For bulk support in the .NET SDK, there is no hidden behavior. You can configure the retry options directly through the [CosmosClientOptions.MaxRetryAttemptsOnRateLimitedRequests](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.maxretryattemptsonratelimitedrequests) and [CosmosClientOptions.MaxRetryWaitTimeOnRateLimitedRequests](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.maxretrywaittimeonratelimitedrequests).

> [!NOTE]
> In cases where the provisioned request units is much lower than the expected based on the amount of data, you might want to consider setting these to high values. The bulk operation will take longer but it has a higher chance of completely succeeding due to the higher retries.

## Performance improvements

As with other operations with the .NET SDK, using the stream APIs results in better performance and avoids any unnecessary serialization. 

Using stream APIs is only possible if the nature of the data you use matches that of a stream of bytes (for example, file streams). In such cases, using the `CreateItemStreamAsync`, `ReplaceItemStreamAsync`, or `DeleteItemStreamAsync` methods and working with `ResponseMessage` (instead of `ItemResponse`) increases the throughput that can be achieved.
