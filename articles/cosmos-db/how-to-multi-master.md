# Configure multi-master in your applications that use Azure Cosmos DB

Once an account has been created with multiple write regions enabled, you must make two changes in your application to the ConnectionPolicy for the DocumentClient to enable the multi-master and multi-homing capabilities in Azure Cosmos DB. Within the ConnectionPolicy, set UseMultipleWriteLocations to true and pass the name of the region where the application is deployed to SetCurrentLocation. This will populate the PreferredLocations property based on the geo-proximity from location passed in. If a new region is later added to the account, the application does not have to be updated or redeployed, it will automatically detect the closer region and will auto-home on to it should a regional event occur.

> [!Note]
> Cosmos accounts initially configured with single write region can be configured to multiple write regions (i.e. multi-master) with zero down time. To learn more see, [Configure multiple-write regions](how-to-manage-database-account.md#configure-multiple-write-regions)

## <a id="netv2"></a>.NET SDK v2

To enable multi-master in your application, set `UseMultipleWriteLocations` to `true`. Also, set `SetCurrentLocation` to the region in which the application is being deployed and where Azure Cosmos DB is replicated:

```csharp
ConnectionPolicy policy = new ConnectionPolicy
    {
        ConnectionMode = ConnectionMode.Direct,
        ConnectionProtocol = Protocol.Tcp,
        UseMultipleWriteLocations = true
    };
policy.SetCurrentLocation("West US 2");
```

## <a id="netv3"></a>.NET SDK v3

To enable multi-master in your application, set `ApplicationRegion` to the region in which the application is being deployed and where Cosmos DB is replicated:

```csharp
CosmosClient cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(
    "<connection-string-from-portal>", 
    new CosmosClientOptions()
    {
        ApplicationRegion = Regions.WestUS2,
    });
```

Optionally, you can use the `CosmosClientBuilder` and `WithApplicationRegion` to achieve the same result:

```csharp
CosmosClientBuilder cosmosClientBuilder = new CosmosClientBuilder("<connection-string-from-portal>")
            .WithApplicationRegion(Regions.WestUS2);
CosmosClient client = cosmosClientBuilder.Build();
```

## <a id="java"></a>Java Async SDK

To enable multi-master in your application, set `policy.setUsingMultipleWriteLocations(true)` and set `policy.setPreferredLocations` to the region in which the application is being deployed and where Cosmos DB is replicated:

```java
ConnectionPolicy policy = new ConnectionPolicy();
policy.setUsingMultipleWriteLocations(true);
policy.setPreferredLocations(Collections.singletonList(region));

AsyncDocumentClient client =
    new AsyncDocumentClient.Builder()
        .withMasterKeyOrResourceToken(this.accountKey)
        .withServiceEndpoint(this.accountEndpoint)
        .withConsistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.Eventual)
        .withConnectionPolicy(policy).build();
```

## <a id="javascript"></a>Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript SDKs

To enable multi-master in your application, set `connectionPolicy.UseMultipleWriteLocations` to `true`. Also, set `connectionPolicy.PreferredLocations` to the region in which the application is being deployed and where Cosmos DB is replicated:

```javascript
const connectionPolicy: ConnectionPolicy = new ConnectionPolicy();
connectionPolicy.UseMultipleWriteLocations = true;
connectionPolicy.PreferredLocations = [region];

const client = new CosmosClient({
  endpoint: config.endpoint,
  auth: { masterKey: config.key },
  connectionPolicy,
  consistencyLevel: ConsistencyLevel.Eventual
});
```

## <a id="python"></a>Python SDK

To enable multi-master in your application, set `connection_policy.UseMultipleWriteLocations` to `true`. Also, set `connection_policy.PreferredLocations` to the region in which the application is being deployed and where Cosmos DB is replicated.

```python
connection_policy = documents.ConnectionPolicy()
connection_policy.UseMultipleWriteLocations = True
connection_policy.PreferredLocations = [region]

client = cosmos_client.CosmosClient(self.account_endpoint, {
                                    'masterKey': self.account_key}, connection_policy, documents.ConsistencyLevel.Session)
```
