# Partitioning in Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB uses partitioning to scale individual containers in a database to meet the performance needs of your application. In partitioning, the items in a container are divided into distinct subsets called *logical partitions*. Logical partitions are formed based on the value of a *partition key* that is associated with each item in a container. All items in a logical partition have the same partition key value.

For example, a container holds items. Each item has a unique value for the `UserID` property. If `UserID` serves as the partition key for the items in the container and there are 1,000 unique `UserID` values, 1,000 logical partitions are created for the container.

In addition to a partition key that determines the item’s logical partition, each item in a container has an *item ID* (unique within a logical partition). Combining the partition key and the item ID creates the item's *index*, which uniquely identifies the item.

[Choosing a partition key](partitioning-overview.md#choose-partitionkey) is an important decision that will affect your application’s performance.

## Managing logical partitions

Azure Cosmos DB transparently and automatically manages the placement of logical partitions on physical partitions to efficiently satisfy the scalability and performance needs of the container. As the throughput and storage requirements of an application increase, Azure Cosmos DB moves logical partitions to automatically spread the load across a greater number of servers. 

Azure Cosmos DB uses hash-based partitioning to spread logical partitions across physical partitions. Azure Cosmos DB hashes the partition key value of an item. The hashed result determines the physical partition. Then, Azure Cosmos DB allocates the key space of partition key hashes evenly across the physical partitions.

Queries that access data within a single logical partition are more cost-effective than queries that access multiple partitions. Transactions (in stored procedures or triggers) are allowed only against items in a single logical partition.

To learn more about how Azure Cosmos DB manages partitions, see [Logical partitions](partition-data.md). (It's not necessary to understand the internal details to build or run your applications, but added here for a curious reader.)

## <a id="choose-partitionkey"></a>Choosing a partition key

The following is a good guidance for choosing a partition key:

* A single logical partition has an upper limit of 10 GB of storage.  

* Azure Cosmos containers have a minimum throughput of 400 request units per second (RU/s). When throughput is provisioned on a database, minimum RUs per container is 100 request units per second (RU/s). Requests to the same partition key can't exceed the throughput that's allocated to a partition. If requests exceed the allocated throughput, requests are rate-limited. So, it's important to pick a partition key that doesn't result in "hot spots" within your application.

* Choose a partition key that has a wide range of values and access patterns that are evenly spread across logical partitions. This helps spread the data and the activity in your container across the set of logical partitions, so that resources for data storage and throughput can be distributed across the logical partitions.

* Choose a partition key that spreads the workload evenly across all partitions and evenly over time. Your choice of partition key should balance the need for efficient partition queries and transactions against the goal of distributing items across multiple partitions to achieve scalability.

* Candidates for partition keys might include properties that appear frequently as a filter in your queries. Queries can be efficiently routed by including the partition key in the filter predicate.
