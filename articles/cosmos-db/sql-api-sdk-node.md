## Release notes

### <a name="3.1.0"/>3.1.0</a>
* Set default ResponseContinuationTokenLimitInKB to 1kb. By default, we are capping this to 1kb to avoid long headers (Node.js has a global header size limit). A user may set this field to allow for longer headers, which can help the backend optimize query execution.
* Remove disableSSLVerification. This option has new alternatives described in [#388](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-js/pull/388)

### <a name="3.0.4"/>3.0.4</a>
* Allow initialHeaders to explicitly set partition key header
* Use package.json#files to prevent extraneous files from being published
* Fix routing map sort error on older version of node+v8
* Fixes bug when user supplies partial retry options

### <a name="3.0.3"/>3.0.3</a>
* Prevent Webpack from resolving modules called with require

### <a name="3.0.2"/>3.0.2</a>
* Fixes a long outstanding bug where RUs were always being reported as 0 for aggregate queries

### <a name="3.0.0"/>3.0.0</a>

ðŸŽ‰ v3 release! ðŸŽ‰ Many new features, bug fixes, and a few breaking changes. Primary goals of this release:

* Implement major new features
  * DISTINCT queries
  * LIMIT/OFFSET queries
  * User cancelable requests
* Update to the latest Cosmos REST API version where all containers have unlimited scale
* Make it easier to use Cosmos from the browser
* Better align with the new Azure JS SDK guidelines

#### Migration guide for breaking changes
##### Improved client Constructor options

Constructor options have been simplified:

* masterKey was renamed key and moved to the top-level
* Properties previously under options.auth have moved to the top-level

``` js
// v2
const client = new CosmosClient({
    endpoint: "https://your-database.cosmos.azure.com",
    auth: {
        masterKey: "your-primary-key"
    }
})

// v3
const client = new CosmosClient({
    endpoint: "https://your-database.cosmos.azure.com",
    key: "your-primary-key"
})
```

##### Simplified QueryIterator API
In v2 there were many different ways to iterate or retrieve results from a query. We have attempted to simplify the v3 API and remove similar or duplicate APIs:

* Remove iterator.next() and iterator.current(). Use fetchNext() to get pages of results.
* Remove iterator.forEach(). Use async iterators instead.
* iterator.executeNext() renamed to iterator.fetchNext()
* iterator.toArray() renamed to iterator.fetchAll()
* Pages are now proper Response objects instead of plain JS objects
* const container = client.database(dbId).container(containerId)

``` js
// v2
container.items.query('SELECT * from c').toArray()
container.items.query('SELECT * from c').executeNext()
container.items.query('SELECT * from c').forEach(({ body: item }) => { console.log(item.id) })

// v3
container.items.query('SELECT * from c').fetchAll()
container.items.query('SELECT * from c').fetchNext()
for await(const { result: item } in client.databases.readAll().getAsyncIterator()) {
    console.log(item.id)
}
```

##### Fixed containers are now partitioned
The Cosmos service now supports partition keys on all containers, including those that were previously created as fixed containers. The v3 SDK updates to the latest API version that implements this change, but it is not breaking. If you do not supply a partition key for operations, we will default to a system key that works with all your existing containers and documents.

##### Upsert removed for stored procedures
Previously upsert was allowed for non-partitioned collections, but with the API version update, all collections are partitioned so we removed it entirely.

##### Item reads will not throw on 404
const container = client.database(dbId).container(containerId)

``` js
// v2
try {
    container.items.read(id, undefined)
} catch (e) {
    if (e.code === 404) { console.log('item not found') }
}

// v3
const { result: item }  = container.items.read(id, undefined)
if (item === undefined) { console.log('item not found') }
```

##### Default multi-region write
The SDK will now write to multiple regions by default if your Cosmos configuration supports it. This was previously opt-in behavior.

##### Proper error objects
Failed requests now throw proper Error or subclasses of Error. Previously they threw plain JS objects.

#### New features
##### User-cancelable requests
The move to fetch internally allows us to use the browser AbortController API to support user-cancelable operations. In the case of operations where multiple requests are potentially in progress (like cross partition queries), all requests for the operation will be canceled. Modern browser users will already have AbortController. Node.js users will need to use a polyfill library

``` js
 const controller = new AbortController()
 const {result: item} = await items.query('SELECT * from c', { abortSignal: controller.signal});
 controller.abort()
```

##### Set throughput as part of db/container create operation
``` js
const { database }  = client.databases.create({ id: 'my-database', throughput: 10000 })
database.containers.create({ id: 'my-container', throughput: 10000 })
```

##### @azure/cosmos-sign
Header token generation was split out into a new library, @azure/cosmos-sign. Anyone calling the Cosmos REST API directly can use this to sign headers using the same code we call inside @azure/cosmos.

##### UUID for generated IDs
v2 had custom code to generate item IDs. We have switched to the well known and maintained community library uuid.

##### Connection strings
It is now possible to pass a connection string copied from the Azure portal:

``` js
const client = new CosmosClient("AccountEndpoint=https://test-account.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=c213asdasdefgdfgrtweaYPpgoeCsHbpRTHhxuMsTaw==;")
Add DISTINCT and LIMIT/OFFSET queries (#306)
 const { results } = await items.query('SELECT DISTINCT VALUE r.name FROM ROOT').fetchAll()
 const { results } = await items.query('SELECT * FROM root r OFFSET 1 LIMIT 2').fetchAll()
```

#### Improved browser experience
While it was possible to use the v2 SDK in the browser it was not an ideal experience. You needed to polyfill several node.js built-in libraries and use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel. The v3 SDK makes the out of the box experience much better for browser users.

* Added retry policy support for throttled requests. (Throttled requests receive a request rate too large exception, error code 429.) By default, Azure Cosmos DB retries nine times for each request when error code 429 is encountered, honoring the retryAfter time in the response header. A fixed retry interval time can now be set as part of the RetryOptions property on the ConnectionPolicy object if you want to ignore the retryAfter time returned by server between the retries. Azure Cosmos DB now waits for a maximum of 30 seconds for each request that is being throttled (irrespective of retry count) and returns the response with error code 429. This time can also be overridden in the RetryOptions property on ConnectionPolicy object.
* Cosmos DB now returns x-ms-throttle-retry-count and x-ms-throttle-retry-wait-time-ms as the response headers in every request to denote the throttle retry count and the cumulative time the request waited between the retries.
* The RetryOptions class was added, exposing the RetryOptions property on the ConnectionPolicy class that can be used to override some of the default retry options.

## Release & Retirement Dates
Microsoft provides notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is recommended that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible.

Any request to Cosmos DB using a retired SDK will be rejected by the service.

> [!WARNING]
> All versions **1.x** of the Node client SDK for SQL API will be retired on **August 30, 2020**. This affects only the client-side Node SDK and does not affect server-side scripts (stored procedures, triggers, and UDFs).
