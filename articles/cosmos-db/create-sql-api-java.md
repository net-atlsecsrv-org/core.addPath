# Quickstart: Build a Java app to manage Azure Cosmos DB SQL API data


> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [.NET V3](create-sql-api-dotnet.md)
> * [.NET V4](create-sql-api-dotnet-V4.md)
> * [Java](create-sql-api-java.md)
> * [Node.js](create-sql-api-nodejs.md)
> * [Python](create-sql-api-python.md)
> * [Xamarin](create-sql-api-xamarin-dotnet.md)

This quickstart shows you how to use a Java application to create and manage a document database from your Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account. First, you create an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account using the Azure portal, create a Java app using the SQL Java SDK, and then add resources to your Cosmos DB account by using the Java application. The instructions in this quickstart can be followed on any operating system that is capable of running Java. After completing this quickstart you'll be familiar with creating and modifying Cosmos DB databases, containers in either the UI or programmatically, whichever is your preference.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)] 
[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api](../../includes/cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api.md)]

In addition: 

* [Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)
    * Be sure to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where the JDK is installed.
* [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) binary archive
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `apt-get install maven` to install Maven.
* [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/)
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install git` to install Git.

## Create a database account

Before you can create a document database, you need to create a SQL API account with Azure Cosmos DB.

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount.md)]

## Add a container

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-collection](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-collection.md)]

<a id="add-sample-data"></a>
## Add sample data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-sql-api-add-sample-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-sql-api-add-sample-data.md)]

## Query your data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-sql-api-query-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-sql-api-query-data.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's switch to working with code. Let's clone a SQL API app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-java-getting-started.git
    ```

## Review the code

This step is optional. If you're interested in learning how the database resources are created in the code, you can review the following snippets. Otherwise, you can skip ahead to [Run the app
](#run-the-app). 

* `CosmosClient` initialization. The `CosmosClient` provides client-side logical representation for the Azure Cosmos database service. This client is used to configure and execute requests against the service.
    
    [!code-java[](~/azure-cosmosdb-java-v4-getting-started/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/sample/sync/SyncMain.java?name=CreateSyncClient)]

* CosmosDatabase creation.

    [!code-java[](~/azure-cosmosdb-java-v4-getting-started/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/sample/sync/SyncMain.java?name=CreateDatabaseIfNotExists)]

* CosmosContainer creation.

    [!code-java[](~/azure-cosmosdb-java-v4-getting-started/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/sample/sync/SyncMain.java?name=CreateContainerIfNotExists)]

* Item creation by using the `createItem` method.

    [!code-java[](~/azure-cosmosdb-java-v4-getting-started/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/sample/sync/SyncMain.java?name=CreateItem)]
   
* Point reads are performed using `getItem` and `read` method

    [!code-java[](~/azure-cosmosdb-java-v4-getting-started/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/sample/sync/SyncMain.java?name=ReadItem)]

* SQL queries over JSON are performed using the `queryItems` method.

    [!code-java[](~/azure-cosmosdb-java-v4-getting-started/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/sample/sync/SyncMain.java?name=QueryItems)]

## Run the app

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and launch the app with your endpoint information. This enables your app to communicate with your hosted database.


1. In the git terminal window, `cd` to the sample code folder.

    ```bash
    cd azure-cosmos-java-getting-started
    ```

2. In the git terminal window, use the following command to install the required Java packages.

    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```

3. In the git terminal window, use the following command to start the Java application (replace YOUR_COSMOS_DB_HOSTNAME with the quoted URI value from the portal, and replace YOUR_COSMOS_DB_MASTER_KEY with the quoted primary key from portal)

    ```bash
    mvn exec:java -DACCOUNT_HOST=YOUR_COSMOS_DB_HOSTNAME -DACCOUNT_KEY=YOUR_COSMOS_DB_MASTER_KEY

    ```

    The terminal window displays a notification that the FamilyDB database was created. 
    
4. The app creates database with name `AzureSampleFamilyDB`
5. The app creates container with name `FamilyContainer`
6. The app will perform point reads using object ids and partition key value (which is lastName in our sample). 
7. The app will query items to retrieve all families with last name in ('Andersen', 'Wakefield', 'Johnson')

7. The app doesn't delete the created resources. Switch back to the portal to [clean up the resources](#clean-up-resources).  from your account so that you don't incur charges.

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-delete-resource-group](../../includes/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos account, document database, and container using the Data Explorer, and run an app to do the same thing programmatically. You can now import additional data into your Azure Cosmos container.
