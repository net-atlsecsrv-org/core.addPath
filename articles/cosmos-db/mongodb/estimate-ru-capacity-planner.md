# Estimate RU/s using the Azure Cosmos DB capacity planner - Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](../includes/appliesto-mongodb-api.md)]

Configuring your databases and collections with the right amount of provisioned throughput, or [Request Units (RU/s)](../request-units.md), for your workload is essential to optimizing cost and performance. This article describes how to use the Azure Cosmos DB [capacity planner](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator/) to get an estimate of the required RU/s and cost of your workload when using the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB. If you are using SQL API, see how to [use capacity calculator with SQL API](../estimate-ru-with-capacity-planner.md) article.

[!INCLUDE [capacity planner modes](../includes/capacity-planner-modes.md)]

## <a id="basic-mode"></a>Estimate provisioned throughput and cost using basic mode
To get a quick estimate for your workload using the basic mode, navigate to the [capacity planner](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator/). Input the following parameters based on your workload:

|**Input**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
| API |Choose MongoDB API |
|Number of regions|Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB is available in all Azure regions. Select the number of regions required for your workload. You can associate any number of regions with your account. See [global distribution](../distribute-data-globally.md) for more details.|
|Multi-region writes|If you enable [multi-region writes](../distribute-data-globally.md#key-benefits-of-global-distribution), your application can read and write to any Azure region. If you disable multi-region writes, your application can write data to a single region. <br/><br/> Enable multi-region writes if you expect to have an active-active workload that requires low latency writes in different regions. For example, an IOT workload that writes data to the database at high volumes in different regions. <br/><br/> Multi-region writes guarantees 99.999% read and write availability. Multi-region writes require more throughput when compared to the single write regions. To learn more, see [how RUs are different for single and multiple-write regions](../optimize-cost-regions.md) article.|
|Total data stored in transactional store |Total estimated data stored(GB) in the transactional store in a single region.|
|Use analytical store| Choose **On** if you want to use [Synapse analytical store](../synapse-link.md). Enter the **Total data stored in analytical store**, it represents the estimated data stored (GB) in the analytical store in a single region.  |
|Item size|The estimated size of the documents, ranging from 1 KB to 2 MB. |
|Finds/sec |Number of find operations expected per second per region. |
|Inserts/sec |Number of insert operations expected per second per region. |
|Updates/sec |Number of update operations expected per second per region. When you choose automatic indexing, the estimated RU/s for the update operation is calculated as one property being changed per an update. |
|Deletes/sec |Number of delete operations expected per second per region. |

After filling the required details, select **Calculate**. The **Cost Estimate** tab shows the total cost for storage and provisioned throughput. You can expand the **Show Details** link in this tab to get the breakdown of the throughput required for different CRUD and query requests. **Each time you change the value of any field, select Calculate to recalculate the estimated cost.**

## <a id="advanced-mode"></a>Estimate provisioned throughput and cost using advanced mode

Advanced mode allows you to provide more settings that impact the RU/s estimate. To use this option, navigate to the [capacity planner](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator/) and **sign in** to the tool with an account you use for Azure. The sign-in option is available at the right-hand corner.

After you sign in, you can see more fields compared to the fields in basic mode. Enter the other parameters based on your workload.

|**Input**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|API|Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-model and multi-API service. Choose MongoDB API. |
|Number of regions|Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB is available in all Azure regions. Select the number of regions required for your workload. You can associate any number of regions with your Cosmos account. See [global distribution](../distribute-data-globally.md) for more details.|
|Multi-region writes|If you enable [multi-region writes](../distribute-data-globally.md#key-benefits-of-global-distribution), your application can read and write to any Azure region. If you disable multi-region writes, your application can write data to a single region. <br/><br/> Enable multi-region writes if you expect to have an active-active workload that requires low latency writes in different regions. For example, an IOT workload that writes data to the database at high volumes in different regions. <br/><br/> Multi-region writes guarantees 99.999% read and write availability. Multi-region writes require more throughput when compared to the single write regions. To learn more, see [how RUs are different for single and multiple-write regions](../optimize-cost-regions.md) article.|
|Default consistency|Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB supports 5 consistency levels, to allow developers to balance the tradeoff between consistency, availability, and latency tradeoffs. To learn more, see the [consistency levels](../consistency-levels.md) article. <br/><br/> By default, API for MongoDB uses session consistency, which guarantees the ability to read your own writes in a session. <br/><br/> Choosing strong or bounded staleness will require double the required RU/s for reads, when compared to session, consistent prefix, and eventual consistency. Strong consistency with multi-region writes is not supported and will automatically default to single-region writes with strong consistency. |
|Indexing policy| If you choose **Off** option, none of the properties are indexed. This results in the lowest RU charge for writes. Turn off the indexing policy if you only plan to query using the _id field and the shard key for every query (both per query).<br/><br/> If you choose the **Automatic** option, the 3.6 and higher versions of API for MongoDB automatically index the _id filed. When you choose automatic indexing, it is the equivalent of setting a wildcard index (where every property gets auto-indexed). Use wildcard indexes for all fields for flexible and efficient queries.<br/><br/>If you choose the **Custom** option, you can set how many properties are indexed with multi-key indexes or compound indexes. You can enter the number of properties indexed later in the form. To learn more, see [index management](../mongodb-indexing.md) in API for MongoDB.|
|Total data stored in transactional store |Total estimated data stored (GB) in the transactional store in a single region.|
|Use analytical store| Choose **On** if you want to use [Synapse analytical store](../synapse-link.md). Enter the **Total data stored in analytical store**, it represents the estimated data stored (GB) in the analytical store in a single region.  |
|Workload mode|Select **Steady** option if your workload volume is constant. <br/><br/> Select **Variable** option if your workload volume changes over time.  For example, during a specific day or a month. The following setting is available if you choose the variable workload option:<ul><li>Percentage of time at peak: Percentage of time in a month where your workload requires peak (highest) throughput. </li></ul> <br/><br/> For example, if you have a workload that has high activity during 9am â€“ 6pm weekday business hours, then the percentage of time at peak is: 45 hours at peak / 730 hours / month = ~6%.<br/><br/>With peak and off-peak intervals, you can optimize your cost by [programmatically scaling your provisioned throughput](../set-throughput.md#update-throughput-on-a-database-or-a-container) up and down accordingly.|
|Item size|The size of the documents, ranging from 1 KB to 2 MB. You can add estimates for multiple sample items. <br/><br/>You can also **Upload sample (JSON)** document for a more accurate estimate.<br/><br/>If your workload has multiple types of items (with different JSON content) in the same container, you can upload multiple JSON documents and get the estimate. Use the **Add new item** button to add multiple sample JSON documents.|
| Operation type | The type of operation such as **Find**, **Aggregate**, **Modify** etc.  |
| Request unit (RU) charge per call | The estimated RU/s charge to execute the selected operation type. |
| Calls/sec per region | Number selected operation types executed per second per region. |

You can also use the **Save Estimate** button to download a CSV file containing the current estimate.
