# Frequently asked questions about autoscale provisioned throughput in Azure Cosmos DB

With autoscale provisioned throughput, Azure Cosmos DB will automatically manage and scale the RU/s of your database or container based on usage. This article answers commonly asked questions about autoscale.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the difference between "autopilot" and "autoscale" in Azure Cosmos DB?
"Autoscale" or "autoscale provisioned throughput" is the updated name for the feature, previously known as "autopilot." With the current release of autoscale, we've added new features, including the ability to set custom max RU/s and programmatic support. 

### What happens to databases or containers created in the previous autopilot tier model?
Resources that were created with the previous tier model are automatically supported with the new autoscale custom maximum RU/s model. The upper bound of the tier becomes the new maximum RU/s, which results in the same scale range. 

For example, if you previously selected the tier that scaled between 400 to 4000 RU/s, the database or container will now show as having a maximum RU/s of 4000 RU/s, which scales between 400 to 4000 RU/s. From here, you can change the maximum RU/s to a custom value to suit your workload. 

### How quickly will autoscale scale up and down based on spikes in traffic?
With autoscale, the system scales the throughput (RU/s) `T` up or down within the `0.1 * Tmax` and `Tmax` range, based on incoming traffic. Because the scaling is automatic and instantaneous, at any point in time, you can consume up to the provisioned `Tmax` with no delay. 

### How do I determine what RU/s the system is currently scaled to?
Use [Azure Monitor metrics](how-to-choose-offer.md#measure-and-monitor-your-usage) to monitor both the provisioned autoscale max RU/s and the current throughput (RU/s) the system is scaled to. 

### What is the pricing for autoscale?
Each hour, you will be billed for the highest throughput `T` the system scaled to within the hour. If your resource had no requests during the hour or did not scale beyond `0.1 * Tmax`, you will be billed for the minimum of `0.1 * Tmax`. Refer to the Azure Cosmos DB [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/) for details. 

### How does autoscale show up on my bill?
In single-master accounts, the autoscale rate per 100 RU/s is 1.5x the rate of standard (manual) provisioned throughput. On your bill, you will see the existing standard provisioned throughput meter. The quantity of this meter will be multiplied by 1.5. For example, if the highest RU/s the system scaled to within an hour was 6000 RU/s, you'd be billed 60 * 1.5 = 90 units of the meter for that hour.

In multi-master accounts, the autoscale rate per 100 RU/s is the same as the rate for standard (manual) provisioned multi-master throughput. On your bill, you will see the existing multi-master meter. Since the rates are the same, if you use autoscale, you'll see the same quantity as with standard throughput.

### Does autoscale work with reserved capacity?
Yes. When you purchase single-master reserved capacity, the reservation discount for autoscale resources is applied to your meter usage at a ratio of 1.5 * the [ratio of the specific region](../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-cosmosdb-reservation-charges.md#reservation-discount-per-region). 

Multi-master reserved capacity works the same for autoscale and standard (manual) provisioned throughput. See [Azure Cosmos DB reserved capacity](cosmos-db-reserved-capacity.md)

### Does autoscale work with free tier?
Yes. In free tier, you can use autoscale throughput on a container. Support for autoscale shared throughput databases with custom max RU/s is not yet available. See how [free tier billing works with autoscale](understand-your-bill.md#billing-examples-with-free-tier-accounts).

### Is autoscale supported for all APIs?
Yes, autoscale is supported for all APIs: Core (SQL), Gremlin, Table, Cassandra, and API for MongoDB.

### Is autoscale supported for multi-master accounts?
Yes. The max RU/s are available in each region that is added to the Azure Cosmos DB account. 

### How do I enable autoscale on new databases or containers?
See this article on [how to enable autoscale](how-to-provision-autoscale-throughput.md).

### Can I enable autoscale on an existing database or a container?
Yes. You can also switch between autoscale and standard (manual) provisioned throughput as needed. Currently, for all APIs, you can only use the [Azure portal](how-to-provision-autoscale-throughput.md#enable-autoscale-on-existing-database-or-container) to do these operations.

### How does the migration between autoscale and standard (manual) provisioned throughput work?
Conceptually, changing the throughput type is a two-stage process. First, you send a request to change the throughput settings to use either autoscale or manual provisioned throughput. In both cases, the system will automatically determine and set an initial RU/s value, based on the current throughput settings and storage. During this step, no user-provided RU/s value will be accepted. Then, after the update is complete, you can [change the RU/s](#can-i-change-the-max-rus-on-the-database-or-container) to suit your workload. 

**Migration from standard (manual) provisioned throughput to autoscale**

For a container, use the following formula to estimate the initial autoscale max RU/s: ``MAX(4000, current manual provisioned RU/s, maximum RU/s ever provisioned / 10, storage in GB * 100)``, rounded to the nearest 1000 RU/s. The actual initial autoscale max RU/s may vary depending on your account configuration.

Example #1: Suppose you have a container with 10,000 RU/s manual provisioned throughput, and 25 GB of storage. When you enable autoscale, the initial autoscale max RU/s will be: 10,000 RU/s, which will scale between 1000 - 10,000 RU/s. 

Example #2: Suppose you have a container with 50,000 RU/s manual provisioned throughput, and 2500 GB of storage. When you enable autoscale, the initial autoscale max RU/s will be: 250,000 RU/s, which will scale between 25,000 - 250,000 RU/s. 

**Migration from autoscale to standard (manual) provisioned throughput**

The initial manual provisioned throughput will be equal to the current autoscale max RU/s. 

Example: Suppose you have an autoscale database or container with max RU/s of 20,000 RU/s (scales between 2000 - 20,000 RU/s). When you update to use manual provisioned throughput, the initial throughput will be 20,000 RU/s. 

### Is there Azure CLI or PowerShell support to manage databases or containers with autoscale?
Currently, you can only create and manage resources with autoscale from the Azure portal, .NET V3 SDK, Java V4 SDK, and Azure Resource Manager. Support in Azure CLI, PowerShell, and other SDKs is not yet available.

### Is autoscale supported for shared throughput databases?
Yes, autoscale is supported for shared throughput databases. To enable this feature, select autoscale and the **Provision throughput** option when creating the database. 

### What is the number of allowed containers per shared throughput database when autoscale is enabled?
Azure Cosmos DB enforces a maximum of 25 containers in a shared throughput database, which applies to databases with autoscale or standard (manual) throughput. 

### What is the storage limit associated with each max RU/s option?  
The storage limit in GB for each max RU/s is: Max RU/s of database or container / 100. For example, if the max RU/s is 20,000 RU/s, the resource can support 200 GB of storage. 
See the [autoscale limits](provision-throughput-autoscale.md#autoscale-limits) article for the available max RU/s and storage options. 

### What happens if I exceed the storage limit associated with my max throughput?
If the storage limit associated with the max throughput of the database or container is exceeded, Azure Cosmos DB will automatically increase the max throughput to the next highest RU/s that can support that level of storage.

For example, if you start with a max RU/s of 50,000 RU/s (scales between 5000 - 50,000 RU/s), you can store up to 500 GB of data. If you exceed 500 GB - e.g. storage is now 600 GB, the new maximum RU/s will be 60,000 RU/s (scales between 6000 - 60,000 RU/s).

### Can I change the max RU/s on the database or container? 
Yes. See this [article](how-to-provision-autoscale-throughput.md) on how to change the max RU/s. When you change the max RU/s, depending on the requested value, this can be an asynchronous operation that may take some time to complete (may be up to 4-6 hours, depending on the RU/s selected)

#### Increasing the max RU/s
When you send a request to increase the max RU/s `Tmax`, depending on the max RU/s selected, the service provisions more resources to support the higher max RU/s. While this is happening, your existing workload and operations will not be affected. The system will continue to scale your database or container between the previous `0.1*Tmax` to `Tmax` until the new scale range of `0.1*Tmax_new` to `Tmax_new` is ready.

#### Lowering the max RU/s
When you lower the max RU/s, the minimum value you can set it to is: `MAX(4000, highest max RU/s ever provisioned / 10, current storage in GB * 100)`, rounded to the nearest 1000 RU/s. 

Example #1: Suppose you have an autoscale container with max RU/s of 20,000 RU/s (scales between 2000 - 20,000 RU/s) and 50 GB of storage. The lowest, minimum value you can set max RU/s to is: MAX(4000, 20,000 / 10, **50 * 100**) = 5000 RU/s (scales between 500 - 5000 RU/s).

Example #2: Suppose you have an autoscale container with max RU/s of 100,000 RU/s and 100 GB of storage. Now, you scale max RU/s up to 150,000 RU/s (scales between 15,000 - 150,000 RU/s). The lowest, minimum value you can now set max RU/s to is: MAX(4000, **150,000 / 10**, 100 * 100) = 15,000 RU/s (scales between 1500 - 15,000 RU/s). 

For a shared throughput database, when you lower the max RU/s, the minimum value you can set it to is: `MAX(4000, highest max RU/s ever provisioned / 10, current storage in GB * 100,  4000 + (MAX(Container count - 25, 0) * 1000))`, rounded to the nearest 1000 RU/s.  

The above formulas and examples relate to the minimum autoscale max RU/s you can set, and is distinct from the `0.1 * Tmax` to `Tmax` range the system automatically scales between. No matter what the max RU/s is, the system will always scale between `0.1 * Tmax` to `Tmax`. 

### How does TTL work with autoscale?
With autoscale, TTL operations do not affect the scaling of RU/s. Any RUs consumed due to TTL are not part of the billed RU/s of the autoscale container. 

For example, suppose you have an autoscale container with 400 – 4000 RU/s:
- Hour 1: T=0: The container has no usage (no TTL or workload requests). The billable RU/s is 400 RU/s.
- Hour 1: T=1: TTL is enabled.
- Hour 1: T=2: The container starts getting requests, which consume 1000 RU in 1 second. There are also 200 RUs worths of TTL that need to happen. 
The billable RU/s is still 1000 RU/s. Regardless of when the TTLs occur, they will not affect the autoscale scaling logic.

### What is the mapping between the max RU/s and physical partitions?
When you first select the max RU/s, Azure Cosmos DB will provision: Max RU/s / 10,000 RU/s = # of physical partitions. Each [physical partition](partition-data.md#physical-partitions) can support up to 10,000 RU/s and 50 GB of storage. As storage size grows, Azure Cosmos DB will automatically split the partitions to add more physical partitions to handle the storage increase, or increase the max RU/s if storage [exceeds the associated limit](#what-is-the-storage-limit-associated-with-each-max-rus-option). 

The max RU/s of the database or container is divided evenly across all physical partitions. So, the total throughput any single physical partition can scale to is: Max RU/s of database or container / # physical partitions. 

### What happens if incoming requests exceed the max RU/s of the database or container?
If the overall consumed RU/s exceeds the max RU/s of the database or container, requests that exceed the max RU/s will be throttled and return a 429 status code. Requests that result in over 100% normalized utilization will also be throttled. Normalized utilization is defined as the max of the RU/s utilization across all physical partitions. For example, suppose your max throughput is 20,000 RU/s and you have two physical partitions, P_1 and P_2, each capable of scaling to 10,000 RU/s. In a given second, if P_1 has used 6000 RUs, and P_2 8000 RUs, the normalized utilization is MAX(6000 RU / 10,000 RU, 8000 RU / 10,000 RU) = 0.8.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Cosmos DB client SDKs and data import tools (Azure Data Factory, bulk executor library) automatically retry on 429s, so occasional 429s are fine. A sustained high number of 429s may indicate you need to increase the max RU/s or review your partitioning strategy for a [hot partition](#autoscale-rate-limiting).

### <a id="autoscale-rate-limiting"></a> Is it still possible to see 429s (throttling/rate limiting) when autoscale is enabled? 
Yes. It is possible to see 429s in two scenarios. First, when the overall consumed RU/s exceeds the max RU/s of the database or container, the service will throttle requests accordingly. 

Second, if there is a hot partition, i.e. a logical partition key value that has a disproportionately higher amount of requests compared to other partition key values, it is possible for the underlying physical partition to exceed its RU/s budget. As a best practice, to avoid hot partitions, [choose a good partition key](partitioning-overview.md#choose-partitionkey) that results in an even distribution of both storage and throughput. 

For example, if you select the 20,000 RU/s max throughput option and have 200 GB of storage, with four physical partitions, each physical partition can be autoscaled up to 5000 RU/s. If there was a hot partition on a particular logical partition key, you will see 429s when the underlying physical partition it resides in exceeds 5000 RU/s, i.e. exceeds 100% normalized utilization.
