# Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin graph support
Azure Cosmos DB supports [Apache Tinkerpop's](https://tinkerpop.apache.org) graph traversal language, known as [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.3.2/reference/#graph-traversal-steps). You can use the Gremlin language to create graph entities (vertices and edges), modify properties within those entities, perform queries and traversals, and delete entities. 

In this article, we provide a quick walkthrough of Gremlin and enumerate the Gremlin features that are supported by the Gremlin API.

## Compatible client libraries

The following table shows popular Gremlin drivers that you can use against Azure Cosmos DB:

## Supported Graph Objects
TinkerPop is a standard that covers a wide range of graph technologies. Therefore, it has standard terminology to describe what features are provided by a graph provider. Azure Cosmos DB provides a persistent, high concurrency, writeable graph database that can be partitioned across multiple servers or clusters. 

The following table lists the TinkerPop features that are implemented by Azure Cosmos DB: 

| Category | Azure Cosmos DB implementation |  Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph features | Provides Persistence and ConcurrentAccess. Designed to support Transactions | Computer methods can be implemented via the Spark connector. |
| Variable features | Supports Boolean, Integer, Byte, Double, Float, Integer, Long, String | Supports primitive types, is compatible with complex types via data model |
| Vertex features | Supports RemoveVertices, MetaProperties, AddVertices, MultiProperties, StringIds, UserSuppliedIds, AddProperty, RemoveProperty  | Supports creating, modifying, and deleting vertices |
| Vertex property features | StringIds, UserSuppliedIds, AddProperty, RemoveProperty, BooleanValues, ByteValues, DoubleValues, FloatValues, IntegerValues, LongValues, StringValues | Supports creating, modifying, and deleting vertex properties |
| Edge features | AddEdges, RemoveEdges, StringIds, UserSuppliedIds, AddProperty, RemoveProperty | Supports creating, modifying, and deleting edges |
| Edge property features | Properties, BooleanValues, ByteValues, DoubleValues, FloatValues, IntegerValues, LongValues, StringValues | Supports creating, modifying, and deleting edge properties |

## Gremlin wire format: GraphSON

Azure Cosmos DB uses the [GraphSON format](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#graphson) when returning results from Gremlin operations. Azure Cosmos DB currently supports "GraphSONv2" version. GraphSON is the Gremlin standard format for representing vertices, edges, and properties (single and multi-valued properties) using JSON.

For example, the following snippet shows a GraphSON representation of a vertex *returned to the client* from Azure Cosmos DB. 

```json
  {
    "id": "a7111ba7-0ea1-43c9-b6b2-efc5e3aea4c0",
    "label": "person",
    "type": "vertex",
    "outE": {
      "knows": [
        {
          "id": "3ee53a60-c561-4c5e-9a9f-9c7924bc9aef",
          "inV": "04779300-1c8e-489d-9493-50fd1325a658"
        },
        {
          "id": "21984248-ee9e-43a8-a7f6-30642bc14609",
          "inV": "a8e3e741-2ef7-4c01-b7c8-199f8e43e3bc"
        }
      ]
    },
    "properties": {
      "firstName": [
        {
          "value": "Thomas"
        }
      ],
      "lastName": [
        {
          "value": "Andersen"
        }
      ],
      "age": [
        {
          "value": 45
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

The properties used by GraphSON for vertices are described below:

| Property | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | The ID for the vertex. Must be unique (in combination with the value of `_partition` if applicable). If no value is provided, it will be automatically supplied with a GUID | 
| `label` | The label of the vertex. This property is used to describe the entity type. |
| `type` | Used to distinguish vertices from non-graph documents |
| `properties` | Bag of user-defined properties associated with the vertex. Each property can have multiple values. |
| `_partition` | The partition key of the vertex. Used for [graph partitioning](graph-partitioning.md). |
| `outE` | This property contains a list of out edges from a vertex. Storing the adjacency information with vertex allows for fast execution of traversals. Edges are grouped based on their labels. |

And the edge contains the following information to help with navigation to other parts of the graph.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The ID for the edge. Must be unique (in combination with the value of `_partition` if applicable) |
| `label` | The label of the edge. This property is optional, and used to describe the relationship type. |
| `inV` | This property contains a list of in vertices for an edge. Storing the adjacency information with the edge allows for fast execution of traversals. Vertices are grouped based on their labels. |
| `properties` | Bag of user-defined properties associated with the edge. Each property can have multiple values. |

Each property can store multiple values within an array. 

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `value` | The value of the property

The write-optimized engine provided by Azure Cosmos DB supports automatic indexing of all properties within vertices and edges by default. Therefore, queries with filters, range queries, sorting, or aggregates on any property are processed from the index, and served efficiently. For more information on how indexing works in Azure Cosmos DB, see our paper on [schema-agnostic indexing](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1668-shukla.pdf).
