|---------|---------|
|Basic|Provides a quick, high-level RU/s and cost estimate.

To learn more, see how to [estimate cost with basic mode](#basic-mode).|
|Advanced|Provides a more detailed RU/s and cost estimate, with the ability to tune more settingsâ€”indexing policy, consistency level, and other parameters that affect the cost and throughput. <br/><br/>Use advanced mode when you are estimating RU/s for a new project or want a more detailed estimate.
