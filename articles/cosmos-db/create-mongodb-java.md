# Quickstart: Build a web app using Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB and Java SDK

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Cosmos DB. 

This quickstart demonstrates how to create a Cosmos account with [Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB](mongodb-introduction.md). You'll then build and deploy a console app built using the [MongoDB Java driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/java/). 

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
* [Install the JDK for Azure and Azure Stack JDK version 8] (https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)
* Maven (Run `apt-get install maven` if you don't have Maven)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-emulator-mongodb](../../includes/cosmos-db-emulator-mongodb.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [mongodb-create-dbaccount](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-mongodb.md)]

## Add a collection

Name your new database, **db**, and your new collection, **coll**.

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-collection](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-collection.md)] 

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone an app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```bash
    md "C:\git-samples"
    ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.

    ```bash
    cd "C:\git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-java-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Then open the code in your favorite editor. 

## Review the code

This step is optional. If you're interested in learning how the database resources are created in the code, you can review the following snippets. Otherwise, you can skip ahead to [Update your connection string](#update-your-connection-string). 

The following snippets are all taken from the Program.java file.

* The DocumentClient is initialized.

    ```java
    MongoClientURI uri = new MongoClientURI("FILLME");`

    MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(uri);            
    ```

* A new database and collection are created.

    ```java
    MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("db");

    MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("coll");
    ```

* Some documents are inserted using `MongoCollection.insertOne`

    ```java
    Document document = new Document("fruit", "apple")
    collection.insertOne(document);
    ```

* Some queries are performed using `MongoCollection.find`

    ```java
    Document queryResult = collection.find(Filters.eq("fruit", "apple")).first();
    System.out.println(queryResult.toJson());    	
    ```

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. From the Account, select **Quick Start**, select Java, then copy the connection string to your clipboard

2. Open the `Program.java` file, replace the argument to the MongoClientURI constructor with the connection string. You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 
    
## Run the console app

1. Run `mvn package` in a terminal to install required npm modules

2. Run `mvn exec:java -D exec.mainClass=GetStarted.Program` in a terminal to start your Java application.

You can now use [Robomongo](mongodb-robomongo.md) / [Studio 3T](mongodb-mongochef.md) to query, modify, and work with this new data.

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-tutorial-review-slas](../../includes/cosmos-db-tutorial-review-slas.md)]

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-delete-resource-group](../../includes/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create a Cosmos account, create a collection and run a console app. You can now import additional data to your Cosmos database.
