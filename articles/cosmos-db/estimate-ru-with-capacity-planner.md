# Estimate RU/s using the Azure Cosmos DB capacity planner - SQL API
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

Configuring your Azure Cosmos databases and containers with the right amount of provisioned throughput, or [Request Units (RU/s)](request-units.md), for your workload is essential to optimizing cost and performance. This article describes how to use the Azure Cosmos DB [capacity planner](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator/) to get an estimate of the required RU/s and cost of your workload when using the SQL API. If you are using API for MongoDB, see how to [use capacity calculator with MongoDB](mongodb/estimate-ru-capacity-planner.md) article.

[!INCLUDE [capacity planner modes](includes/capacity-planner-modes.md)]

## <a id="basic-mode"></a>Estimate provisioned throughput and cost using basic mode
To get a quick estimate for your workload using the basic mode, navigate to the [capacity planner](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator/). Enter in the following parameters based on your workload:

|**Input**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
| API |Choose SQL (Core) API |
|Number of regions|Azure Cosmos DB is available in all Azure regions. Select the number of regions required for your workload. You can associate any number of regions with your Cosmos account. See [global distribution](distribute-data-globally.md) in Azure Cosmos DB for more details.|
|Multi-region writes|If you enable [multi-region writes](distribute-data-globally.md#key-benefits-of-global-distribution), your application can read and write to any Azure region. If you disable multi-region writes, your application can write data to a single region. <br/><br/> Enable multi-region writes if you expect to have an active-active workload that requires low latency writes in different regions. For example, an IOT workload that writes data to the database at high volumes in different regions. <br/><br/> Multi-region writes guarantees 99.999% read and write availability. Multi-region writes require more throughput when compared to the single write regions. To learn more, see [how RUs are different for single and multiple-write regions](optimize-cost-regions.md) article.|
|Total data stored in transactional store |Total estimated data stored(GB) in the transactional store in a single region.|
|Use analytical store| Choose **On** if you want to use analytical store. Enter the **Total data stored in analytical store**, it represents the estimated data stored (GB) in the analytical store in a single region.  |
|Item size|The estimated size of the data item (for example, document), ranging from 1 KB to 2 MB. |
|Queries/sec |Number of queries expected per second per region. The average RU charge to run a query is estimated at 10 RUs. |
|Point reads/sec |Number of point read operations expected per second per region. Point reads are the key/value lookup on a single item ID and a partition key. To learn more about point reads, see the [options to read data](optimize-cost-reads-writes.md#reading-data-point-reads-and-queries) article. |
|Creates/sec |Number of create operations expected per second per region. |
|Updates/sec |Number of update operations expected per second per region. When you choose automatic indexing, the estimated RU/s for the update operation is calculated as one property being changed per an update. |
|Deletes/sec |Number of delete operations expected per second per region. |

After filling the required details, select **Calculate**. The **Cost Estimate** tab shows the total cost for storage and provisioned throughput. You can expand the **Show Details** link in this tab to get the breakdown of the throughput required for different CRUD and query requests. Each time you change the value of any field, select **Calculate** to recalculate the estimated cost.

## <a id="advanced-mode"></a>Estimate provisioned throughput and cost using advanced mode

Advanced mode allows you to provide more settings that impact the RU/s estimate. To use this option, navigate to the [capacity planner](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator/) and **sign in** to the tool with an account you use for Azure. The sign-in option is available at the right-hand corner.

After you sign in, you can see more fields compared to the fields in basic mode. Enter the other parameters based on your workload.

|**Input**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|API|Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-model and multi-API service. Choose SQL(Core) API. |
|Number of regions|Azure Cosmos DB is available in all Azure regions. Select the number of regions required for your workload. You can associate any number of regions with your Cosmos account. See [global distribution](distribute-data-globally.md) in Azure Cosmos DB for more details.|
|Multi-region writes|If you enable [multi-region writes](distribute-data-globally.md#key-benefits-of-global-distribution), your application can read and write to any Azure region. If you disable multi-region writes, your application can write data to a single region. <br/><br/> Enable multi-region writes if you expect to have an active-active workload that requires low latency writes in different regions. For example, an IOT workload that writes data to the database at high volumes in different regions. <br/><br/> Multi-region writes guarantees 99.999% read and write availability. Multi-region writes require more throughput when compared to the single write regions. To learn more, see [how RUs are different for single and multiple-write regions](optimize-cost-regions.md) article.|
|Default consistency|Azure Cosmos DB supports 5 consistency levels, to allow developers to balance the tradeoff between consistency, availability, and latency tradeoffs. To learn more, see the [consistency levels](consistency-levels.md) article. <br/><br/> By default, Azure Cosmos DB uses session consistency, which guarantees the ability to read your own writes in a session. <br/><br/> Choosing strong or bounded staleness will require double the required RU/s for reads, when compared to session, consistent prefix, and eventual consistency. Strong consistency with multi-region writes is not supported and will automatically default to single-region writes with strong consistency. |
|Indexing policy|By default, Azure Cosmos DB [indexes all properties](index-policy.md) in all items for flexible and efficient queries (maps to the **Automatic** indexing policy). <br/><br/> If you choose **off**, none of the properties are indexed. This results in the lowest RU charge for writes. Select **off** policy if you expect to only do [point reads](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container.readitemasync) (key value lookups) and/or writes, and no queries. <br/><br/> If you choose **Automatic**, Azure CosmosDB automatically indexes all the items as they are written. <br/><br/> **Custom** indexing policy allows you to include or exclude specific properties from the index for lower write throughput and storage. To learn more, see [indexing policy](index-overview.md) and [sample indexing policies](how-to-manage-indexing-policy.md#indexing-policy-examples) articles.|
|Total data stored in transactional store |Total estimated data stored(GB) in the transactional store in a single region.|
|Use analytical store| Choose **On** if you want to use analytical store. Enter the **Total data stored in analytical store**, it represents the estimated data stored(GB) in the analytical store in a single region.  |
|Workload mode|Select **Steady** option if your workload volume is constant. <br/><br/> Select **Variable** option if your workload volume changes over time.  For example, during a specific day or a month. The following setting is available if you choose the variable workload option:<ul><li>Percentage of time at peak: Percentage of time in a month where your workload requires peak (highest) throughput. </li></ul> <br/><br/> For example, if you have a workload that has high activity during 9am â€“ 6pm weekday business hours, then the percentage of time at peak is: 45 hours at peak / 730 hours / month = ~6%.<br/><br/>With peak and off-peak intervals, you can optimize your cost by [programmatically scaling your provisioned throughput](set-throughput.md#update-throughput-on-a-database-or-a-container) up and down accordingly.|
|Item size|The size of the data item (for example, document), ranging from 1 KB to 2 MB. You can add estimates for multiple sample items. <br/><br/>You can also **Upload sample (JSON)** document for a more accurate estimate.<br/><br/>If your workload has multiple types of items (with different JSON content) in the same container, you can upload multiple JSON documents and get the estimate. Use the **Add new item** button to add multiple sample JSON documents.|
| Number of properties | The average number of properties per an item. |
|Point reads/sec |Number of point read operations expected per second per region. Point reads are the key/value lookup on a single item ID and a partition key. Point read operations are different from query read operations. To learn more about point reads, see the [options to read data](optimize-cost-reads-writes.md#reading-data-point-reads-and-queries) article. If your workload mode is **Variable**, you can provide the expected number of point read operations at peak and off peak. |
|Creates/sec |Number of create operations expected per second per region. |
|Updates/sec |Number of update operations expected per second per region. |
|Deletes/sec |Number of delete operations expected per second per region. |
|Queries/sec |Number of queries expected per second per region. For an accurate estimate, either use the average cost of queries or enter the RU/s your queries use from query stats in Azure portal. |
| Average RU/s charge per query | By default, the average cost of queries/sec per region is estimated at 10 RU/s. You can increase or decrease it based on the RU/s charges based on your estimated query charge.|

You can also use the **Save Estimate** button to download a CSV file containing the current estimate.
