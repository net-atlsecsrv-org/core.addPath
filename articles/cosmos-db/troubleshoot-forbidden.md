# Diagnose and troubleshoot Azure Cosmos DB forbidden exceptions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

The HTTP status code 403 represents the request is forbidden to complete.

## Firewall blocking requests
On this scenario, it's common to see errors like the ones below:

```
Request originated from client IP {...} through public internet. This is blocked by your Cosmos DB account firewall settings.
```

```
Request is blocked. Please check your authorization token and Cosmos DB account firewall settings
```

### Solution
Verify that your current [firewall settings](how-to-configure-firewall.md) are correct and include the IPs or networks you are trying to connect from.
If you recently updated them, keep in mind that changes can take **up to 15 minutes to apply**.

## Next steps
* Configure [IP Firewall](how-to-configure-firewall.md).
* Configure access from [virtual networks](how-to-configure-vnet-service-endpoint.md).
* Configure access from [private endpoints](how-to-configure-private-endpoints.md).
