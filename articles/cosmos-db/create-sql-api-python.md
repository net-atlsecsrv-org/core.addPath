In this quickstart, you create and manage an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account from the Azure portal, and from Visual Studio Code with a Python app cloned from GitHub. Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-model database service that lets you quickly create and query document, table, key-value, and graph databases with global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio). Or [try Azure Cosmos DB for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cosmosdb/) without an Azure subscription. You can also use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-emulator) with a URI of `https://localhost:8081` and the key `C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==`.
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), with the `python` executable in your `PATH`.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python#overview).
- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads). 

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount.md)]

## Add a container

You can now use the Data Explorer tool in the Azure portal to create a database and container. 

1. Select **Data Explorer** > **New Container**. 
    
    The **Add Container** area is displayed on the far right, you may need to scroll right to see it.

    ![The Azure portal Data Explorer, Add Container pane](./media/create-sql-api-python/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer.png)

2. In the **Add container** page, enter the settings for the new container.

    |Setting|Suggested value|Description
    |---|---|---|
    |**Database ID**|Tasks|Enter *Tasks* as the name for the new database. Database names must contain from 1 through 255 characters, and they cannot contain `/, \\, #, ?`, or a trailing space. Check the **Provision database throughput** option, it allows you to share the throughput provisioned to the database across all the containers within the database. This option also helps with cost savings. |
    |**Throughput**|400|Leave the throughput at 400 request units per second (RU/s). If you want to reduce latency, you can scale up the throughput later.| 
    |**Container ID**|Items|Enter *Items* as the name for your new container. Container IDs have the same character requirements as database names.|
    |**Partition key**| /category| The sample described in this article uses */category* as the partition key.|
    
    In addition to the preceding settings, you can optionally add **Unique keys** for the container. Let's leave the field empty in this example. Unique keys provide developers with the ability to add a layer of data integrity to the database. By creating a unique key policy while creating a container, you ensure the uniqueness of one or more values per partition key. To learn more, refer to the [Unique keys in Azure Cosmos DB](unique-keys.md) article.
    
    Select **OK**. The Data Explorer displays the new database and container.

## Add sample data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-sql-api-add-sample-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-sql-api-add-sample-data.md)]

## Query your data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-sql-api-query-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-sql-api-query-data.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a SQL API app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. This quickstart uses version 4 of the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cosmos/#history).

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```cmd
    md "git-samples"
    ```
   If you are using a bash prompt, you should instead use the following command:

   ```bash
   mkdir "git-samples"
   ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.

    ```bash
    cd "git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started.git
    ```  

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. In your Azure Cosmos DB account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Keys** from the left navigation. Use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the **URI** and **Primary Key** into the *cosmos_get_started.py* file in the next step.

    ![Get an access key and URI in the Keys settings in the Azure portal](./media/create-sql-api-dotnet/access-key-and-uri-in-keys-settings-in-the-azure-portal.png)

2. In Visual Studio Code, open the *cosmos_get_started.py* file in *\git-samples\azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started*.

3. Copy your **URI** value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the **endpoint** variable in *cosmos_get_started.py*. 

    `endpoint = 'https://FILLME.documents.azure.com',`

4. Then copy your **PRIMARY KEY** value from the portal and make it the value of the **key** in *cosmos_get_started.py*. You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 

    `key = 'FILLME'`

5. Save the *cosmos_get_started.py* file.

## Review the code

This step is optional. Learn about the database resources created in code, or skip ahead to [Update your connection string](#update-your-connection-string).

The following snippets are all taken from the *cosmos_get_started.py* file.

* The CosmosClient is initialized. Make sure to update the "endpoint" and "key" values as described in the [Update your connection string](#update-your-connection-string) section. 

    [!code-python[](~/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started/cosmos_get_started.py?name=create_cosmos_client)]

* A new database is created.

    [!code-python[](~/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started/cosmos_get_started.py?name=create_database_if_not_exists)]

* A new container is created, with 400 RU/s of [provisioned throughput](request-units.md). We choose `lastName` as the [partition key](partitioning-overview.md#choose-partitionkey), which allows us to do efficient queries that filter on this property. 

    [!code-python[](~/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started/cosmos_get_started.py?name=create_container_if_not_exists)]

* Some items are added to the container. Containers are a collection of items (JSON documents) that can have varied schema. The helper methods ```get_[name]_family_item``` return representations of a family that are stored in Azure Cosmos DB as JSON documents.

    [!code-python[](~/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started/cosmos_get_started.py?name=create_item)]

* Point reads (key value lookups) are performed using the `read_item` method. We print out the [RU charge](request-units.md) of each operation.

    [!code-python[](~/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started/cosmos_get_started.py?name=read_item)]

* A query is performed using SQL query syntax. Because we're using partition key values of ```lastName``` in the WHERE clause, Azure Cosmos DB will efficiently route this query to the relevant partitions, improving performance.

    [!code-python[](~/azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started/cosmos_get_started.py?name=query_items)]
   
## Run the app

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **View** > **Command Palette**. 

2. At the prompt, enter  **Python: Select Interpreter** and then select the version of Python to use.

    The Footer in Visual Studio Code is updated to indicate the interpreter selected. 

3. Select **View** > **Integrated Terminal** to open the Visual Studio Code integrated terminal.

4. In the integrated terminal window, ensure you are in the *azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started* folder. If not, run the following command to switch to the sample folder. 

    ```cmd
    cd "\git-samples\azure-cosmos-db-python-getting-started"`
    ```

5. Run the following command to install the azure-cosmos package. 

    ```python
    pip install --pre azure-cosmos
    ```

    If you get an error about access being denied when attempting to install azure-cosmos, you'll need to [run VS Code as an administrator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37700536/visual-studio-code-terminal-how-to-run-a-command-with-administrator-rights).

6. Run the following command to run the sample and create and store new documents in Azure Cosmos DB.

    ```python
    python cosmos_get_started.py
    ```

7. To confirm the new items were created and saved, in the Azure portal, select **Data Explorer** > **AzureSampleFamilyDatabase** > **Items**. View the items that were created. For example, here is a sample JSON document for the Andersen family:
   
   ```json
   {
       "id": "Andersen-1569479288379",
       "lastName": "Andersen",
       "district": "WA5",
       "parents": [
           {
               "familyName": null,
               "firstName": "Thomas"
           },
           {
               "familyName": null,
               "firstName": "Mary Kay"
           }
       ],
       "children": null,
       "address": {
           "state": "WA",
           "county": "King",
           "city": "Seattle"
       },
       "registered": true,
       "_rid": "8K5qAIYtZXeBhB4AAAAAAA==",
       "_self": "dbs/8K5qAA==/colls/8K5qAIYtZXc=/docs/8K5qAIYtZXeBhB4AAAAAAA==/",
       "_etag": "\"a3004d78-0000-0800-0000-5d8c5a780000\"",
       "_attachments": "attachments/",
       "_ts": 1569479288
   }
