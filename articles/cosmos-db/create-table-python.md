# Quickstart: Build a Table API app with Python and Azure Cosmos DB

This quickstart shows how to use Python and the Azure Cosmos DB [Table API](table-introduction.md) to build an app by cloning an example from GitHub. This quickstart also shows you how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account and how to use Data Explorer to create tables and entities in the web-based Azure portal.

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, wide-column, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api](../../includes/cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api.md)]

In addition:

* If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you select the **Azure development** and **Python development** workloads during the Visual Studio setup.
* Also select the Python 2 option in the **Python development** workload, or download Python 2.7 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/).

## Create a database account

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You need to create a new Table API account to work with the generally available Table API SDKs. Table API accounts created during preview are not supported by the generally available SDKs.

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

## Add a table

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table.md)]

## Add sample data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table-add-sample-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table-add-sample-data.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Table app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```bash
    md "C:\git-samples"
    ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.

    ```bash
    cd "C:\git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-python-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Then open the solution file in Visual Studio. 

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app. This enables your app to communicate with your hosted database. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Connection String**. 

    ![View and copy the CONNECTION STRING in the Connection String pane](./media/create-table-python/connection-string.png)

2. Copy the ACCOUNT NAME using the button on the right side.

3. Open the config.py file, and paste the ACCOUNT NAME from the portal into the STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME value on line 19.

4. Go back to the portal and copy the PRIMARY KEY.

5. Paste the PRIMARY KEY from the portal into the STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY value on line 20.

3. Save the config.py file.

## Run the app

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in **Solution Explorer**, select the current Python environment, then right click.

2. Select Install Python Package, then enter **azure-storage-table**

3. Run F5 to run the application. Your app displays in your browser. 

You can now go back to Data Explorer and see query, modify, and work with this new data. 

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-tutorial-review-slas](../../includes/cosmos-db-tutorial-review-slas.md)]

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-delete-resource-group](../../includes/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a table using the Data Explorer, and run an app.  Now you can query your data using the Table API.
