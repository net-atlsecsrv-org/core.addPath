# Use built-in notebook commands and features in Azure Cosmos DB Python notebooks (preview)

Built-in Jupyter notebooks in Azure Cosmos DB enable you to analyze and visualize your data from the Azure portal. This article describes how to use built-in notebook commands and features to do common operations in Python notebooks.

## Install a new package
After you enable notebook support for your Azure Cosmos accounts, you can open a new notebook and install a package.

In a new code cell, insert and run the following code, replacing ``PackageToBeInstalled`` with the desired Python package.
```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install PackageToBeInstalled --user
```
This package will be available to use from any notebook in the Azure Cosmos account workspace. 

> [!TIP]
> If your notebook requires a custom package, we recommend that you add a cell in your notebook to install the package, as packages are removed if you [reset the workspace](#reset-notebooks-workspace).  

## Run a SQL query

You can use the ``%%sql`` magic command to run a [SQL query](sql-query-getting-started.md) against any container in your account. Use the syntax:

```python
%%sql --database {database_id} --container {container_id}
{Query text}
```

- Replace ``{database_id}`` and ``{container_id}`` with the name of the database and container in your Cosmos account. If the ``--database`` and ``--container`` arguments are not provided, the query will be executed on the [default database and container](#set-default-database-for-queries).
- You can run any SQL query that is valid in Azure Cosmos DB. 
The query text must be on a new line.

For example: 
```python
%%sql --database RetailDemo --container WebsiteData
SELECT c.Action, c.Price as ItemRevenue, c.Country, c.Item FROM c
```
Run ```%%sql?``` in a cell to see the help documentation for the sql magic command in the notebook.

## Run a SQL query and output to a Pandas DataFrame

You can output the results of a ``%%sql`` query into a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/dsintro.html#dataframe). Use the syntax: 

```python
%%sql --database {database_id} --container {container_id} --output {outputDataFrameVar}
{Query text}
```
- Replace ``{database_id}`` and ``{container_id}`` with the name of the database and container in your Cosmos account. If the ``--database`` and ``--container`` arguments are not provided, the query will be executed on the [default database and container](#set-default-database-for-queries).
- Replace ``{outputDataFrameVar}`` with the name of the DataFrame variable that will contain the results.
- You can run any SQL query that is valid in Azure Cosmos DB. 
The query text must be on a new line. 

For example:

```python
%%sql --database RetailDemo --container WebsiteData --output df_cosmos
SELECT c.Action, c.Price as ItemRevenue, c.Country, c.Item FROM c
```
```python
df_cosmos.head(10)

    Action    ItemRevenue    Country/Region    Item
0    Viewed    9.00    Tunisia    Black Tee
1    Viewed    19.99    Antigua and Barbuda    Flannel Shirt
2    Added    3.75    Guinea-Bissau    Socks
3    Viewed    3.75    Guinea-Bissau    Socks
4    Viewed    55.00    Czech Republic    Rainjacket
5    Viewed    350.00    Iceland    Cosmos T-shirt
6    Added    19.99    Syrian Arab Republic    Button-Up Shirt
7    Viewed    19.99    Syrian Arab Republic    Button-Up Shirt
8    Viewed    33.00    Tuvalu    Red Top
9    Viewed    14.00    Cabo Verde    Flip Flop Shoes
```
## Set default database for queries
You can set the default database ```%%sql``` commands will use for the notebook. Replace ```{database_id}``` with the name of your database.

```python
%database {database_id}
```
Run ```%database?``` in a cell to see documentation in the notebook.

## Set default container for queries
You can set the default container ```%%sql``` commands will use for the notebook. Replace ```{container_id}``` with the name of your container.

```python
%container {container_id}
```
Run ```%container?``` in a cell to see documentation in the notebook.

## Upload JSON items to a container
You can use the ``%%upload`` magic command to upload data from a JSON file to a specified Azure Cosmos container. Use the following command to upload the items:

```python
%%upload --databaseName {database_id} --containerName {container_id} --url {url_location_of_file}
```

- Replace ``{database_id}`` and ``{container_id}`` with the name of the database and container in your Azure Cosmos account. If the ``--database`` and ``--container`` arguments are not provided, the query will be executed on the [default database and container](#set-default-database-for-queries).
- Replace ``{url_location_of_file}`` with the location of your JSON file. The file must be an array of valid JSON objects and it should be accessible over the public Internet.

For example:

```python
%%upload --database databaseName --container containerName --url 
https://contoso.com/path/to/data.json
```
```
Documents successfully uploaded to ContainerName
Total number of documents imported : 2654
Total time taken : 00:00:38.1228087 hours
Total RUs consumed : 25022.58
```
With the output statistics, you can calculate the effective RU/s used to upload the items. For example, if 25,000 RUs were consumed over 38 seconds, the effective RU/s is 25,000 RUs / 38 seconds = 658 RU/s.

## Run another notebook in current notebook 
You can use the ``%%run`` magic command to run another notebook in your workspace from your current notebook. Use the syntax:

```python
%%run ./path/to/{notebookName}.ipynb
```
Replace ``{notebookName}`` with the name of the notebook you want to run. The notebook must be in your current 'My Notebooks' workspace. 

## Use built-in nteract data explorer
You can use the built-in [nteract data explorer](https://blog.nteract.io/designing-the-nteract-data-explorer-f4476d53f897) to filter and visualize a DataFrame. To enable this feature, set the option ``pd.options.display.html.table_schema`` to ``True`` and ``pd.options.display.max_rows`` to the desired value (you can set ``pd.options.display.max_rows`` to ``None`` to show all results).

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.options.display.html.table_schema = True
pd.options.display.max_rows = None

df_cosmos.groupby("Item").size()
```

## Use the built-in Python SDK
Version 4 of the [Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK for SQL API](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos) is installed and included in the notebook environment for the Azure Cosmos account.

Use the built-in ``cosmos_client`` instance to run any SDK operation. 

For example:

```python
## Import modules as needed
from azure.cosmos.partition_key import PartitionKey

## Create a new database if it doesn't exist
database = cosmos_client.create_database_if_not_exists('RetailDemo')

## Create a new container if it doesn't exist
container = database.create_container_if_not_exists(id='WebsiteData', partition_key=PartitionKey(path='/CartID'))
```
See [Python SDK samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/samples). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The built-in Python SDK is only supported for SQL (Core) API accounts. For other APIs, you will need to [install the relevant Python driver](#install-a-new-package) that corresponds to the API. 

## Create a custom instance of ``cosmos_client``
For more flexibility, you can create a custom instance of ``cosmos_client`` in order to:

- Customize the [connection policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cosmos/azure.cosmos.documents.connectionpolicy?view=azure-python-preview)
- Run operations against a different Azure Cosmos account than the one you are in

You can access the connection string and primary key of the current account via the [environment variables](#access-the-account-endpoint-and-primary-key-env-variables). 

```python
import azure.cosmos.cosmos_client as cosmos
import azure.cosmos.documents as documents

# These should be set to a region you've added for Azure Cosmos DB
region_1 = "Central US" 
region_2 = "East US 2"

custom_connection_policy = documents.ConnectionPolicy()
custom_connection_policy.PreferredLocations = [region_1, region_2] # Set the order of regions the SDK will route requests to. The regions should be regions you've added for Cosmos, otherwise this will error.

# Create a new instance of CosmosClient, getting the endpoint and key from the environment variables
custom_client = cosmos.CosmosClient(url=COSMOS.ENDPOINT, credential=COSMOS.KEY, connection_policy=custom_connection_policy)

```
## Access the account endpoint and primary key env variables
You can access the built-in endpoint and key of the account your notebook is in.

```python
endpoint = COSMOS.ENDPOINT
primary_key = COSMOS.KEY
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ``COSMOS.ENDPOINT`` and ``COSMOS.KEY`` variables are only applicable for SQL API. For other APIs, find the endpoint and key in the **Connection Strings** or **Keys** blade in your Azure Cosmos account.  

## Reset notebooks workspace
To reset the notebooks workspace to the default settings, select **Reset Workspace** on the command bar. This will remove any custom installed packages and restart the Jupyter server. Your notebooks, files, and Azure Cosmos resources will not be affected.
