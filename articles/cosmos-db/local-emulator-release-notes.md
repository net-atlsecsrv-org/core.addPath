## Release notes

### 2.9.1

- This release fixes couple issues in the query API support and restores compatibility with older OSs such as Windows Server 2012.

### 2.9.0

- This release adds the option to set the consistency to consistent prefix and increase the maximum limits for users and permissions.

### 2.7.2

- This release adds MongoDB version 3.6 server support to the Cosmos Emulator. To start a MongoDB endpoint that target version 3.6 of the service, start the emulator from an Administrator command line with "/EnableMongoDBEndpoint=3.6" option.

### 2.7.0

- This release fixes a regression which prevented users from executing queries against the SQL API account from the emulator when using .NET core or x86 .NET based clients.

### 2.4.6

- This release provides parity with the features in the Azure Cosmos service as of July 2019, with the exceptions noted in [Develop locally with Azure Cosmos emulator](local-emulator.md). It also fixes several bugs related to emulator shutdown when invoked via command line and internal IP address overrides for SDK clients using direct mode connectivity.

### 2.4.3

- Disabled starting the MongoDB service by default. Only the SQL endpoint is enabled as default. The user must start the endpoint manually using the emulator's "/EnableMongoDbEndpoint" command-line option. Now, it's like all the other service endpoints, such as Gremlin, Cassandra, and Table.
- Fixed a bug in the emulator when starting with “/AllowNetworkAccess” where the Gremlin, Cassandra, and Table endpoints weren't properly handling requests from external clients.
- Add direct connection ports to the Firewall Rules settings.

### 2.4.0

- Fixed an issue with emulator failing to start when network monitoring apps, such as Pulse Client, are present on the host computer.
