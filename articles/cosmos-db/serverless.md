# Azure Cosmos DB serverless (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Cosmos DB serverless is currently in preview. This preview version is provided without a Service Level Agreement and is not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental terms of use for Microsoft Azure previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Cosmos DB serverless lets you use your Azure Cosmos account in a consumption-based fashion where you are only charged for the Request Units consumed by your database operations and the storage consumed by your data. There is no minimum charge involved when using Azure Cosmos DB in serverless mode.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Do you have any feedback about serverless? We want to hear it! Feel free to drop a message to the Azure Cosmos DB serverless team: [azurecosmosdbserverless@service.microsoft.com](mailto:azurecosmosdbserverless@service.microsoft.com).

When using Azure Cosmos DB, every database operation has a cost expressed in [Request Units](request-units.md). How you are charged for this cost depends on the type of Azure Cosmos account you are using:

- In [provisioned throughput](set-throughput.md) mode, you have to commit to a certain amount of throughput (expressed in Request Units per second) that is provisioned on your databases and containers. The cost of your database operations is then deducted from the number of Request Units available every second. At the end of your billing period, you get billed for the amount of throughput you have provisioned.
- In serverless mode, you don't have to provision any throughput when creating containers in your Azure Cosmos account. At the end of your billing period, you get billed for the number of Request Units that were consumed by your database operations.

## Use-cases

Azure Cosmos DB serverless best fits scenarios where you expect:

- **Light traffic**: Because provisioning capacity in such situations isn't required and may be cost-prohibitive
- **Moderate burstability**: Because serverless containers can deliver up to 5,000 Request Units per second
- **Moderate performance**: Because serverless containers have [specific performance characteristics](#performance)

For these reasons, Azure Cosmos DB serverless should be considered for the following types of workload:

- Development
- Testing
- Prototyping
- Proof of concept
- Non-critical application with light traffic

See the [how to choose between provisioned throughput and serverless](throughput-serverless.md) article for more guidance on how to choose the offer that best fits your use-case.

## Using serverless resources

Serverless is a new Azure Cosmos account type, which means that you have to choose between **provisioned throughput** and **serverless** when creating a new account. You must create a new serverless account to get started with serverless. During the preview release, the only supported way to create a new serverless account is by [using the Azure portal](create-cosmosdb-resources-portal.md). Migrating existing accounts to/from serverless mode is not currently supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Serverless is currently supported on the Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API only.

Any container that is created in a serverless account is a serverless container. Serverless containers expose the same capabilities as containers created in provisioned throughput mode, so you read, write and query your data the exact same way. However serverless accounts and containers also have specific characteristics:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of these limitations may be eased or removed when serverless becomes generally available and **your feedback** will help us decide! Reach out and tell us more about your serverless experience: [azurecosmosdbserverless@service.microsoft.com](mailto:azurecosmosdbserverless@service.microsoft.com).

- A serverless account can only run in a single Azure region. It is not possible to add additional Azure regions to a serverless account after you create it.
- It is not possible to enable the [Synapse Link preview feature](synapse-link.md) on a serverless account.
- Provisioning throughput is not required on serverless containers, so the following statements are applicable:
    - You can't pass any throughput when creating a serverless container and doing so returns an error.
    - You can't read or update the throughput on a serverless container and doing so returns an error.
    - You can't create a shared throughput database in a serverless account and doing so returns an error.
- Serverless containers can deliver a maximum throughput burstability of 5,000 Request Units per second.
- Serverless containers can store a maximum of 50 GB of data and indexes.

## Monitoring your consumption

If you have used Azure Cosmos DB in provisioned throughput mode before, you will find that serverless is more cost-effective when your traffic doesn't justify provisioned capacity. The trade-off is that your costs will become less predictable because you are billed based on the number of requests your database has processed. Because of that, it's important to keep an eye on your current consumption.

When browsing the **Metrics** pane of your account, you will find a chart named **Request Units consumed** under the **Overview** tab. This chart shows how many Request Units your account has consumed:

:::image type="content" source="./media/serverless/request-units-consumed.png" alt-text="Chart showing the consumed Request Units" border="false":::

You can find the same chart when using Azure Monitor, as described [here](monitor-request-unit-usage.md). Note that Azure Monitor lets you setup [alerts](../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview.md), which can be used to notify you when your Request Unit consumption has passed a certain threshold.

## <a id="performance"></a>Performance

Serverless resources yield specific performance characteristics that are different from what provisioned throughput resources deliver:

- **Availability**: After the serverless offer becomes generally available, the availability of serverless containers will be covered by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.9% when Availability Zones (zone redundancy) aren't used. The SLA is 99.99% when Availability Zones are used.
- **Latency**: After the serverless offer becomes generally available, the latency of serverless containers will be covered by a Service Level Objective (SLO) of 10 milliseconds or less for point-reads and 30 milliseconds or less for writes. A point-read operation consists in fetching a single item by its ID and partition key value.
- **Burstability**: After the serverless offer becomes generally available, the burstability of serverless containers will be covered by a Service Level Objective (SLO) of 95%. This means the maximum burstability can be attained at least 95% of the time.

> [!NOTE]
> As any Azure preview, Azure Cosmos DB serverless is excluded from Service Level Agreements (SLA). The performance characteristics mentioned above are provided as a preview of what this offer will deliver when generally available.
