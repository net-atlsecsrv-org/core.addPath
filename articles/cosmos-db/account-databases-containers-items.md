# Azure Cosmos DB resource model

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS). To begin using Azure Cosmos DB, you should initially create an Azure Cosmos account in your Azure subscription and databases, containers, items under it. This article describes the Azure Cosmos DB resource model and different entities in the resource model hierarchy.

The Azure Cosmos account is the fundamental unit of global distribution and high availability. Your Azure Cosmos account contains a unique DNS name and you can manage an account by using Azure portal, Azure CLI or by using different language-specific SDKs. For more information, see [how to manage your Azure Cosmos account](how-to-manage-database-account.md). For globally distributing your data and throughput across multiple Azure regions, you can add and remove Azure regions to your account at any time. You can configure your account to have either a single region or multiple write regions. For more information, see [how to add and remove Azure regions to your account](how-to-manage-database-account.md). You can configure the [default consistency](consistency-levels.md) level on an account.

## Elements in an Azure Cosmos account

Azure Cosmos container is the fundamental unit of scalability. You can virtually have an unlimited provisioned throughput (RU/s) and storage on a container. Azure Cosmos DB transparently partitions your container using the logical partition key that you specify in order to elastically scale your provisioned throughput and storage.

Currently, you can create a maximum of 50 Azure Cosmos accounts under an Azure subscription (this is a soft limit that can be increased via support request). A single Azure Cosmos account can virtually manage unlimited amount of data and provisioned throughput. To manage your data and provisioned throughput, you can create one or more Azure Cosmos databases under your account and within that database, you can create one or more containers. The following image shows the hierarchy of elements in an Azure Cosmos account:

After you create an account under your Azure subscription, you can manage the data in your account by creating databases, containers, and items.

## Azure Cosmos databases

You can create one or multiple Azure Cosmos databases under your account. A database is analogous to a namespace. A database is the unit of management for a set of Azure Cosmos containers. The following table shows how a database is mapped to various API-specific entities:

| Azure Cosmos entity | SQL API | Cassandra API | Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB | Gremlin API | Table API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Azure Cosmos database | Database | Keyspace | Database | Database | NA |

> [!NOTE]
> With Table API accounts, when you create your first table, a default database is automatically created in your Azure Cosmos account.

### Operations on an Azure Cosmos database

You can interact with an Azure Cosmos database with Azure Cosmos APIs as described in the following table:

| Operation | Azure CLI | SQL API | Cassandra API | Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB | Gremlin API | Table API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Enumerate all databases| Yes | Yes | Yes (database is mapped to a keyspace) | Yes | NA | NA |
|Read database| Yes | Yes | Yes (database is mapped to a keyspace) | Yes | NA | NA |
|Create new database| Yes | Yes | Yes (database is mapped to a keyspace) | Yes | NA | NA |
|Update database| Yes | Yes | Yes (database is mapped to a keyspace) | Yes | NA | NA |

## Azure Cosmos containers

An Azure Cosmos container is the unit of scalability both for provisioned throughput and storage. A container is horizontally partitioned and then replicated across multiple regions. The items that you add to the container are automatically grouped into logical partitions, which are distributed across physical partitions, based on the partition key. The throughput on a container is evenly distributed across the physical partitions. To learn more about partitioning and partition keys, see [Partition data](partitioning-overview.md). 

When you create a container, you configure throughput in one of the following modes:

* **Dedicated provisioned throughput mode**: The throughput provisioned on a container is exclusively reserved for that container and it is backed by the SLAs. To learn more, see [How to provision throughput on a container](how-to-provision-container-throughput.md).

* **Shared provisioned throughput mode**: These containers share the provisioned throughput with the other containers in the same database (excluding containers that have been configured with dedicated provisioned throughput). In other words, the provisioned throughput on the database is shared among all the “shared throughput” containers. To learn more, see [How to provision throughput on a database](how-to-provision-database-throughput.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure shared and dedicated throughput only when creating the database and container. To switch from dedicated throughput mode to shared throughput mode (and vice versa) after the container is created, you have to create a new container and migrate the data to the new container. You can migrate the data by using the Azure Cosmos DB change feed feature.

An Azure Cosmos container can scale elastically, whether you create containers by using dedicated or shared provisioned throughput modes.

A container is a schema-agnostic container of items. Items in a container can have arbitrary schemas. For example, an item that represents a person and an item that represents an automobile can be placed in the *same container*. By default, all items that you add to a container are automatically indexed without requiring explicit index or schema management. You can customize the indexing behavior by configuring the [indexing policy](index-overview.md) on a container. 

You can set [Time to Live (TTL)](time-to-live.md) on selected items in a container or for the entire container to gracefully purge those items from the system. Azure Cosmos DB automatically deletes the items when they expire. It also guarantees that a query performed on the container doesn't return the expired items within a fixed bound. To learn more, see [Configure TTL on your container](how-to-time-to-live.md).

You can use [change feed](change-feed.md) to subscribe to the operations log that is managed for each logical partition of your container. Change feed provides the log of all the updates performed on the container, along with the before and after images of the items. For more information, see [Build reactive applications by using change feed](serverless-computing-database.md). You can also configure the retention duration for the change feed by using the change feed policy on the container.

You can register [stored procedures, triggers, user-defined functions (UDFs)](stored-procedures-triggers-udfs.md), and [merge procedures](how-to-manage-conflicts.md) for your container.

You can specify a [unique key constraint](unique-keys.md) on your Azure Cosmos container. By creating a unique key policy, you ensure the uniqueness of one or more values per logical partition key. If you create a container by using a unique key policy, no new or updated items with values that duplicate the values specified by the unique key constraint can be created. To learn more, see [Unique key constraints](unique-keys.md).

A container is specialized into API-specific entities as shown in the following table:

| Azure Cosmos entity | SQL API | Cassandra API | Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB | Gremlin API | Table API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Azure Cosmos container | Container | Table | Collection | Graph | Table |

> [!NOTE]
> When creating containers, make sure you don’t create two containers with the same name but different casing. That’s because some parts of the Azure platform are not case-sensitive, and this can result in confusion/collision of telemetry and actions on containers with such names.

### Properties of an Azure Cosmos container

An Azure Cosmos container has a set of system-defined properties. Depending on which API you use, some properties might not be directly exposed. The following table describes the list of system-defined properties:
