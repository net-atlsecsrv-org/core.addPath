# Throughput (RU/s) operations with Azure CLI for a table for Azure Cosmos DB Table API

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.12.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

This script creates a Table API table then updates the throughput the table. The script then migrates from standard to autoscale throughput then reads the value of the autoscale throughput after it has been migrated.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/table/throughput.sh "Throughput operations for Table API.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb table create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/table#az-cosmosdb-table-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Table API table. |
| [az cosmosdb table throughput update](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/table/throughput#az-cosmosdb-table-throughput-update) | Update throughput for an Azure Cosmos Table API table. |
| [az cosmosdb table throughput migrate](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/table/throughput#az-cosmosdb-table-throughput-migrate) | Migrate throughput for an Azure Cosmos Table API table. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
