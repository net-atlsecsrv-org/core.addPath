# Create resource lock for a Azure Cosmos DB Table API table using Azure CLI
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-table-api](../../../includes/appliesto-table-api.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.9.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resource locks do not work for changes made by users connecting Cosmos DB Table SDK, Azure Storage Table SDK, any tools that connect via account keys, or the Azure Portal unless the Cosmos DB account is first locked with the `disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess` property enabled. To learn more about how to enable this property see, [Preventing changes from SDKs](../../../role-based-access-control.md#prevent-sdk-changes).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/table/lock.sh "Create a resource lock for an Azure Cosmos DB Table API table.")]
