# Create an Azure Cosmos Cassandra API account, keyspace and table with autoscale using Azure CLI
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-cassandra-api](../../../includes/appliesto-cassandra-api.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.9.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/cassandra/autoscale.sh "Create an Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API account, keyspace, and table with autoscale.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra keyspace create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/keyspace#az-cosmosdb-cassandra-keyspace-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Cassandra keyspace. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra table create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/table#az-cosmosdb-cassandra-table-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Cassandra table. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
