# Throughput (RU/s) operations with Azure CLI for a keyspace or table for Azure Cosmos DB - Cassandra API
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-cassandra-api](../../../includes/appliesto-cassandra-api.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.12.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

This script creates a Cassandra keyspace with shared throughput and a Cassandra table with dedicated throughput, then updates the throughput for both the keyspace and table. The script then migrates from standard to autoscale throughput then reads the value of the autoscale throughput after it has been migrated.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/cassandra/throughput.sh "Throughput operations for Cassandra keyspace and table.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra keyspace create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/keyspace#az-cosmosdb-cassandra-keyspace-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Cassandra keyspace. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra table create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/table#az-cosmosdb-cassandra-table-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Cassandra table. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra keyspace throughput update](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/keyspace/throughput#az-cosmosdb-cassandra-keyspace-throughput-update) | Update RU/s for an Azure Cosmos Cassandra keyspace. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra table throughput update](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/table/throughput#az-cosmosdb-cassandra-table-throughput-update) | Update RU/s for an Azure Cosmos Cassandra table. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra keyspace throughput migrate](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/keyspace/throughput#az_cosmosdb_cassandra_keyspace_throughput_migrate) | Migrate throughput for an Azure Cosmos Cassandra keyspace. |
| [az cosmosdb cassandra table throughput migrate](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/cassandra/table/throughput#az_cosmosdb_cassandra_table_throughput_migrate) | Migrate throughput for an Azure Cosmos Cassandra table. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
