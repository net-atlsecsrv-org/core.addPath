# Throughput (RU/s) operations with Azure CLI for a database or graph for Azure Cosmos DB - Gremlin API
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-gremlin-api](../../../includes/appliesto-gremlin-api.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.12.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

This script creates a Gremlin database with shared throughput and a Gremlin graph with dedicated throughput, then updates the throughput for both the database and graph. The script then migrates from standard to autoscale throughput then reads the value of the autoscale throughput after it has been migrated.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/gremlin/throughput.sh "Throughput operations for a Gremlin database and graph.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb gremlin database create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/gremlin/database#az-cosmosdb-gremlin-database-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Gremlin database. |
| [az cosmosdb gremlin graph create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/gremlin/graph#az-cosmosdb-gremlin-graph-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos Gremlin graph. |
| [az cosmosdb gremlin database throughput update](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/gremlin/database/throughput#az-cosmosdb-gremlin-database-throughput-update) | Update RU/s for an Azure Cosmos Gremlin database. |
| [az cosmosdb gremlin graph throughput update](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/gremlin/graph/throughput#az-cosmosdb-gremlin-graph-throughput-update) | Update RU/s for an Azure Cosmos Gremlin graph. |
| [az cosmosdb gremlin database throughput migrate](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/gremlin/database/throughput#az_cosmosdb_gremlin_database_throughput_migrate) | Migrate throughput for an Azure Cosmos Gremlin database. |
| [az cosmosdb gremlin graph throughput migrate](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/gremlin/graph/throughput#az_cosmosdb_gremlin_graph_throughput_migrate) | Migrate throughput for an Azure Cosmos Gremlin graph. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
