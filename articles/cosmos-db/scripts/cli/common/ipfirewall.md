# Create an Azure Cosmos account with IP firewall using Azure CLI
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-all-apis](../../../includes/appliesto-all-apis.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.9.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

> [!NOTE]
> This sample demonstrates using a SQL (Core) API account. To use this sample for other APIs, apply the `ip-range-filter` parameter in the script below to `az cosmosdb account create` command for your API specific script.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/common/ipfirewall.sh "Create an Azure Cosmos account with ip firewall.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
