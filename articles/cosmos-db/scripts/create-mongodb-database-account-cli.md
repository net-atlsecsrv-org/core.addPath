# Create an Azure Cosmos DB account with Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB using Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates a Cosmos account with Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

[!NOTE] To learn more about database and container naming conventions, see, [Work with databases, containers, and items in Azure Cosmos DB](../databases-containers-items.md).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/create-cosmosdb-mongodb-account/create-cosmosdb-mongodb-account.sh "Create a Cosmos account with Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB - account, database, and collection.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```
