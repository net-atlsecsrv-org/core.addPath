# Create a resource lock for Azure Cosmos Gremlin API database and graph using Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resource locks do not work for changes made by users connecting using any Gremlin SDK or the Azure Portal unless the Cosmos DB account is first locked with the `disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess` property enabled. To learn more about how to enable this property see, [Preventing changes from SDKs](../../../role-based-access-control.md#prevent-sdk-changes).

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../../../powershell_scripts/cosmosdb/gremlin/ps-gremlin-lock.ps1 "Create, list, and remove resource locks")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
