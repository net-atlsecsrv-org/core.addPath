# Get account keys for Azure Cosmos DB using the Azure CLI

This sample gets account keys for any kind of Azure Cosmos DB account.  

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/scale-cosmosdb-get-account-key/secure-cosmosdb-get-account-key.sh "Get Azure Cosmos DB account keys")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb list-keys](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-list-keys) | List the access keys for a Cosmos DB account. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure).
