# Regenerate an Azure Cosmos DB account key using the Azure CLI

This sample regenerates any kind of Azure Cosmos DB account key using the Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/secure-cosmosdb-regenerate-keys/secure-cosmosdb-regenerate-keys.sh "Regenerate Azure Cosmos DB account keys")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |

| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Updates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb list-keys](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-list-keys) | List the access keys for a Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb regenerate-key](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-regenerate-key) | Regenerates Azure Cosmos DB account keys. |
