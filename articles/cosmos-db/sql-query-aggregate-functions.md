# Aggregate functions in Azure Cosmos DB
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values in the `SELECT` clause and return a single value. For example, the following query returns the count of items within a container:

```sql
    SELECT COUNT(1)
    FROM c
```

## Types of aggregate functions

The SQL API supports the following aggregate functions. `SUM` and `AVG` operate on numeric values, and `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX` work on numbers, strings, Booleans, and nulls.

| Function | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [AVG](sql-query-aggregate-avg.md) | Returns the average of the values in the expression. |
| [COUNT](sql-query-aggregate-count.md) | Returns the number of items in the expression. |
| [MAX](sql-query-aggregate-max.md) | Returns the maximum value in the expression. |
| [MIN](sql-query-aggregate-min.md) | Returns the minimum value in the expression. |
| [SUM](sql-query-aggregate-sum.md) | Returns the sum of all the values in the expression. |


You can also return only the scalar value of the aggregate by using the VALUE keyword. For example, the following query returns the count of values as a single number:

```sql
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(1)
    FROM Families f
```

The results are:

```json
    [ 2 ]
```

You can also combine aggregations with filters. For example, the following query returns the count of items with the address state of `WA`.

```sql
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(1)
    FROM Families f
    WHERE f.address.state = "WA"
```

The results are:

```json
    [ 1 ]
```

## Remarks

These aggregate system functions will benefit from a [range index](index-policy.md#includeexclude-strategy). If you expect to do an `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, or `SUM` on a property, you should [include the relevant path in the indexing policy](index-policy.md#includeexclude-strategy).
