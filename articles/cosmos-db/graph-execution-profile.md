# How to use the execution profile step to evaluate your Gremlin queries

This article provides an overview of how to use the execution profile step for Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API graph databases. This step provides relevant information for troubleshooting and query optimizations, and it is compatible with any Gremlin query that can be executed against a Cosmos DB Gremlin API account.

To use this step, simply append the `executionProfile()` function call at the end of your Gremlin query. **Your Gremlin query will be executed** and the result of the operation will return a JSON response object with the query execution profile.

For example:

```java
    // Basic traversal
    g.V('mary').out()

    // Basic traversal with execution profile call
    g.V('mary').out().executionProfile()
```

After calling the `executionProfile()` step, the response will be a JSON object that includes the executed Gremlin step, the total time it took, and an array of the Cosmos DB runtime operators that the statement resulted in.

> [!NOTE]
> This implementation for Execution Profile is not defined in the Apache Tinkerpop specification. It is specific to Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API's implementation.


## Response Example

The following is an annotated example of the output that will be returned:

```json
[
  {
    // The Gremlin statement that was executed.
    "gremlin": "g.V('mary').out().executionProfile()",

    // Amount of time in milliseconds that the entire operation took.
    "totalTime": 28,

    // An array containing metrics for each of the steps that were executed. 
    // Each Gremlin step will translate to one or more of these steps.
    // This list is sorted in order of execution.
    "metrics": [
      {
        // This operation obtains a set of Vertex objects.

## Execution profile response objects

The response of an executionProfile() function will yield a hierarchy of JSON objects with the following structure:
  - **Gremlin operation object**: Represents the entire Gremlin operation that was executed. Contains the following properties.
    - `gremlin`: The explicit Gremlin statement that was executed.
    - `totalTime`: The time, in milliseconds, that the execution of the step incurred in. 
    - `metrics`: An array that contains each of the Cosmos DB runtime operators that were executed to fulfill the query. This list is sorted in order of execution.
    
  - **Cosmos DB runtime operators**: Represents each of the components of the entire Gremlin operation. This list is sorted in order of execution. Each object contains the following properties:
    - `name`: Name of the operator. This is the type of step that was evaluated and executed. Read more in the table below.
    - `time`: Amount of time, in milliseconds, that a given operator took.
    - `annotations`: Contains additional information, specific to the operator that was executed.
    - `annotations.percentTime`: Percentage of the total time that it took to execute the specific operator.
    - `counts`: Number of objects that were returned from the storage layer by this operator. This is contained in the `counts.resultCount` scalar value within.
    - `storeOps`: Represents a storage operation that can span one or multiple partitions.
    - `storeOps.fanoutFactor`: Represents the number of partitions that this specific storage operation accessed.
    - `storeOps.count`: Represents the number of results that this storage operation returned.
    - `storeOps.size`: Represents the size in bytes of the result of a given storage operation.

Cosmos DB Gremlin Runtime Operator|Description
---|---
`GetVertices`| This step obtains a predicated set of objects from the persistence layer. 
`GetEdges`| This step obtains the edges that are adjacent to a set of vertices. This step can result in one or many storage operations.
`GetNeighborVertices`| This step obtains the vertices that are connected to a set of edges. The edges contain the partition keys and ID's of both their source and target vertices.
`Coalesce`| This step accounts for the evaluation of two operations whenever the `coalesce()` Gremlin step is executed.
`CartesianProductOperator`| This step computes a cartesian product between two datasets. Usually executed whenever the predicates `to()` or `from()` are used.
`ConstantSourceOperator`| This step computes an expression to produce a constant value as a result.
`ProjectOperator`| This step prepares and serializes a response using the result of preceding operations.
`ProjectAggregation`| This step prepares and serializes a response for an aggregate operation.

> [!NOTE]
> This list will continue to be updated as new operators are added.

## Examples on how to analyze an execution profile response

The following are examples of common optimizations that can be spotted using the Execution Profile response:
  - Blind fan-out query.
  - Unfiltered query.

### Blind fan-out query patterns

Assume the following execution profile response from a **partitioned graph**:

```json
[
  {
    "gremlin": "g.V('tt0093640').executionProfile()",
    "totalTime": 46,
    "metrics": [
      {
        "name": "GetVertices",
        "time": 46,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 100
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 1
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 5,
            "count": 1,
            "size": 589,
            "time": 75.61
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "ProjectOperator",
        "time": 0,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 0
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The following conclusions can be made from it:
- The query is a single ID lookup, since the Gremlin statement follows the pattern `g.V('id')`.
- Judging from the `time` metric, the latency of this query seems to be high since it's [more than 10ms for a single point-read operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction#guaranteed-low-latency-at-99th-percentile-worldwide).
- If we look into the `storeOps` object, we can see that the `fanoutFactor` is `5`, which means that [5 partitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data) were accessed by this operation.

As a conclusion of this analysis, we can determine that the first query is accessing more partitions than necessary. This can be addressed by specifying the partitioning key in the query as a predicate. This will lead to less latency and less cost per query. Learn more about [graph partitioning](graph-partitioning.md). A more optimal query would be `g.V('tt0093640').has('partitionKey', 't1001')`.

### Unfiltered query patterns

Compare the following two execution profile responses. For simplicity, these examples use a single partitioned graph.

This first query retrieves all vertices with the label `tweet` and then obtains their neighboring vertices:

```json
[
  {
    "gremlin": "g.V().hasLabel('tweet').out().executionProfile()",
    "totalTime": 42,
    "metrics": [
      {
        "name": "GetVertices",
        "time": 31,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 73.81
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 30
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 1,
            "count": 13,
            "size": 6819,
            "time": 1.02
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "GetEdges",
        "time": 6,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 14.29
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 18
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 1,
            "count": 20,
            "size": 7950,
            "time": 1.98
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "GetNeighborVertices",
        "time": 5,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 11.9
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 20
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 1,
            "count": 4,
            "size": 1070,
            "time": 1.19
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "ProjectOperator",
        "time": 0,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 0
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 20
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Notice the profile of the same query, but now with an additional filter, `has('lang', 'en')`, before exploring the adjacent vertices:

```json
[
  {
    "gremlin": "g.V().hasLabel('tweet').has('lang', 'en').out().executionProfile()",
    "totalTime": 14,
    "metrics": [
      {
        "name": "GetVertices",
        "time": 14,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 58.33
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 11
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 1,
            "count": 11,
            "size": 4807,
            "time": 1.27
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "GetEdges",
        "time": 5,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 20.83
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 18
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 1,
            "count": 18,
            "size": 7159,
            "time": 1.7
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "GetNeighborVertices",
        "time": 5,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 20.83
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 18
        },
        "storeOps": [
          {
            "fanoutFactor": 1,
            "count": 4,
            "size": 1070,
            "time": 1.01
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "ProjectOperator",
        "time": 0,
        "annotations": {
          "percentTime": 0
        },
        "counts": {
          "resultCount": 18
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

These two queries reached the same result, however, the first one will require more Request Units since it needed to iterate a larger initial dataset before querying the adjacent items. We can see indicators of this behavior when comparing the following parameters from both responses:
- The `metrics[0].time` value is higher in the first response, which indicates that this single step took longer to resolve.
- The `metrics[0].counts.resultsCount` value is higher as well in the first response, which indicates that the initial working dataset was larger.
