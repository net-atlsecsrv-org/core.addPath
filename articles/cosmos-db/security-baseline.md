# Azure Security Baseline for Cosmos DB
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-all-apis](includes/appliesto-all-apis.md)]

The Azure Security Baseline for Cosmos DB contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Cosmos account via a Private Endpoint. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can also reduce the risk of data exfiltration by configuring a strict set of outbound rules on a network security group (NSG) and associating that NSG with your subnet.

You can also use Service Endpoints to secure your Azure Cosmos account. By enabling a Service Endpoint, you can configure Azure Cosmos accounts to allow access from only a specific subnet of an Azure virtual network. Once the Azure Cosmos DB Service Endpoint is enabled, you can limit access to an Azure Cosmos account with connections from a subnet in a  virtual network.

You can also secure the data stored in your Azure Cosmos account by using IP firewalls. Azure Cosmos DB supports IP-based access controls for inbound firewall support. You can set an IP firewall on the Azure Cosmos account by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources related to your Azure Cosmos account.

When virtual machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cosmos account, you can use a network security group (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audits. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Use the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) feature to enable a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from calling APIs in a different domain. However, CORS provides a secure way to allow the origin domain to call APIs in another domain. After you enable the CORS support for your Azure Cosmos account, only authenticated requests are evaluated to determine whether they are allowed according to the rules you have specified.

Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-cross-origin-resource-sharing

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Use Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for Azure Cosmos DB . ATP for Azure Cosmos DB provides an additional layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Azure Cosmos accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats and integrate them with central security monitoring systems.

Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the Virtual Networks associated with your Azure Cosmos DB instances to guard against DDoS attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses.

## Data Recovery

*For more information, see [Security Control: Data Recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back ups

**Guidance**: Azure Cosmos DB takes snapshots of your data every four hours. All the backups are stored separately in a storage service, and those backups are globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters. At any given time, only the last two snapshots are retained. However, if the container or database is deleted, Azure Cosmos DB retains the existing snapshots of a given container or database for 30 days. Contact Azure Support to restore from a backup.

Understanding Azure Cosmos DB Automated Backups: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/online-backup-and-restore

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Microsoft

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer managed keys

**Guidance**: Azure Cosmos DB automatically takes backups of your data at regular intervals. If database or container is deleted, you can file a support ticket or call Azure support to restore the data from automatic online backups. Azure support is available for selected plans only such as Standard, Developer, and plans higher than them. To restore a specific snapshot of the backup, Azure Cosmos DB requires that the data is available for the duration of the backup cycle for that snapshot. 

If using Key Vault to store credentials for your Cosmos DB instances, ensure regular automated backups of your keys.

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer managed keys

**Guidance**: If database or container is deleted, you can file a support ticket or call Azure support to restore the data from automatic online backups. Azure support is available for selected plans only such as Standard, Developer, and plans higher than them. To restore a specific snapshot of the backup, Azure Cosmos DB requires that the data is available for the duration of the backup cycle for that snapshot.

Test restoration of your secrets stored in Azure Key Vault using PowerShell. The Restore-AzureKeyVaultKey cmdlet creates a key in the specified key vault. This key is a replica of the backed-up key in the input file and has the same name as the original key.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer managed keys

**Guidance**: Because all user data stored in Cosmos DB is encrypted at rest and in transport, you don't have to take any action. Another way to put this is that encryption at rest is "on" by default. There are no controls to turn it off or on. Azure Cosmos DB uses AES-256 encryption on all regions where the account is running.

Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.
