# Azure security baseline for Azure Cosmos DB

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Cosmos DB. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Cosmos DB. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Cosmos DB have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Cosmos DB completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Cosmos DB security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Cosmos account via a Private Endpoint. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can also reduce the risk of data exfiltration by configuring a strict set of outbound rules on a network security group (NSG) and associating that NSG with your subnet.

You can also use Service Endpoints to secure your Azure Cosmos account. By enabling a Service Endpoint, you can configure Azure Cosmos accounts to allow access from only a specific subnet of an Azure virtual network. Once the Azure Cosmos DB Service Endpoint is enabled, you can limit access to an Azure Cosmos account with connections from a subnet in a  virtual network.

You can also secure the data stored in your Azure Cosmos account by using IP firewalls. Azure Cosmos DB supports IP-based access controls for inbound firewall support. You can set an IP firewall on the Azure Cosmos account by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: The [Azure Security Benchmark](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark.md) is the default policy initiative for Security Center and is the foundation for [Security Center's recommendations](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/security-center-recommendations.md). The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/azure-defender.md) plan for the related services.

**Azure Policy built-in definitions - Microsoft.DocumentDB**:

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources related to your Azure Cosmos account.

When virtual machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cosmos account, you can use a network security group (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audits. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Use the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) feature to enable a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from calling APIs in a different domain. However, CORS provides a secure way to allow the origin domain to call APIs in another domain. After you enable the CORS support for your Azure Cosmos account, only authenticated requests are evaluated to determine whether they are allowed according to the rules you have specified.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Use Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for Azure Cosmos DB. ATP for Azure Cosmos DB provides an additional layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Azure Cosmos accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats and integrate them with central security monitoring systems.

Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the Virtual Networks associated with your Azure Cosmos DB instances to guard against DDoS attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: For resources that need access to your Azure Cosmos account, use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., AzureCosmosDB) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

- [For more information about using service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.DocumentDB" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Cosmos DB instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions for Azure Cosmos DB, such as:

- Deploy Advanced Threat Protection for Cosmos DB Accounts

- Cosmos DB should use a virtual network service endpoint

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by Azure Cosmos DB. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use storage accounts for long-term/archival storage. Alternatively, you may on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal to configure role-based access control (RBAC) and maintain inventory on Azure Cosmos DB resources. The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can use built-in roles or custom roles for individuals and groups.

Azure Cosmos DB provides built-in Azure RBAC for common management scenarios in Azure Cosmos DB. An individual who has a profile in Azure AD can assign these Azure roles to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities to grant or deny access to resources and operations on Azure Cosmos DB resources.

You can also use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform adhoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups.

Additionally, some actions in Azure Cosmos DB can be controlled with Azure AD and account-specific master keys. Use the 'disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess' account setting to control key access.

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Not applicable; Azure Cosmos DB does not support administrator accounts. All access is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Azure Cosmos DB uses two types of keys to authorize users and does not support Single Sign-On (SSO) at the data plane level. Access to the control plane for Cosmos DB is available via REST API and supports SSO. To authenticate, set the Authorization header for your requests to a JSON Web Token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

- [How to create and use tags](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. Azure Cosmos DB instances are separated by virtual network/subnet, tagged appropriately, and secured within a network security group (NSG) or Azure Firewall. Azure Cosmos DB instances storing sensitive data should be isolated. By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Cosmos DB instance account via a private endpoint. The private endpoint is a set of private IP addresses in a subnet within your virtual network. You can then limit access to the selected private IP addresses.

**Responsibility**: Shared

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.5: Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data

**Guidance**: Automatic data identification, classification, and loss prevention features are not yet available for Azure Cosmos DB. However, you can use the Azure Cognitive Search integration for classification and data analysis. You can also implement a third-party solution if required for compliance purposes.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

## Malware Defense

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Malware Defense](../security/benchmarks/security-control-malware-defense.md).*

### 8.2: Pre-scan files to be uploaded to non-compute Azure resources

**Guidance**: Microsoft Antimalware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure CosmosDB), however it does not run on customer content.

It is your responsibility to pre-scan any files being uploaded to non-compute Azure resources, including Azure Cosmos DB. Microsoft cannot access customer data, and therefore cannot conduct anti-malware scans of customer content on your behalf.

## Data Recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Azure Cosmos DB automatically takes backups of your data at regular intervals. If database or container is deleted, you can file a support ticket or call Azure support to restore the data from automatic online backups. Azure support is available for selected plans only such as Standard, Developer, and plans higher than them. To restore a specific snapshot of the backup, Azure Cosmos DB requires that the data is available for the duration of the backup cycle for that snapshot. 

If using Key Vault to store credentials for your Cosmos DB instances, ensure regular automated backups of your keys.

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: If database or container is deleted, you can file a support ticket or call Azure support to restore the data from automatic online backups. Azure support is available for selected plans only such as Standard, Developer, and plans higher than them. To restore a specific snapshot of the backup, Azure Cosmos DB requires that the data is available for the duration of the backup cycle for that snapshot.

Test restoration of your secrets stored in Azure Key Vault using PowerShell. The Restore-AzureKeyVaultKey cmdlet creates a key in the specified key vault. This key is a replica of the backed-up key in the input file and has the same name as the original key.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Because all user data stored in Cosmos DB is encrypted at rest and in transport, you don't have to take any action. Another way to put this is that encryption at rest is "on" by default. There are no controls to turn it off or on. Azure Cosmos DB uses AES-256 encryption on all regions where the account is running.

Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident the Security Center is in finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 10.3: Test security response procedures
