# Working with Dates in Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB delivers schema flexibility and rich indexing via a native [JSON](https://www.json.org) data model. All Azure Cosmos DB resources including databases, containers, documents, and stored procedures are modeled and stored as JSON documents. As a requirement for being portable, JSON (and Azure Cosmos DB) supports only a small set of basic types: String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object, and Null. However, JSON is flexible and allow developers and frameworks to represent more complex types using these primitives and composing them as objects or arrays. 

In addition to the basic types, many applications need the DateTime type to represent dates and timestamps. This article describes how developers can store, retrieve, and query dates in Azure Cosmos DB using the .NET SDK.

## Storing DateTimes

Azure Cosmos DB supports JSON types such as - string, number, boolean, null, array, object. It does not directly support a DateTime type. Currently, Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support localization of dates. So, you need to store DateTimes as strings. The recommended format for DateTime strings in Azure Cosmos DB is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ` which follows the ISO 8601 UTC standard. It is recommended to store all dates in Azure Cosmos DB as UTC. Converting the date strings to this format will allow sorting dates lexicographically. If non-UTC dates are stored, the logic must be handled at the client-side. To convert a  local DateTime to UTC, the offset must be known/stored as a property in the JSON and the client can use the offset to compute UTC DateTime value.

Most applications can use the default string representation for DateTime for the following reasons:

* Strings can be compared, and the relative ordering of the DateTime values is preserved when they are transformed to strings. 
* This approach doesn't require any custom code or attributes for JSON conversion.
* The dates as stored in JSON are human readable.
* This approach can take advantage of Azure Cosmos DB's index for fast query performance.

For example, the following snippet stores an `Order` object containing two DateTime properties - `ShipDate` and `OrderDate` as a document using the .NET SDK:

    public class Order
    {
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName="id")]
        public string Id { get; set; }
        public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
        public DateTime ShipDate { get; set; }
        public double Total { get; set; }
    }

    await client.CreateDocumentAsync("/dbs/orderdb/colls/orders", 
        new Order 
        { 
            Id = "09152014101",
            OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-30),
            ShipDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-14), 
            Total = 113.39
        });

This document is stored in Azure Cosmos DB as follows:

    {
        "id": "09152014101",
        "OrderDate": "2014-09-15T23:14:25.7251173Z",
        "ShipDate": "2014-09-30T23:14:25.7251173Z",
        "Total": 113.39
    }
    

Alternatively, you can store DateTimes as Unix timestamps, that is, as a number representing the number of elapsed seconds since January 1, 1970. Azure Cosmos DB's internal Timestamp (`_ts`) property follows this approach. You can use the [UnixDateTimeConverter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.azure.documents.unixdatetimeconverter.aspx) class to serialize DateTimes as numbers. 

## Indexing DateTimes for range queries
Range queries are common with DateTime values. For example, if you need to find all orders created since yesterday, or find all orders shipped in the last five minutes, you need to perform range queries. To execute these queries efficiently, you must configure your collection for Range indexing on strings.

    DocumentCollection collection = new DocumentCollection { Id = "orders" };
    collection.IndexingPolicy = new IndexingPolicy(new RangeIndex(DataType.String) { Precision = -1 });
    await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync("/dbs/orderdb", collection);

You can learn more about how to configure indexing policies at [Azure Cosmos DB Indexing Policies](index-policy.md).

## Querying DateTimes in LINQ
The SQL .NET SDK automatically supports querying data stored in Azure Cosmos DB via LINQ. For example, the following snippet shows a LINQ query that filters orders that were shipped in the last three days.

    IQueryable<Order> orders = client.CreateDocumentQuery<Order>("/dbs/orderdb/colls/orders")
        .Where(o => o.ShipDate >= DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-3));
          
    // Translated to the following SQL statement and executed on Azure Cosmos DB
    SELECT * FROM root WHERE (root["ShipDate"] >= "2016-12-18T21:55:03.45569Z")
