# ORDER BY clause in Azure Cosmos DB

The optional `ORDER BY` clause specifies the sorting order for results returned by the query.

## Syntax
  
```sql  
ORDER BY <sort_specification>  
<sort_specification> ::= <sort_expression> [, <sort_expression>]  
<sort_expression> ::= {<scalar_expression> [ASC | DESC]} [ ,...n ]  
```  

## Arguments
  
- `<sort_specification>`  
  
   Specifies a property or expression on which to sort the query result set. A sort column can be specified as a name or property alias.  
  
   Multiple properties can be specified. Property names must be unique. The sequence of the sort properties in the `ORDER BY` clause defines the organization of the sorted result set. That is, the result set is sorted by the first property and then that ordered list is sorted by the second property, and so on.  
  
   The property names referenced in the `ORDER BY` clause must correspond to either a property in the select list or to a property defined in the collection specified in the `FROM` clause without any ambiguities.  
  
- `<sort_expression>`  
  
   Specifies one or more properties or expressions on which to sort the query result set.  
  
- `<scalar_expression>`  
  
   See the [Scalar expressions](sql-query-scalar-expressions.md) section for details.  
  
- `ASC | DESC`  
  
   Specifies that the values in the specified column should be sorted in ascending or descending order. `ASC` sorts from the lowest value to highest value. `DESC` sorts from highest value to lowest value. `ASC` is the default sort order. Null values are treated as the lowest possible values.  
  
## Remarks  
  
   The `ORDER BY` clause requires that the indexing policy include an index for the fields being sorted. The Azure Cosmos DB query runtime supports sorting against a property name and not against computed properties. Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple `ORDER BY` properties. In order to run a query with multiple ORDER BY properties, you should define a [composite index](index-policy.md#composite-indexes) on the fields being sorted.

> [!Note]
> If the properties being sorted might be undefined for some documents and you want to retrieve them in an ORDER BY query, you must explicitly include this path in the index. The default indexing policy won't allow for the retrieval of the documents where the sort property is undefined. [Review example queries on documents with some missing fields](#documents-with-missing-fields).

## Examples

For example, here's a query that retrieves families in ascending order of the resident city's name:

```sql
    SELECT f.id, f.address.city
    FROM Families f
    ORDER BY f.address.city
```

The results are:

```json
    [
      {
        "id": "WakefieldFamily",
        "city": "NY"
      },
      {
        "id": "AndersenFamily",
        "city": "Seattle"
      }
    ]
```

The following query retrieves family `id`s in order of their item creation date. Item `creationDate` is a number representing the *epoch time*, or elapsed time since Jan. 1, 1970 in seconds.

```sql
    SELECT f.id, f.creationDate
    FROM Families f
    ORDER BY f.creationDate DESC
```

The results are:

```json
    [
      {
        "id": "WakefieldFamily",
        "creationDate": 1431620462
      },
      {
        "id": "AndersenFamily",
        "creationDate": 1431620472
      }
    ]
```

Additionally, you can order by multiple properties. A query that orders by multiple properties requires a [composite index](index-policy.md#composite-indexes). Consider the following query:

```sql
    SELECT f.id, f.creationDate
    FROM Families f
    ORDER BY f.address.city ASC, f.creationDate DESC
```

This query retrieves the family `id` in ascending order of the city name. If multiple items have the same city name, the query will order by the `creationDate` in descending order.

## Documents with missing fields

Queries with `ORDER BY` that are run against containers with the default indexing policy will not return documents where the sort property is undefined. If you would like to include documents where the sort property is undefined, you should explicitly include this property in the indexing policy.

For example, here's a container with an indexing policy that does not explicitly include any paths besides `"/*"`:

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": []
}
```

If you run a query that includes `lastName` in the `Order By` clause, the results will only include documents that have a `lastName` property defined. We have not defined an explicit included path for `lastName` so any documents without a `lastName` will not appear in the query results.

Here is a query that sorts by `lastName` on two documents, one of which does not have a `lastName` defined:

```sql
    SELECT f.id, f.lastName
    FROM Families f
    ORDER BY f.lastName
```

The results only include the document that has a defined `lastName`:

```json
    [
        {
            "id": "AndersenFamily",
            "lastName": "Andersen"
        }
    ]
```

If we update the container's indexing policy to explicitly include a path for `lastName`, we will include documents with an undefined sort property in the query results. You must explicitly define the path to lead to this scalar value (and not beyond it). You should use the `?` character in your path definition in the indexing policy to ensure that you explicitly index the property `lastName` and no additional nested paths beyond it. If your `Order By` query uses a [composite index](index-policy.md#composite-indexes), the results will always include documents with an undefined sort property in the query results.

Here is a sample indexing policy which allows you to have documents with an undefined `lastName` appear in the query results:

```json
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/lastName/?"
        },
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": []
}
```

If you run the same query again, documents that are missing `lastName` appear first in the query results:

```sql
    SELECT f.id, f.lastName
    FROM Families f
    ORDER BY f.lastName
```

The results are:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "WakefieldFamily"
    },
    {
        "id": "AndersenFamily",
        "lastName": "Andersen"
    }
]
```

If you modify the sort order to `DESC`, documents that are missing `lastName` appear last in the query results:

```sql
    SELECT f.id, f.lastName
    FROM Families f
    ORDER BY f.lastName DESC
```

The results are:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "AndersenFamily",
        "lastName": "Andersen"
    },
    {
        "id": "WakefieldFamily"
    }
]
```
