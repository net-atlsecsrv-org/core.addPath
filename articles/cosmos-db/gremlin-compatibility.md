# Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin compatibility
Azure Cosmos DB Graph engine closely follows [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#graph-traversal-steps) traversal steps specification but there are differences.

## Behavior differences

* Azure Cosmos DB Graph engine runs ***breadth-first*** traversal while TinkerPop Gremlin is depth-first. This behavior achieves better performance in horizontally scalable system like Cosmos DB. 

## Unsupported features

* ***[Gremlin Bytecode](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/)*** is a programming language agnostic specification for graph traversals. Cosmos DB Graph doesn't support it yet. Use ```GremlinClient.SubmitAsync()``` and pass traversal as a text string.

* ***```property(set, 'xyz', 1)```*** set cardinality isn't supported today. Use ```property(list, 'xyz', 1)``` instead.

* ***```match()```*** allows querying graphs using declarative pattern matching. This capability isn't available.

* ***Objects as properties*** on vertices or edges aren't supported. Properties can only be primitive types or arrays.

* ***Sorting by array properties*** ```.order().by(<array property>)``` isn't supported. Sorting is supported only by primitive types.

* ***Non-primitive JSON types*** aren't supported. Use ```string```, ```number```, or ```true```/```false``` types. ```null``` values aren't supported. 

* ***GraphSONv3*** serializer isn't available today.

* ***Transactions*** aren't supported because of distributed nature of the system.  Configure appropriate consistency model on Gremlin account to "read your own writes" and use optimistic concurrency to resolve conflicting writes.
