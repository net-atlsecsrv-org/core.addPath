# Configure role-based access control with Azure Active Directory for your Azure Cosmos DB account (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Cosmos DB role-based access control is currently in preview. This preview version is provided without a Service Level Agreement and is not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental terms of use for Microsoft Azure previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

> [!NOTE]
> This article is about role-based access control for data plane operations in Azure Cosmos DB. If you are using management plane operations, see [role-based access control](role-based-access-control.md) applied to your management plane operations article.

Azure Cosmos DB exposes a built-in role-based access control (RBAC) system that lets you:

- Authenticate your data requests with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity.
- Authorize your data requests with a fine-grained, role-based permission model.

## Concepts

The Azure Cosmos DB data plane RBAC is built on concepts that are commonly found in other RBAC systems like [Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md):

- The [permission model](#permission-model) is composed of a set of **actions**; each of these actions maps to one or multiple database operations. Some examples of actions include reading an item, writing an item, or executing a query.
- Azure Cosmos DB users create **[role definitions](#role-definitions)** containing a list of allowed actions.
- Role definitions get assigned to specific Azure AD identities through **[role assignments](#role-assignments)**. A role assignment also defines the scope that the role definition applies to; currently, three scopes are currently:
    - An Azure Cosmos DB account,
    - An Azure Cosmos DB database,
    - An Azure Cosmos DB container.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Cosmos DB RBAC does not currently expose any built-in role definitions.

## <a id="permission-model"></a> Permission model

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This permission model only covers database operations that let you read and write data. It does **not** cover any kind of management operations, like creating containers or changing their throughput. This means that you **cannot use any Azure Cosmos DB data plane SDK** to authenticate management operations with an AAD identity. Instead, you must use [Azure RBAC](role-based-access-control.md) through:
> - [ARM templates](manage-with-templates.md)
> - [Azure PowerShell scripts](manage-with-powershell.md),
> - [Azure CLI scripts](manage-with-cli.md),
> - Azure management libraries available in
>   - [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.ResourceManager.CosmosDB)
>   - [Java](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure.resourcemanager/azure-resourcemanager-cosmos)
>   - [Python](https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-cosmosdb/)

The table below lists all the actions exposed by the permission model.

| Name | Corresponding database operation(s) |
|---|---|
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata` | Read account metadata. See [Metadata requests](#metadata-requests) for details. |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/create` | Create a new item. |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/read` | Read an individual item by its ID and partition key (point-read). |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/replace` | Replace an existing item. |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/upsert` | "Upsert" an item, which means create it if it doesn't exist, or replace it if it exists. |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/delete` | Delete an item. |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/executeQuery` | Execute a [SQL query](sql-query-getting-started.md). |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/readChangeFeed` | Read from the container's [change feed](read-change-feed.md). |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/executeStoredProcedure` | Execute a [stored procedure](stored-procedures-triggers-udfs.md). |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/manageConflicts` | Manage [conflicts](conflict-resolution-policies.md) for multi-write region accounts (that is, list and delete items from the conflict feed). |

Wildcards are supported at both *containers* and *items* levels:

- `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/*`
- `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/*`

### <a id="metadata-requests"></a> Metadata requests

When using Azure Cosmos DB SDKs, these SDKs issue read-only metadata requests during initialization and to serve specific data requests. These metadata requests fetch various configuration details such as: 

- The global configuration of your account, which includes the Azure regions the account is available in.
- The partition key of your containers or their indexing policy.
- The list of physical partitions that make a container and their addresses.

They do *not* fetch any of the data that you've stored in your account.

To ensure the best transparency of our permission model, these metadata requests are explicitly covered by the `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata` action. This action should be allowed in every situation where your Azure Cosmos DB account is accessed through one of the Azure Cosmos DB SDKs. It can be assigned (through a role assignment) at any level in the Azure Cosmos DB hierarchy (that is, account, database, or container).

The actual metadata requests allowed by the `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata` action depend on the scope that the action is assigned to:

| Scope | Requests allowed by the action |
|---|---|
| Account | - Listing the databases under the account<br>- For each database under the account, the allowed actions at the database scope |
| Database | - Reading database metadata<br>- Listing the containers under the database<br>- For each container under the database, the allowed actions at the container scope |
| Container | - Reading container metadata<br>- Listing physical partitions under the container<br>- Resolving the address of each physical partition |

## <a id="role-definitions"></a> Create role definitions

When creating a role definition, you need to provide:

- The name of your Azure Cosmos DB account.
- The resource group containing your account.
- The type of the role definition; only `CustomRole` is currently supported.
- The name of the role definition.
- A list of [actions](#permission-model) that you want the role to allow.
- One or multiple scope(s) that the role definition can be assigned at; supported scopes are:
    - `/` (account-level),
    - `/dbs/<database-name>` (database-level),
    - `/dbs/<database-name>/colls/<container-name>` (container-level).

> [!NOTE]
> The operations described below are currently available in:
> - Azure PowerShell: [Az.CosmosDB version 2.0.1-preview](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.CosmosDB/2.0.1-preview)
> - Azure CLI: ['cosmosdb-preview' extension version 0.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/cosmosdb-preview)

### Using Azure PowerShell

Create a role named *MyReadOnlyRole* that only contains read actions:

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = "<myResourceGroup>"
$accountName = "<myCosmosAccount>"
New-AzCosmosDBSqlRoleDefinition -AccountName $accountName `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -Type CustomRole -RoleName MyReadOnlyRole `
    -DataAction @( `
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata',
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/read', `
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/executeQuery', `
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/readChangeFeed') `
    -AssignableScope "/"
```

Create a role named *MyReadWriteRole* that contains all actions:

```powershell
New-AzCosmosDBSqlRoleDefinition -AccountName $accountName `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -Type CustomRole -RoleName MyReadWriteRole `
    -DataAction @( `
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata',
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/*', `
        'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/*') `
    -AssignableScope "/"
```

List the role definitions you've created to fetch their IDs:

```powershell
Get-AzCosmosDBSqlRoleDefinition -AccountName $accountName `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```

```
RoleName         : MyReadWriteRole
Id               : /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAcc
                   ounts/<myCosmosAccount>/sqlRoleDefinitions/<roleDefinitionId>
Type             : CustomRole
Permissions      : {Microsoft.Azure.Management.CosmosDB.Models.Permission}
AssignableScopes : {/subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAc
                   counts/<myCosmosAccount>}

RoleName         : MyReadOnlyRole
Id               : /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAcc
                   ounts/<myCosmosAccount>/sqlRoleDefinitions/<roleDefinitionId>
Type             : CustomRole
Permissions      : {Microsoft.Azure.Management.CosmosDB.Models.Permission}
AssignableScopes : {/subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAc
                   counts/<myCosmosAccount>}
```

### Using the Azure CLI

Create a role named *MyReadOnlyRole* that only contains read actions:

```json
// role-definition-ro.json
{
    "RoleName": "MyReadOnlyRole",
    "Type": "CustomRole",
    "AssignableScopes": ["/"],
    "Permissions": [{
        "DataActions": [
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata",
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/read",
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/executeQuery",
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/readChangeFeed"
        ]
    }]
}
```

```azurecli
resourceGroupName='<myResourceGroup>'
accountName='<myCosmosAccount>'
az cosmosdb sql role definition create --account-name $accountName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --body @role-definition-ro.json
```

Create a role named *MyReadWriteRole* that contains all actions:

```json
// role-definition-rw.json
{
    "RoleName": "MyReadWriteRole",
    "Type": "CustomRole",
    "AssignableScopes": ["/"],
    "Permissions": [{
        "DataActions": [
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata",
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/*",
            "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/*"
        ]
    }]
}
```

```azurecli
az cosmosdb sql role definition create --account-name $accountName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --body @role-definition-rw.json
```

List the role definitions you've created to fetch their IDs:

```azurecli
az cosmosdb sql role definition list --account-name $accountName --resource-group $resourceGroupName
```

```

  }
]
```

## <a id="role-assignments"></a> Create role assignments

Once you've created your role definitions, you can associate them with your AAD identities. When creating a role assignment, you need to provide:

- The name of your Azure Cosmos DB account.
- The resource group containing your account.
- The ID of the role definition to assign.
- The principal ID of the identity that the role definition should be assigned to.
- The scope of the role assignment; supported scopes are:
    - `/` (account-level)
    - `/dbs/<database-name>` (database-level)
    - `/dbs/<database-name>/colls/<container-name>` (container-level)

  The scope must match or be a sub-scope of one of the role definition's assignable scopes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to create a role assignment for a service principal, make sure to use its **Object ID** as found in the **Enterprise applications** section of the **Azure Active Directory** portal blade.

> [!NOTE]
> The operations described below are currently available in:
> - Azure PowerShell: [Az.CosmosDB version 2.0.1-preview](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.CosmosDB/2.0.1-preview)
> - Azure CLI: ['cosmosdb-preview' extension version 0.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/cosmosdb-preview)

### Using Azure PowerShell

Assign a role to an identity:

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = "<myResourceGroup>"
$accountName = "<myCosmosAccount>"
$readOnlyRoleDefinitionId = "<roleDefinitionId>" // as fetched above
$principalId = "<aadPrincipalId>"
New-AzCosmosDBSqlRoleAssignment -AccountName $accountName `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -RoleDefinitionId $readOnlyRoleDefinitionId `
    -Scope $accountName `
    -PrincipalId $principalId
```

### Using the Azure CLI

Assign a role to an identity:

```azurecli
resourceGroupName='<myResourceGroup>'
accountName='<myCosmosAccount>'
readOnlyRoleDefinitionId = '<roleDefinitionId>' // as fetched above
principalId = '<aadPrincipalId>'
az cosmosdb sql role assignment create --account-name $accountName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --scope "/" --principal-id $principalId --role-definition-id $readOnlyRoleDefinitionId
```

## Initialize the SDK with Azure AD

To use the Azure Cosmos DB RBAC in your application, you have to update the way you initialize the Azure Cosmos DB SDK. Instead of passing your account's primary key, you have to pass an instance of a `TokenCredential` class. This instance provides the Azure Cosmos DB SDK with the context required to fetch an AAD token on behalf of the identity you wish to use.

The way you create a `TokenCredential` instance is beyond the scope of this article. There are many ways to create such an instance depending on the type of AAD identity you want to use (user principal, service principal, group etc.). Most importantly, your `TokenCredential` instance must resolve to the identity (principal ID) that you've assigned your roles to. You can find examples of creating a `TokenCredential` class:

- [In .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#credential-classes)
- [In Java](/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#credential-classes)
- [In JavaScript](/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#credential-classes)
- In REST API

The examples below use a service principal with a `ClientSecretCredential` instance.

### In .NET

The Azure Cosmos DB RBAC is currently supported in the `preview` version of the [.NET SDK V3](sql-api-sdk-dotnet-standard.md).

```csharp
TokenCredential servicePrincipal = new ClientSecretCredential(
    "<azure-ad-tenant-id>",
    "<client-application-id>",
    "<client-application-secret>");
CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient("<account-endpoint>", servicePrincipal);
```

### In Java

The Azure Cosmos DB RBAC is currently supported in the [Java SDK V4](sql-api-sdk-java-v4.md).

```java
TokenCredential ServicePrincipal = new ClientSecretCredentialBuilder()
    .authorityHost("https://login.microsoftonline.com")
    .tenantId("<azure-ad-tenant-id>")
    .clientId("<client-application-id>")
    .clientSecret("<client-application-secret>")
    .build();
CosmosAsyncClient Client = new CosmosClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<account-endpoint>")
    .credential(ServicePrincipal)
    .build();
```

### In JavaScript

The Azure Cosmos DB RBAC is currently supported in the [JavaScript SDK V3](sql-api-sdk-node.md).

```javascript
const servicePrincipal = new ClientSecretCredential(
    "<azure-ad-tenant-id>",
    "<client-application-id>",
    "<client-application-secret>");
const client = new CosmosClient({
    "<account-endpoint>",
    aadCredentials: servicePrincipal
});
```

### In REST API

The Azure Cosmos DB RBAC is currently supported with the 2021-03-15 version of REST API. When constructing the [authorization header](/rest/api/cosmos-db/access-control-on-cosmosdb-resources), set the **type** parameter to **aad** and the hash signature **(sig)** to the **oauth token** as shown in the following example:

`type=aad&ver=1.0&sig=<token-from-oauth>`

## Auditing data requests

When using the Azure Cosmos DB RBAC, [diagnostic logs](cosmosdb-monitor-resource-logs.md) get augmented with identity and authorization information for each data operation. This lets you perform detailed auditing and retrieve the AAD identity used for every data request sent to your Azure Cosmos DB account.

This additional information flows in the **DataPlaneRequests** log category and consists of two extra columns:

- `aadPrincipalId_g` shows the principal ID of the AAD identity that was used to authenticate the request.
- `aadAppliedRoleAssignmentId_g` shows the [role assignment](#role-assignments) that was honored when authorizing the request.

## Limits

- You can create up to 100 role definitions and 2,000 role assignments per Azure Cosmos DB account.
- You can only assign role definitions to Azure AD identities belonging to the same Azure AD tenant as your Azure Cosmos DB account.
- Azure AD group resolution is not currently supported for identities that belong to more than 200 groups.
- The Azure AD token is currently passed as a header with each individual request sent to the Azure Cosmos DB service, increasing the overall payload size.
- Accessing your data with Azure AD through the [Azure Cosmos DB Explorer](data-explorer.md) isn't supported yet. Using the Azure Cosmos DB Explorer still requires the user to have access to the account's primary key for now.

## Frequently asked questions
