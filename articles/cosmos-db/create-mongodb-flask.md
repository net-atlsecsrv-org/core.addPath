# Quickstart: Build a Python app using Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Cosmos DB.

This quickstart guide uses the following [Flask example](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/CosmosDB-Flask-Mongo-Sample) and demonstrates how to build a simple To-Do Flask app with the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md) and the Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

- Download the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md). The emulator is currently only supported on Windows. The sample shows how to use the sample with a production key from Azure, which can be done on any platform.

- If you don’t already have Visual Studio Code installed, you can quickly install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).

- Be sure to add Python Language support by installing one of the popular Python extensions.
  1. Select an extension.
  2. Install the extension by typing `ext install` into the Command Palette `Ctrl+Shift+P`.

     The examples in this document use Don Jayamanne's popular and full featured [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python).

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Flask-MongoDB app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You see how easy it is to work with data programmatically.

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```bash
    md "C:\git-samples"
    ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.

    ```bash
    cd "C:\git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/CosmosDB-Flask-Mongo-Sample.git
    ```
3. Run the following command to install the python modules.

    ```bash 
    pip install -r .\requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

## Review the code

This step is optional. If you're interested in learning how the database resources are created in the code, you can review the following snippets. Otherwise, you can skip ahead to [Run the web app](#run-the-web-app). 

The following snippets are all taken from the app.py file and uses the connection string for the local Azure Cosmos DB Emulator. The password needs to be split up as seen below to accommodate for the forward slashes that cannot be parsed otherwise.

* Initialize the MongoDB client, retrieve the database, and authenticate.

    ```python
    client = MongoClient("mongodb://127.0.0.1:10250/?ssl=true") #host uri
    db = client.test    #Select the database
    db.authenticate(name="localhost",password='C2y6yDjf5' + r'/R' + '+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw' + r'/Jw==')
    ```

* Retrieve the collection or create it if it does not already exist.

    ```python
    todos = db.todo #Select the collection
    ```

* Create the app

    ```Python
    app = Flask(__name__)
    title = "TODO with Flask"
    heading = "ToDo Reminder"
    ```
    
## Run the web app

1. Make sure the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator is running.

2. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that the app is saved in.

3. Then set the environment variable for the Flask app with `set FLASK_APP=app.py`, `$env:FLASK_APP = app.py` for PowerShell editors, or `export FLASK_APP=app.py` if you are using a Mac. 

4. Run the app with `flask run` and browse to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

5. Add and remove tasks and see them added and changed in the collection.

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-mongodb.md)]

## Update your connection string

If you want to test the code against a live Cosmos Account, go to the Azure portal to create an account and get your connection string information. Then copy it into the app.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in your Cosmos account, in the left navigation click **Connection String**, and then click **Read-write Keys**. You'll use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the Username, Password, and Host into the Dal.cs file in the next step.

2. Open the **app.py** file in the root directory.

3. Copy your **username** value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the **name** in your **app.py** file.

4. Then copy your **connection string** value from the portal and make it the value of the MongoClient in your **app.py** file.

5. Finally copy your **password** value from the portal and make it the value of the **password** in your **app.py** file.

You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Cosmos DB. You can run it the same way as before.

## Deploy to Azure

To deploy this app, you can create a new web app in Azure and enable continuous deployment with a fork of this GitHub repo. Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment) to set up continuous deployment with GitHub in Azure.

When deploying to Azure, you should remove your application keys and make sure the section below is not commented out:

```python
    client = MongoClient(os.getenv("MONGOURL"))
    db = client.test    #Select the database
    db.authenticate(name=os.getenv("MONGO_USERNAME"),password=os.getenv("MONGO_PASSWORD"))
```

You then need to add your MONGOURL, MONGO_PASSWORD, and MONGO_USERNAME to the application settings. You can follow this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-app-settings) to learn more about Application Settings in Azure Web Apps.

If you don't want to create a fork of this repo, you can also click the deploy to Azure button below. You should then go into Azure and set up the application settings with your Cosmos DB account info.

</a>

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to store your code in GitHub or other source control options, please be sure to remove your connection strings from the code. They can be set with application settings for the web app instead.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create a Cosmos account and run a Flask app. You can now import additional data to your Cosmos database.
