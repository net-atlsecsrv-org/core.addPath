# Azure Cosmos DB Attachments
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB attachments are special items that contain references to an associated metadata with an external blob or media file.

Azure Cosmos DB supports two types of attachments:

* **Unmanaged Attachments** are a wrapper around an URI reference to a blob that is stored in an external service (for example, Azure Storage, OneDrive, etc.). This approach is similar to storing a URI property in a standard Azure Cosmos DB item.
* **Managed Attachments** are blobs managed and stored internally by Azure Cosmos DB and exposed via a system-generated mediaLink.


> [!NOTE]
> Attachment is a legacy feature. Their support is scoped to offer continued functionality if you are already using this feature.
> 
> Instead of using attachments, we recommend you to use Azure Blob Storage as a purpose-built blob storage service to store blob data . You can continue to store metadata related to blobs, along with reference URI links, in Azure Cosmos DB as item properties. Storing this data in Azure Cosmos DB provides the ability to query metadata and links to blobs stored in Azure Blob Storage.
> 
> Microsoft is committed to provide a minimum 36-month notice prior to fully deprecating attachments – which will be announced at a further date.

## Known limitations

Azure Cosmos DB’s managed attachments are distinct from its support for standard items – for which it offers unlimited scalability, global distribution, and integration with other Azure services.

- Attachments aren't supported in all versions of the Azure Cosmos DB’s SDKs.
- Managed attachments are limited to 2 GB of storage per database account.
- Managed attachments aren't compatible with Azure Cosmos DB’s global distribution, and they aren't replicated across regions.

## Migrating Attachments to Azure Blob Storage

We recommend migrating Azure Cosmos DB attachments to Azure Blob Storage by following these steps:

1. Copy attachments data from your source Azure Cosmos DB container to your target Azure Blob Storage container.
2. Validate the uploaded blob data in the target Azure Blob Storage container.
3. If applicable, add URI references to the blobs contained in Azure Blob Storage as string properties within your Azure Cosmos DB dataset.
4. Refactor your application code to read and write blobs from the new Azure Blob Storage container.

The following dotnet code sample shows how to copy attachments from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Blob storage as part of a migration flow by using Azure Cosmos DB's .NET SDK v2 and Azure Blob Storage .NET SDK v12. Make sure to replace the `<placeholder values>` for the source Azure Cosmos DB account and target Azure Blob storage container.
