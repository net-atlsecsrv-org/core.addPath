# Quickstart: Build a Java app to manage Azure Cosmos DB Table API data

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [.NET](create-table-dotnet.md)
> * [Java](create-table-java.md)
> * [Node.js](create-table-nodejs.md)
> * [Python](create-table-python.md)
> 

This quickstart shows how to use Java and the Azure Cosmos DB [Table API](table-introduction.md) to build an app by cloning an example from GitHub. You'll learn how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account and how to use Data Explorer to create tables and entities in the web-based Azure portal.

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api](../../includes/cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api.md)]

In addition: 

* [Java Development Kit (JDK) 8](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)
    * Be sure to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where the JDK is installed.
* [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) binary archive
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `apt-get install maven` to install Maven.
* [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/)
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install git` to install Git.

## Create a database account

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You need to create a new Table API account to work with the generally available Table API SDKs. Table API accounts created during preview are not supported by the generally available SDKs.
>

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

## Add a table

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table.md)]

## Add sample data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table-add-sample-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table-add-sample-data.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Table app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```bash
    md "C:\git-samples"
    ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.

    ```bash
    cd "C:\git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-table-java-getting-started.git 
    ```

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app. This enables your app to communicate with your hosted database. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Connection String**. 

   ![View the connection string information in the Connection String pane](./media/create-table-java/cosmos-db-quickstart-connection-string.png)

2. Copy the PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING using the copy button on the right.

3. Open config.properties from the C:\git-samples\storage-table-java-getting-started\src\main\resources folder. 

5. Comment out line one and uncomment line two. The first two lines should now look like this.

    ```xml
    #StorageConnectionString = UseDevelopmentStorage=true
    StorageConnectionString = DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[ACCOUNTNAME];AccountKey=[ACCOUNTKEY]
    ```

6. Paste your PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING from the portal into the StorageConnectionString value in line 2. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If your Endpoint uses documents.azure.com, that means you have a preview account, and you need to create a [new Table API account](#create-a-database-account) to work with the generally available Table API SDK.
    >

7. Save the config.properties file.

You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Run the app

1. In the git terminal window, `cd` to the storage-table-java-getting-started folder.

    ```git
    cd "C:\git-samples\storage-table-java-getting-started"
    ```

2. In the git terminal window, run the following commands to run start the Java application.

    ```git
    mvn compile exec:java 
    ```

    The console window displays the table data being added to the new table database in Azure Cosmos DB.

    You can now go back to Data Explorer and see query, modify, and work with this new data.

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-delete-resource-group](../../includes/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a table using the Data Explorer, and run an app.  Now you can query your data using the Table API.
