# Find the request unit charge for operations executed in Azure Cosmos DB Table API

Azure Cosmos DB supports many APIs, such as SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table. Each API has its own set of database operations. These operations range from simple point reads and writes to complex queries. Each database operation consumes system resources based on the complexity of the operation.

The cost of all database operations is normalized by Azure Cosmos DB and is expressed by Request Units (or RUs, for short). You can think of RUs as a performance currency abstracting the system resources such as CPU, IOPS, and memory that are required to perform the database operations supported by Azure Cosmos DB. No matter which API you use to interact with your Azure Cosmos container, costs are always measured by RUs. Whether the database operation is a write, point read, or query, costs are always measured in RUs. To learn more, see the [request units and it's considerations](request-units.md) article.

This article presents the different ways you can find the [request unit](request-units.md) (RU) consumption for any operation executed against a container in Azure Cosmos DB Table API. If you are using a different API, see [API for MongoDB](find-request-unit-charge-mongodb.md), [Cassandra API](find-request-unit-charge-cassandra.md), [Gremlin API](find-request-unit-charge-gremlin.md), and [SQL API](find-request-unit-charge.md) articles to find the RU/s charge.

## Use the .NET SDK

Currently, the only SDK that returns the RU charge for table operations is the [.NET Standard SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Table). The `TableResult` object exposes a `RequestCharge` property that is populated by the SDK when you use it against the Azure Cosmos DB Table API:

```csharp
CloudTable tableReference = client.GetTableReference("table");
TableResult tableResult = tableReference.Execute(TableOperation.Insert(new DynamicTableEntity("partitionKey", "rowKey")));
if (tableResult.RequestCharge.HasValue) // would be false when using Azure Storage Tables
{
    double requestCharge = tableResult.RequestCharge.Value;
}
```

For more information, see [Quickstart: Build a Table API app by using the .NET SDK and Azure Cosmos DB](create-table-dotnet.md).
