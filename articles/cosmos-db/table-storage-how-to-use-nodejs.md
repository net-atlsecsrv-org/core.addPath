# How to use Azure Table storage or the Azure Cosmos DB Table API from Node.js

[!INCLUDE [storage-selector-table-include](../../includes/storage-selector-table-include.md)]
[!INCLUDE [storage-table-applies-to-storagetable-and-cosmos](../../includes/storage-table-applies-to-storagetable-and-cosmos.md)]

This article shows you how to create tables, store your data, and perform CRUD operations on the data. Choose either the Azure Table service or the Azure Cosmos DB Table API. The samples are written in Node.js.

## Create an Azure service account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-azure-service-account](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-azure-service-account.md)]

**Create an Azure storage account**

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-storage-account](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-storage-account.md)]

**Create an Azure Cosmos DB Table API account**

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-tableapi-account](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-tableapi-account.md)]

## Configure your application to access Azure Storage or the Azure Cosmos DB Table API

To use Azure Storage or Azure Cosmos DB, you need the Azure Storage SDK for Node.js, which includes a set of convenience libraries that
communicate with the Storage REST services.

### Use Node Package Manager (NPM) to install the package

1. Use a command-line interface such as **PowerShell** (Windows), **Terminal** (Mac), or **Bash** (Unix), and navigate to the folder where you created your application.
2. Type **npm install azure-storage** in the command window. Output from the command is similar to the following example.

   ```bash
    azure-storage@0.5.0 node_modules\azure-storage
    +-- extend@1.2.1
    +-- xmlbuilder@0.4.3
    +-- mime@1.2.11
    +-- node-uuid@1.4.3
    +-- validator@3.22.2
    +-- underscore@1.4.4
    +-- readable-stream@1.0.33 (string_decoder@0.10.31, isarray@0.0.1, inherits@2.0.1, core-util-is@1.0.1)
    +-- xml2js@0.2.7 (sax@0.5.2)
    +-- request@2.57.0 (caseless@0.10.0, aws-sign2@0.5.0, forever-agent@0.6.1, stringstream@0.0.4, oauth-sign@0.8.0, tunnel-agent@0.4.1, isstream@0.1.2, json-stringify-safe@5.0.1, bl@0.9.4, combined-stream@1.0.5, qs@3.1.0, mime-types@2.0.14, form-data@0.2.0, http-signature@0.11.0, tough-cookie@2.0.0, hawk@2.3.1, har-validator@1.8.0)
   ```

3. You can manually run the **ls** command to verify that a **node_modules** folder was created. Inside that folder you will find the **azure-storage** package, which contains the libraries you need to access storage.

### Import the package

Add the following code to the top of the **server.js** file in your application:

```javascript
var azure = require('azure-storage');
```

## Add your connection string

You can either connect to the Azure storage account or the Azure Cosmos DB Table API account. Get the connection string based on the type of account you are using.

### Add an Azure Storage connection

The Azure module reads the environment variables AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT and AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY, or AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING for information required to connect to your Azure Storage account. If these environment variables are not set, you must specify the account information when calling `TableService`. For example, the following code creates a `TableService` object:

```javascript
var tableSvc = azure.createTableService('myaccount', 'myaccesskey');
```

### Add an Azure Cosmos DB connection

To add an Azure Cosmos DB connection, create a `TableService` object and specify your account name, primary key, and endpoint. You can copy these values from **Settings** > **Connection String** in the Azure portal for your Cosmos DB account. For example:

```javascript
var tableSvc = azure.createTableService('myaccount', 'myprimarykey', 'myendpoint');
```

## Create a table

The following code creates a `TableService` object and uses it to create a new table.

```javascript
var tableSvc = azure.createTableService();
```

The call to `createTableIfNotExists` creates a new table with the specified name if it does not already exist. The following example creates a new table named 'mytable' if it does not already exist:

```javascript
tableSvc.createTableIfNotExists('mytable', function(error, result, response){
  if(!error){
    // Table exists or created
  }
});
```

The `result.created` is `true` if a new table is created, and `false` if the table already exists. The `response` contains information about the request.

### Apply filters

You can apply optional filtering to operations performed using `TableService`. Filtering operations can include logging, automatic retries, etc. Filters are objects that implement a method with the signature:

```javascript
function handle (requestOptions, next)
```

After doing its preprocessing on the request options, the method must call **next**, passing a callback with the following signature:

```javascript
function (returnObject, finalCallback, next)
```

In this callback, and after processing the `returnObject` (the response from the request to the server), the callback must either invoke `next` if it exists to continue processing other filters or simply invoke `finalCallback` otherwise to end the service invocation.

Two filters that implement retry logic are included with the Azure SDK for Node.js, `ExponentialRetryPolicyFilter` and `LinearRetryPolicyFilter`. The following creates a `TableService` object that uses the `ExponentialRetryPolicyFilter`:

```javascript
var retryOperations = new azure.ExponentialRetryPolicyFilter();
var tableSvc = azure.createTableService().withFilter(retryOperations);
```

## Add an entity to a table

To add an entity, first create an object that defines your entity properties. All entities must contain a **PartitionKey** and **RowKey**, which are unique identifiers for the entity.

* **PartitionKey** - Determines the partition in which the entity is stored.
* **RowKey** - Uniquely identifies the entity within the partition.

Both **PartitionKey** and **RowKey** must be string values. For more information, see [Understanding the Table Service Data Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179338.aspx).

The following is an example of defining an entity. The **dueDate** is defined as a type of `Edm.DateTime`. Specifying the type is optional, and types are inferred if not specified.

```javascript
var task = {
  PartitionKey: {'_':'hometasks'},
  RowKey: {'_': '1'},
  description: {'_':'take out the trash'},
  dueDate: {'_':new Date(2015, 6, 20), '$':'Edm.DateTime'}
};
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a `Timestamp` field for each record, which is set by Azure when an entity is inserted or updated.

You can also use the `entityGenerator` to create entities. The following example creates the same task entity using the `entityGenerator`.

```javascript
var entGen = azure.TableUtilities.entityGenerator;
var task = {
  PartitionKey: entGen.String('hometasks'),
  RowKey: entGen.String('1'),
  description: entGen.String('take out the trash'),
  dueDate: entGen.DateTime(new Date(Date.UTC(2015, 6, 20))),
};
```

To add an entity to your table, pass the entity object to the `insertEntity` method.

```javascript
tableSvc.insertEntity('mytable',task, function (error, result, response) {
  if(!error){
    // Entity inserted
  }
});
```

If the operation is successful, `result` contains the [ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) of the inserted record and `response` contains information about the operation.

Example response:

```javascript
{ '.metadata': { etag: 'W/"datetime\'2015-02-25T01%3A22%3A22.5Z\'"' } }
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `insertEntity` does not return the inserted entity as part of the `response` information. If you plan on performing other operations on this entity, or want to cache the information, it can be useful to have it returned as part of the `result`. You can do this by enabling `echoContent` as follows:
>
> `tableSvc.insertEntity('mytable', task, {echoContent: true}, function (error, result, response) {...}`

## Update an entity

There are multiple methods available to update an existing entity:

* `replaceEntity` - Updates an existing entity by replacing it.
* `mergeEntity` - Updates an existing entity by merging new property values into the existing entity.
* `insertOrReplaceEntity` - Updates an existing entity by replacing it. If no entity exists, a new one will be inserted.
* `insertOrMergeEntity` - Updates an existing entity by merging new property values into the existing. If no entity exists, a new one will be inserted.

The following example demonstrates updating an entity using `replaceEntity`:

```javascript
tableSvc.replaceEntity('mytable', updatedTask, function(error, result, response){
  if(!error) {
    // Entity updated
  }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, updating an entity does not check to see if the data being updated has previously been modified by another process. To support concurrent updates:
>
> 1. Get the ETag of the object being updated. This is returned as part of the `response` for any entity-related operation and can be retrieved through `response['.metadata'].etag`.
> 2. When performing an update operation on an entity, add the ETag information previously retrieved to the new entity. For example:
>
> 		entity2['.metadata'].etag = currentEtag;
> 3. Perform the update operation. If the entity has been modified since you retrieved the ETag value, such as another instance of your application, an `error` is returned stating that the update condition specified in the request was not satisfied.
>
>

With `replaceEntity` and `mergeEntity`, if the entity that is being updated doesn't exist, then the update operation fails; therefore, if you want to store an entity regardless of whether it already exists, use `insertOrReplaceEntity` or `insertOrMergeEntity`.

The `result` for successful update operations contains the **Etag** of the updated entity.

## Work with groups of entities

Sometimes it makes sense to submit multiple operations together in a batch to ensure atomic processing by the server. To accomplish that, use the `TableBatch` class to create a batch, and then use the `executeBatch` method of `TableService` to perform the batched operations.

 The following example demonstrates submitting two entities in a batch:

```javascript
var task1 = {
  PartitionKey: {'_':'hometasks'},
  RowKey: {'_': '1'},
  description: {'_':'Take out the trash'},
  dueDate: {'_':new Date(2015, 6, 20)}
};
var task2 = {
  PartitionKey: {'_':'hometasks'},
  RowKey: {'_': '2'},
  description: {'_':'Wash the dishes'},
  dueDate: {'_':new Date(2015, 6, 20)}
};

var batch = new azure.TableBatch();

batch.insertEntity(task1, {echoContent: true});
batch.insertEntity(task2, {echoContent: true});

tableSvc.executeBatch('mytable', batch, function (error, result, response) {
  if(!error) {
    // Batch completed
  }
});
```

For successful batch operations, `result` contains information for each operation in the batch.

### Work with batched operations

You can inspect operations added to a batch by viewing the `operations` property. You can also use the following methods to work with operations:

* **clear** - Clears all operations from a batch.
* **getOperations** - Gets an operation from the batch.
* **hasOperations** - Returns true if the batch contains operations.
* **removeOperations** - Removes an operation.
* **size** - Returns the number of operations in the batch.

## Retrieve an entity by key

To return a specific entity based on the **PartitionKey** and **RowKey**, use the **retrieveEntity** method.

```javascript
tableSvc.retrieveEntity('mytable', 'hometasks', '1', function(error, result, response){
  if(!error){
    // result contains the entity
  }
});
```

After this operation is complete, `result` contains the entity.

## Query a set of entities

To query a table, use the **TableQuery** object to build up a query expression using the following clauses:

* **select** - The fields to be returned from the query.
* **where** - The where clause.

  * **and** - An `and` where condition.
  * **or** - An `or` where condition.
* **top** - The number of items to fetch.

The following example builds a query that returns the top five items with a PartitionKey of 'hometasks'.

```javascript
var query = new azure.TableQuery()
  .top(5)
  .where('PartitionKey eq ?', 'hometasks');
```

Because **select** is not used, all fields are returned. To perform the query against a table, use **queryEntities**. The following example uses this query to return entities from 'mytable'.

```javascript
tableSvc.queryEntities('mytable',query, null, function(error, result, response) {
  if(!error) {
    // query was successful
  }
});
```

If successful, `result.entries` contains an array of entities that match the query. If the query was unable to return all entities, `result.continuationToken` is non-*null* and can be used as the third parameter of **queryEntities** to retrieve more results. For the initial query, use *null* for the third parameter.

### Query a subset of entity properties

A query to a table can retrieve just a few fields from an entity.
This reduces bandwidth and can improve query performance, especially for large entities. Use the **select** clause and pass the names of the fields to return. For example, the following query returns only the **description** and **dueDate** fields.

```javascript
var query = new azure.TableQuery()
  .select(['description', 'dueDate'])
  .top(5)
  .where('PartitionKey eq ?', 'hometasks');
```

## Delete an entity

You can delete an entity using its partition and row keys. In this example, the **task1** object contains the **RowKey** and **PartitionKey** values of the entity to delete. Then the object is passed to the **deleteEntity** method.

```javascript
var task = {
  PartitionKey: {'_':'hometasks'},
  RowKey: {'_': '1'}
};

tableSvc.deleteEntity('mytable', task, function(error, response){
  if(!error) {
    // Entity deleted
  }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Consider using ETags when deleting items, to ensure that the item hasn't been modified by another process. See [Update an entity](#update-an-entity) for information on using ETags.
>
>

## Delete a table

The following code deletes a table from a storage account.

```javascript
tableSvc.deleteTable('mytable', function(error, response){
    if(!error){
        // Table deleted
    }
});
```

If you are uncertain whether the table exists, use **deleteTableIfExists**.

## Use continuation tokens

When you are querying tables for large amounts of results, look for continuation tokens. There may be large amounts of data available for your query that you might not realize if you do not build to recognize when a continuation token is present.

The **results** object returned during querying entities sets a `continuationToken` property when such a token is present. You can then use this when performing a query to continue to move across the partition and table entities.

When querying, you can provide a `continuationToken` parameter between the query object instance and the callback function:

```javascript
var nextContinuationToken = null;
dc.table.queryEntities(tableName,
    query,
    nextContinuationToken,
    function (error, results) {
        if (error) throw error;

        // iterate through results.entries with results

        if (results.continuationToken) {
            nextContinuationToken = results.continuationToken;
        }

    });
```

If you inspect the `continuationToken` object, you will find properties such as `nextPartitionKey`, `nextRowKey` and `targetLocation`, which can be used to iterate through all the results.

You can also use `top` along with `continuationToken` to set the page size.

## Work with shared access signatures

Shared access signatures (SAS) are a secure way to provide granular access to tables without providing your Storage account name or keys. SAS are often used to provide limited access to your data, such as allowing a mobile app to query records.

A trusted application such as a cloud-based service generates a SAS using the **generateSharedAccessSignature** of the **TableService**, and provides it to an untrusted or semi-trusted application such as a mobile app. The SAS is generated using a policy, which describes the start and end dates during which the SAS is valid, as well as the access level granted to the SAS holder.

The following example generates a new shared access policy that will allow the SAS holder to query ('r') the table, and expires 100 minutes after the time it is created.

```javascript
var startDate = new Date();
var expiryDate = new Date(startDate);
expiryDate.setMinutes(startDate.getMinutes() + 100);
startDate.setMinutes(startDate.getMinutes() - 100);

var sharedAccessPolicy = {
  AccessPolicy: {
    Permissions: azure.TableUtilities.SharedAccessPermissions.QUERY,
    Start: startDate,
    Expiry: expiryDate
  },
};

var tableSAS = tableSvc.generateSharedAccessSignature('mytable', sharedAccessPolicy);
var host = tableSvc.host;
```

Note that you must also provide the host information, as it is required when the SAS holder attempts to access the table.

The client application then uses the SAS with **TableServiceWithSAS** to perform operations against the table. The following example connects to the table and performs a query. See [Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md) article for the format of tableSAS.

```javascript
// Note in the following command, host is in the format: `https://<your_storage_account_name>.table.core.windows.net` and the tableSAS is in the format: `sv=2018-03-28&si=saspolicy&tn=mytable&sig=9aCzs76n0E7y5BpEi2GvsSv433BZa22leDOZXX%2BXXIU%3D`;

var sharedTableService = azure.createTableServiceWithSas(host, tableSAS);
var query = azure.TableQuery()
  .where('PartitionKey eq ?', 'hometasks');

sharedTableService.queryEntities(query, null, function(error, result, response) {
  if(!error) {
    // result contains the entities
  }
});
```

Because the SAS was generated with only query access, an error is returned if you attempt to insert, update, or delete entities.

### Access Control Lists

You can also use an Access Control List (ACL) to set the access policy for a SAS. This is useful if you want to allow multiple clients to access the table, but provide different access policies for each client.

An ACL is implemented using an array of access policies, with an ID associated with each policy. The following example defines two policies, one for 'user1' and one for 'user2':

```javascript
var sharedAccessPolicy = {
  user1: {
    Permissions: azure.TableUtilities.SharedAccessPermissions.QUERY,
    Start: startDate,
    Expiry: expiryDate
  },
  user2: {
    Permissions: azure.TableUtilities.SharedAccessPermissions.ADD,
    Start: startDate,
    Expiry: expiryDate
  }
};
```

The following example gets the current ACL for the **hometasks** table, and then adds the new policies using **setTableAcl**. This approach allows:

```javascript
var extend = require('extend');
tableSvc.getTableAcl('hometasks', function(error, result, response) {
if(!error){
    var newSignedIdentifiers = extend(true, result.signedIdentifiers, sharedAccessPolicy);
    tableSvc.setTableAcl('hometasks', newSignedIdentifiers, function(error, result, response){
      if(!error){
        // ACL set
      }
    });
  }
});
```

After the ACL has been set, you can then create a SAS based on the ID for a policy. The following example creates a new SAS for 'user2':

```javascript
tableSAS = tableSvc.generateSharedAccessSignature('hometasks', { Id: 'user2' });
```
