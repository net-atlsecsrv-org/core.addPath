# Use MongoDB extension commands to manage data stored in Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB 
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-mongodb-api](includes/appliesto-mongodb-api.md)]

The following document contains the custom action commands that are specific to Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB. These commands can be used to create and obtain database resources that are specific to the [Azure Cosmos DB capacity model](account-databases-containers-items.md).

By using the Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB, you can enjoy the benefits Cosmos DB such as global distribution, automatic sharding, high availability, latency guarantees, automatic, encryption at rest, backups, and many more, while preserving your investments in your MongoDB app. You can communicate with the Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB by using any of the open-source [MongoDB client drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers). The Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB enables the use of existing client drivers by adhering to the [MongoDB wire protocol](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol).

## MongoDB protocol support

Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB is compatible with MongoDB server version 3.2 and 3.6. See [supported features and syntax](mongodb-feature-support.md) for more details. 

The following extension commands provide the ability to create and modify Azure Cosmos DB-specific resources via database requests:

* [Create database](#create-database)
* [Update database](#update-database)
* [Get database](#get-database)
* [Create collection](#create-collection)
* [Update collection](#update-collection)
* [Get collection](#get-collection)

## <a id="create-database"></a> Create database

The create database extension command creates a new MongoDB database. The database name can be used from the database context set by the `use database` command. The following table describes the parameters within the command:

|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `customAction`   |  `string`  |   Name of the custom command, it must be "CreateDatabase".      |
| `offerThroughput` | `int`  | Provisioned throughput that you set on the database. This parameter is optional. |
| `autoScaleSettings` | `Object` | Required for [Autoscale mode](provision-throughput-autoscale.md). This object contains the settings associated with the Autoscale capacity mode. You can set up the `maxThroughput` value, which describes the highest amount of Request Units that the collection will be increased to dynamically. |

### Output

If the command is successful, it will return the following response:

```javascript
{ "ok" : 1 }
```

See the [default output](#default-output) of custom command for the parameters in the output.

### Examples

#### Create a database

To create a database named `"test"` that uses all the default values, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateDatabase"});
```

This command will create a database without database-level throughput. This means that the collections within this database will need to specify the amount of throughput that you need to use.

#### Create a database with throughput

To create a database named `"test"` and to specify a [database-level](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database) provisioned throughput of 1000 RUs, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateDatabase", offerThroughput: 1000 });
```

This will create a database and set a throughput to it. All collections within this database will share the set throughput, unless the collections are created with [a specific throughput level](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database-and-a-container).

#### Create a database with Autoscale throughput

To create a database named `"test"` and to specify an Autoscale max throughput of 20,000 RU/s at [database-level](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database), use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateDatabase", autoScaleSettings: { maxThroughput: 20000 } });
```

## <a id="update-database"></a> Update database

The update database extension command updates the properties associated with the specified database. The following table describes the parameters within the command:

|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `customAction`    |    `string`     |   Name of the custom command. Must be "UpdateDatabase".      |
|  `offerThroughput`   |  `int`       |     New provisioned throughput that you want to set on the database if the database uses [database-level throughput](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database)  |
| `autoScaleSettings` | `Object` | Required for [Autoscale mode](provision-throughput-autoscale.md). This object contains the settings associated with the Autoscale capacity mode. You can set up the `maxThroughput` value, which describes the highest amount of Request Units that the database will be increased to dynamically. |

This command uses the database specified in the context of the session. This is the database you used in the `use <database>` command. At the moment, the database name can not be changed using this command.

### Output

If the command is successful, it will return the following response:

```javascript
{ "ok" : 1 }
```

See the [default output](#default-output) of custom command for the parameters in the output.

### Examples

#### Update the provisioned throughput associated with a database

To update the provisioned throughput of a database with name `"test"` to 1200 RUs, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "UpdateDatabase", offerThroughput: 1200 });
```

#### Update the Autoscale throughput associated with a database

To update the provisioned throughput of a database with name `"test"` to 20,000 RUs, or to transform it to an [Autoscale throughput level](provision-throughput-autoscale.md), use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "UpdateDatabase", autoScaleSettings: { maxThroughput: 20000 } });
```


## <a id="get-database"></a> Get database

The get database extension command returns the database object. The database name is used from the database context against which the command is executed.

```javascript
{
  customAction: "GetDatabase"
}
```

The following table describes the parameters within the command:


|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  `customAction`   |   `string`      |   Name of the custom command. Must be "GetDatabase"|
		
### Output

If the command succeeds, the response contains a document with the following fields:

|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  `ok`   |   `int`     |   Status of response. 1 == success. 0 == failure.      |
| `database`    |    `string`	     |   Name of the database.      |
|   `provisionedThroughput`  |    `int`	     |    Provisioned throughput that is set on the database if the database is using  [manual database-level throughput](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database)     |
| `autoScaleSettings` | `Object` | This object contains the capacity parameters associated with the database if it is using the [Autoscale mode](provision-throughput-autoscale.md). The `maxThroughput` value describes the highest amount of Request Units that the database will be increased to dynamically. |

If the command fails, a default custom command response is returned. See the [default output](#default-output) of custom command for the parameters in the output.

### Examples

#### Get the database

To get the database object for a database named `"test"`, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "GetDatabase"});
```

If the database has no associated throughput, the output would be:

```javascript
{ "database" : "test", "ok" : 1 }
```

If the database has a [database-level manual throughput](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database) associated with it, the output would show the `provisionedThroughput` values:

```javascript
{ "database" : "test", "provisionedThroughput" : 20000, "ok" : 1 }
```

If the database has a [database-level Autoscale throughput](provision-throughput-autoscale.md) associated with it, the output would show the `provisionedThroughput`, which describes the minimum RU/s for the database, and the `autoScaleSettings` object including the `maxThroughput`, which describes the maximum RU/s for the database.

```javascript
{
        "database" : "test",
        "provisionedThroughput" : 2000,
        "autoScaleSettings" : {
                "maxThroughput" : 20000
        },
        "ok" : 1
}
```

## <a id="create-collection"></a> Create collection

The create collection extension command creates a new MongoDB collection. The database name is used from the databases context set by the `use database` command. The format of the CreateCollection command is as follows:

```javascript
{
  customAction: "CreateCollection",
  collection: "<Collection Name>",
  shardKey: "<Shard key path>",
  offerThroughput: (int), // Amount of throughput allocated to a specific collection

}
```

The following table describes the parameters within the command:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| `customAction` | `string` | Required | Name of the custom command. Must be "CreateCollection".|
| `collection` | `string` | Required | Name of the collection. No special characters or spaces are allowed.|
| `offerThroughput` | `int` | Optional | Provisioned throughput to set on the database. If this parameter is not provided, it will default to the minimum, 400 RU/s. * To specify throughput beyond 10,000 RU/s, the `shardKey` parameter is required.|
| `shardKey` | `string` | Required for collections with large throughput | The path to the Shard Key for the sharded collection. This parameter is required if you set more than 10,000 RU/s in `offerThroughput`.  If it is specified, all documents inserted will require this key and value. |
| `autoScaleSettings` | `Object` | Required for [Autoscale mode](provision-throughput-autoscale.md) | This object contains the settings associated with the Autoscale capacity mode. You can set up the `maxThroughput` value, which describes the highest amount of Request Units that the collection will be increased to dynamically. |

### Output

Returns a default custom command response. See the [default output](#default-output) of custom command for the parameters in the output.

### Examples

#### Create a collection with the minimum configuration

To create a new collection with name `"testCollection"` and the default values, use the following command: 

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateCollection", collection: "testCollection"});
```

This will result in a new fixed, unsharded, collection with 400RU/s and an index on the `_id` field automatically created. This type of configuration will also apply when creating new collections via the `insert()` function. For example: 

```javascript
use test
db.newCollection.insert({});
```

#### Create a unsharded collection

To create a unsharded collection with name `"testCollection"` and provisioned throughput of 1000 RUs, use the following command: 

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateCollection", collection: "testCollection", offerThroughput: 1000});
``` 

You can create a collection with up to 10,000 RU/s as the `offerThroughput` without needing to specify a shard key. For collections with larger throughput, check out the next section.

#### Create a sharded collection

To create a sharded collection with name `"testCollection"` and provisioned throughput of 11,000 RUs, and a `shardkey` property "a.b", use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateCollection", collection: "testCollection", offerThroughput: 11000, shardKey: "a.b" });
```

This command now requires the `shardKey` parameter, since more than 10,000 RU/s specified in the `offerThroughput`.

#### Create an unsharded Autoscale collection

To create an unsharded collection named `'testCollection'` that uses [Autoscale throughput capacity](provision-throughput-autoscale.md) set to 4,000 RU/s, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({ 
    customAction: "CreateCollection", collection: "testCollection", 
    autoScaleSettings:{
      maxThroughput: 4000
    } 
});
```

For the `autoScaleSettings.maxThroughput` value you can specify a range from 4,000 RU/s to 10,000 RU/s without a shard key. For higher autoscale throughput, you need to specify the `shardKey` parameter.

#### Create a sharded Autoscale collection

To create a sharded collection named `'testCollection'` with a shard key called `'a.b'`, and that uses [Autoscale throughput capacity](provision-throughput-autoscale.md) set to 20,000 RU/s, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "CreateCollection", collection: "testCollection", shardKey: "a.b", autoScaleSettings: { maxThroughput: 20000 }});
```

## <a id="update-collection"></a> Update collection

The update collection extension command updates the properties associated with the specified collection.

```javascript
{
  customAction: "UpdateCollection",
  collection: "<Name of the collection that you want to update>",
  offerThroughput: (int) // New throughput that will be set to the collection
}
```

The following table describes the parameters within the command:

|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  `customAction`   |   `string`      |   Name of the custom command. Must be "UpdateCollection".      |
|  `collection`   |   `string`      |  	Name of the collection.       |
| `offerThroughput`	| `int` |	Provisioned throughput to set on the collection.|
| `autoScaleSettings` | `Object` | Required for [Autoscale mode](provision-throughput-autoscale.md). This object contains the settings associated with the Autoscale capacity mode. The `maxThroughput` value describes the highest amount of Request Units that the collection will be increased to dynamically. |

## Output

Returns a default custom command response. See the [default output](#default-output) of custom command for the parameters in the output.

### Examples

#### Update the provisioned throughput associated with a collection

To update the provisioned throughput of a collection with name `"testCollection"` to 1200 RUs, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "UpdateCollection", collection: "testCollection", offerThroughput: 1200 });
```

## <a id="get-collection"></a> Get collection

The get collection custom command returns the collection object.

```javascript
{
  customAction: "GetCollection",
  collection: "<Name of the collection>"
}
```

The following table describes the parameters within the command:


|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `customAction`    |   `string`      |   Name of the custom command. Must be "GetCollection".      |
| `collection`    |    `string`     |    Name of the collection.     |

### Output

If the command succeeds, the response contains a document with the following fields


|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  `ok`   |    `int`     |   Status of response. 1 == success. 0 == failure.      |
| `database`    |    `string`     |   Name of the database.      |
| `collection`    |    `string`     |    Name of the collection.     |
|  `shardKeyDefinition`   |   `document`      |  Index specification document used as a shard key. This is an optional response parameter.       |
|  `provisionedThroughput`   |   `int`      |    Provisioned Throughput to set on the collection. This is an optional response parameter.     |
| `autoScaleSettings` | `Object` | This object contains the capacity parameters associated with the database if it is using the [Autoscale mode](provision-throughput-autoscale.md). The `maxThroughput` value describes the highest amount of Request Units that the collection will be increased to dynamically. |

If the command fails, a default custom command response is returned. See the [default output](#default-output) of custom command for the parameters in the output.

### Examples

#### Get the collection

To get the collection object for a collection named `"testCollection"`, use the following command:

```javascript
use test
db.runCommand({customAction: "GetCollection", collection: "testCollection"});
```

If the collection has an associated throughput capacity to it, it will include the `provisionedThroughput` value, and the output would be:

```javascript
{
        "database" : "test",
        "collection" : "testCollection",
        "provisionedThroughput" : 400,
        "ok" : 1
}
```

If the collection has an associated Autoscale throughput, it will include the `autoScaleSettings` object with the `maxThroughput` parameter, which defines the maximum throughput the collection will increase to dynamically. Additionally, it will also include the `provisionedThroughput` value, which defines the minimum throughput this collection will reduce to if there are no requests in the collection: 

```javascript
{
        "database" : "test",
        "collection" : "testCollection",
        "provisionedThroughput" : 1000,
        "autoScaleSettings" : {
            "maxThroughput" : 10000
        },
        "ok" : 1
}
```

If the collection is sharing [database-level throughput](set-throughput.md#set-throughput-on-a-database), either on Autoscale mode or manual, the output would be:

```javascript
{ "database" : "test", "collection" : "testCollection", "ok" : 1 }
```

```javascript
{
        "database" : "test",
        "provisionedThroughput" : 2000,
        "autoScaleSettings" : {
            "maxThroughput" : 20000
        },
        "ok" : 1
}
```


## <a id="default-output"></a> Default output of a custom command

If not specified, a custom response contains a document with the following fields:

|**Field**|**Type** |**Description** |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  `ok`   |    `int`     |   Status of response. 1 == success. 0 == failure.      |
| `code`    |   `int`      |   Only returned when the command failed (i.e. ok == 0). Contains the MongoDB error code. This is an optional response parameter.      |
|  `errMsg`   |  `string`      | 	Only returned when the command failed (i.e. ok == 0). Contains a user-friendly error message. This is an optional response parameter.      |

For example:

```javascript
{ "ok" : 1 }
```
