# Azure CLI samples for Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API

The following table includes links to sample Azure CLI scripts for Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API. Reference pages for all Azure Cosmos DB CLI commands are available in the [Azure CLI Reference](/cli/azure/cosmosdb). All Azure Cosmos DB CLI script samples can be found in the [Azure Cosmos DB CLI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cli-samples/tree/master/cosmosdb).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently you can only create 3.2 version (that is, accounts using the endpoint in the format `*.documents.azure.com`) of Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB accounts by using PowerShell, CLI, and Resource Manager templates. To create 3.6 version of accounts, use Azure portal instead.
