# PostgreSQL extensions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server
PostgreSQL provides the ability to extend the functionality of your database using extensions. Extensions allow for bundling multiple related SQL objects together in a single package that can be loaded or removed from your database with a single command. After being loaded in the database, extensions can function as do built-in features. For more information on PostgreSQL extensions, see [Packaging Related Objects into an Extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/extend-extensions.html).

## How to use PostgreSQL extensions
PostgreSQL extensions must be installed in your database before you can use them. To install a particular extension, run the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-createextension.html) command from psql tool to load the packaged objects into your database.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL currently supports a subset of key extensions as listed below. Extensions beyond the ones listed are not supported; you cannot create your own extension with Azure Database for PostgreSQL service.

## Extensions supported by Azure Database for PostgreSQL
The following tables list the standard PostgreSQL extensions that are currently supported by Azure Database for PostgreSQL. This information is also available by running `SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;`.

Provides time-oriented analytical functions, optimizations, and scales PostgreSQL for time-series workloads.

## pg_stat_statements
The [pg\_stat\_statements extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/pgstatstatements.html) is preloaded on every Azure Database for PostgreSQL server to provide you a means of tracking execution statistics of SQL statements.
The setting `pg_stat_statements.track`, which controls what statements are counted by the extension, defaults to `top`, meaning all statements issued directly by clients are tracked. The two other tracking levels are `none` and `all`. This setting is configurable as a server parameter through the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/howto-configure-server-parameters-using-portal) or the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/howto-configure-server-parameters-using-cli).

There is a tradeoff between the query execution information pg_stat_statements provides and the impact on server performance as it logs each SQL statement. If you are not actively using the pg_stat_statements extension, we recommend that you set `pg_stat_statements.track` to `none`. Note that some third party monitoring services may rely on pg_stat_statements to deliver query performance insights, so confirm whether this is the case for you or not.

## dblink and postgres_fdw
dblink and postgres_fdw allow you to connect from one PostgreSQL server to another, or to another database in the same server. The receiving server needs to allow connections from the sending server through its firewall. When using these extensions to connect between Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers, this can be done by setting "Allow access to Azure services" to ON. This is also needed if you want to use the extensions to loop back to the same server. The "Allow access to Azure services" setting can be found in the Azure portal page for the Postgres server, under Connection Security. Turning "Allow access to Azure services" ON whitelists all Azure IPs.

Currently, outbound connections from Azure Database for PostgreSQL are not supported, except for connections to other Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers.

## TimescaleDB
TimescaleDB is a time-series database that is packaged as an extension for PostgreSQL. TimescaleDB provides time-oriented analytical functions, optimizations, and scales Postgres for time-series workloads.

### Installing TimescaleDB
To install TimescaleDB, you need to include it in the server's shared preload libraries. A change to Postgres's shared preload libraries requires a **server reboot** to take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> TimescaleDB can be enabled on Azure Database for PostgreSQL versions 9.6 and 10

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

2. On the sidebar, select **Server Parameters**.

3. Search for the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter.

4. Copy and paste the following as the value for `shared_preload_libraries`
   ```
   timescaledb
   ```

5. Select **Save** to preserve your changes. You get a notification once the change is saved. 

6. After the notification, **restart** the server to apply these changes. To learn how to restart a server, see [Restart an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server](howto-restart-server-portal.md).


You can now enable TimescaleDB in your Postgres database. Connect to the database and issue the following command:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
```
> [!TIP]
> If you see an error, confirm that you [restarted your server](howto-restart-server-portal.md) after saving shared_preload_libraries. 

You can now create a TimescaleDB hypertable [from scratch](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/creating-hypertables) or migrate [existing time-series data in PostgreSQL](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/migrating-data).
