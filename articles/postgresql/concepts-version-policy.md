# Azure Database for PostgreSQL versioning policy

This page describes the Azure Database for PostgreSQL versioning policy, and is applicable to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server and Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server (Preview) deployment modes.

## Supported  PostgreSQL versions

Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports the following database versions.

| Version | Single Server | Flexible Server (Preview) |
| ----- | :------: | :----: |
| PostgreSQL 12 |  | X  | 
| PostgreSQL 11 | X | X |
| PostgreSQL 10 | X |  |
| PostgreSQL 9.6 | X |  |
| PostgreSQL 9.5 | X |  |

## Major version support
Each major version of PostgreSQL will be supported by Azure Database for PostgreSQL from the date on which Azure begins supporting the version until the version is retired by the PostgreSQL community, as provided in the [PostgreSQL community versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

## Minor version support
Azure Database for PostgreSQL automatically performs minor version upgrades to the Azure preferred PostgreSQL version as part of periodic maintenance. 

## Major version retirement policy
The table below provides the retirement details for PostgreSQL major versions. The dates follow the [PostgreSQL community versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

| Version | What's New | Azure support start date | Retirement date|

| PostgreSQL 9.5| [Features](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/release-9-5.html)  | April 18, 2018	| February 11, 2021
| [PostgreSQL 9.6](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-96-released-1703/) | [Features](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/NewIn96) | April 18, 2018	| November 11, 2021

## Retired PostgreSQL engine versions not supported in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

After the retirement date for each PostgreSQL database version, if you continue running the retired version, note the following restrictions:
- As the community will not be releasing any further bug fixes or security fixes, Azure Database for PostgreSQL will not patch the retired database engine for any bugs or security issues or otherwise take security measures with regard to the retired database engine. You may experience security vulnerabilities or other issues as a result. However, Azure will continue to perform periodic maintenance and patching for the host, OS, containers, and any other service-related components.
- If any support issue you may experience relates to the PostgreSQL database, we may not be able to provide you with support. In such cases, you will have to upgrade your database in order for us to provide you with any support.
- You will not be able to create new database servers for the retired version. However, you will be able to perform point-in-time recoveries and create read replicas for your existing servers.
- New service capabilities developed by Azure Database for PostgreSQL may only be available to supported database server versions.
- Uptime SLAs will apply solely to Azure Database for PostgreSQL service-related issues and not to any downtime caused by database engine-related bugs.  
- In the extreme event of a serious threat to the service caused by the PostgreSQL database engine vulnerability identified in the retired database version, Azure may choose to stop your database server to secure the service. In such case, you will be notified to upgrade the server before bringing the server online.

## PostgreSQL version syntax
Before PostgreSQL version 10, the [PostgreSQL versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) considered a _major version_ upgrade to be an increase in the first _or_ second number. For example, 9.5 to 9.6 was considered a _major_ version upgrade. As of version 10, only a change in the first number is considered a major version upgrade. For example, 10.0 to 10.1 is a _minor_ release upgrade. Version 10 to 11 is a _major_ version upgrade.
