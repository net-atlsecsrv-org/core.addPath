# Choose distribution columns in Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Hyperscale (Citus)

Choosing each table's distribution column is one of the most important modeling decisions you'll make. Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Hyperscale (Citus) stores rows in shards based on the value of the rows' distribution column.

The correct choice groups related data together on the same physical nodes, which makes queries fast and adds support for all SQL features. An incorrect choice makes the system run slowly and won't support all SQL features across nodes.

This article gives distribution column tips for the two most common Hyperscale (Citus) scenarios.

### Multi-tenant apps

The multi-tenant architecture uses a form of hierarchical database modeling to
distribute queries across nodes in the server group. The top of the data
hierarchy is known as the *tenant ID* and needs to be stored in a column on
each table.

Hyperscale (Citus) inspects queries to see which tenant ID they involve and finds the matching table shard. It
routes the query to a single worker node that contains the shard. Running a query with
all relevant data placed on the same node is called colocation.

The following diagram illustrates colocation in the multi-tenant data
model. It contains two tables, Accounts and Campaigns, each distributed
by `account_id`. The shaded boxes represent shards. Green shards are stored
together on one worker node, and blue shards are stored on another worker node. Notice how a join
query between Accounts and Campaigns has all the necessary data
together on one node when both tables are restricted to the same
account\_id.

To apply this design in your own schema, identify
what constitutes a tenant in your application. Common instances include
company, account, organization, or customer. The column name will be
something like `company_id` or `customer_id`. Examine each of your
queries and ask yourself, would it work if it had additional WHERE
clauses to restrict all tables involved to rows with the same tenant ID?
Queries in the multi-tenant model are scoped to a tenant. For
instance, queries on sales or inventory are scoped within a certain
store.

#### Best practices

-   **Partition distributed tables by a common tenant\_id column.** For
    instance, in a SaaS application where tenants are companies, the
    tenant\_id is likely to be the company\_id.
-   **Convert small cross-tenant tables to reference tables.** When
    multiple tenants share a small table of information, distribute it
    as a reference table.
-   **Restrict filter all application queries by tenant\_id.** Each
    query should request information for one tenant at a time.

tutorial](./tutorial-design-database-hyperscale-multi-tenant.md) for an example of how to 
build this kind of application.

### Real-time apps

The multi-tenant architecture introduces a hierarchical structure
and uses data colocation to route queries per tenant. By contrast, real-time
architectures depend on specific distribution properties of their data
to achieve highly parallel processing.

We use "entity ID" as a term for distribution columns in the real-time
model. Typical entities are users, hosts, or devices.

Real-time queries typically ask for numeric aggregates grouped by date or
category. Hyperscale (Citus) sends these queries to each shard for partial results and
assembles the final answer on the coordinator node. Queries run fastest when as
many nodes contribute as possible, and when no single node must do a
disproportionate amount of work.

#### Best practices

-   **Choose a column with high cardinality as the distribution
    column.** For comparison, a Status field on an order table with
    values New, Paid, and Shipped is a poor choice of
    distribution column. It assumes only those few values, which limits the number of shards that can hold
    the data, and the number of nodes that can process it. Among columns
    with high cardinality, it's also good to choose those columns that
    are frequently used in group-by clauses or as join keys.
-   **Choose a column with even distribution.** If you distribute a
    table on a column skewed to certain common values, data in the
    table tends to accumulate in certain shards. The nodes that hold
    those shards end up doing more work than other nodes.
-   **Distribute fact and dimension tables on their common columns.**
    Your fact table can have only one distribution key. Tables that join
    on another key won't be colocated with the fact table. Choose
    one dimension to colocate based on how frequently it's joined and
    the size of the joining rows.
-   **Change some dimension tables into reference tables.** If a
    dimension table can't be colocated with the fact table, you can
    improve query performance by distributing copies of the dimension
    table to all of the nodes in the form of a reference table.

tutorial](./tutorial-design-database-hyperscale-realtime.md) for an example of how to build this kind of application.

### Time-series data

In a time-series workload, applications query recent information while they 
archive old information.

The most common mistake in modeling time-series information in Hyperscale (Citus) is to 
use the timestamp itself as a distribution column. A hash distribution based
on time distributes times seemingly at random into different shards rather
than keeping ranges of time together in shards. Queries that involve time
generally reference ranges of time, for example, the most recent data. This type of 
hash distribution leads to network overhead.

#### Best practices

-   **Don't choose a timestamp as the distribution column.** Choose a
    different distribution column. In a multi-tenant app, use the tenant
    ID, or in a real-time app use the entity ID.
-   **Use PostgreSQL table partitioning for time instead.** Use table
    partitioning to break a large table of time-ordered data into
    multiple inherited tables with each table containing different time
    ranges. Distributing a Postgres-partitioned table in Hyperscale (Citus) 
    creates shards for the inherited tables.
