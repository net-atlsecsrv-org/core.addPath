# Troubleshoot data encryption in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server

This article helps you identify and resolve common issues that can occur in the single-server deployment of Azure Database for PostgreSQL when configured with data encryption using a customer-managed key.

## Introduction

When you configure data encryption to use a customer-managed key in Azure Key Vault, the server requires continuous access to the key. If the server loses access to the customer-managed key in Azure Key Vault, it will deny all connections, return the appropriate error message, and change its state to ***Inaccessible*** in the Azure portal.

If you no longer need an inaccessible Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, you can delete it to stop incurring costs. No other actions on the server are permitted until access to the key vault has been restored and the server is available. It's also not possible to change the data encryption option from `Yes`(customer-managed) to `No` (service-managed) on an inaccessible server when it's encrypted with a customer-managed key. You'll have to revalidate the key manually before the server is accessible again. This action is necessary to protect the data from unauthorized access while permissions to the customer-managed key are revoked.

## Common errors causing server to become inaccessible

The following misconfigurations cause most issues with data encryption that use Azure Key Vault keys:

- The key vault is unavailable or doesn't exist:
  - The key vault was accidentally deleted.
  - An intermittent network error causes the key vault to be unavailable.

- You don't have permissions to access the key vault or the key doesn't exist:
  - The key expired or was accidentally deleted or disabled.
- The managed identity of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance was accidentally deleted.
  - The managed identity of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance has insufficient key permissions. For example, the permissions don't include Get, Wrap, and Unwrap.
  - The managed identity permissions to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance were revoked or deleted.

## Identify and resolve common errors

### Errors on the key vault

#### Disabled key vault

- `AzureKeyVaultKeyDisabledMessage`
- **Explanation**: The operation couldn't be completed on server because the Azure Key Vault key is disabled.

#### Missing key vault permissions

- `AzureKeyVaultMissingPermissionsMessage`
- **Explanation**: The server doesn't have the required Get, Wrap, and Unwrap permissions to Azure Key Vault. Grant any missing permissions to the service principal with ID.

### Mitigation

- Confirm that the customer-managed key is present in the key vault.
- Identify the key vault, then go to the key vault in the Azure portal.
- Ensure that the key URI identifies a key that is present.
