# Create and manage read replicas in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) from the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read replicas in Hyperscale (Citus) are currently in preview. This preview
> version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not
> recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported
> or might have constrained capabilities.
>
> You can see a complete list of other new features in [preview features for
> Hyperscale (Citus)](hyperscale-preview-features.md).

In this article, you learn how to create and manage read replicas in Hyperscale
(Citus) from the Azure portal. To learn more about read replicas, see the
[overview](concepts-hyperscale-read-replicas.md).


## Prerequisites

A [Hyperscale (Citus) server group](quickstart-create-hyperscale-portal.md) to
be the primary.

## Create a read replica

To create a read replica, follow these steps:

1. Select an existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server group to use as the
   primary. 

2. On the server group sidebar, under **Server group management**, select
   **Replication**.

3. Select **Add Replica**.

4. Enter a name for the read replica. 

5. Select **OK** to confirm the creation of the replica.

After the read replica is created, it can be viewed from the **Replication** window.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Review the [considerations section of the Read Replica
> overview](concepts-hyperscale-read-replicas.md#considerations).
>
> Before a primary server group setting is updated to a new value, update the
> replica setting to an equal or greater value. This action helps the replica
> keep up with any changes made to the master.

## Delete a primary server group

To delete a primary server group, you use the same steps as to delete a
standalone Hyperscale (Citus) server group. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When you delete a primary server group, replication to all read replicas is
> stopped. The read replicas become standalone server groups that now support
> both reads and writes.

To delete a server group from the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your primary Azure Database for PostgreSQL
   server group.

2. Open the **Overview** page for the server group. Select **Delete**.
 
3. Enter the name of the primary server group to delete. Select **Delete** to
   confirm deletion of the primary server group.
 

## Delete a replica

You can delete a read replica similarly to how you delete a primary server
group.

- In the Azure portal, open the **Overview** page for the read replica. Select
  **Delete**.
 
You can also delete the read replica from the **Replication** window by
following these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your primary Hyperscale (Citus) server group.

2. On the server group menu, under **Server group management**, select
   **Replication**.

3. Select the read replica to delete.
 
4. Select **Delete replica**.
 
5. Enter the name of the replica to delete. Select **Delete** to confirm
   deletion of the replica.
