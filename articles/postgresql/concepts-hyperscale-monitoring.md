# Monitor and tune Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)

Monitoring data about your servers helps you troubleshoot and optimize for your
workload. Hyperscale (Citus) provides various monitoring options to provide
insight into the behavior of nodes in a server group.

## Metrics

Hyperscale (Citus) provides metrics for each node in a server group. The
metrics give insight into the behavior of supporting resources. Each metric is
emitted at a one-minute frequency, and has up to 30 days of history.

In addition to viewing graphs of the metrics, you can configure alerts. For
step by step guidance, see [How to set up
alerts](howto-hyperscale-alert-on-metric.md).  Other tasks include setting up
automated actions, running advanced analytics, and archiving history. For more
information, see the [Azure Metrics
Overview](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics.md).

### List of metrics

These metrics are available for Hyperscale (Citus) nodes:

|Metric|Metric Display Name|Unit|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|active_connections|Active Connections|Count|The number of active connections to the server.|
|cpu_percent|CPU percent|Percent|The percentage of CPU in use.|
|iops|IOPS|Count|See the [IOPS definition](../virtual-machines/linux/premium-storage-performance.md#iops) and [Hyperscale throughput](concepts-hyperscale-configuration-options.md)|
|memory_percent|Memory percent|Percent|The percentage of memory in use.|
|network_bytes_ingress|Network In|Bytes|Network In across active connections.|
|network_bytes_egress|Network Out|Bytes|Network Out across active connections.|
|storage_percent|Storage percentage|Percent|The percentage of storage used out of the server's maximum.|
|storage_used|Storage used|Bytes|The amount of storage in use. The storage used by the service may include the database files, transaction logs, and the server logs.|

Azure supplies no aggregate metrics for the cluster as a whole, but metrics for
multiple nodes can be placed on the same graph.
