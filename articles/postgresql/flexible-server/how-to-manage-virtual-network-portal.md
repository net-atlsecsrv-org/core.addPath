# Create and manage virtual networks for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server using the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is in preview

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server supports two types of mutually exclusive network connectivity methods to connect to your flexible server. The two options are:

* Public access (allowed IP addresses)
* Private access (VNet Integration)

In this article, we will focus on creation of PostgreSQL server with **Private access (VNet Integration)** using Azure portal. With Private access (VNet Integration), you can deploy your flexible server into your own [Azure Virtual Network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). Azure Virtual Networks provide private and secure network communication. With private access, connections to the PostgreSQL server are restricted to your virtual network. To learn more about it, refer to [Private access (VNet Integration)](./concepts-networking.md#private-access-vnet-integration).

You can deploy your flexible server into a virtual network and subnet during server creation. After the flexible server is deployed, you cannot move it into another virtual network, subnet or to *Public access (allowed IP addresses)*.

## Prerequisites
To create a flexible server in a virtual network, you need:
- A [Virtual Network](../../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md#create-a-virtual-network)
    > [!Note]
    > The virtual network and subnet should be in the same region and subscription as your flexible server.

-  To [delegate a subnet](../../virtual-network/manage-subnet-delegation.md#delegate-a-subnet-to-an-azure-service) to **Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers**. This delegation means that only Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Servers can use that subnet. No other Azure resource types can be in the delegated subnet.

## Create Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server in an already existing virtual network

1. Select **Create a resource** (+) in the upper-left corner of the  portal.
2. Select **Databases** > **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**. You can also enter **PostgreSQL** in the search box to find the service.
3. Select **Flexible server** as the deployment option.
4. Fill out the **Basics** form.
5. Go to the **Networking** tab to configure how you want to connect to your server.
6. In the **Connectivity method**, select **Private access (VNet Integration)**. Go to **Virtual Network** and select the already existing *virtual network* and *Subnet* created as part of prerequisites above.
7. Select **Review + create** to review your flexible server configuration.
8. Select **Create** to provision the server. Provisioning can take a few minutes.

>[!Note]
> After the flexible server is deployed to a virtual network and subnet, you cannot move it to Public access (allowed IP addresses).
