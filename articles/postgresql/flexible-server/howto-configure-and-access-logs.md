# Configure and Access Logs in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is in preview

PostgreSQL logs are available on every node of a flexible server. You can ship logs to a storage server, or to an analytics service. The logs can be used to identify, troubleshoot, and repair configuration errors and suboptimal performance.

## Configure diagnostic settings

You can enable diagnostic settings for your Postgres server using the Azure portal, CLI, REST API, and PowerShell. The log category to select is **PostgreSQLLogs**.

To enable resource logs using the Azure portal:

1. In the portal, go to *Diagnostic Settings* in the navigation menu of your Postgres server.
   
2. Select *Add Diagnostic Setting*.

3. Name this setting. 

4. Select your preferred endpoint (storage account, event hub, log analytics). 

5. Select the log type **PostgreSQLLogs**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-logging/diagnostic-create-setting.png" alt-text="Choose PostgreSQL logs":::

7. Save your setting.

To enable resource logs using PowerShell, CLI, or REST API, visit the [diagnostic settings](../../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) article.

### Access resource logs

The way you access the logs depends on which endpoint you choose. For Azure Storage, see the [logs storage account](../../azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs.md#send-to-azure-storage) article. For Event Hubs, see the [stream Azure logs](../../azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs.md#send-to-azure-event-hubs) article.

For Azure Monitor Logs, logs are sent to the workspace you selected. The Postgres logs use the **AzureDiagnostics** collection mode, so they can be queried from the AzureDiagnostics table. The fields in the table are described below. Learn more about querying and alerting in the [Azure Monitor Logs query](../../azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview.md) overview.

The following are queries you can try to get started. You can configure alerts based on queries.

Search for all Postgres logs for a particular server in the last day

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where LogicalServerName_s == "myservername"
| where Category == "PostgreSQLLogs"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d) 
```

Search for all non-localhost connection attempts

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where Message contains "connection received" and Message !contains "host=127.0.0.1"
| where Category == "PostgreSQLLogs" and TimeGenerated > ago(6h)
```

The query above will show results over the last 6 hours for any Postgres server logging in this workspace.
