# Logs in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is in preview

Azure Database for PostgreSQL allows you to configure and access Postgres' standard logs. The logs can be used to identify, troubleshoot, and repair configuration errors and suboptimal performance. Logging information you can configure and access includes errors, query information, autovacuum records, connections, and checkpoints. (Access to transaction logs is not available).

Audit logging is made available through a Postgres extension, `pgaudit`. To learn more, visit the [auditing concepts](concepts-audit.md) article.

## Configure logging

You can configure Postgres standard logging on your server using the logging server parameters. To learn more about Postgres log parameters, visit the [When To Log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHEN) and [What To Log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHAT) sections of the Postgres documentation. Most, but not all, Postgres logging parameters are available to configure in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

To learn how to configure parameters in Azure Database for PostgreSQL, see the [portal documentation](howto-configure-server-parameters-using-portal.md) or the [CLI documentation](howto-configure-server-parameters-using-cli.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring a high volume of logs, for example statement logging, can add significant performance overhead. 

## Accessing logs

Azure Database for PostgreSQL is integrated with Azure Monitor diagnostic settings. Diagnostic settings allows you to send your Postgres logs in JSON format to Azure Monitor Logs for analytics and alerting, Event Hubs for streaming, and Azure Storage for archiving. 

### Log format
