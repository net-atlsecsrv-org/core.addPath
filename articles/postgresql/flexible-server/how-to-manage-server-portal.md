## Scale compute and storage

After server creation you can scale between the various [pricing tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/postgresql/) as your needs change. You can also scale up or down your compute and memory by increasing or decreasing vCores.

> [!NOTE]
> Storage cannot be scaled down to lower value.

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. Select **Compute + Storage**, located in the **Settings** section.
2. You can change the **Compute Tier** , **vCore**, **Storage** to scale up the server using higher compute tier or scale up within the same tier by increasing storage or vCores to your desired value.
