# Limits in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is in preview

The following sections describe capacity and functional limits in the database service. If you'd like to learn about resource (compute, memory, storage) tiers, see the [compute and storage](concepts-compute-storage.md) article.

## Maximum connections

The maximum number of connections per pricing tier and vCores are shown below. The Azure system requires three connections to monitor the Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server.

| SKU Name             | vCores | Memory Size | Max Connections | Max User Connections |
|----------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Burstable**        |        |             |                 |                      |
| B1ms                 | 1      | 2 GiB       | 50              | 47                   |

| **General Purpose**  |        |             |                 |                      |

When connections exceed the limit, you may receive the following error:
> FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For best experience, we recommend that you use a connection pooler like PgBouncer to efficiently manage connections.

A PostgreSQL connection, even idle, can occupy about 10 MB of memory. Also, creating new connections takes time. Most applications request many short-lived connections, which compounds this situation. The result is fewer resources available for your actual workload leading to decreased performance. Connection pooling can be used to decrease idle connections and reuse existing connections.

## Functional limitations

### Scale operations

- Scaling the server storage requires a server restart.
- Server storage can only be scaled in 2x increments, see [Compute and Storage](concepts-compute-storage.md) for details.
- Decreasing server storage size is currently not supported.

### Server version upgrades

- Automated migration between major database engine versions is currently not supported. If you would like to upgrade to the next major version, take a [dump and restore](../howto-migrate-using-dump-and-restore.md) it to a server that was created with the new engine version.

### Networking

- Moving in and out of VNET is currently not supported.
- Combining public access with deployment within a VNET is currently not supported.
- Firewall rules are not supported on VNET, Network security groups can be used instead.
- Public access database servers can connect to public internet, for example through `postgres_fdw`, and this access cannot be restricted. VNET-based servers can have restricted outbound access using Network Security Groups.

### High availability (HA)

- Zone-Redundant HA is currently not supported for Burstable servers.
- The database server IP address changes when your server fails over to the HA standby. Ensure you use the DNS record instead of the server IP address.
- If logical replication is configured with a HA configured flexible server, in the event of a failover to the standby server, the logical replication slots are not copied over to the standby server. 
- For more details on zone-redundant HA including the limitations, please see the [concepts - HA documentation](concepts-high-availability.md) page.

### Availability zones

- Manually moving servers to a different availability zone is currently not supported.
- The availability zone of the HA standby server cannot be manually configured.

### Postgres engine, extensions, and PgBouncer

- Postgres 10 and older are not supported. We recommend using the [Single Server](../overview-single-server.md) option if you require older Postgres versions.
- Extension support is currently limited to the Postgres `contrib` extensions.
- Built-in PgBouncer connection pooler is currently not available for database servers within a VNET, or for Burstable servers.

### Stop/start operation

- Server can't be stopped for more than seven days.

### Scheduled maintenance

- Changing the maintenance window less than five days before an already planned upgrade, will not affect that upgrade. Changes only take effect with the next scheduled maintenance.

### Backing up a server

- Backups are managed by the system, there is currently no way to run these backups manually. We recommend using `pg_dump` instead.
- Backups are always snapshot-based full backups (not differential backups), possibly leading to higher backup storage utilization. Note that transaction logs (write ahead logs - WAL) are separate from the full/differential backups, and are archived continuously.

### Restoring a server

- When using the Point-in-time-Restore feature, the new server is created with the same compute and storage configurations as the server it is based on.
- VNET based database servers are restored into the same VNET when you restore from a backup.
- The new server created during a restore does not have the firewall rules that existed on the original server. Firewall rules need to be created separately for the new server.
- Restoring a deleted server is not supported.
- Cross region restore is not supported.

### Other features

* Azure AD authentication is not yet supported. We recommend using the [Single Server](../overview-single-server.md) option if you require Azure AD authentication.
* Read replicas are not yet supported. We recommend using the [Single Server](../overview-single-server.md) option if you require read replicas.
