# Scheduled maintenance in Azure Database for PostgreSQL â€“ Hyperscale (Citus)

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) does periodic maintenance to
keep your managed database secure, stable, and up-to-date.  During maintenance,
all nodes in the server group get new features, updates, and patches.

The key features of scheduled maintenance for Hyperscale (Citus) are:

* Updates are applied at the same time on all nodes in the server group
* Notifications about upcoming maintenance are posted to Azure Service Health
  five days in advance
* Usually there are at least 30 days between successful maintenance events for
  a server group

## Notification about upcoming maintenance

Notifications about upcoming scheduled maintenance are posted to Azure Service
Health and can be:

* Emailed to a specific address
* Emailed to an Azure Resource Manager Role
* Sent in a text message (SMS) to mobile devices
* Pushed as a notification to an Azure app
* Delivered as a voice message

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Normally there are at least 30 days between successful scheduled maintenance
> events for a server group.
>
> However, in case of a critical emergency update such as a severe
> vulnerability, the notification window could be shorter than five days. The
> critical update may be applied to your server even if a successful scheduled
> maintenance was performed in the last 30 days.

If maintenance fails or gets canceled, the system will create a notification.
It will try maintenance again according to current scheduling settings, and
notify you five days before the next maintenance event.
