# PostgreSQL extensions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Hyperscale (Citus)

PostgreSQL provides the ability to extend the functionality of your database by using extensions. Extensions allow for bundling multiple related SQL objects together in a single package that can be loaded or removed from your database with a single command. After being loaded in the database, extensions can function like built-in features. For more information on PostgreSQL extensions, see [Package related objects into an extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/extend-extensions.html).

## Use PostgreSQL extensions

PostgreSQL extensions must be installed in your database before you can use them. To install a particular extension, run the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-createextension.html) command from the psql tool to load the packaged objects into your database.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) Preview currently supports a subset of key extensions as listed here. Extensions other than the ones listed aren't supported. You can't create your own extension with Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## pg_stat_statements
The [pg\_stat\_statements extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) is preloaded on every Azure Database for PostgreSQL server to provide you with a means of tracking execution statistics of SQL statements.

The setting `pg_stat_statements.track` controls what statements are counted by the extension. It defaults to `top`, which means that all statements issued directly by clients are tracked. The two other tracking levels are `none` and `all`. This setting is configurable as a server parameter through the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/howto-configure-server-parameters-using-portal) or the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/howto-configure-server-parameters-using-cli).

There's a tradeoff between the query execution information pg_stat_statements provides and the effect on server performance as it logs each SQL statement. If you aren't actively using the pg_stat_statements extension, we recommend that you set `pg_stat_statements.track` to `none`. Some third-party monitoring services might rely on pg_stat_statements to deliver query performance insights, so confirm whether this is the case for you or not.

## dblink and postgres_fdw
You can use dblink and postgres_fdw to connect from one PostgreSQL server to another, or to another database in the same server. The receiving server needs to allow connections from the sending server through its firewall. To use these extensions to connect between Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers, set **Allow access to Azure services** to ON. You also need to turn this setting ON if you want to use the extensions to loop back to the same server. The **Allow access to Azure services** setting can be found in the Azure portal page for the Postgres server under **Connection Security**. Turning **Allow access to Azure services** ON whitelists all Azure IPs.

Currently, outbound connections from Azure Database for PostgreSQL aren't supported, except for connections to other Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers.
