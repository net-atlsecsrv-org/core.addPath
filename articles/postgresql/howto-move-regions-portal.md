# Move an Azure Database for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server to another region by using the Azure portal

There are various scenarios for moving an existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server from one region to another. For example, you might want to move a production server to another region as part of your disaster recovery planning.

You can use an Azure Database for PostgreSQL [cross-region read replica](concepts-read-replicas.md#cross-region-replication) to complete the move to another region. To do so, first create a read replica in the target region. Next, stop replication to the read replica server to make it a standalone server that accepts both read and write traffic. 

> [!NOTE]
> This article focuses on moving your server to a different region. If you want to move your server to a different resource group or subscription, refer to the [move](../azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription.md) article. 

## Prerequisites

- The cross-region read replica feature is only available for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server in the General Purpose or Memory Optimized pricing tiers. Ensure the source server is in one of these pricing tiers.

- Make sure that your Azure Database for PostgreSQL source server is in the Azure region that you want to move from.

## Prepare to move

To prepare the source server for replication using the Azure portal, use the following steps: 

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select the existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server that you want to use as the source server. This action opens the **Overview** page.
1. From the server's menu, select **Replication**. If Azure replication support is set to at least **Replica**, you can create read replicas. 
1. If Azure replication support is not set to at least **Replica**, set it. Select **Save**.
1. Restart the server to apply the change by selecting **Yes**.
1. You will receive two Azure portal notifications once the operation is complete. There is one notification for updating the server parameter. There is another notification for the server restart that follows immediately.
1. Refresh the Azure portal page to update the Replication toolbar. You can now create read replicas for this server.

To create a cross-region read replica server in the target region using the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. Select the existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server that you want to use as the source server.
1. Select **Replication** from the menu, under **SETTINGS**.
1. Select **Add Replica**.
1. Enter a name for the replica server.
1. Select the location for the replica server. The default location is the same as the primary server's. Verify that you've selected the target location where you want the replica to be deployed.
1. Select **OK** to confirm creation of the replica. During replica creation, data is copied from the source server to the replica. Create time may last several minutes or more, in proportion to the size of the source server.

>[!NOTE]
> When you create a replica, it doesn't inherit the firewall rules and VNet service endpoints of the primary server. These rules must be set up independently for the replica.

## Move

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The standalone server can't be made into a replica again.
> Before you stop replication on a read replica, ensure the replica has all the data that you require.

To stop replication to the replica from the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. Once the replica has been created, locate and select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL source server. 
1. Select **Replication** from the menu, under **SETTINGS**.
1. Select the replica server.
1. Select **Stop replication**.
1. Confirm you want to stop replication by clicking **OK**.

## Clean up source server

You may want to delete the source Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Once the replica has been created, locate and select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL source server.
1. In the **Overview** window, select **Delete**.
1. Type in the name of the source server to confirm you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you moved an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server from one region to another by using the Azure portal and then cleaned up the unneeded source resources.
