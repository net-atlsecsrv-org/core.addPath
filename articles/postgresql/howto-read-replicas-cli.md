# Create and manage read replicas from the Azure CLI, REST API

In this article, you learn how to create and manage read replicas in Azure Database for PostgreSQL by using the Azure CLI and REST API. To learn more about read replicas, see the [overview](concepts-read-replicas.md).

## Azure CLI
You can create and manage read replicas using the Azure CLI.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- An [Azure Database for PostgreSQL server](quickstart-create-server-up-azure-cli.md) to be the master server.


### Prepare the master server
These steps must be used to prepare a master server in the General Purpose or Memory Optimized tiers.

The `azure.replication_support` parameter must be set to **REPLICA** on the master server. When this static parameter is changed, a server restart is required for the change to take effect.

1. Set `azure.replication_support` to REPLICA.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az postgres server configuration set --resource-group myresourcegroup --server-name mydemoserver --name azure.replication_support --value REPLICA
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get the error "Invalid value given" while trying to set azure.replication_support from the Azure CLI, it is likely your server already has REPLICA set by default. A bug is preventing this setting from being correctly reflected on newer servers where REPLICA is the internal default. <br><br>
> You can skip the prepare master steps and go to create the replica. <br><br>
> If you would like to confirm your server is in this category, visit the server's replication page in the Azure portal. "Disable replication" will be grayed out and "Add Replica" will be active in the toolbar.

2. Restart the server to apply the change.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az postgres server restart --name mydemoserver --resource-group myresourcegroup
   ```

### Create a read replica

The [az postgres server replica create](/cli/azure/postgres/server/replica?view=azure-cli-latest#az-postgres-server-replica-create) command requires the following parameters:

| Setting | Example value | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resource-group | myresourcegroup |  The resource group where the replica server will be created.  |
| name | mydemoserver-replica | The name of the new replica server that is created. |
| source-server | mydemoserver | The name or resource ID of the existing master server to replicate from. |

In the CLI example below, the replica is created in the same region as the master.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres server replica create --name mydemoserver-replica --source-server mydemoserver --resource-group myresourcegroup
```

To create a cross region read replica, use the `--location` parameter. The CLI example below creates the replica in West US.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres server replica create --name mydemoserver-replica --source-server mydemoserver --resource-group myresourcegroup --location westus
```

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about which regions you can create a replica in, visit the [read replica concepts article](concepts-read-replicas.md). 

If you haven't set the `azure.replication_support` parameter to **REPLICA** on a General Purpose or Memory Optimized master server and restarted the server, you receive an error. Complete those two steps before you create a replica.

A replica is created by using the same compute and storage settings as the master. After a replica is created, several settings can be changed independently from the master server: compute generation, vCores, storage, and back-up retention period. The pricing tier can also be changed independently, except to or from the Basic tier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before a master server setting is updated to a new value, update the replica setting to an equal or greater value. This action helps the replica keep up with any changes made to the master.

### List replicas
You can view the list of replicas of a master server by using [az postgres server replica list](/cli/azure/postgres/server/replica?view=azure-cli-latest#az-postgres-server-replica-list) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres server replica list --server-name mydemoserver --resource-group myresourcegroup 
```

### Stop replication to a replica server
You can stop replication between a master server and a read replica by using [az postgres server replica stop](/cli/azure/postgres/server/replica?view=azure-cli-latest#az-postgres-server-replica-stop) command.

After you stop replication to a master server and a read replica, it can't be undone. The read replica becomes a standalone server that supports both reads and writes. The standalone server can't be made into a replica again.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres server replica stop --name mydemoserver-replica --resource-group myresourcegroup 
```

### Delete a master or replica server
To delete a master or replica server, you use the [az postgres server delete](/cli/azure/postgres/server?view=azure-cli-latest#az-postgres-server-delete) command.

When you delete a master server, replication to all read replicas is stopped. The read replicas become standalone servers that now support both reads and writes.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres server delete --name myserver --resource-group myresourcegroup
```

## REST API
You can create and manage read replicas using the [Azure REST API](/rest/api/azure/).

### Prepare the master server
These steps must be used to prepare a master server in the General Purpose or Memory Optimized tiers.

The `azure.replication_support` parameter must be set to **REPLICA** on the master server. When this static parameter is changed, a server restart is required for the change to take effect.

1. Set `azure.replication_support` to REPLICA.

   ```http
   PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{masterServerName}/configurations/azure.replication_support?api-version=2017-12-01
   ```

   ```JSON
   {
    "properties": {
    "value": "replica"
    }
   }
   ```

2. [Restart the server](/rest/api/postgresql/servers/restart) to apply the change.

   ```http
   POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{masterServerName}/restart?api-version=2017-12-01
   ```

### Create a read replica
You can create a read replica by using the [create API](/rest/api/postgresql/servers/create):

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{replicaName}?api-version=2017-12-01
```

```json
{
  "location": "southeastasia",
  "properties": {
    "createMode": "Replica",
    "sourceServerId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{masterServerName}"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about which regions you can create a replica in, visit the [read replica concepts article](concepts-read-replicas.md). 

If you haven't set the `azure.replication_support` parameter to **REPLICA** on a General Purpose or Memory Optimized master server and restarted the server, you receive an error. Complete those two steps before you create a replica.

A replica is created by using the same compute and storage settings as the master. After a replica is created, several settings can be changed independently from the master server: compute generation, vCores, storage, and back-up retention period. The pricing tier can also be changed independently, except to or from the Basic tier.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before a master server setting is updated to a new value, update the replica setting to an equal or greater value. This action helps the replica keep up with any changes made to the master.

### List replicas
You can view the list of replicas of a master server using the [replica list API](/rest/api/postgresql/replicas/listbyserver):

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{masterServerName}/Replicas?api-version=2017-12-01
```

### Stop replication to a replica server
You can stop replication between a master server and a read replica by using the [update API](/rest/api/postgresql/servers/update).

After you stop replication to a master server and a read replica, it can't be undone. The read replica becomes a standalone server that supports both reads and writes. The standalone server can't be made into a replica again.

```http
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{masterServerName}?api-version=2017-12-01
```

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "replicationRole":"None"  
   }
}
```

### Delete a master or replica server
To delete a master or replica server, you use the [delete API](/rest/api/postgresql/servers/delete):

When you delete a master server, replication to all read replicas is stopped. The read replicas become standalone servers that now support both reads and writes.

```http
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/{serverName}?api-version=2017-12-01
```
