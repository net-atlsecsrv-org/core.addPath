# Monitor and scale a single PostgreSQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script scales a single Azure Database for PostgreSQL server to a different performance level after querying the metrics. 

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to run the CLI locally, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Check the version by running `az --version`. See [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to install or upgrade your version of Azure CLI.

## Sample script
In this sample script, edit the highlighted lines to update the admin username and password to your own. Replace the SubscriptionID used in the `az monitor` commands with your own subscription ID.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/postgresql/scale-postgresql-server/scale-postgresql-server.sh?highlight=15-16 "Create and scale Azure Database for PostgreSQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it after the script has been run. 
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/postgresql/scale-postgresql-server/delete-postgresql.sh "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the commands outlined in the following table:

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az postgres server create](/cli/azure/postgres/server) | Creates a PostgreSQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics) | List the metric value for the resources. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
