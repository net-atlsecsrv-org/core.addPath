# Manage an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server using the Azure portal

This article shows you how to manage your Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers. Management tasks include compute and storage scaling, admin password reset, and viewing server details.

## Sign in

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a server

Visit the [quickstart](quickstart-create-server-database-portal.md) to learn how to create and get started with an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

## Scale compute and storage

After server creation you can scale between the General Purpose and Memory Optimized tiers as your needs change. You can also scale compute and memory by increasing or decreasing vCores. Storage can be scaled up (however, you cannot scale storage down).

### Scale between General Purpose and Memory Optimized tiers

You can scale from General Purpose to Memory Optimized and vice-versa. Changing to and from the Basic tier after server creation is not supported.

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. Select **Pricing tier**, located in the **Settings** section.

2. Select **General Purpose** or **Memory Optimized**, depending on what you are scaling to.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Changing tiers causes a server restart.

3. Select **OK** to save changes.

### Scale vCores up or down

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. Select **Pricing tier**, located in the **Settings** section.

2. Change the **vCore** setting by moving the slider to your desired value.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Scaling vCores causes a server restart.

3. Select **OK** to save changes.

### Scale storage up

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. Select **Pricing tier**, located in the **Settings** section.

2. Change the **Storage** setting by moving the slider up to your desired value.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Storage cannot be scaled down.

3. Select **OK** to save changes.

## Update admin password

You can change the administrator role's password using the Azure portal.

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. In the **Overview** window select **Reset password**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-create-manage-server-portal/overview-reset-password.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal to reset the password in Azure Database for PostgreSQL":::

2. Enter a new password and confirm the password. The textbox will prompt you about password complexity requirements.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-create-manage-server-portal/reset-password.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal to reset your password and save in Azure Database for PostgreSQL":::

3. Select **OK** to save the new password.

## Delete a server

You can delete your server if you no longer need it. 

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. In the **Overview** window select **Delete**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-create-manage-server-portal/overview-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal to Delete the server in Azure Database for PostgreSQL":::

2. Type the name of the server into the input box to confirm that this is the server you want to delete.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-create-manage-server-portal/confirm-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal to confirm the server delete in Azure Database for PostgreSQL":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Deleting a server is irreversible.

3. Select **Delete**.
