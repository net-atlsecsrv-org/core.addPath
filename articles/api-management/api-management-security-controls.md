# Security controls for API Management

This article documents the security controls built into API Management.

[!INCLUDE [Security controls Header](../../includes/security-controls-header.md)]

## Network

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes | Documentation |
|---|---|--|--|
| Service endpoint support| No | |  |
| VNet injection support| Yes | |  |
| Network isolation and firewalling support| Yes | Using networking security groups (NSG) and Azure Application Gateway (or other software appliance) respectively. |  |
| Forced tunneling support| Yes | Azure networking provides forced tunneling. |  |

## Monitoring & logging

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes| Documentation |
|---|---|--|--|
| Azure monitoring support (Log analytics, App insights, etc.)| Yes | | |
| Control and management plane logging and audit| Yes | [Azure Monitor activity logs](../azure-monitor/platform/activity-logs-overview.md) | |
| Data plane logging and audit| Yes | [Azure Monitor diagnostic logs](../azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-overview.md) and (optionally) [Azure Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md).  | |


## Identity

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes| Documentation |
|---|---|--|--|
| Authentication| Yes | |  |
| Authorization| Yes | |  |

## Data protection

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes | Documentation |
|---|---|--|--|
| Server-side encryption at rest: Microsoft-managed keys | Yes | Sensitive data such as certificates, keys, and secret-named values are encrypted with service-managed, per service instance keys. |  |
| Server-side encryption at rest: customer-managed keys (BYOK) | No | All encryption keys are per service instance and are service managed. |  |
| Column level encryption (Azure Data Services)| N/A | |  |
| Encryption in transit (such as ExpressRoute encryption, in VNet encryption, and VNet-VNet encryption)| Yes | [Express Route](../expressroute/index.yml) and VNet encryption is provided by [Azure networking](../virtual-network/index.yml). |  |
| API calls encrypted| Yes | Management plane calls are made through [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/index.yml) over TLS. A valid JSON web token (JWT) is required.  Data plane calls can be secured with TLS and one of supported authentication mechanisms (for example, client certificate or JWT). |   |
 |

## Configuration management

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes| Documentation |
|---|---|--|--|
| Configuration management support (versioning of configuration, etc.)| Yes | Using the [Azure API Management DevOps Resource Kit](https://aka.ms/apimdevops) |  |

## Vulnerability scans false positives

This section documents common vulnerabilities that do not affect Azure API Management.

| Vulnerability               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ticketbleed (CVE-2016-9244) | Ticketbleed is vulnerability in the implementation of the TLS SessionTicket extension found in some F5 products. It allows the leakage ("bleeding") of up to 31 bytes of data from uninitialized memory. This is caused by the TLS stack padding a Session ID, passed from the client, with data to make it 32 bits long. |
