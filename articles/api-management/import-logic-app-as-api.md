# Import a Logic App as an API

This article shows how to import a Logic App as an API and test the imported API.

In this article, you learn how to:

> -   Import a Logic App as an API
> -   Test the API in the Azure portal
> -   Test the API in the Developer portal

## Prerequisites

-   Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md)
-   Make sure there is a Logic App in your subscription that exposes an HTTP endpoint. For more information, [Trigger workflows with HTTP endpoints](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md)

[!INCLUDE [api-management-navigate-to-instance.md](../../includes/api-management-navigate-to-instance.md)]

## <a name="create-api"> </a>Import and publish a back-end API

1. Select **APIs** from under **API MANAGEMENT**.
2. Select **Logic App** from the **Add a new API** list.

3. Press **Browse** to see the list of Logic Apps with HTTP trigger in your subscription. (Note that Logic Apps without HTTP trigger will not appear in the list.)
4. Select the app. API Management finds the swagger associated with the selected app, fetches it, and imports it.
5. Add an API URL suffix. The suffix is a name that identifies this specific API in this API Management instance. It has to be unique in this API Management instance.
6. Publish the API by associating the API with a product. In this case, the "_Unlimited_" product is used. If you want for the API to be published and be available to developers, add it to a product. You can do it during API creation or set it later.

    Products are associations of one or more APIs. You can include a number of APIs and offer them to developers through the developer portal. Developers must first subscribe to a product to get access to the API. When they subscribe, they get a subscription key that is good for any API in that product. If you created the API Management instance, you are an administrator already, so you are subscribed to every product by default.

    By default, each API Management instance comes with two sample products:

    - **Starter**
    - **Unlimited**

7. Select **Create**.

## Test the API in the Azure portal

Operations can be called directly from the Azure portal, which provides a convenient way to view and test the operations of an API.

1. Select the API you created in the previous step.
2. Press the **Test** tab.
3. Select some operation.

    The page displays fields for query parameters and fields for the headers. One of the headers is "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", for the subscription key of the product that is associated with this API. If you created the API Management instance, you are an administrator already, so the key is filled in automatically.

4. Press **Send**.

    Backend responds with **200 OK** and some data.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-navigate-to-instance.md](../../includes/api-management-append-apis.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>Every Logic App has **manual-invoke** operation. If you want to comprise your API of multiple logic apps, in order not to have collision, you need to rename the function.
