# API Management policies
This section provides a reference for the following API Management policies. For information on adding and configuring policies, see [Policies in API Management](api-management-howto-policies.md).

 Policies are a powerful capability of the system that allow the publisher to change the behavior of the API through configuration. Policies are a collection of Statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API. Popular Statements include format conversion from XML to JSON and call rate limiting to restrict the amount of incoming calls from a developer. Many more policies are available out of the box.

 Policy expressions can be used as attribute values or text values in any of the API Management policies, unless the policy specifies otherwise. Some policies such as the [Control flow](api-management-advanced-policies.md#choose) and [Set variable](api-management-advanced-policies.md#set-variable) policies are based on policy expressions. For more information, see [Advanced policies](api-management-advanced-policies.md#AdvancedPolicies) and [Policy expressions](api-management-policy-expressions.md).
