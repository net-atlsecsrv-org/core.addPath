# Get API analytics in Azure API Management

Azure API Management provides built-in analytics for your APIs. Analyze the usage and performance of the APIs in your API Management instance across several dimensions, including:

* Time
* Geography
* APIs
* API operations
* Products
* Subscriptions
* Users
* Requests

Use analytics for high-level monitoring and troubleshooting of your APIs. For additional monitoring features, including near real-time metrics and resource logs for diagnostics and auditing, see [Tutorial: Monitor published APIs](api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor.md).

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Monitoring**, select **Analytics**.

1. Select a time range for data, or enter a custom time range.
1. Select a report category for analytics data, such as **Timeline**, **Geography**, and so on.
1. Optionally, filter the report by one or more additional categories.

## Analytics - REST API

Use [Reports](/rest/api/apimanagement/2019-12-01/reports) operations in the API Management REST API to retrieve and filter analytics data for your API Management instance.

Available operations return report records by API, geography, API operations, product, request, subscription, time, or user.
