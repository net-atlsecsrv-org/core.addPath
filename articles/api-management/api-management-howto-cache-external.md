# Use an external Azure Cache for Redis in Azure API Management

In addition to utilizing the built-in cache, Azure API Management also allows for caching responses in an external Azure Cache for Redis.

Using an external cache allows to overcome a few limitations of the built-in cache. It is especially beneficial if you would like to:

* Avoid having your cache periodically cleared during API Management updates
* Have more control over your cache configuration
* Cache more data than your API Management tier allows to
* Use caching with the Consumption tier of API Management

For more detailed information about caching, see [API Management caching policies](api-management-caching-policies.md) and  [Custom caching in Azure API Management](api-management-sample-cache-by-key.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

+ [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md)
+ Understand [caching in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-cache.md)

## <a name="create-cache"> </a> Create Azure Cache for Redis

This section explains how to create an Azure Cache for Redis in Azure. If you already have an Azure Cache for Redis, within or outside of Azure, you can <a href="#add-external-cache">skip</a> to the next section.

## <a name="add-external-cache"> </a>Add an external cache

Follow the steps below to add an external Azure Cache for Redis in Azure API Management.

![Bring your own cache to APIM](media/api-management-howto-cache-external/add-external-cache.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The **Use from** setting specifies which API Management regional deployment will communicate with the configured cache in case of a multi-regional configuration of API Management. The caches specified as **Default** will be overridden by caches with a regional value.
>
> For example, if API Management is hosted in the East US, Southeast Asia and West Europe regions and there are two caches configured, one for **Default** and one for **Southeast Asia**, API Management in **Southeast Asia** will use its own cache, while the other two regions will use the **Default** cache entry.

### Add an Azure Cache for Redis from the same subscription

1. Browse to your API Management instance in the Azure portal.
2. Select the **External cache** tab from the menu on the left.
3. Click the **+ Add** button.
4. Select your cache in the **Cache instance** dropdown field.
5. Select **Default** or specify the desired region in the **Use from** dropdown field.
6. Click **Save**.

### Add an Azure Cache for Redis hosted outside of the current Azure subscription or Azure in general

1. Browse to your API Management instance in the Azure portal.
2. Select the **External cache** tab from the menu on the left.
3. Click the **+ Add** button.
4. Select **Custom** in the **Cache instance** dropdown field.
5. Select **Default** or specify the desired region in the **Use from** dropdown field.
6. Provide your Azure Cache for Redis connection string in the **Connection string** field.
7. Click **Save**.

## Use the external cache

Once the external cache is configured in Azure API Management, it can be used through caching policies. See [Add caching to improve performance in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-cache.md) for detailed steps.
