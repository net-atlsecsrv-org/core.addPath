# Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Azure API Management

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions for Azure API Management. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see
[Azure Policy built-in definitions](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md). For API
Management policy samples, see [API Management - Policy index](./policies/index.md).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
