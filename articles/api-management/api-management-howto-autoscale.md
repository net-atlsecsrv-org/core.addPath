# Automatically scale an Azure API Management instance  

Azure API Management service instance can scale automatically based on a set of rules. This behavior can be enabled and configured through Azure Monitor and is supported only in **Standard** and **Premium** tiers of the Azure API Management service.

The article walks through the process of configuring autoscale and suggests optimal configuration of autoscale rules.

> [!NOTE]
> API Management service in the **Consumption** tier scales automatically based on the traffic - without any additional configuration needed.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps from this article, you must:

+ Have an active Azure subscription.
+ Have an Azure API Management instance. For more information, see [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
+ Understand the concept of [Capacity of an Azure API Management instance](api-management-capacity.md).
+ Understand [manual scaling process of an Azure API Management instance](upgrade-and-scale.md), including cost consequences.

[!INCLUDE [premium-standard.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-standard.md)]

## Azure API Management autoscale limitations

Certain limitations and consequences of scaling decisions need to be considered before configuring autoscale behavior.

+ Autoscale can be enabled only for **Standard** and **Premium** tiers of Azure API Management service.
+ Pricing tiers also specify the maximum number of units for a service instance.
+ Scaling process will take at least 20 minutes.
+ If the service is locked by another operation, scaling request will fail and retry automatically.
+ In case of a service with multi-regional deployments, only units in the **Primary location** can be scaled. Units in other locations can't be scaled.

## Enable and configure autoscale for Azure API Management service

Follow the steps below to configure autoscale for an Azure API Management service:

1. Navigate to **Monitor** instance in the Azure portal.

2. Select **Autoscale** from the menu on the left.

3. Locate your Azure API Management service based on the filters in dropdown menus.
4. Select the desired Azure API Management service instance.
5. In the newly opened section, click the **Enable autoscale** button.

6. In the **Rules** section, click **+ Add a rule**.

7. Define a new scale out rule.

   For example, a scale out rule could trigger an addition of an Azure API Management unit, when the average capacity metric over the last 30 minutes exceeds 80%. The table below provides configuration for such a rule.

8. Click **Add** to save the rule.

9. Click again on **+ Add a rule**.

    This time, a scale in rule needs to be defined. It will ensure resources are not being wasted, when the usage of APIs decreases.

10. Define a new scale in rule.

    For example, a scale in rule could trigger a removal of an Azure API Management unit, when the average capacity metric over the last 30 minutes has been lower than 35%. The table below provides configuration for such a rule.
