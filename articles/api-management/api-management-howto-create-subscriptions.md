# Create subscriptions in Azure API Management

When you publish APIs through Azure API Management, it's easy and common to secure access to those APIs by using subscription keys. Client applications that need to consume the published APIs must include a valid subscription key in HTTP requests when they make calls to those APIs. To get a subscription key for accessing APIs, a subscription is required. For more information about subscriptions, see [Subscriptions in Azure API Management](api-management-subscriptions.md).

This article walks through the steps for creating subscriptions in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To take the steps in this article, the prerequisites are as follows:

+ [Create an API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
+ Understand [subscriptions in API Management](api-management-subscriptions.md).

## Create a new subscription

1. Select **Subscriptions** in the menu on the left.
2. Select **Add subscription**.
3. Provide a name of the subscription and select the scope.
4. Optionally, choose if the subscription should be associated with a user.
5. Select **Save**.

After you create the subscription, two API keys are provided to access the APIs. One key is primary, and one is secondary.
