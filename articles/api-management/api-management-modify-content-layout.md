# Modify the content and layout of pages on the developer portal in Azure API Management
There are three fundamental ways to customize the developer portal in Azure API Management:

* [Edit the contents of static pages and page layout elements][modify-content-layout] (explained in this guide)
* [Update the styles used for page elements across the developer portal][customize-styles]
* [Modify the templates used for pages generated by the portal][portal-templates] (for example, API docs, products, user authentication, etc.)

[!INCLUDE [premium-dev-standard-basic.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic.md)]

## <a name="page-structure"> </a>Structure of developer portal pages

The developer portal is based on a content management system. The layout of every page is built based on set of small page elements known as widgets:

![Developer portal page structure][api-management-customization-widget-structure]

All widgets are editable.
* The core contents specific to each individual page reside in the "Contents" widget. Editing a page means editing the contents of this widget.
* All page layout elements are contained with the remaining widgets. Changes made to these widgets are applied to all pages. They are referred to as "layout widgets."

In day-to-day page editing one would often modify just the Content widget, which will have different content for each individual page.

## <a name="modify-layout-widget"> </a>Modifying the contents of a layout widget

The Developer portal is accessible from the Azure Portal.

1. Click **Developer Portal** from the toolbar of your API Management instance.
2. To edit the contents of widgets, click the icon comprised of two paint brushes from the **Developer** portal menu on the left.
3. To modify the contents of the header, scroll to the **Header** section in the list on the left.

    The widgets are editable from within the fields.
4. Once you are ready to publish your changes, click **Publish** at the bottom of the page.

Now you should be able to see the new header on every page within the developer portal.
