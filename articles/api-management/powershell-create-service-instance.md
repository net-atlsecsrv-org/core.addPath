# Quickstart: Create a new Azure API Management service instance by using PowerShell

Azure API Management (APIM) helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. API Management provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. APIM  enables you to create and manage modern API gateways for existing backend services hosted anywhere. For more information, see the [Overview](api-management-key-concepts.md).

This quickstart describes the steps for creating a new API Management instance by using Azure PowerShell cmdlets.

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 1.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps). If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Create resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following command creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the West US location:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location WestUS
```

## Create an API Management service

Now that you have a resource group, you can create an API Management service instance. Create one by using [New-AzApiManagement](/powershell/module/az.apimanagement/new-azapimanagement) and provide a service name and publisher details. The service name must be unique within Azure.

In the following example, *myapim* is used for the service name. Update the name to a unique value. Also update the organization name of the API publisher and the admin email address to receive notifications.

By default, the command creates the instance in the Developer tier, an economical option to evaluate Azure API Management. This tier isn't for production use. For more information about scaling the API Management tiers, see [upgrade and scale](upgrade-and-scale.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a long-running operation. It can take between 30 and 40 minutes to create and activate an API Management service in this tier.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzApiManagement -Name "myapim" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "West US" -Organization "Contoso" -AdminEmail "admin@contoso.com" 
```

When the command returns, run [Get-AzApiManagement](/powershell/module/az.apimanagement/get-azapimanagement) to view the properties of the Azure API Management service. After activation, the provisioning status is Succeeded and the service instance has several associated URLs. For example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzApiManagement -Name "myapim" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" 
```

Example output:

```console

```

After your API Management service instance is deployed, you're ready to use it. Start with the tutorial to [import and publish your first API](import-and-publish.md).

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) command to remove the resource group and all related resources.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```
