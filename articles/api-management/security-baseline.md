# Azure security baseline for API Management

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to API Management. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to API Management. **Controls** not applicable to API Management have been excluded.

 
To see how API Management completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full API Management security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure API Management can be deployed inside an Azure Virtual Network (Vnet), so it can access backend services within the network. The developer portal and API Management gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet (External) or only within the Vnet (Internal).

- External: the API Management gateway and developer portal are accessible from the public internet via an external load balancer. The gateway can access resources within the virtual network.

- Internal: the API Management gateway and developer portal are accessible only from within the virtual network via an internal load balancer. The gateway can access resources within the virtual network.

Inbound and outbound traffic into the subnet in which API Management is deployed can be controlled using Network Security Group.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Inbound and outbound traffic into the subnet in which API Management is deployed can be controlled using Network Security groups (NSGs). Deploy an NSG to your API Management subnet and enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

Caution: When configuring an NSG on the API Management subnet, there are a set of ports that are required to be open. If any of these ports are unavailable, API Management may not operate properly and may become inaccessible.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: To protect critical Web/HTTP APIs configure API Management within a Virtual Network (Vnet) in internal mode and configure an Azure Application Gateway. Application Gateway is a PaaS service. It acts as a reverse-proxy and provides L7 load balancing, routing, web application firewall (WAF), and other services.

Combining API Management provisioned in an internal Vnet with the Application Gateway frontend enables the following scenarios:
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing all APIs to both internal consumers and external consumers.
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing a subset of APIs to external consumers.
- Provide a way of switching access to API Management from the public Internet on and off.

Note: This feature is available in the Premium and Developer tiers of API Management.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Configure API Management within a Virtual Network (Vnet) in internal mode and configure an Azure Application Gateway. Application Gateway is a PaaS service. It acts as a reverse-proxy and provides L7 load balancing, routing, web application firewall (WAF), and other services.

Combining API Management provisioned in an internal Vnet with the Application Gateway frontend enables the following scenarios:
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing all APIs to both internal consumers and external consumers.
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing a subset of APIs to external consumers.
- Provide a way of switching access to API Management from the public Internet on and off.

Note: This feature is available in the Premium and Developer tiers of API Management.

Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses.

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Inbound and outbound traffic into the subnet in which API Management is deployed can be controlled using Network Security Groups (NSG). Deploy an NSG to your API Management subnet and enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

Caution: When configuring an NSG on the API Management subnet, there are a set of ports that are required to be open. If any of these ports are unavailable, API Management may not operate properly and may become inaccessible.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Configure API Management within a Virtual Network (Vnet) in internal mode and configure an Azure Application Gateway. Application Gateway is a PaaS service. It acts as a reverse-proxy and provides L7 load balancing, routing, web application firewall (WAF), and other services. Application Gateway WAF provides protection from common security exploits and vulnerabilities and can run in the following two modes:
- Detection mode: Monitors and logs all threat alerts. You can turn on logging diagnostics for Application Gateway in the Diagnostics section. You must make sure that the WAF log is selected and turned on. Web application firewall doesn't block incoming requests when it's operating in Detection mode.
- Prevention mode: Blocks intrusions and attacks that the rules detect. The attacker receives a "403 unauthorized access" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.

Combining API Management provisioned in an internal Vnet with the Application Gateway frontend enables the following scenarios:
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing all APIs to both internal consumers and external consumers.
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing a subset of APIs to external consumers.
- Provide a way of switching access to API Management from the public Internet on and off.

Note: This feature is available in the Premium and Developer tiers of API Management.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

**Guidance**: To manage traffic flowing to Web/HTTP APIs deploy API Management to a Virtual Network (Vnet) associated with App Service Environment in external or internal mode.

In internal mode, configure an Azure Application Gateway in front of API Management. Application Gateway is a PaaS service. It acts as a reverse-proxy and provides L7 load balancing, routing, web application firewall (WAF), and other services. Application Gateway WAF provides protection from common security exploits and vulnerabilities.

Combining API Management provisioned in an internal Vnet with the Application Gateway frontend enables the following scenarios:
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing all APIs to both internal consumers and external consumers.
- Use a single API Management resource for exposing a subset of APIs to external consumers.
- Provide a way of switching access to API Management from the public Internet on and off.

Note: This feature is available in the Premium and Developer tiers of API Management.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network (Vnet) Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups (NSGs) used on your API Management subnets. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

Caution: When configuring an NSG on the API Management subnet, there are a set of ports that are required to be open. If any of these ports are unavailable, API Management may not operate properly and may become inaccessible.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure API Management deployments. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ApiManagement" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce network configuration of your Azure API Management deployments and related resources.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Within the Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspace(s) to query and perform analytics, send logs to Azure Storage for long-term/archival storage or offline analysis, or export logs to other analytics solution on Azure and elsewhere using Azure Event Hubs. Azure API Management outputs logs and metrics to Azure Monitor by default. Verbosity of the logging can be configured on a service-wide and per-API basis.

In addition to Azure Monitor, Azure API Management can be integrated with one or several Azure Application Insights services. Logging settings for Application Insights can be configured on either per-service or per-API basis.

Optionally, enable, and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send activity logs to a Log Analytics workspace for reporting and analysis, to Azure Storage for long-term safekeeping, to Azure Event Hubs for export in other analytics solutions on Azure and elsewhere. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure API Management service.

For data plane audit logging, diagnostic logs provide rich information about operations and errors that are important for auditing as well as troubleshooting purposes. Diagnostics logs differ from activity logs. Activity logs provide insights into the operations that were performed on your Azure resources. Diagnostics logs provide insight into operations that your resource performed.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.6: Monitor and review logs

**Guidance**: Azure API Management continuously emits logs and metrics to Azure Monitor, giving you a near real-time visibility into the state and health of your APIs. With Azure Monitor and Log Analytics workspace(s), you can review, query, visualize, route, archive, configure alerts, and take actions on metrics and logs coming from API Management and related resources. Analyze and monitor logs for anomalous behaviors and regularly review results.

Optionally, integrate API Management with Azure Application Insights and use it as primary or secondary monitoring, tracing, reporting, and alerting tool.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.7: Enable alerts for anomalous activities

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings as well as the diagnostic settings for your Azure API Management instances and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace. Perform queries in Log Analytics to search terms, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide many other insights based on the collected data. You can create alerts based on your Log Analytics workspace queries.

Create metric alerts to let you know when something unexpected is happening. For example, get notifications when your Azure API Management instance has been exceeding its expected peak capacity over a certain period of time or if there has been a certain number of unauthorized gateway requests or errors over a predefined period of time.

Optionally, integrate API Management with Azure Application Insights and use it as primary or secondary monitoring, tracing, reporting, and alerting tool.

Optionally, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of accounts that have administrative access to the Azure API Management control plane (Azure portal).

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) has built-in roles that must be explicitly assigned and are queryable. API Management relies on these roles and Role-Based Access Control to enable fine-grained access management for API Management services and entities.

Additionally, API Management contains a built-in Administrators group in the API Management's user system. Groups in API Management control visibility of APIs in the developer portal and the members of the Administrators group can see all APIs.

Follow recommendations from Azure Security Center for the management and maintenance of administrative accounts.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure API Management does not have the concept of default passwords/key.

Azure API Management subscriptions, which are one means of securing access to APIs, do however come with a pair of generated subscription keys. Customers may regenerate these subscription keys at any time.

- [Understanding Azure API Management Subscriptions](api-management-subscriptions.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

- [How to use Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Azure API Management can be configured to leverage Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as an identity provider for authenticating users on the Developer Portal in order to benefit from the SSO capabilities offered by Azure AD. Once configured, new Developer Portal users can choose to follow the out-of-the-box sign-up process by first authenticating through Azure AD and then completing the sign-up process on the portal once authenticated.

- [Authorize developer accounts by using Azure AD in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-aad.md)

Alternatively, the sign-in/sign-up process can be further customized through delegation. Delegation allows you to use your existing website for handling developer sign in/sign up and subscription to products, as opposed to using the built-in functionality in the developer portal. It enables your website to own the user data and perform the validation of these steps in a custom way.

- [How to configure Named Locations in Azure](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Whenever possible, use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

Configure your Azure API Management Developer Portal to authenticate developer accounts by using Azure AD.

Configure your Azure API Management instance to protect your APIs by using the OAuth 2.0 protocol with Azure AD.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides logs to help discover stale accounts. Customers may utilize Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that only the right users continue to have appropriate access.

Customers can maintain inventory of API Management user accounts and reconcile access as needed. In API Management, developers are the consumers of the APIs that exposed with API Management. By default, newly created developer accounts are Active, and associated with the Developers group. Developer accounts that are in an active state can be used to access all of the APIs for which they have subscriptions.

Administrators can create custom groups or leverage external groups in associated Azure AD tenants. Custom and external groups can be used alongside system groups in giving developers visibility and access to API products.
