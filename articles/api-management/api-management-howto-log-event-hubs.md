# How to log events to Azure Event Hubs in Azure API Management
Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable data ingress service that can ingest millions of events per second so that you can process and analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your connected devices and applications. Event Hubs acts as the "front door" for an event pipeline, and once data is collected into an event hub, it can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters. Event Hubs decouples the production of a stream of events from the consumption of those events, so that event consumers can access the events on their own schedule.

This article is a companion to the [Integrate Azure API Management with Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/integrate-azure-api-management-with-event-hubs/) video and describes how to log API Management events using Azure Event Hubs.

## Create an Azure Event Hub

For detailed steps on how to create an event hub and get connection strings that you need to send and receive events to and from the Event Hub, see [Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).

## Create an API Management logger
Now that you have an Event Hub, the next step is to configure a [Logger](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/2019-12-01/logger) in your API Management service so that it can log events to the Event Hub.

API Management loggers are configured using the [API Management REST API](https://aka.ms/apimapi). For detailed request examples, see [how to create Loggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/2019-12-01/logger/createorupdate).

## Configure log-to-eventhubs policies

Once your logger is configured in API Management, you can configure your log-to-eventhubs policies to log the desired events. The log-to-eventhubs policy can be used in either the inbound policy section or the outbound policy section.

1. Browse to your APIM instance.
2. Select the API tab.
3. Select the API to which you want to add the policy. In this example, we're adding a policy to the **Echo API** in the **Unlimited** product.
4. Select **All operations**.
5. On the top of the screen, select the Design tab.
6. In the Inbound or Outbound processing window, click the triangle (next to the pencil).
7. Select the Code editor. For more information, see [How to set or edit policies](set-edit-policies.md).
8. Position your cursor in the `inbound` or `outbound` policy section.
9. In the window on the right, select **Advanced policies** > **Log to EventHub**. This inserts the `log-to-eventhub` policy statement template.

```xml
<log-to-eventhub logger-id ='logger-id'>
  @( string.Join(",", DateTime.UtcNow, context.Deployment.ServiceName, context.RequestId, context.Request.IpAddress, context.Operation.Name))
</log-to-eventhub>
```
Replace `logger-id` with the value you used for `{new logger name}` in the URL to create the logger in the previous step.

You can use any expression that returns a string as the value for the `log-to-eventhub` element. In this example, a string containing the date and time, service name, request id, request ip address, and operation name is logged.

Click **Save** to save the updated policy configuration. As soon as it is saved the policy is active and events are logged to the designated Event Hub.
