# Backup and restore service

The sample script in this article shows how to backup and restore the API Management service instance. 

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 1.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/api-management/backup-restore-apim-service/backup_restore_apim_service.ps1 "Backup and restore the APIM service instance")]

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) command to remove the resource group and all related resources.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure PowerShell module, see [Azure PowerShell documentation](/powershell/azure/).

Additional Azure PowerShell samples for Azure API Management can be found in the [PowerShell samples](../powershell-samples.md).
