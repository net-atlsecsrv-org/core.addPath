# Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints
This document lists some of the most common Microsoft Azure limits, which are also sometimes called quotas. This document doesn't currently cover all Azure services. Over time, the list will be expanded and updated to cover more services.

To learn more about Azure pricing, see [Azure pricing overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/). There, you can estimate your costs by using the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/). You also can go to the pricing details page for a particular service, for example, [Windows VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/#Windows). For tips to help manage your costs, see [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](billing/billing-getting-started.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, [open an online customer support request at no charge](azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-quota-errors.md). The limits can't be raised above the maximum limit value shown in the following tables. If there's no maximum limit column, the resource doesn't have adjustable limits.
>
> [Free Trial subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p) aren't eligible for limit or quota increases. If you have a [Free Trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p), you can upgrade to a [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) subscription. For more information, see [Upgrade your Azure Free Trial subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription.md) and the [Free Trial subscription FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq).

## Limits and Azure Resource Manager
It's now possible to combine multiple Azure resources into a single Azure resource group. When you use resource groups, limits that once were global become managed at a regional level with Azure Resource Manager. For more information about Azure resource groups, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md).

In the following list of limits, a new table reflects any differences in limits when you use Azure Resource Manager. For example, there's a **Subscription limits** table and a **Subscription limits - Azure Resource Manager** table. When a limit applies to both scenarios, it's only shown in the first table. Unless otherwise indicated, limits are global across all regions.

> [!NOTE]
> Quotas for resources in Azure resource groups are per-region accessible by your subscription, not per-subscription as the service management quotas are. Let's use vCPU quotas as an example. To request a quota increase with support for vCPUs, you must decide how many vCPUs you want to use in which regions. You then make a specific request for Azure resource group vCPU quotas for the amounts and regions that you want. If you need to use 30 vCPUs in West Europe to run your application there, you specifically request 30 vCPUs in West Europe. Your vCPU quota isn't increased in any other region--only West Europe has the 30-vCPU quota.
> <!-- -->
> As a result, decide what your Azure resource group quotas must be for your workload in any one region. Then request that amount in each region into which you want to deploy. For help in how to determine your current quotas for specific regions, see [Troubleshoot deployment issues](resource-manager-common-deployment-errors.md).

* **Standard**, which includes S1, S2, S3, and S3 High Density, is for larger production workloads. Multiple levels exist within the Standard tier so that you can choose a resource configuration that best matches your workload profile.
