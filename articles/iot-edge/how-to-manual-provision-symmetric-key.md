# Set up an Azure IoT Edge device with symmetric key authentication

This article provides the steps to register a new IoT Edge device in IoT Hub and configure the device to authenticate with symmetric keys.

The steps in this article walk through a process called manual provisioning, where you connect each device to its IoT hub manually. The alternative is automatic provisioning using the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, which is helpful when you have many devices to provision.

<!--TODO: Add auto-provision info/links-->

For manual provisioning, you have two options for authenticating IoT Edge devices:

* **Symmetric key**: When you create a new device identity in IoT Hub, the service creates two keys. You place one of the keys on the device, and it presents the key to IoT Hub when authenticating.

  This authentication method is faster to get started, but not as secure.

* **X.509 self-signed**: You create two X.509 identity certificates and place them on the device. When you create a new device identity in IoT Hub, you provide thumbprints from both certificates. When the device authenticates to IoT Hub, it presents its certificates and IoT Hub can verify that they match the thumbprints.

  This authentication method is more secure, and recommended for production scenarios.

This article walks through the registration and provisioning process with symmetric key authentication. If you want to learn how to set up a device with X.509 certificates, see [Set up an Azure IoT Edge device with X.509 certificate authentication](how-to-manual-provision-x509.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you follow the steps in this article, you should have a device with the IoT Edge runtime installed on it. If not, follow the steps in [Install or uninstall the Azure IoT Edge runtime](how-to-install-iot-edge.md).

## Register a new device

Every device that connects to an IoT Hub has a device ID that's used to track cloud-to-device or device-to-cloud communications. You configure a device with its connection information, which includes the IoT hub hostname, the device ID, and the information the device uses to authenticate to IoT Hub.

For symmetric key authentication, this information is gathered in a *connection string* that you can retrieve from IoT Hub and then place on your IoT Edge device.

You can use several tools to register a new IoT Edge device in IoT Hub and retrieve its connection string, depending on your preference.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

### Prerequisites for the Azure portal

A free or standard [IoT hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in your Azure subscription.

### Create an IoT Edge device in the Azure portal

1. Right-click on the ID of your device in the **Azure IoT Hub** section.
1. Select **Copy Device Connection String**.

   The connection string is copied to your clipboard.

You can also select **Get Device Info** from the right-click menu to see all the device info, including the connection string, in the output window.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

### Prerequisites for the Azure CLI

* An [IoT hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-cli.md) in your Azure subscription.
* [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) in your environment. At a minimum, your Azure CLI version must be 2.0.70 or newer. Use `az --version` to validate. This version supports az extension commands and introduces the Knack command framework.
* The [IoT extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension).

### Create an IoT Edge device with the Azure CLI

Use the [az iot hub device-identity create](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/hub/device-identity#ext-azure-iot-az-iot-hub-device-identity-create) command to create a new device identity in your IoT hub. For example:

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub device-identity create --device-id [device id] --hub-name [hub name] --edge-enabled
   ```

This command includes three parameters:

* `--device-id` or `-d`: Provide a descriptive name that's unique to your IoT hub.
* `hub-name` or `-n`: Provide the name of your IoT hub.
* `--edge-enabled` or `--ee`: Declare that the device is an IoT Edge device.

   ![az iot hub device-identity create output](./media/how-to-manual-provision-symmetric-key/create-edge-device-cli.png)

### View IoT Edge devices with the Azure CLI

Use the [az iot hub device-identity list](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/hub/device-identity#ext-azure-iot-az-iot-hub-device-identity-list) command to view all devices in your IoT hub. For example:

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub device-identity list --hub-name [hub name]
   ```

Any device that is registered as an IoT Edge device will have the property **capabilities.iotEdge** set to **true**.

### Retrieve the connection string with the Azure CLI

When you're ready to set up your device, you need the connection string that links your physical device with its identity in the IoT hub. Use the [az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/hub/device-identity#ext-azure-iot-az-iot-hub-device-identity-show-connection-string) command to return the connection string for a single device:

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --device-id [device id] --hub-name [hub name]
   ```

The value for the `device-id` parameter is case-sensitive. Don't copy the quotation marks around the connection string.

## Provision an IoT Edge device

Once the IoT Edge device has an identity in IoT Hub and a connection string that it can use for authentication, you need to provision the device itself with this information.

On a Linux device, you provide the connection string by editing a config.yaml file. On a Windows device, you provide the connection string by running a PowerShell script.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

On the IoT Edge device, open the configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
```

Find the provisioning configurations of the file and uncomment the **Manual provisioning configuration using a connection string** section. 

Update the value of **device_connection_string** with the connection string from your IoT Edge device. Make sure any other provisioning sections are commented out. Make sure the **provisioning:** line has no preceding whitespace and that nested items are indented by two spaces.

```yml
# Manual provisioning configuration using a connection string
provisioning:
  source: "manual"
  device_connection_string: "<ADD DEVICE CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
  dynamic_reprovisioning: false
```

To paste clipboard contents into Nano `Shift+Right Click` or press `Shift+Insert`.

Save and close the file.

   `CTRL + X`, `Y`, `Enter`

After entering the provisioning information in the configuration file, restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart iotedge
```

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

1. On the IoT Edge device, run PowerShell as an administrator.

2. Use the [Initialize-IoTEdge](reference-windows-scripts.md#initialize-iotedge) command to configure the IoT Edge runtime on your machine. The command defaults to manual provisioning with Windows containers.

   ```powershell
   . {Invoke-WebRequest -useb https://aka.ms/iotedge-win} | Invoke-Expression; `
   Initialize-IoTEdge -ManualConnectionString -ContainerOs Windows
   ```

   * If you are using Linux containers, add the `-ContainerOs` parameter to the flag. Be consistent with the container option you chose with the `Deploy-IoTEdge` command that you ran previously.

      ```powershell
      . {Invoke-WebRequest -useb https://aka.ms/iotedge-win} | Invoke-Expression; `
      Initialize-IoTEdge -ContainerOs Linux
      ```

   * If you downloaded the IoTEdgeSecurityDaemon.ps1 script onto your device for offline or specific version installation, be sure to reference the local copy of the script.

      ```powershell
      . <path>/IoTEdgeSecurityDaemon.ps1
      Initialize-IoTEdge -ManualX509
      ```

3. When prompted, provide the device connection string that you retrieved in the previous section. The device connection string associates the physical device with a device ID in IoT Hub and provides authentication information.

   The device connection string takes the following format, and should not include quotation marks: `HostName={IoT hub name}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId={device name};SharedAccessKey={key}`

When you provision a device manually, you can use additional parameters to modify the process including:

* Direct traffic to go through a proxy server
* Declare a specific edgeAgent container image, and provide credentials if it's in a private registry

For more information about these additional parameters, see [PowerShell scripts for IoT Edge on Windows](reference-windows-scripts.md).
