# Tutorial: Develop C IoT Edge modules for Windows devices

This article shows you how to use Visual Studio to develop C code and deploy it to a Windows device that's running Azure IoT Edge.

You can use Azure IoT Edge modules to deploy code that implements your business logic directly in your IoT Edge devices. This tutorial walks you through creating and deploying an IoT Edge module that filters sensor data. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Use Visual Studio to create an IoT Edge module that's based on the C SDK.
> * Use Visual Studio and Docker to create a Docker image and publish it to your registry.
> * Deploy the module to your IoT Edge device.
> * View generated data.

The IoT Edge module that you create in this tutorial filters the temperature data that's generated by your device. The module sends messages upstream only if the temperature exceeds a specified threshold. This type of analysis at the edge is useful for reducing the amount of data that's communicated to and stored in the cloud.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

This tutorial demonstrates how to develop a module in C by using Visual Studio 2019 and then deploy it to a Windows device. If you're developing modules for Linux devices, go to [Develop C IoT Edge modules for Linux devices](tutorial-csharp-module.md) instead.

To understand your options for developing and deploying C modules to Windows devices, refer to the following table:

| C | Visual&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;Code | Visual Studio 2017&nbsp;and&nbsp;2019 |
| -- | ------------------ | :------------------: |
| Windows AMD64 |  | ![Develop C modules for WinAMD64 in Visual Studio](./media/tutorial-c-module/green-check.png) |

Before you begin this tutorial, set up your development environment by following the instructions in the [Develop IoT Edge modules for Windows devices](tutorial-develop-for-windows.md) tutorial. After you complete it, your environment will contain the following prerequisites:

* A free or standard-tier [IoT hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in Azure.
* A [Windows device that's running Azure IoT Edge](quickstart.md).
* A container registry, such as [Azure Container Registry](../container-registry/index.yml).
* [Visual Studio 2019](/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio), configured with the [Azure IoT Edge Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsc-iot.vs16iotedgetools) extension.
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), configured to run Windows containers.

Install the Azure IoT C SDK for Windows x64 through vcpkg by running the following commands:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   .\vcpkg install azure-iot-sdk-c:x64-windows
   .\vcpkg --triplet x64-windows integrate install
   ```

> [!TIP]
> If you're using Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.7 or later), download and install Azure IoT Edge Tools for Visual Studio 2017 from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsc-iot.vsiotedgetools).

## Create a module project

In this section, you create an IoT Edge module project that's based on the C SDK by using Visual Studio and the Azure IoT Edge Tools extension. After you create a project template, you'll add new code so that the module filters out messages based on their reported properties.

### Create a new project

Create a C solution template that you can customize with your own code.

1. Open Visual Studio 2019, and then select **Create New Project**.

1. On the **Create a new project** pane, search for **IoT Edge** and then, in the results list, select the **Azure IoT Edge (Windows amd64)** project.

   ![Screenshot of the IoT Edge "Create a new project" pane.](./media/tutorial-c-module-windows/new-project.png)

1. Select **Next**.

    The **Configure your new project** pane opens.

   ![Screenshot of the "Configure your new project" pane.](./media/tutorial-c-module-windows/configure-project.png)

1. On the **Configure your new project** pane, rename the project and solution to something more descriptive, such as **CTutorialApp**. 

1. Select **Create** to create the project.

   The **Add Module** pane opens.

   ![Screenshot of the "Add Module" pane for configuring your project.](./media/tutorial-c-module-windows/add-application-and-module.png)

1. On the **Configure your new project** page, do the following:

   a. On the left pane, select the **C Module** template.  
   b. In the **Module Name** box, enter **CModule**.  
   c. In the **Repository Url** box, replace **localhost:5000** with the **Login server** value from your Azure container registry, in the following format: `<registry name>.azurecr.io/cmodule`

    > [!NOTE]
    > An image repository includes the name of your container registry and the name of your container image. Your container image is prepopulated from the module project-name value.  You can retrieve the login server from the overview page of your container registry in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Add** to create the project.

### Add your registry credentials

The deployment manifest shares the credentials for your container registry with the IoT Edge runtime. The runtime needs these credentials to pull your private images onto the IoT Edge device. Use the credentials from the **Access keys** section of your Azure container registry.

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, open the *deployment.template.json* file.

1. Look for the **registryCredentials** property in the $edgeAgent desired properties. The registry address of the property should be autofilled with the information you provided when you created the project. The username and password fields should contain variable names. For example:

   ```json
   "registryCredentials": {
     "<registry name>": {
       "username": "$CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME_<registry name>",
       "password": "$CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD_<registry name>",
       "address": "<registry name>.azurecr.io"
     }
   }
   ```

1. Open the environment (ENV) file in your module solution. By default, the file is hidden in Solution Explorer, so you might need to select the **Show All Files** button to display it. The ENV file should contain the same username and password variables that you saw in the *deployment.template.json* file.

1. Add the **Username** and **Password** values from your Azure container registry.

1. Save your changes to the ENV file.

### Update the module with custom code

The default module code receives messages in an input queue and passes them along through an output queue. Let's add some more code so that the module processes the messages at the edge before forwarding them to your IoT hub. Update the module so that it analyzes the temperature data in each message and sends the message to the IoT hub only if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.

1. The data from the sensor in this scenario comes in JSON format. To filter messages in JSON format, import a JSON library for C. This tutorial uses Parson.

   a. Download the [Parson GitHub repository](https://github.com/kgabis/parson).  
   b. Copy the *parson.c* and *parson.h* files to the CModule project.  
   c. In Visual Studio, open the *CMakeLists.txt* file from the CModule project folder.  
   d. At the top of the file, import the Parson files as a library called **my_parson**.

      ```txt
      add_library(my_parson
          parson.c
          parson.h
      )
      ```  
   e. Add `my_parson` to the list of libraries in the "target_link_libraries" section of the *CMakeLists.txt* file.  
   f. Save the *CMakeLists.txt* file.  
   g. Select **CModule** > **main.c**. At the bottom of the list of include statements, add a new statement to include `parson.h` for JSON support:

      ```c
      #include "parson.h"
      ```

1. In the *main.c* file, add a global variable called `temperatureThreshold` next to the `messagesReceivedByInput1Queue` variable. This variable sets the value that the measured temperature must exceed for the data to be sent to your IoT hub.

    ```c
    static double temperatureThreshold = 25;
    ```

1. Find the `CreateMessageInstance` function in *main.c*. Replace the inner *if-else* statement with the following code, which adds a few lines of functionality:

   ```c
   if ((messageInstance->messageHandle = IoTHubMessage_Clone(message)) == NULL)
   {
       free(messageInstance);
       messageInstance = NULL;
   }
   else
   {
       messageInstance->messageTrackingId = messagesReceivedByInput1Queue;
       MAP_HANDLE propMap = IoTHubMessage_Properties(messageInstance->messageHandle);
       if (Map_AddOrUpdate(propMap, "MessageType", "Alert") != MAP_OK)
       {
          printf("ERROR: Map_AddOrUpdate Failed!\r\n");
       }
   }
   ```

   The new lines of code in the *else* statement add a new property to the message, which labels the message as an alert. This code labels all messages as alerts, because we'll add functionality that sends messages to the IoT hub only if they report high temperatures.

1. Find the `InputQueue1Callback` function, and replace the whole function with the following code. This function implements the actual messaging filter. When a message is received, it checks whether the reported temperature exceeds the threshold. If the temperature does exceed the threshold, the function forwards the message through its output queue. If it doesn't exceed the threshold, the function ignores the message.

    ```c
    static unsigned char *bytearray_to_str(const unsigned char *buffer, size_t len)
    {
        unsigned char *ret = (unsigned char *)malloc(len + 1);
        memcpy(ret, buffer, len);
        ret[len] = '\0';
        return ret;
    }

    static IOTHUBMESSAGE_DISPOSITION_RESULT InputQueue1Callback(IOTHUB_MESSAGE_HANDLE message, void* userContextCallback)
    {
        IOTHUBMESSAGE_DISPOSITION_RESULT result;
        IOTHUB_CLIENT_RESULT clientResult;
        IOTHUB_MODULE_CLIENT_LL_HANDLE iotHubModuleClientHandle = (IOTHUB_MODULE_CLIENT_LL_HANDLE)userContextCallback;

        unsigned const char* messageBody;
        size_t contentSize;

        if (IoTHubMessage_GetByteArray(message, &messageBody, &contentSize) == IOTHUB_MESSAGE_OK)
        {
            messageBody = bytearray_to_str(messageBody, contentSize);
        } else
        {
            messageBody = "<null>";
        }

        printf("Received Message [%zu]\r\n Data: [%s]\r\n",
                messagesReceivedByInput1Queue, messageBody);

        // Check whether the message reports temperatures that exceed the threshold
        JSON_Value *root_value = json_parse_string(messageBody);
        JSON_Object *root_object = json_value_get_object(root_value);
        double temperature;

        // If temperature exceeds the threshold, send to output1
        if (json_object_dotget_value(root_object, "machine.temperature") != NULL && (temperature = json_object_dotget_number(root_object, "machine.temperature")) > temperatureThreshold)
        {
            printf("Machine temperature %f exceeds threshold %f\r\n", temperature, temperatureThreshold);
            // This message should be sent to next stop in the pipeline, namely "output1".  What happens at "outpu1" is determined
            // by the configuration of the Edge routing table setup.
            MESSAGE_INSTANCE *messageInstance = CreateMessageInstance(message);
            if (NULL == messageInstance)
            {
                result = IOTHUBMESSAGE_ABANDONED;
            }
            else
            {
                printf("Sending message (%zu) to the next stage in pipeline\n", messagesReceivedByInput1Queue);

                clientResult = IoTHubModuleClient_LL_SendEventToOutputAsync(iotHubModuleClientHandle, messageInstance->messageHandle, "output1", SendConfirmationCallback, (void *)messageInstance);
                if (clientResult != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
                {
                    IoTHubMessage_Destroy(messageInstance->messageHandle);
                    free(messageInstance);
                    printf("IoTHubModuleClient_LL_SendEventToOutputAsync failed on sending msg#=%zu, err=%d\n", messagesReceivedByInput1Queue, clientResult);
                    result = IOTHUBMESSAGE_ABANDONED;
                }
                else
                {
                    result = IOTHUBMESSAGE_ACCEPTED;
                }
            }
        }
        // If message does not exceed the threshold, do not forward
        else
        {
            printf("Not sending message (%zu) to the next stage in pipeline.\r\n", messagesReceivedByInput1Queue);
            result = IOTHUBMESSAGE_ACCEPTED;
        }

        messagesReceivedByInput1Queue++;
        return result;
    }
    ```

1. Add a `moduleTwinCallback` function. This method receives updates on the desired properties from the module twin, and updates the **temperatureThreshold** variable to match. All modules have their own module twin, which lets you configure the code that's running inside the module directly from the cloud.

    ```c
    static void moduleTwinCallback(DEVICE_TWIN_UPDATE_STATE update_state, const unsigned char* payLoad, size_t size, void* userContextCallback)
    {
        printf("\r\nTwin callback called with (state=%s, size=%zu):\r\n%s\r\n",
            MU_ENUM_TO_STRING(DEVICE_TWIN_UPDATE_STATE, update_state), size, payLoad);
        JSON_Value *root_value = json_parse_string(payLoad);
        JSON_Object *root_object = json_value_get_object(root_value);
        if (json_object_dotget_value(root_object, "desired.TemperatureThreshold") != NULL) {
            temperatureThreshold = json_object_dotget_number(root_object, "desired.TemperatureThreshold");
        }
        if (json_object_get_value(root_object, "TemperatureThreshold") != NULL) {
            temperatureThreshold = json_object_get_number(root_object, "TemperatureThreshold");
        }
    }
    ```

1. Look for the `SetupCallbacksForModule` function. Replace the function with the following code, which adds an *else-if* statement to check whether the module twin has been updated.

   ```c
   static int SetupCallbacksForModule(IOTHUB_MODULE_CLIENT_LL_HANDLE iotHubModuleClientHandle)
   {
       int ret;

       if (IoTHubModuleClient_LL_SetInputMessageCallback(iotHubModuleClientHandle, "input1", InputQueue1Callback, (void*)iotHubModuleClientHandle) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
       {
           printf("ERROR: IoTHubModuleClient_LL_SetInputMessageCallback(\"input1\")..........FAILED!\r\n");
           ret = MU_FAILURE;
       }
       else if (IoTHubModuleClient_LL_SetModuleTwinCallback(iotHubModuleClientHandle, moduleTwinCallback, (void*)iotHubModuleClientHandle) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
       {
           printf("ERROR: IoTHubModuleClient_LL_SetModuleTwinCallback(default)..........FAILED!\r\n");
           ret = MU_FAILURE;
       }
       else
       {
           ret = 0;
       }

       return ret;
   }
   ```

1. Save the *main.c* file.

1. Open the *deployment.template.json* file.

1. Add the **CModule** module twin to the deployment manifest. Insert the following JSON content at the bottom of the `moduleContent` section, after the `$edgeHub` module twin:

   ```json
   "CModule": {
       "properties.desired":{
           "TemperatureThreshold":25
       }
   }
   ```

   ![Screenshot showing the module twin being added to the deployment template.](./media/tutorial-c-module-windows/module-twin.png)

1. Save the *deployment.template.json* file.

## Build and push your module

In the preceding section, you created an IoT Edge solution and added code to **CModule** to filter out messages where the reported machine temperature is below the acceptable threshold. Now you need to build the solution as a container image and push it to your container registry.

### Sign in to Docker

Provide your container registry credentials to Docker on your development machine so that it can push your container image to be stored in the registry.

1. Open PowerShell or a Command Prompt window.

1. Sign in to Docker with the Azure container registry credentials that you saved after you created the registry.

   ```cmd
   docker login -u <ACR username> -p <ACR password> <ACR login server>
   ```

   You might receive a security warning that recommends the use of `--password-stdin`. Although we recommend this as a best practice for production scenarios, it's outside the scope of this tutorial. For more information, see the [docker login reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#provide-a-password-using-stdin).

### Build and push

Your development machine now has access to your container registry, and your IoT Edge devices will too. It's time to turn the project code into a container image.

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the name of the project that you want to build. The default name is **AzureIotEdgeApp1**. For this tutorial, we chose the name **CTutorialApp** and, because you're building a Windows module, the extension should be **Windows.Amd64**.

1. Select **Build and Push IoT Edge Modules**.

   The build and push command starts three operations:
   * First, it creates a new folder in the solution named *config*, which holds the full deployment manifest. It's built from information in the deployment template and other solution files. 
   * Second, it runs `docker build` to build the container image, based on the appropriate Dockerfile for your target architecture. 
   * Finally, it runs `docker push` to push the image repository to your container registry.

   This process might take several minutes the first time, but it will go faster the next time you run the commands.

## Deploy modules to the device

Use Visual Studio Cloud Explorer and the Azure IoT Edge Tools extension to deploy the module project to your IoT Edge device. You've already prepared a deployment manifest for your scenario, the *deployment.windows-amd64.json* file in the *config* folder. All you need to do now is select a device to receive the deployment.

Make sure that your IoT Edge device is up and running.

1. In Visual Studio Cloud Explorer, expand the resources to view your list of IoT devices.

1. Right-click the name of the IoT Edge device that you want to receive the deployment.

1. Select **Create Deployment**.

1. In Visual Studio File Explorer, select the *deployment.windows-amd64.json* file in the *config* folder of your solution.

1. Refresh Cloud Explorer to view the deployed modules that are listed under your device.

## View generated data

After you apply the deployment manifest to your IoT Edge device, the IoT Edge runtime on the device collects the new deployment information and starts executing on it. Any modules that are running on the device but not included in the deployment manifest are stopped. Any modules that are missing from the device are started.

You can use the IoT Edge Tools extension to view messages as they arrive at your IoT hub.

1. In Visual Studio Cloud Explorer, select the name of your IoT Edge device.

1. In the **Actions** list, select **Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint**.

1. View the messages that are arriving at your IoT hub. It might take a while for the messages to arrive, because the IoT Edge device has to receive its new deployment and start all the modules. The changes to the CModule code must wait until the machine temperature reaches 25 degrees before the messages can be sent. The code also adds the message type **Alert** to any messages that reach that temperature threshold.

   ![Screenshot of the Output window displaying messages that are arriving at the IoT hub.](./media/tutorial-c-module-windows/view-d2c-message.png)

## Edit the module twin

You used the CModule module twin to set the temperature threshold at 25 degrees. You can use the module twin to change the functionality without having to update the module code.

1. In Visual Studio, open the *deployment.windows-amd64.json* file. 

   Do *not* open the *deployment.template* file. If you don't see the deployment manifest in the *config* file in Solution Explorer, select the **Show all files** icon in the Solution Explorer toolbar.

1. Look for the CModule twin, and change the value of the **temperatureThreshold** parameter to a new temperature that's 5 to 10 degrees higher than the latest reported temperature.

1. Save the *deployment.windows-amd64.json* file.

1. Follow the deployment instructions again to apply the updated deployment manifest to your device.

1. Monitor the incoming device-to-cloud messages. The messages should stop until the new temperature threshold is reached.

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue to the next recommended article, you can keep and reuse the resources and configurations that you created in this tutorial. You can also keep using the same IoT Edge device as a test device.

Otherwise, to avoid incurring charges, you can delete the local configurations and the Azure resources that you used here.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an IoT Edge module with code to filter raw data that's generated by your IoT Edge device.
