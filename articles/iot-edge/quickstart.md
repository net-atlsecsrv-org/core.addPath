# Quickstart: Deploy your first IoT Edge module to a Windows device (preview)

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-201806](../../includes/iot-edge-version-201806.md)]

Try out Azure IoT Edge in this quickstart by deploying containerized code to a Linux on Windows IoT Edge device. IoT Edge allows you to remotely manage code on your devices so that you can send more of your workloads to the edge. For this quickstart, we recommend using your own device to see how easy it is to use Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to:

* Create an IoT hub.
* Register an IoT Edge device to your IoT hub.
* Install and start the IoT Edge for Linux on Windows runtime on your device.
* Remotely deploy a module to an IoT Edge device and send telemetry.

![Diagram that shows the architecture of this quickstart for your device and cloud.](./media/quickstart/install-edge-full.png)

This quickstart walks you through how to set up your Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows device. Then, you'll deploy a module from the Azure portal to your device. The module you'll use is a simulated sensor that generates temperature, humidity, and pressure data. Other Azure IoT Edge tutorials build on the work you do here by deploying modules that analyze the simulated data for business insights.

If you don't have an active Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) before you begin.

>[!NOTE]
>IoT Edge for Linux on Windows is in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

Prepare your environment for the Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

Create a cloud resource group to manage all the resources you'll use in this quickstart.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az group create --name IoTEdgeResources --location westus2
   ```

Make sure your IoT Edge device meets the following requirements:

* Editions
  * Windows 10 version 1809 or later; build 17763 or later
    * Professional, Enterprise, IoT Enterprise
  * Windows Server 2019 build 17763 or later

  
* Hardware requirements
  * Minimum Free Memory: 2 GB
  * Minimum Free Disk Space: 10 GB


>[!NOTE]
>This quickstart uses Windows Admin Center to create a deployment of IoT Edge for Linux on Windows. You can also use PowerShell. If you wish to use PowerShell to create your deployment, follow the steps in the how-to guide on [installing and provisioning Azure IoT Edge for Linux on a Windows device](how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows.md).

## Create an IoT hub

Start by creating an IoT hub with the Azure CLI.

![Diagram that shows the step to create an I o T hub.](./media/quickstart/create-iot-hub.png)

The free level of Azure IoT Hub works for this quickstart. If you've used IoT Hub in the past and already have a hub created, you can use that IoT hub.

The following code creates a free **F1** hub in the resource group `IoTEdgeResources`. Replace `{hub_name}` with a unique name for your IoT hub. It might take a few minutes to create an IoT hub.

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub create --resource-group IoTEdgeResources --name {hub_name} --sku F1 --partition-count 2
```

If you get an error because you already have one free hub in your subscription, change the SKU to `S1`. If you get an error that the IoT hub name isn't available, someone else already has a hub with that name. Try a new name.

## Register an IoT Edge device

Register an IoT Edge device with your newly created IoT hub.

![Diagram that shows the step to register a device with an IoT hub identity.](./media/quickstart/register-device.png)

Create a device identity for your simulated device so that it can communicate with your IoT hub. The device identity lives in the cloud, and you use a unique device connection string to associate a physical device to a device identity.

IoT Edge devices behave and can be managed differently than typical IoT devices. Use the `--edge-enabled` flag to declare that this identity is for an IoT Edge device.

1. In Azure Cloud Shell, enter the following command to create a device named **myEdgeDevice** in your hub.

     ```azurecli-interactive
     az iot hub device-identity create --device-id myEdgeDevice --edge-enabled --hub-name {hub_name}
     ```

     If you get an error about `iothubowner` policy keys, make sure that Cloud Shell is running the latest version of the Azure IoT extension.

1. View the connection string for your device, which links your physical device with its identity in IoT Hub. It contains the name of your IoT hub, the name of your device, and a shared key that authenticates connections between the two.

     ```azurecli-interactive
     az iot hub device-identity connection-string show --device-id myEdgeDevice --hub-name {hub_name}
     ```

1. Copy the value of the `connectionString` key from the JSON output and save it. This value is the device connection string. You'll use it to configure the IoT Edge runtime in the next section.

     ![Screenshot that shows the connectionString output in Cloud Shell.](./media/quickstart/retrieve-connection-string.png)

## Install and start the IoT Edge runtime

Install IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on your device, and configure it with the device connection string.

Your IoT Edge device is now configured. It's ready to run cloud-deployed modules.

## Deploy a module

Manage your Azure IoT Edge device from the cloud to deploy a module that sends telemetry data to IoT Hub.

![Diagram that shows the step to deploy a module.](./media/quickstart/deploy-module.png)

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-deploy-module](../../includes/iot-edge-deploy-module.md)]

## View the generated data

In this quickstart, you created a new IoT Edge device and installed the IoT Edge runtime on it. Then you used the Azure portal to deploy an IoT Edge module to run on the device without having to make changes to the device itself.

The module that you pushed generates sample environment data that you can use for testing later. The simulated sensor is monitoring both a machine and the environment around the machine. For example, this sensor might be in a server room, on a factory floor, or on a wind turbine. The messages that it sends include ambient temperature and humidity, machine temperature and pressure, and a timestamp. IoT Edge tutorials use the data created by this module as test data for analytics.

From the command shell in Windows Admin Center, confirm that the module you deployed from the cloud is running on your IoT Edge device.

1. Connect to your newly created IoT Edge device.

     :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart/connect-edge-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting Connect in Windows Admin Center.":::

     On the **Overview** page, you'll see the **IoT Edge Module List** and **IoT Edge Status**. You can see the modules that have been deployed and the device status.  

1. Under **Tools**, select **Command Shell**. The command shell is a PowerShell terminal that automatically uses Secure Shell (SSH) to connect to your Azure IoT Edge device's Linux VM on your Windows PC.

     :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart/command-shell-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows opening the command shell.":::

1. To verify the three modules on your device, run the following Bash command:

     ```bash
     sudo iotedge list
     ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart/iotedge-list-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the command shell I o T edge list output.":::

1. View the messages being sent from the temperature sensor module to the cloud.

     ```bash
     iotedge logs SimulatedTemperatureSensor -f
     ```

    >[!Important]
    >IoT Edge commands are case-sensitive when they refer to module names.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart/temperature-sensor-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of messages sent from the module to the cloud.":::

You can also use the [Azure IoT Hub extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit) to watch messages arrive at your IoT hub.

## Clean up resources

If you want to continue on to the IoT Edge tutorials, skip this step. You can use the device that you registered and set up in this quickstart. Otherwise, you can delete the Azure resources that you created to avoid charges.

If you created your virtual machine and IoT hub in a new resource group, you can delete that group and all the associated resources. If you don't want to delete the whole group, you can delete individual resources instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the contents of the resource group to make sure that there's nothing you want to keep. Deleting a resource group is irreversible.

Use the following command to remove the **IoTEdgeResources** group. Deletion might take a few minutes.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name IoTEdgeResources
```

You can confirm that the resource group is removed by using this command to view the list of resource groups.

```azurecli-interactive
az group list
```

### Remove Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows

Use the dashboard extension in Windows Admin Center to uninstall Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

1. Connect to the IoT Edge device in Windows Admin Center. The Azure dashboard tool extension loads.

1. Select **Uninstall**. After Azure IoT Edge is removed, Windows Admin Center removes the Azure IoT Edge device connection entry from the **Start** page.

>[!Note]
>Another way to remove Azure IoT Edge from your Windows system is to select **Start** > **Settings** > **Apps** > **Azure IoT Edge** > **Uninstall** on your IoT Edge device. This method removes Azure IoT Edge from your IoT Edge device, but leaves the connection behind in Windows Admin Center. To complete the removal, uninstall Windows Admin Center from the **Settings** menu as well.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created an IoT Edge device and used the Azure IoT Edge cloud interface to deploy code onto the device. Now you have a test device generating raw data about its environment.

Next, set up your local development environment so that you can start creating IoT Edge modules that run your business logic.
