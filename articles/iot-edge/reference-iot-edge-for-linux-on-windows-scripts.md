# PowerShell scripts for IoT Edge for Linux on Windows

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-201806](../../includes/iot-edge-version-201806.md)]

Understand the PowerShell scripts that deploy, provision, and get the status your IoT Edge for Linux on Windows virtual machine.

The commands described in this article are from the `AzureEFLOW.psm1` file, which can be found on your system in your `WindowsPowerShell` directory under `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShellModules\AzureEFLOW`.

## Deploy-Eflow

The **Deploy-Eflow** command is the main deployment method. The deployment command creates the virtual machine, provisions files, and deploys the IoT Edge agent module. While none of the parameters are required, they can be used to provision your IoT Edge device during the deployment and modify settings for the virtual machine during creation. For a full list, use the command `Get-Help Deploy-Eflow -full`.  

>[!NOTE]
>For the provisioning type, **X509** currently exclusively refers to X509 provisioning using an [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md). The manual X509 provisioning method is not currently supported.

| Parameter | Accepted values | Comments |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- |
| eflowVhdxDir | Directory path | Directory where deployment stores VHDX file for VM. |
| provisioningType | **manual**, **TPM**, **X509**, or **symmetric** |  Defines the type of provisioning you wish to use for your IoT Edge device. |
| devConnString | The device connection string of an existing IoT Edge device | Device connection string for manually provisioning an IoT Edge device (**manual**). |
| symmKey | The primary key for an existing DPS enrollment or the primary key of an existing IoT Edge device registered using symmetric keys | Symmetric key for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| scopeId | The scope ID for an existing DPS instance. | Scope ID for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| registrationId | The registration ID of an existing IoT Edge device | Registration ID for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| identityCertLocVm | Directory path; must be in a folder that can be owned by the `iotedge` service | Absolute destination path of the identity certificate on your virtual machine for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| identityCertLocWin | Directory path | Absolute source path of the identity certificate in Windows for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| identityPkLocVm | Directory path; must be in a folder that can be owned by the `iotedge` service | Absolute destination path of the identity private key on your virtual machine for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| identityPkLocWin | Directory path | Absolute source path of the identity private key in Windows for provisioning an IoT Edge device (**X509** or **symmetric**). |
| vmSizeDefintion | No longer than 30 characters | Definition of the number of cores and available RAM for the virtual machine. **Default value**: Standard_K8S_v1. |
| vmDiskSize | Between 8 GB and 256 GB | Maximum disk size of the dynamically expanding virtual hard disk. **Default value**: 16 GB. |
| vmUser | No longer than 30 characters | Username for logging on to the virtual machine. |
| vnetType | **Transparent** or **ICS** | The type of virtual switch. **Default value**: Transparent. Transparent refers to an external switch, while ICS refers to an internal switch. |
| vnetName | No longer than 64 characters | The name of the virtual switch. **Default value**: External. |
| enableVtpm | None | **Switch parameter**. Create the virtual machine with TPM enabled or disabled. |
| mobyPackageVersion | No longer than 30 characters |  Version of Moby package to be verified or installed on the virtual machine.  **Default value:** 19.03.11. |
| iotedgePackageVersion | No longer than 30 characters | Version of IoT Edge package to be verified or installed on the virtual machine. **Default value:** 1.1.0. |
| installPackages | None | **Switch parameter**. When toggled, the script will attempt to install the Moby and IoT Edge packages rather than only verifying the packages are present. |

>[!NOTE]
>By default, if the process cannot find an external switch with the name `External`, it will search for any existing external switch through which to obtain an IP address. If there is no external switch available, it will search for an internal switch. If there is no internal switch available, it will attempt to create the default switch through which to obtain an IP address.

## Verify-EflowVm
