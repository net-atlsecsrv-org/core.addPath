# Deploy and monitor IoT Edge modules at scale using the Azure portal

Create an **IoT Edge automatic deployment** in the Azure portal to manage ongoing deployments for many devices at once. Automatic deployments for IoT Edge are part of the [automatic device management](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-automatic-device-management) feature of IoT Hub. Deployments are dynamic processes that enable you to deploy multiple modules to multiple devices, track the status and health of the modules, and make changes when necessary. 

For more information, see [Understand IoT Edge automatic deployments for single devices or at scale](module-deployment-monitoring.md).

## Identify devices using tags

Before you can create a deployment, you have to be able to specify which devices you want to affect. Azure IoT Edge identifies devices using **tags** in the device twin. Each device can have multiple tags that you define in any way that makes sense for your solution. For example, if you manage a campus of smart buildings, you might add the following tags to a device:

```json
"tags":{
  "location":{
    "building": "20",
    "floor": "2"
  },
  "roomtype": "conference",
  "environment": "prod"
}
```

For more information about device twins and tags, see [Understand and use device twins in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md).

## Create a deployment

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your IoT hub. 
1. Select **IoT Edge**.
1. Select **Add IoT Edge Deployment**.

There are five steps to create a deployment. The following sections walk through each one. 

### Step 1: Name and Label

1. Give your deployment a unique name that is up to 128 lowercase letters. Avoid spaces and the following invalid characters: `& ^ [ ] { } \ | " < > /`.
1. You can add labels as key-value pairs to help track your deployments. For example, **HostPlatform** and **Linux**, or **Version** and **3.0.1**.
1. Select **Next** to move to step two. 

### Step 2: Add Modules (optional)

You can add up to 20 modules to a deployment. 

If you create a deployment with no modules, it removes any current modules from the target devices. 

To add a module from Azure Stream Analytics, follow these steps:

1. In the **Deployment Modules** section of the page, click **Add**.
1. Select **Azure Stream Analytics module**.
1. Choose your **Subscription** from the drop-down menu.
1. Choose your IoT **Edge job** from the drop-down menu.
1. Select **Save** to add your module to the deployment. 

To add custom code as a module, or to manually add an Azure service module, follow these steps:

1. In the **Container Registry Settings** section of the page, provide the names and credentials for any private container registries that contain the module images for this deployment. The IoT Edge Agent will report error 500 if it can't find the container registry credential for a Docker image.
1. In the **Deployment Modules** section of the page, click **Add**.
1. Select **IoT Edge Module**.
1. Give your module a **Name**.
1. For the **Image URI** field, enter the container image for your module. 
1. Specify any **Container Create Options** that should be passed to the container. For more information, see [docker create](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create/).
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Restart policy**. Choose from the following options: 
   * **Always** - The module always restarts if it shuts down for any reason.
   * **never** - The module never restarts if it shuts down for any reason.
   * **on-failure** - The module restarts if it crashes, but not if it shuts down cleanly. 
   * **on-unhealthy** - The module restarts if it crashes or returns an unhealthy status. It's up to each module to implement the health status function. 
1. Use the drop-down menu to select the **Desired Status** for the module. Choose from the following options:
   * **running** - Running is the default option. The module will start running immediately after being deployed.
   * **stopped** - After being deployed, the module will remain idle until called upon to start by you or another module.
1. Select **Set module twin's desired properties** if you want to add tags or other properties to the module twin.
1. Enter **Environment Variables** for this module. Environment variables provide configuration information to a module.
1. Select **Save** to add your module to the deployment. 

Once you have all the modules for a deployment configured, select **Next** to move to step three.

### Step 3: Specify Routes (optional)

Routes define how modules communicate with each other within a deployment. By default the wizard gives you a route called **route** and defined as **FROM /* INTO $upstream**, which means that any messages output by any modules are sent to your IoT hub.  

Add or update the routes with information from [Declare routes](module-composition.md#declare-routes), then select **Next** to continue to the review section.

### Step 4: Specify Metrics (optional)

Metrics provide summary counts of the various states that a device may report back as a result of applying configuration content.

1. Enter a name for **Metric Name**.

1. Enter a query for **Metric Criteria**. The query is based on IoT Edge hub module twin [reported properties](module-edgeagent-edgehub.md#edgehub-reported-properties). The metric represents the number of rows returned by the query.

   For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT deviceId FROM devices
     WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200
   ```

### Step 5: Target Devices

Use the tags property from your devices to target the specific devices that should receive this deployment. 

Since multiple deployments may target the same device, you should give each deployment a priority number. If there's ever a conflict, the deployment with the highest priority (larger values indicate higher priority) wins. If two deployments have the same priority number, the one that was created most recently wins. 

1. Enter a positive integer for the deployment **Priority**.
1. Enter a **Target condition** to determine which devices will be targeted with this deployment. The condition is based on device twin tags or device twin reported properties and should match the expression format. For example, `tags.environment='test'` or `properties.reported.devicemodel='4000x'`. 
1. Select **Next** to move on to the final step.

### Step 6: Review Deployment

Review your deployment information, then select **Submit**.

## Deploy modules from Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace is an online applications and services marketplace where you can browse through a wide range of enterprise applications and solutions that are certified and optimized to run on Azure, including [IoT Edge modules](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/internet-of-things?page=1&subcategories=iot-edge-modules). Azure Marketplace can also be accessed through the Azure portal under **Create a Resource**.

You can deploy an IoT Edge module from either Azure Marketplace or the Azure portal:

1. Find a module and begin the deployment process.

   * Azure portal: Find a module and select **Create**.

   * Azure Marketplace:

     1. Find a module and select **Get it now**.
     1. Acknowledge the provider's terms of use and privacy policy by selecting **Continue**.

1. Choose your subscription and the IoT Hub to which the target device is attached.

1. Choose **Deploy at Scale**.

1. Choose whether to add the module to a new deployment or to a clone of an existing deployment; if cloning, select the existing deployment from the list.

1. Select **Create** to continue the process of creating a deployment at scale. You'll be able to specify the same details as you would for any deployment.

## Monitor a deployment

To view the details of a deployment and monitor the devices running it, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your IoT hub. 
1. Select **IoT Edge**.
1. Select **IoT Edge deployments**. 

   ![View IoT Edge deployments](./media/how-to-deploy-monitor/iot-edge-deployments.png)

1. Inspect the deployment list. For each deployment, you can view the following details:
   * **ID** - the name of the deployment.
   * **Target condition** - the tag used to define targeted devices.
   * **Priority** - the priority number assigned to the deployment.
   * **System metrics** - **Targeted** specifies the number of device twins in IoT Hub that match the targeting condition, and **Applied** specifies the number of devices that have had the deployment content applied to their module twins in IoT Hub. 
   * **Device metrics** - the number of IoT Edge devices in the deployment reporting success or errors from the IoT Edge client runtime.
   * **Custom metrics** - the number of IoT Edge devices in the deployment reporting data for any metrics that you defined for the deployment.
   * **Creation time** - the timestamp from when the deployment was created. This timestamp is used to break ties when two deployments have the same priority. 
1. Select the deployment that you want to monitor.  
1. Inspect the deployment details. You can use tabs to review the details of the deployment.

## Modify a deployment

When you modify a deployment, the changes immediately replicate to all targeted devices. 

If you update the target condition, the following updates occur:

* If a device didn't meet the old target condition, but meets the new target condition and this deployment is the highest priority for that device, then this deployment is applied to the device. 
* If a device currently running this deployment no longer meets the target condition, it uninstalls this deployment and takes on the next highest priority deployment. 
* If a device currently running this deployment no longer meets the target condition and doesn't meet the target condition of any other deployments, then no change occurs on the device. The device continues running its current modules in their current state, but is not managed as part of this deployment anymore. Once it meets the target condition of any other deployment, it uninstalls this deployment and takes on the new one. 

To modify a deployment, use the following steps: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your IoT hub. 
1. Select **IoT Edge**.
1. Select **IoT Edge deployments**. 

   ![View IoT Edge deployments](./media/how-to-deploy-monitor/iot-edge-deployments.png)

1. Select the deployment that you want to modify. 
1. Make updates to the following fields: 
   * Target condition
   * Metrics - you can modify or delete metrics you've defined, or add new ones.
   * Labels
   * Priority
1. Select **Save**.
1. Follow the steps in [Monitor a deployment](#monitor-a-deployment) to watch the changes roll out. 

## Delete a deployment

When you delete a deployment, any devices take on their next highest priority deployment. If your devices don't meet the target condition of any other deployment, then the modules are not removed when the deployment is deleted. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your IoT hub. 
1. Select **IoT Edge**.
1. Select **IoT Edge deployments**. 

   ![View IoT Edge deployments](./media/how-to-deploy-monitor/iot-edge-deployments.png)

1. Use the checkbox to select the deployment that you want to delete. 
1. Select **Delete**.
1. A prompt will inform you that this action will delete this deployment and revert to the previous state for all devices.  This means that a deployment with a lower priority will apply.  If no other deployment is targeted, no modules will be removed. If you want to remove all modules from your device, create a deployment with zero modules and deploy it to the same devices. Select **Yes** to continue.
