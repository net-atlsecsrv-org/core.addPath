# Azure IoT Edge versions and release notes

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](../../includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

Azure IoT Edge is a product built from the open-source IoT Edge project hosted on GitHub. All new releases are made available in the [Azure IoT Edge project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge). Contributions and bug reports can be made on the [open-source IoT Edge project](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge).

## Documented versions

The IoT Edge documentation on this site is available for two different versions of the product, so that you can choose the content that applies to your IoT Edge environment. Currently, the two supported versions are:

* **IoT Edge 1.1 (LTS)** is the first long-term support (LTS) version of IoT Edge. The documentation for this version covers all features and capabilities from all previous versions through 1.1. This documentation version will be stable through the supported lifetime of version 1.1, and will not reflect new features released in later versions. The 1.1 release is the latest generally available version of IoT Edge.
* **IoT Edge 1.2 (preview)** contains additional content for features and capabilities that are in the latest preview release, [1.2-rc4](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases/tag/1.2.0-rc4).

For more information about IoT Edge releases, see [Azure IoT Edge supported systems](support.md).
