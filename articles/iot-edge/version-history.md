# Azure IoT Edge versions and release notes

Azure IoT Edge is a product built from the open-source IoT Edge project hosted on GitHub. All new releases are made available in the [Azure IoT Edge project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge). Contributions and bug reports can be made on the [open-source IoT Edge project](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge).

## Documented versions

The IoT Edge documentation on this site is available for two different versions of the product, so that you can choose the content that applies to your IoT Edge environment. Currently, the two supported versions are:

* **IoT Edge 1.0.10** covers all features and capabilities through the latest generally available release: [1.0.10](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases/tag/1.0.10).
