# Store data at the edge with Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge (preview)

Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge provides a [block blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-block-blobs) storage solution at the edge. A blob storage module on your IoT Edge device behaves like an Azure block blob service, but the block blobs are stored locally on your IoT Edge device. You can access your blobs using the same Azure storage SDK methods or block blob API calls that you're already used to.

This module comes with **deviceToCloudUpload** and **deviceAutoDelete** features.
> [!NOTE]
> Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge is in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

**deviceToCloudUpload** is a configurable functionality, which allows you to automatically upload the data from your local blob storage to Azure with intermittent internet connectivity support. It allows you to:

- Turn ON/OFF the deviceToCloudUpload feature.
- Choose the order in which the data is copied to Azure like NewestFirst or OldestFirst.
- Specify the Azure Storage account to which you want your data uploaded.
- Specify the containers you want to upload to Azure. This module allows you to specify both source and target container names.
- Choose the ability to delete the blobs immediately, after upload to cloud storage is finished
- Do full blob upload (using `Put Blob` operation) and block level upload (using `Put Block` and `Put Block List` operations).

This module uses block level upload, when your blob consists of blocks. Here are some of the common scenarios:

- Your application updates some blocks of a previously uploaded blob, this module uploads only the updated blocks and not the whole blob.
- The module is uploading blob and internet connection goes away, when the connectivity is back again it uploads only the remaining blocks and not the whole blob.

If an unexpected process termination (like power failure) happens during a blob upload, all blocks that were due for the upload will be uploaded again, when the module comes back online.

**deviceAutoDelete** is a configurable functionality where the module automatically deletes your blobs from the local storage when the specified duration (measured in minutes) expires. It allows you to:

- Turn ON/OFF the deviceAutoDelete feature.
- Specify the time in minutes (deleteAfterMinutes) after which the blobs will be automatically deleted.
- Choose the ability to retain the blob while it is uploading if deleteAfterMinutes value expires.

Scenarios where data like videos, images, finance data, hospital data, or any data that needs to be stored locally, later that could be processed locally or transferred to the cloud are good examples to use this module.

This article explains the concepts related to Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge container that runs a blob service on your IoT Edge device.

## Prerequisites

An Azure IoT Edge device:

- You can use your development machine or a virtual machine as an IoT Edge device by following the steps in the quickstart for [Linux](quickstart-linux.md) or [Windows devices](quickstart.md).

- The Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge module supports the following device configurations:

  | Operating system | AMD64 | ARM32v7 | ARM64 |
  | ---------------- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
  | Raspbian-stretch | No | Yes | No |  
  | Ubuntu Server 16.04 | Yes | No | Yes (available to [install](how-to-install-iot-edge-linux-arm.md#install-a-specific-version) with [Azure IoT Edge 1.0.8-rc1 and later](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases)) |
  | Ubuntu Server 18.04 | Yes | No | Yes (available to [install](how-to-install-iot-edge-linux-arm.md#install-a-specific-version) with [Azure IoT Edge 1.0.8-rc1 and later](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases)) |
  | Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, build 17763 | Yes | No | No |
  | Windows Server 2019, build 17763 | Yes | No | No |
  

Cloud resources:

A standard-tier [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in Azure.

## deviceToCloudUpload and deviceAutoDelete properties

Use desired properties to set deviceToCloudUploadProperties and deviceAutoDeleteProperties. They can be set during deployment or changed later by editing the module twin without the need to redeploy. We recommend checking the "Module Twin" for `reported configuration` and `configurationValidation` to make sure values are correctly propagated.

### deviceToCloudUploadProperties

The name of this setting is `deviceToCloudUploadProperties`

| Field | Possible Values | Explanation | Environment variable |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| uploadOn | true, false | By default it is set to `false`, if you want to turn it On set it to `true`| `deviceToCloudUploadProperties__uploadOn={false,true}` |
| uploadOrder | NewestFirst, OldestFirst | Allows you to choose the order in which the data is copied to Azure. By default it is set to `OldestFirst`. The order is determined by last modified time of Blob | `deviceToCloudUploadProperties__uploadOrder={NewestFirst,OldestFirst}` |
| cloudStorageConnectionString |  | `"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<your Azure Storage Account Name>;AccountKey=<your Azure Storage Account Key>;EndpointSuffix=<your end point suffix>"` is a connection string that allows you to specify the Azure Storage account to which you want your data uploaded. Specify `Azure Storage Account Name`, `Azure Storage Account Key`, `End point suffix`. Add appropriate EndpointSuffix of Azure where data will be uploaded, it varies for Global Azure, Government Azure, and Microsoft Azure Stack. | `deviceToCloudUploadProperties__cloudStorageConnectionString=<connection string>` |
| storageContainersForUpload | `"<source container name1>": {"target": "<target container name>"}`,<br><br> `"<source container name1>": {"target": "%h-%d-%m-%c"}`, <br><br> `"<source container name1>": {"target": "%d-%c"}` | Allows you to Specify the container names you want to upload to Azure. This module allows you to specify both source and target container names. If you don't specify the target container name, it will automatically assign the container name as `<IoTHubName>-<IotEdgeDeviceID>-<ModuleName>-<SourceContainerName>`. You can create template strings for target container name, check out the possible values column. <br>* %h -> IoT Hub Name (3-50 characters). <br>* %d -> IoT Edge Device ID (1 to 129 characters). <br>* %m -> Module Name (1 to 64 characters). <br>* %c -> Source Container Name (3 to 63 characters). <br><br>Maximum size of the container name is 63 characters, while automatically assigning the target container name if the size of container exceeds 63 characters it will trim each section (IoTHubName, IotEdgeDeviceID, ModuleName, SourceContainerName) to 15 characters. | `deviceToCloudUploadProperties__storageContainersForUpload__<sourceName>__target: <targetName>` |
| deleteAfterUpload | true, false | By default it is set to `false`. When it is set to `true`, it will automatically delete the data when upload to cloud storage is finished | `deviceToCloudUploadProperties__deleteAfterUpload={false,true}` |


### deviceAutoDeleteProperties

The name of this setting is `deviceAutoDeleteProperties`

| Field | Possible Values | Explanation | Environment variable |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| deleteOn | true, false | By default it is set to `false`, if you want to turn it On set it to `true`| `deviceAutoDeleteProperties__deleteOn={false,true}` |
| deleteAfterMinutes | `<minutes>` | Specify the time in minutes. The module will automatically delete your blobs from local storage when this value expires | `deviceAutoDeleteProperties__ deleteAfterMinutes=<minutes>` |
| retainWhileUploading | true, false | By default it is set to `true`, and it will retain the blob while it is uploading to cloud storage if deleteAfterMinutes expires. You can set it to `false` and it will delete the data as soon as deleteAfterMinutes expires. Note: For this property to work uploadOn should be set to true| `deviceAutoDeleteProperties__retainWhileUploading={false,true}` |

## Configure log files

For information on configuring log files for your module, see these [production best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/production-checklist#set-up-logs-and-diagnostics).

## Connect to your blob storage module

You can use the account name and account key that you configured for your module to access the blob storage on your IoT Edge device.

Specify your IoT Edge device as the blob endpoint for any storage requests that you make to it. You can [Create a connection string for an explicit storage endpoint](../storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string.md#create-a-connection-string-for-an-explicit-storage-endpoint) using the IoT Edge device information and the account name that you configured.

- For modules that are deployed on the same device as where the Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge module is running, the blob endpoint is: `http://<module name>:11002/<account name>`.
- For external modules or applications that are running on a different device than where the Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge module is running, then depending upon your network setup, such that the data traffic from your external module or application can reach the device running the Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge module, the blob endpoint is one of:
  - `http://<device IP >:11002/<account name>`
  - `http://<IoT Edge device hostname>:11002/<account name>`
  - `http://<fully qualified domain name>:11002/<account name>`

## Azure Blob Storage quickstart samples

The Azure Blob Storage documentation includes quickstart sample code in several languages. You can run these samples to test Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge by changing the blob endpoint to connect to your local blob storage module.

The following quickstart samples use languages that are also supported by IoT Edge, so you could deploy them as IoT Edge modules alongside the blob storage module:

- [.NET](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet.md)
- [Java](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-java.md)
- [Python](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python.md)
- [Node.js](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-nodejs.md)

## Connect to your local storage with Azure Storage Explorer

You can use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) to connect to your local storage account.

1. Download and install Azure Storage Explorer

1. Connect to Azure Storage using a connection string

1. Provide connection string: `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=http://<host device name>:11002/<your local account name>;AccountName=<your local account name>;AccountKey=<your local account key>;`

1. Go through the steps to connect.

1. Create container inside your local storage account

1. Start uploading files as Block blobs.
   > [!NOTE]
   > This module does not support Page blobs.

1. You can choose to connect your Azure storage accounts where you are uploading the data. It gives you a single view for both your local storage account and Azure storage account
