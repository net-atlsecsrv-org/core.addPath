# Create an assignment and allocate credit

After you've set up a course and created a classroom in the Microsoft Azure Education Hub, you're asked to create an assignment where you will allocate credit and invite selected students to your course.

## Prerequisites

- An academic grant with an approved credit amount
- A classroom created in the Azure Education Hub
- An work or school account and a subscription within the classroom that will access your Azure credit

### Accounts

The Azure Education Hub accepts any email address in the _____@___.___ format. It
does *not* currently check for a valid account in your organization or whether the
Microsoft account is current or valid. Carefully check each email address before
continuing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work and school accounts are subject to their own policies, including whether an email
address from a domain other than the organization is permitted (for example, adding
student2@outlook.com to the @school.edu domain). Be sure to check these
policies before adding new users.

When a work or school account (for example, student1@school.edu) is added by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) in the Educator Sponsor Portal or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Azure automatically sends email to the recipient. This email requires the user to accept the new account and Azure role prior to receiving access to the subscription. If you're a course teaching assistant (TA) or professor, be sure to inform students of this so that their subscription displays in the Azure portal as expected. The email should look similar to this:

## Create an assignment and invite students to the course

1. Choose the amount of funds to credit to the student's subscription. If not all students will receive the same amount, you can select **Change** and apply a custom amount to each student or project group.

1. Select **Create assignment**.
1. (Optional) You can also remove existing students by clicking **Remove** next to the student's name.
1. Select the **Close** button when finished. The additional permissions appear on the Sponsor Credit Management page.
