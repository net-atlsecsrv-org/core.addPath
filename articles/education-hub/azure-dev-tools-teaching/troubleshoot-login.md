# Troubleshooting student login issues
Accessing Azure Dev Tools for Teaching requires a user to have a Microsoft Account (MSA). Students will be automatically directed to create an MSA if their account is not already an MSA or linked to an MSA. If your domain is associated with Active Directory, all accounts under that domain are already considered an MSA.

If a student tries to log in and receives the following error message, use one of the solutions described below.

There are two solutions: create a new Microsoft account or use an existing Microsoft account.

## Create a new Microsoft account
### Use a university email address
If you're logging in with a university email address (for example, `John.Smith@university.edu`), you'll need to create a Microsoft account with that email address. Creating an account is free and takes just a few minutes. Having a Microsoft account will allow you to automatically log into all your Microsoft products with a single username and password.

### Use a personal email address
If you're logging in with a personal email address (for example, `John.Smith@email.com`) but also have a university email address, try using the university email address. If you previously logged into your institution's webstore with a personal email address or do not have a university email address, you'll need to create or link a Microsoft account with your personal email address.

## Use an existing Microsoft account
If a student has an existing Microsoft account (for example, Xbox), they can connect that account to an Azure Dev Tools account.

1. Go to https://account.microsoft.com.
1. Log in with your Microsoft account credentials.
1. Select **Your info** from the top ribbon menu.

1. Click **Manage how you sign into Microsoft**. You'll be asked to verify your identity. You'll be emailed a security code.

1. Click **Add email** to your account and enter your university email address.
The next time you sign in, you can use your university email address to access your Azure Dev Tools for Teaching.
