# Frequently asked questions about the Education Hub

This article addresses frequent questions about Azure for Students, Azure for Students Starter, and Azure Dev Tools for Teaching.

## Azure for Students

### What happens after I use my $100 credit or I'm at the end of 12 months?

After you exhaust your available credit or reach the end of 12 months, your Azure subscription becomes disabled. To continue using [Azure](https://account.azure.com/), you may upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription in the Azure Account portal. To get detailed terms of use for Azure for Students, please visit the [offer terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0170p/).

### Can I get Azure for Students again next year?

Thank you for your interest in Azure for Students! We're glad that you've enjoyed using it. At this time, we are not announcing renewals. Check back here for updates.

### What are subscriptions, and how do they relate to Azure for Students?

Subscriptions provide access to Azure services. Azure for Students gives you $100 credit for 12 months. It includes access to more than 25 free services, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure services at the end of 12 months or after you've exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, you must upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

### What happens with my Azure services if I don't upgrade?

If you decide not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you've exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, any products you've deployed are decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. You have 90 days from the end of your free subscription to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

### How do I know how much of the $100 credit I have left?

You can see your remaining credit on the [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).
