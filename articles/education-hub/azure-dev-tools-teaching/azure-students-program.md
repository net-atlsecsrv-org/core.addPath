# Azure for Students

Through the Azure Dev Tools for Teaching program, students who have a current and active Azure for Students 
subscription can download certain software developer tools for free. Azure for Students provides access to all 
Azure products that are expressly intended to support education or teaching, non-commercial research, or 
efforts to design, develop, test, and demonstrate software applications for these purposes. Students download 
the tools from the Azure Education Hub.

Azure for Students provides you with a $100 credit for 12 months. It includes access to more than 25 free 
services, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are 
deducted from the credit. You can see your remaining credit on the [Azure Sponsorships 
portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).

After you exhaust your available credit or reach the end of 12 months, your Azure subscription becomes 
disabled. The Azure for Students subscription is not renewable. To continue using Azure, you may upgrade 
to a pay-as-you-go subscription in the [Azure Account portal](https://account.azure.com/). If you decide 
not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you've exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, 
any products you've deployed are decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. You have 90 days 
from the end of your free subscription to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.
