# What is Azure Dev Tools for Teaching?

Microsoft Azure Dev Tools for Teaching puts professional developer tools, software, and services
from Microsoft in the hands of faculty and students with low-cost subscriptions. Students
receive developer tools at no cost--everything needed to create apps, games, and websites--so 
they can chase their dreams, create the next big breakthrough in technology, or get a head 
start on their career.

As an administrator of the Azure Dev Tools for Teaching subscription, you'll be able to:

- Manage and access software through a centralized online location that eliminates the
need to maintain a WebStore or an internal site.

- Give academic users access to software, free training/learning materials, and the
Azure cloud platform through the same online portal.

## Program details

We designed Azure Dev Tools for Teaching for STEM-focused instruction. Any course curriculum 
focused on science, technology, engineering, or mathematics is eligible to
use Azure Dev Tools for Teaching to help professors teach and students learn more effectively. 

Your Microsoft Azure Dev Tools for Teaching subscription provides you with access to certain software 
developer tools. These tools are available to download for free. If you're a faculty member is enrolled 
in an approved course, you're eligible to install Azure Dev Tools for Teaching software onto your 
personal computer for non-commercial use.

Azure Dev Tools for Teaching is available in the more than 140 countries/regions where Azure is 
commercially available. The Education Hub Store is available in the following languages: Arabic, 
Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, 
Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.

## Student benefits

All software is accessible through an [Education Hub](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools) 
(built into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)) that houses all products and services available 
to academic users. Students access software by simply logging in to the Azure portal with the same 
credentials they use to access their Imagine subscription.

Students don't need to sign up for an Azure subscription to access their software benefits. However, 
Microsoft does offer USD$100 in Azure credit plus access to free Azure services for students: students 
can sign up for the [Azure for Students offer](azure-students-program.md) without needing a credit card.
