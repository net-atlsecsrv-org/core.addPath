This example creates a primitive DMZ with four Windows servers and Network Security Groups. This example describes each of the relevant PowerShell commands to provide a deeper understanding of each step. There is also a Traffic Scenario section to provide an in-depth step-by-step how traffic proceeds through the layers of defense in the DMZ. Finally, in the references section is the complete code and instruction to build this environment to test and experiment with various scenarios. 

![Inbound DMZ with NSG][1]

## Environment description
In this example a subscription contains the following resources:

* Two cloud services: “FrontEnd001” and “BackEnd001”
* A Virtual Network, “CorpNetwork”, with two subnets; “FrontEnd” and “BackEnd”
* A Network Security Group that is applied to both subnets
* A Windows Server that represents an application web server (“IIS01”)
* Two windows servers that represent application back-end servers (“AppVM01”, “AppVM02”)
* A Windows server that represents a DNS server (“DNS01”)

In the references section, there is a PowerShell script that builds most of the environment described in this example. Building the VMs and Virtual Networks, although are done by the example script, are not described in detail in this document. 

To build the environment;

1. Save the network config xml file included in the references section (updated with names, location, and IP addresses to match the given scenario)
2. Update the user variables in the script to match the environment the script is to be run against (subscriptions, service names, etc.)
3. Execute the script in PowerShell

>[!Note]
>The region signified in the PowerShell script must match the region signified in the network configuration xml file.
>
>

Once the script runs successfully additional optional steps may be taken, in the references section are two scripts to set up the web server and app server with a simple web application to allow testing with this DMZ configuration.

The following sections provide a detailed description of Network Security Groups and how they function for this example by walking through key lines of the PowerShell script.

## Network Security Groups (NSG)
For this example, an NSG group is built and then loaded with six rules. 

> [!TIP]
> Generally speaking, you should create your specific “Allow” rules first and then the more generic “Deny” rules last. The assigned priority dictates which rules are evaluated first. Once traffic is found to apply to a specific rule, no further rules are evaluated. NSG rules can apply in either in the inbound or outbound direction (from the perspective of the subnet).
> 
> 

Declaratively, the following rules are being built for inbound traffic:

1. Internal DNS traffic (port 53) is allowed
2. RDP traffic (port 3389) from the Internet to any VM is allowed
3. HTTP traffic (port 80) from the Internet to web server (IIS01) is allowed
4. Any traffic (all ports) from IIS01 to AppVM1 is allowed
5. Any traffic (all ports) from the Internet to the entire VNet (both subnets) is Denied
6. Any traffic (all ports) from the Frontend subnet to the Backend subnet is Denied

With these rules bound to each subnet, if an HTTP request was inbound from the Internet to the web server, both rules 3 (allow) and 5 (deny) would apply, but since rule 3 has a higher priority only it would apply and rule 5 would not come into play. Thus the HTTP request would be allowed to the web server. If that same traffic was trying to reach the DNS01 server, rule 5 (Deny) would be the first to apply and the traffic would not be allowed to pass to the server. Rule 6 (Deny) blocks the Frontend subnet from talking to the Backend subnet (except for allowed traffic in rules 1 and 4), this rule-set protects the Backend network in case an attacker compromises the web application on the Frontend, the attacker would have limited access to the Backend “protected” network (only to resources exposed on the AppVM01 server).

There is a default outbound rule that allows traffic out to the internet. For this example, we’re allowing outbound traffic and not modifying any outbound rules. To lock down traffic in both directions, User Defined Routing is required and is explored in “Example 3” on the [Security Boundary Best Practices Page][HOME].

Each rule is discussed in more detail as follows (**Note**: any item in the following list beginning with a dollar sign (for example: $NSGName) is a user-defined variable from the script in the reference section of this document):

1. First a Network Security Group must be built to hold the rules:

	```PowerShell
	New-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName `
	    -Location $DeploymentLocation `
	    -Label "Security group for $VNetName subnets in $DeploymentLocation"
    ```

2. The first rule in this example allows DNS traffic between all internal networks to the DNS server on the backend subnet. The rule has some important parameters:
   
   * “Type” signifies in which direction of traffic flow this rule takes effect. The direction is from the perspective of the subnet or Virtual Machine (depending on where this NSG is bound). Thus if Type is “Inbound” and traffic is entering the subnet, the rule would apply and traffic leaving the subnet would not be affected by this rule.
   * “Priority” sets the order in which a traffic flow is evaluated. The lower the number the higher the priority. When a rule applies to a specific traffic flow, no further rules are processed. Thus if a rule with priority 1 allows traffic, and a rule with priority 2 denies traffic, and both rules apply to traffic then the traffic would be allowed to flow (since rule 1 had a higher priority it took effect and no further rules were applied).
   * “Action” signifies if traffic affected by this rule is blocked or allowed.

     ```PowerShell    
     Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName | `
	    Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule -Name "Enable Internal DNS" `
	    -Type Inbound -Priority 100 -Action Allow `
	    -SourceAddressPrefix VIRTUAL_NETWORK -SourcePortRange '*' `
	    -DestinationAddressPrefix $VMIP[4] `
	    -DestinationPortRange '53' `
	    -Protocol *
     ```

3. This rule allows RDP traffic to flow from the internet to the RDP port on any server on the bound subnet. This rule uses two special types of address prefixes; “VIRTUAL_NETWORK” and “INTERNET.” These tags are an easy way to address a larger category of address prefixes.

	```PowerShell
    Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName | `
         Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule -Name "Enable RDP to $VNetName VNet" `
         -Type Inbound -Priority 110 -Action Allow `
         -SourceAddressPrefix INTERNET -SourcePortRange '*' `
         -DestinationAddressPrefix VIRTUAL_NETWORK `
         -DestinationPortRange '3389' `
         -Protocol *
    ```

4. This rule allows inbound internet traffic to hit the web server. This rule does not change the routing behavior. The rule only allows traffic destined for IIS01 to pass. Thus if traffic from the Internet had the web server as its destination this rule would allow it and stop processing further rules. (In the rule at priority 140 all other inbound internet traffic is blocked). If you're only processing HTTP traffic, this rule could be further restricted to only allow Destination Port 80.

	```PowerShell
    Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName | `
         Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule -Name "Enable Internet to $VMName[0]" `
         -Type Inbound -Priority 120 -Action Allow `
         -SourceAddressPrefix Internet -SourcePortRange '*' `
         -DestinationAddressPrefix $VMIP[0] `
         -DestinationPortRange '*' `
         -Protocol *
    ```

5. This rule allows traffic to pass from the IIS01 server to the AppVM01 server, a later rule blocks all other Frontend to Backend traffic. To improve this rule, if the port is known that should be added. For example, if the IIS server is hitting only SQL Server on AppVM01, the Destination Port Range should be changed from “*” (Any) to 1433 (the SQL port) thus allowing a smaller inbound attack surface on AppVM01 should the web application ever be compromised.

	```PowerShell
    Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName | `
        Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule -Name "Enable $VMName[1] to $VMName[2]" `
        -Type Inbound -Priority 130 -Action Allow `
		-SourceAddressPrefix $VMIP[1] -SourcePortRange '*' `
     	-DestinationAddressPrefix $VMIP[2] `
     	-DestinationPortRange '*' `
     	-Protocol *
    ```

6. This rule denies traffic from the internet to any servers on the network. With the rules at priority 110 and 120, the effect is to allow only inbound internet traffic to the firewall and RDP ports on servers and blocks everything else. This rule is a "fail-safe" rule to block all unexpected flows.
	```PowerShell
    Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName | `
    	Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule `
        -Name "Isolate the $VNetName VNet from the Internet" `
        -Type Inbound -Priority 140 -Action Deny `
        -SourceAddressPrefix INTERNET -SourcePortRange '*' `
        -DestinationAddressPrefix VIRTUAL_NETWORK `
        -DestinationPortRange '*' `
        -Protocol *
    ```
7. The final rule denies traffic from the Frontend subnet to the Backend subnet. Since this rule is an Inbound only rule, reverse traffic is allowed (from the Backend to the Frontend).

	```PowerShell
    Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $NSGName | `
		Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule `
		-Name "Isolate the $FESubnet subnet from the $BESubnet subnet" `
        -Type Inbound -Priority 150 -Action Deny `
        -SourceAddressPrefix $FEPrefix -SourcePortRange '*' `
        -DestinationAddressPrefix $BEPrefix `
        -DestinationPortRange '*' `
        -Protocol * 
    ```

## Traffic scenarios
#### (*Allowed*) Internet to web server
1. An internet user requests an HTTP page from FrontEnd001.CloudApp.Net (Internet Facing Cloud Service)
2. Cloud service passes traffic through open endpoint on port 80 towards IIS01 (the web server)
3. Frontend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   1. NSG Rule 1 (DNS) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   2. NSG Rule 2 (RDP) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   3. NSG Rule 3 (Internet to IIS01) does apply, traffic is allowed, stop rule processing
4. Traffic hits internal IP address of the web server IIS01 (10.0.1.5)
5. IIS01 is listening for web traffic, receives this request and starts processing the request
6. IIS01 asks the SQL Server on AppVM01 for information
7. Since there are no outbound rules on Frontend subnet, traffic is allowed
8. The Backend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   1. NSG Rule 1 (DNS) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   2. NSG Rule 2 (RDP) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   3. NSG Rule 3 (Internet to Firewall) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   4. NSG Rule 4 (IIS01 to AppVM01) does apply, traffic is allowed, stop rule processing
9. AppVM01 receives the SQL Query and responds
10. Since there are no outbound rules on the Backend subnet, the response is allowed
11. Frontend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
    1. There is no NSG rule that applies to Inbound traffic from the Backend subnet to the Frontend subnet, so none of the NSG rules apply
    2. The default system rule allowing traffic between subnets would allow this traffic so the traffic is allowed.
12. The IIS server receives the SQL response and completes the HTTP response and sends to the requestor
13. Since there are no outbound rules on the Frontend subnet the response is allowed, and the internet User receives the web page requested.

#### (*Allowed*) RDP to backend
1. Server Admin on internet requests RDP session to AppVM01 on BackEnd001.CloudApp.Net:xxxxx where xxxxx is the randomly assigned port number for RDP to AppVM01 (the assigned port can be found on the Azure portal or via PowerShell)
2. Backend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   1. NSG Rule 1 (DNS) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   2. NSG Rule 2 (RDP) does apply, traffic is allowed, stop rule processing
3. With no outbound rules, default rules apply and return traffic is allowed
4. RDP session is enabled
5. AppVM01 prompts for the user name and password

#### (*Allowed*) Web server DNS look-up on DNS server
1. Web Server, IIS01, needs a data feed at www.data.gov, but needs to resolve the address.
2. The network configuration for the VNet lists DNS01 (10.0.2.4 on the Backend subnet) as the primary DNS server, IIS01 sends the DNS request to DNS01
3. No outbound rules on Frontend subnet, traffic is allowed
4. Backend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   * NSG Rule 1 (DNS) does apply, traffic is allowed, stop rule processing
5. DNS server receives the request
6. DNS server doesn’t have the address cached and asks a root DNS server on the internet
7. No outbound rules on Backend subnet, traffic is allowed
8. Internet DNS server responds, since this session was initiated internally, the response is allowed
9. DNS server caches the response, and responds to the initial request back to IIS01
10. No outbound rules on Backend subnet, traffic is allowed
11. Frontend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
    1. There is no NSG rule that applies to Inbound traffic from the Backend subnet to the Frontend subnet, so none of the NSG rules apply
    2. The default system rule allowing traffic between subnets would allow this traffic so the traffic is allowed
12. IIS01 receives the response from DNS01

#### (*Allowed*) Web server access file on AppVM01
1. IIS01 asks for a file on AppVM01
2. No outbound rules on Frontend subnet, traffic is allowed
3. The Backend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   1. NSG Rule 1 (DNS) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   2. NSG Rule 2 (RDP) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   3. NSG Rule 3 (Internet to IIS01) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   4. NSG Rule 4 (IIS01 to AppVM01) does apply, traffic is allowed, stop rule processing
4. AppVM01 receives the request and responds with file (assuming access is authorized)
5. Since there are no outbound rules on the Backend subnet, the response is allowed
6. Frontend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   1. There is no NSG rule that applies to Inbound traffic from the Backend subnet to the Frontend subnet, so none of the NSG rules apply
   2. The default system rule allowing traffic between subnets would allow this traffic so the traffic is allowed.
7. The IIS server receives the file

#### (*Denied*) Web to backend server
1. An internet user tries to access a file on AppVM01 through the BackEnd001.CloudApp.Net service
2. Since there are no endpoints open for file share, this traffic would not pass the Cloud Service and wouldn’t reach the server
3. If the endpoints were open for some reason, NSG rule 5 (Internet to VNet) would block this traffic

#### (*Denied*) Web DNS look-up on DNS server
1. An internet user tries to look up an internal DNS record on DNS01 through the BackEnd001.CloudApp.Net service
2. Since there are no endpoints open for DNS, this traffic would not pass the Cloud Service and wouldn’t reach the server
3. If the endpoints were open for some reason, NSG rule 5 (Internet to VNet) would block this traffic (Note: that Rule 1 (DNS) would not apply for two reasons, first the source address is the internet, this rule only applies to the local VNet as the source, also this rule is an Allow rule, so it would never deny traffic)

#### (*Denied*) Web to SQL access through firewall
1. An internet user requests SQL data from FrontEnd001.CloudApp.Net (Internet Facing Cloud Service)
2. Since there are no endpoints open for SQL, this traffic would not pass the Cloud Service and wouldn’t reach the firewall
3. If endpoints were open for some reason, the Frontend subnet begins inbound rule processing:
   1. NSG Rule 1 (DNS) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   2. NSG Rule 2 (RDP) doesn’t apply, move to next rule
   3. NSG Rule 3 (Internet to IIS01) does apply, traffic is allowed, stop rule processing
4. Traffic hits internal IP address of the IIS01 (10.0.1.5)
5. IIS01 isn't listening on port 1433, so no response to the request

## Conclusion
This example is a relatively simple and straight forward way of isolating the back-end subnet from inbound traffic.

 .SYNOPSIS
  Example of Network Security Groups in an isolated network (Azure only, no hybrid connections)

 .DESCRIPTION
  This script will build out a sample DMZ setup containing:
   - A default storage account for VM disks
   - Two new cloud services
   - Two Subnets (FrontEnd and BackEnd subnets)
   - One server on the FrontEnd Subnet
   - Three Servers on the BackEnd Subnet
   - Network Security Groups to allow/deny traffic patterns as declared

  Before running script, ensure the network configuration file is created in
  the directory referenced by $NetworkConfigFile variable (or update the
  variable to reflect the path and file name of the config file being used).

 .Notes
  Security requirements are different for each use case and can be addressed in a
  myriad of ways. Please be sure that any sensitive data or applications are behind
  the appropriate layer(s) of protection. This script serves as an example of some
  of the techniques that can be used, but should not be used for all scenarios. You
  are responsible to assess your security needs and the appropriate protections
  needed, and then effectively implement those protections.
