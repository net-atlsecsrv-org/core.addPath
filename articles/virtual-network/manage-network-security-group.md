# Create, change, or delete a network security group

Security rules in network security groups enable you to filter the type of network traffic that can flow in and out of virtual network subnets and network interfaces. To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](security-overview.md). Next, complete the [Filter network traffic](tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md) tutorial to gain some experience with network security groups.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

If you don't have one, set up an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio). Complete one of these tasks before starting the remainder of this article:

- **Portal users**: Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

- **PowerShell users**: Either run the commands in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell), or run PowerShell from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. In the Azure Cloud Shell browser tab, find the **Select environment** dropdown list, then pick **PowerShell** if it isn't already selected.

    If you're running PowerShell locally, use Azure PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az.Network` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). Run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

- **Azure Command-line interface (CLI) users**: Either run the commands in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash), or run the CLI from your computer. Use Azure CLI version 2.0.28 or later if you're running the Azure CLI locally. Run `az --version` to find the installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

The account you log into, or connect to Azure with must be assigned to the [Network contributor role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) or to a [Custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) that's assigned the appropriate actions listed in [Permissions](#permissions).

### Create a security rule

There's a limit to how many rules per network security group you can create for each Azure location and subscription. To learn more, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to view your network security groups. Search for and select **Network security groups**.

2. Select the name of the network security group you want to add a security rule to.

3. In the network security group's menu bar, choose **Inbound security rules** or **Outbound security rules**.

    Several existing rules are listed, including some you may not have added. When you create a network security group, several default security rules are created in it. To learn more, see [default security rules](security-overview.md#default-security-rules).  You can't delete default security rules, but you can override them with rules that have a higher priority.

4. <a name="security-rule-settings"></a>Select **Add**. Select or add values for the following settings, and then select **OK**:

    | Setting | Value | Details |
    | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | **Source** | One of:<ul><li>**Any**</li><li>**IP Addresses**</li><li>**Service Tag** (inbound security rule) or **VirtualNetwork** (outbound security rule)</li><li>**Application&nbsp;security&nbsp;group**</li></ul> | <p>If you choose **IP Addresses**, you must also specify **Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges**.</p><p>If you choose **Service Tag**, you may also pick a **Source service tag**.</p><p>If you choose **Application security group**, you must also pick an existing application security group. If you choose **Application security group** for both **Source** and **Destination**, the network interfaces within both application security groups must be in the same virtual network.</p> |
    | **Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges** | A comma-delimited list of IP addresses and Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) ranges | <p>This setting appears if you change **Source** to **IP Addresses**. You must specify a single value or comma-separated list of multiple values. An example of multiple values is `10.0.0.0/16, 192.188.1.1`. There are limits to the number of values you can specify. For more details, see [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).</p><p>If the IP address you specify is assigned to an Azure VM, specify its private IP address, not its public IP address. Azure processes security rules after it translates the public IP address to a private IP address for inbound security rules, but before it translates a private IP address to a public IP address for outbound rules. To learn more about public and private IP addresses in Azure, see [IP address types](virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md).</p> |
    | **Source service tag** | A service tag from the dropdown list | This optional setting appears if you set **Source** to **Service Tag** for an inbound security rule. A service tag is a predefined identifier for a category of IP addresses. To learn more about available service tags, and what each tag represents, see [Service tags](security-overview.md#service-tags). |
    | **Source application security group** | An existing application security group | This setting appears if you set **Source** to **Application security group**. Select an application security group that exists in the same region as the network interface. Learn how to [create an application security group](#create-an-application-security-group). |
    | **Source port ranges** | One of:<ul><li>A single port, such as `80`</li><li>A range of ports, such as `1024-65535`</li><li>A comma-separated list of single ports and/or port ranges, such as `80, 1024-65535`</li><li>An asterisk (`*`) to allow traffic on any port</li></ul> | This setting specifies the ports on which the rule allows or denies traffic. There are limits to the number of ports you can specify. For more details, see [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits). |
    | **Destination** | One of:<ul><li>**Any**</li><li>**IP Addresses**</li><li>**Service Tag** (outbound security rule) or **VirtualNetwork** (inbound security rule)</li><li>**Application&nbsp;security&nbsp;group**</li></ul> | <p>If you choose **IP addresses**, then also specify **Destination IP addresses/CIDR ranges**.</p><p>If you choose **VirtualNetwork**, traffic is allowed to all IP addresses within the virtual network's address space. **VirtualNetwork** is a service tag.</p><p>If you select **Application security group**, you must then select an existing application security group. Learn how to [create an application security group](#create-an-application-security-group).</p> |
    | **Destination IP addresses/CIDR ranges** | A comma-delimited list of IP addresses and CIDR ranges | <p>This setting appears if you change **Destination** to **IP Addresses**. Similar to **Source** and **Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges**, you can specify single or multiple addresses or ranges. There are limits to the number you can specify. For more details, see [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).</p><p>If the IP address you specify is assigned to an Azure VM, ensure that you specify its private IP, not its public IP address. Azure processes security rules after it translates the public IP address to a private IP address for inbound security rules, but before Azure translates a private IP address to a public IP address for outbound rules. To learn more about public and private IP addresses in Azure, see [IP address types](virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md).</p> |
    | **Destination service tag** | A service tag from the dropdown list | This optional setting appears if you change **Destination** to **Service Tag** for an outbound security rule. A service tag is a predefined identifier for a category of IP addresses. To learn more about available service tags, and what each tag represents, see [Service tags](security-overview.md#service-tags). |
    | **Destination application security group** | An existing application security group | This setting appears if you set **Destination** to **Application security group**. Select an application security group that exists in the same region as the network interface. Learn how to [create an application security group](#create-an-application-security-group). |
    | **Destination port ranges** | One of:<ul><li>A single port, such as `80`</li><li>A range of ports, such as `1024-65535`</li><li>A comma-separated list of single ports and/or port ranges, such as `80, 1024-65535`</li><li>An asterisk (`*`) to allow traffic on any port</li></ul> | As with **Source port ranges**, you can specify single or multiple ports and ranges. There are limits to the number you can specify. For more details, see [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits). |
    | **Protocol** | **Any**, **TCP**, **UDP**, or **ICMP** | You may restrict the rule to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), or Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). The default is for the rule to apply to all protocols. |
    | **Action** | **Allow** or **Deny** | This setting specifies whether this rule allows or denies access for the supplied source and destination configuration. |
    | **Priority** | A value between 100 and 4096 that's unique for all security rules within the network security group | Azure processes security rules in priority order. The lower the number, the higher the priority. We recommend that you leave a gap between priority numbers when you create rules, such as 100, 200, and 300. Leaving gaps makes it easier to add rules in the future, so that you can give them higher or lower priority than existing rules. |
    | **Name** | A unique name for the rule within the network security group | The name can be up to 80 characters. It must begin with a letter or number, and it must end with a letter, number, or underscore. The name may contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, or hyphens. |
    | **Description** | A text description | You may optionally specify a text description for the security rule. |
