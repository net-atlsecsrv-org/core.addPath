# Configure routing preference for a public IP address using Azure PowerShell

This article shows you how to configure routing preference via ISP network (**Internet** option) for a public IP address using Azure PowerShell. After creating the public IP address, you can associate it with the following Azure resources for inbound and outbound traffic to the internet:

* Virtual machine
* Virtual machine scale set
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Internet-facing load balancer
* Application Gateway
* Azure Firewall

By default, the routing preference for public IP address is set to the Microsoft global network for all Azure services and can be associated with any Azure service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Routing preference is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) now.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]
If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 6.9.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Register the feature for your subscription
The Routing Preference feature is currently in preview. Register the feature for your subscription as follows:
```azurepowershell
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowRoutingPreferenceFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
```

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.Resources/New-azResourceGroup). This example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```azurepowershell
$rg = New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location EastUS
```

## Create a Public IP with Internet routing preference

The following command creates a new public IP with a routing preference type as *Internet* in the *East US* Azure region:

```azurepowershell
$iptagtype="RoutingPreference"
$tagName = "Internet"
$ipTag = New-AzPublicIpTag -IpTagType $iptagtype -Tag $tagName 
# attach the tag
$publicIp = New-AzPublicIpAddress  `
-Name "MyPublicIP" `
-ResourceGroupName $rg.ResourceGroupName `
-Location $rg.Location `
-IpTag $ipTag `
-AllocationMethod Static `
-Sku Standard `
-IpAddressVersion IPv4
```

You can associate the above created public IP address with a [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) virtual machine. Use the CLI section on the tutorial page: [Associate a public IP address to a virtual machine](associate-public-ip-address-vm.md#azure-cli) to associate the Public IP to your VM. You can also associate the public IP address created above with with an [Azure Load Balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md), by assigning it to the load balancer **frontend** configuration. The public IP address serves as a load-balanced virtual IP address (VIP).

## Clean up resources

If no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```
