# Azure security baseline for Virtual Network NAT

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Microsoft Virtual Network NAT. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Virtual Network NAT. **Controls** not applicable to Virtual Network NAT have been excluded.

 
To see how Virtual Network NAT completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Virtual Network NAT security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Virtual Network NAT doesn't support controlling outbound traffic with network security groups (NSG).  Inbound traffic is only allowed in response to an outbound originated flow.

However, network security group (NSG) flow logs can be used with NAT gateway resources to monitor outbound originated traffic.

Use Azure Security Center and follow the network protection recommendations to help secure your Azure network resources. Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. You can also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Enable Network Watcher packet capture to investigate anomalous activities. 

- [How to create a Network Watcher instance](../network-watcher/network-watcher-create.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for subnets configured with NAT gateway resources using built-in or custom Azure Policy definitions and assignments.

- [How to configure and manage Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

- [Azure Policy samples for networking](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md#network)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity log to monitor resource configurations and detect changes to your NAT gateway resources and virtual network resources. Create alerts in Azure Monitor to notify you when critical resources are changed.

- [How to view and retrieve Azure Activity log events](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md#view-the-activity-log)

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Ingest logs related to Virtual Network NAT via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

Alternatively, you can enable and on-board this data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

- [How to onboard Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/quickstart-onboard.md) 

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) 

- [How to get started with Azure Monitor and third-party SIEM integration](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/use-azure-monitor-to-integrate-with-siem-tools/)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Activity logs, which are automatically available, contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your NAT gateway resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) 

- [Understand logging and different log types in Azure](../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md) 

Virtual Network NAT currently does not produce any additional diagnostic logs which are configurable by customers.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 2.7: Enable alerts for anomalous activities

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center with Log Analytics workspace for monitoring and alerting on anomalous activity found in security logs and events. Instead, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel.

- [How to onboard Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/quickstart-onboard.md) 

- [How to manage alerts in Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md)

## Inventory and Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Inventory and Asset Management](../security/benchmarks/security-control-inventory-asset-management.md).*

### 6.1: Use automated asset discovery solution

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Graph to query/discover all resources (such as compute, storage, network, ports, and protocols and so on) within your subscriptions. 

Ensure appropriate (read) permissions in your tenant and enumerate all Azure subscriptions and resources within your subscriptions.

Although classic Azure resources may be discovered via Resource Graph, it is highly recommended to create and use Azure Resource Manager based resources going forward.

- [Azure Resource Graph queries](../governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 6.2: Maintain asset metadata

**Guidance**: Apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 7.5: Securely store configuration of Azure resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure DevOps to securely store and manage your code like custom Azure Policy definitions, Azure Resource Manager templates and desired state configuration scripts. To access the resources you manage in Azure DevOps, you can grant or deny permissions to specific users, built-in security groups, or groups defined in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) if integrated with Azure DevOps, or Active Directory if integrated with TFS.
