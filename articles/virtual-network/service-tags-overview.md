# Virtual network service tags
<a name="network-service-tags"></a>

A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change, minimizing the complexity of frequent updates to network security rules.

You can use service tags to define network access controls on [network security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#security-rules) or [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/service-tags). Use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when you create security rules. By specifying the service tag name, such as **ApiManagement**, in the appropriate *source* or *destination* field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service.

You can use service tags to achieve network isolation and protect your Azure resources from the general Internet while accessing Azure services that have public endpoints. Create inbound/outbound network security group rules to deny traffic to/from **Internet** and allow traffic to/from **AzureCloud** or other [available service tags](#available-service-tags) of specific Azure services.

## Available service tags
The following table includes all the service tags available for use in [network security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#security-rules) rules.

The columns indicate whether the tag:

- Is suitable for rules that cover inbound or outbound traffic.
- Supports [regional](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions) scope.
- Is usable in [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/service-tags) rules.

By default, service tags reflect the ranges for the entire cloud. Some service tags also allow more granular control by restricting the corresponding IP ranges to a specified region. For example, the service tag **Storage** represents Azure Storage for the entire cloud, but **Storage.WestUS** narrows the range to only the storage IP address ranges from the WestUS region. The following table indicates whether each service tag supports such regional scope.

>[!NOTE]
>In the classic deployment model (before Azure Resource Manager), a subset of the tags listed in the previous table are supported. These tags are spelled differently:
>
>| Classic spelling | Equivalent Resource Manager tag |
>|---|---|
>| AZURE_LOADBALANCER | AzureLoadBalancer |
>| INTERNET | Internet |
>| VIRTUAL_NETWORK | VirtualNetwork |

> [!NOTE]
> Service tags of Azure services denote the address prefixes from the specific cloud being used. For example, the underlying IP ranges that correspond to the **Sql** tag value on the Azure Public cloud will be different from the underlying ranges on the Azure China cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> If you implement a [virtual network service endpoint](virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) for a service, such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database, Azure adds a [route](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#optional-default-routes) to a virtual network subnet for the service. The address prefixes in the route are the same address prefixes, or CIDR ranges, as those of the corresponding service tag.

## Service tags on-premises  
You can obtain the current service tag and range information to include as part of your on-premises firewall configurations. This information is the current point-in-time list of the IP ranges that correspond to each service tag. You can obtain the information programmatically or via a JSON file download, as described in the following sections.

### Use the Service Tag Discovery API (public preview)
You can programmatically retrieve the current list of service tags together with IP address range details:

- [REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/virtualnetwork/servicetags/list)
- [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/Get-AzNetworkServiceTag?view=azps-2.8.0&viewFallbackFrom=azps-2.3.2)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-list-service-tags)

> [!NOTE]
> While it's in public preview, the Discovery API might return information that's less current than information returned by the JSON downloads. (See the next section.)


### Discover service tags by using downloadable JSON files 
You can download JSON files that contain the current list of service tags together with IP address range details. These lists are updated and published weekly. Locations for each cloud are:

- [Azure Public](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519)
- [Azure US Government](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063)  
- [Azure China](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57062) 
- [Azure Germany](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57064)   

The IP address ranges in these files are in CIDR notation. 

> [!NOTE]
>A subset of this information has been published in XML files for [Azure Public](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653), [Azure China](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42064), and [Azure Germany](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54770). These XML downloads will be deprecated by June 30, 2020 and will no longer be available after that date. You should migrate to using the Discovery API or JSON file downloads as described in the previous sections.

### Tips 
- You can detect updates from one publication to the next by noting increased *changeNumber* values in the JSON file. Each subsection (for example, **Storage.WestUS**) has its own *changeNumber* that's incremented as changes occur. The top level of the file's *changeNumber* is incremented when any of the subsections is changed.
- For examples of how to parse the service tag information (for example, get all address ranges for Storage in WestUS), see the [Service Tag Discovery API PowerShell](https://aka.ms/discoveryapi_powershell) documentation.
