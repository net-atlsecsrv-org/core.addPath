# What is Azure Virtual Network?

Azure Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. A virtual network is scoped to a single Azure region. An Azure [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/) is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. 

Virtual networks are made up of subnets. A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your virtual network. Subnets, like virtual networks, are scoped to a single Azure region. 

Multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected together using Virtual Network Peering.

Azure Virtual Network provides the following key capabilities:

## Isolation and segmentation

You can implement multiple virtual networks within each Azure [subscription](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#subscription) and Azure [region](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#region). Each virtual network is isolated from other virtual networks. For each virtual network you can:
- Specify a custom private IP address space using public and private (RFC 1918) addresses. Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that you assign.
- Segment the virtual network into one or more subnets and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.
- Use Azure-provided name resolution, or specify your own DNS server, for use by resources in a virtual network.

## Communicate with the internet

All resources in a virtual network can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use public IP or public Load Balancer to manage your outbound connections.  To learn more about outbound connections in Azure, see [Outbound connections](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md), [Public IP addresses](virtual-network-public-ip-address.md), and [Load Balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
>When using only an internal [Standard Load Balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview.md), outbound connectivity is not available until you define how you want [outbound connections](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md) to work with an instance-level public IP or a public Load Balancer.

## Communicate between Azure resources

Azure resources communicate securely with each other in one of the following ways:

- **Through a virtual network**: You can deploy VMs, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. To view a complete list of Azure resources that you can deploy into a virtual network, see [Virtual network service integration](virtual-network-for-azure-services.md). 
- **Through a virtual network service endpoint**: Extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your virtual network to Azure service resources, such as Azure Storage accounts and Azure SQL databases, over a direct connection. Service endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only a virtual network. To learn more, see [Virtual network service endpoints overview](virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md).
 
## Communicate with on-premises resources

You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using any combination of the following options:

- **Point-to-site virtual private network (VPN):** Established between a virtual network and a single computer in your network. Each computer that wants to establish connectivity with a virtual network must configure its connection. This connection type is great if you're just getting started with Azure, or for developers, because it requires little or no changes to your existing network. The communication between your computer and a virtual network is sent through an encrypted tunnel over the internet. To learn more, see [Point-to-site VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#P2S).
- **Site-to-site VPN:** Established between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN Gateway that is deployed in a virtual network. This connection type enables any on-premises resource that you authorize to access a virtual network. The communication between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN gateway is sent through an encrypted tunnel over the internet. To learn more, see [Site-to-site VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#s2smulti).
- **Azure ExpressRoute:** Established between your network and Azure, through an ExpressRoute partner. This connection is private. Traffic does not go over the internet. To learn more, see [ExpressRoute](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#ExpressRoute).

## Filter network traffic
You can filter network traffic between subnets using either or both of the following options:
- **Security groups:** Network security groups and application security groups can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. To learn more, see [Network security groups](security-overview.md#network-security-groups) or [Application security groups](security-overview.md#application-security-groups).
- **Network virtual appliances:** A network virtual appliance is a VM that performs a network function, such as a firewall, WAN optimization, or other network function. To view a list of available network virtual appliances that you can deploy in a virtual network, see [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/networking?page=1&subcategories=appliances).

## Route network traffic

Azure routes traffic between subnets, connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the Internet, by default. You can implement either or both of the following options to override the default routes Azure creates:
- **Route tables:** You can create custom route tables with routes that control where traffic is routed to for each subnet. Learn more about [route tables](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#user-defined).
- **Border gateway protocol (BGP) routes:** If you connect your virtual network to your on-premises network using an Azure VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute connection, you can propagate your on-premises BGP routes to your virtual networks. Learn more about using BGP with [Azure VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-bgp-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) and [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-routing.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#dynamic-route-exchange).

## Connect virtual networks

You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. To learn more, see [Virtual network peering](virtual-network-peering-overview.md).

## Next steps

You now have an overview of Azure Virtual Network. To get started using a virtual network, create one, deploy a few VMs to it, and communicate between the VMs. To learn how, see the [Create a virtual network](quick-create-portal.md) quickstart.
