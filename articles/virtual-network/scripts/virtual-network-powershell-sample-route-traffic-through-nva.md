# Route traffic through a network virtual appliance script sample

This script sample creates a virtual network with front-end and back-end subnets. It also creates a VM with IP forwarding enabled to route traffic between the two subnets. After running the script you can deploy network software, such as a firewall application, to the VM.

You can execute the script from the Azure [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell), or from a local PowerShell installation. If you use PowerShell locally, this script requires the Az PowerShell module version 5.4.1 or later. To find the installed version, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az`. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual network, and network security groups. Each command in the following table links to command-specific documentation:

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup)  | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork) | Creates an Azure virtual network and front-end subnet. |
| [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig) | Creates back-end and DMZ subnets. |
| [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress) | Creates a public IP address to access the VM from the internet. |
| [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface) | Creates a virtual network interface and enable IP forwarding for it. |
| [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup) | Creates a network security group (NSG). |
| [New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig) | Creates NSG rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS ports inbound to the VM. |
| [Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig)| Associates the NSGs and route tables to subnets. |
| [New-AzRouteTable](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azroutetable)| Creates a route table for all routes. |
| [New-AzRouteConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azrouteconfig)| Creates routes to route traffic between subnets and the internet through the VM. |
| [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm) | Creates a virtual machine and attaches the NIC to it. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to use and administrative credentials. |
| [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup)  | Deletes a resource group and all resources it contains. |
