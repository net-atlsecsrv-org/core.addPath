# Filter network traffic with a network security group using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

You can filter network traffic inbound to and outbound from a virtual network subnet with a network security group. Network security groups contain security rules that filter network traffic by IP address, port, and protocol. Security rules are applied to resources deployed in a subnet. In this article, you learn how to:

* Create a network security group and security rules
* Create a virtual network and associate a network security group to a subnet
* Deploy virtual machines (VM) into a subnet
* Test traffic filters

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Create a network security group

A network security group contains security rules. Security rules specify a source and destination. Sources and destinations can be application security groups.

### Create application security groups

First create a resource group for all the resources created in this article with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). The following example creates a resource group in the *eastus* location:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS
```

Create an application security group with [New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azapplicationsecuritygroup). An application security group enables you to group servers with similar port filtering requirements. The following example creates two application security groups.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$webAsg = New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Name myAsgWebServers `
  -Location eastus

$mgmtAsg = New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Name myAsgMgmtServers `
  -Location eastus
```

### Create security rules

Create a security rule with [New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig). The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *myWebServers* application security group over ports 80 and 443:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$webRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "Allow-Web-All" `
  -Access Allow `
  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound `
  -Priority 100 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix Internet `
  -SourcePortRange * `
  -DestinationApplicationSecurityGroupId $webAsg.id `
  -DestinationPortRange 80,443

The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *myMgmtServers* application security group over port 3389:

$mgmtRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "Allow-RDP-All" `
  -Access Allow `
  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound `
  -Priority 110 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix Internet `
  -SourcePortRange * `
  -DestinationApplicationSecurityGroupId $mgmtAsg.id `
  -DestinationPortRange 3389
```

In this article, RDP (port 3389) is exposed to the internet for the *myAsgMgmtServers* VM. For production environments, instead of exposing port 3389 to the internet, it's recommended that you connect to Azure resources that you want to manage using a [VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [private](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) network connection.

### Create a network security group

Create a network security group with [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup). The following example creates a network security group named *myNsg*:

```powershell-interactive
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myNsg `
  -SecurityRules $webRule,$mgmtRule
```

## Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network with [New-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork). The following example creates a virtual named *myVirtualNetwork*:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location EastUS `
  -Name myVirtualNetwork `
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16
```

Create a subnet configuration with [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig), and then write the subnet configuration to the virtual network with [Set-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetwork). The following example adds a subnet named *mySubnet* to the virtual network and associates the *myNsg* network security group to it:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
  -Name mySubnet `
  -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork `
  -AddressPrefix "10.0.2.0/24" `
  -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg
$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```

## Create virtual machines

Before creating the VMs, retrieve the virtual network object with the subnet with [Get-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetwork):

```powershell-interactive
$virtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork `
 -Name myVirtualNetwork `
 -Resourcegroupname myResourceGroup
```

Create a public IP address for each VM with [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress):

```powershell-interactive
$publicIpWeb = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -AllocationMethod Dynamic `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmWeb

$publicIpMgmt = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -AllocationMethod Dynamic `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmMgmt
```

Create two network interfaces with [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface), and assign a public IP address to the network interface. The following example creates a network interface, associates the *myVmWeb* public IP address to it, and makes it a member of the *myAsgWebServers* application security group:

```powershell-interactive
$webNic = New-AzNetworkInterface `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmWeb `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -SubnetId $virtualNetwork.Subnets[0].Id `
  -ApplicationSecurityGroupId $webAsg.Id `
  -PublicIpAddressId $publicIpWeb.Id
```

The following example creates a network interface, associates the *myVmMgmt* public IP address to it, and makes it a member of the *myAsgMgmtServers* application security group:

```powershell-interactive
$mgmtNic = New-AzNetworkInterface `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmMgmt `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -SubnetId $virtualNetwork.Subnets[0].Id `
  -ApplicationSecurityGroupId $mgmtAsg.Id `
  -PublicIpAddressId $publicIpMgmt.Id
```

Create two VMs in the virtual network so you can validate traffic filtering in a later step.

Create a VM configuration with [New-AzVMConfig](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig), then create the VM with [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm). The following example creates a VM that will serve as a web server. The `-AsJob` option creates the VM in the background, so you can continue to the next step:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create user object
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."

$webVmConfig = New-AzVMConfig `
  -VMName myVmWeb `
  -VMSize Standard_DS1_V2 | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows `
  -ComputerName myVmWeb `
  -Credential $cred | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage `
  -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer `
  -Offer WindowsServer `
  -Skus 2016-Datacenter `
  -Version latest | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface `
  -Id $webNic.Id
New-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -VM $webVmConfig `
  -AsJob
```

Create a VM to serve as a management server:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create user object
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."

# Create the web server virtual machine configuration and virtual machine.
$mgmtVmConfig = New-AzVMConfig `
  -VMName myVmMgmt `
  -VMSize Standard_DS1_V2 | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows `
  -ComputerName myVmMgmt `
  -Credential $cred | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage `
  -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer `
  -Offer WindowsServer `
  -Skus 2016-Datacenter `
  -Version latest | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface `
  -Id $mgmtNic.Id
New-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -VM $mgmtVmConfig
```

The virtual machine takes a few minutes to create. Don't continue with the next step until Azure finishes creating the VM.

## Test traffic filters

Use [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) to return the public IP address of a VM. The following example returns the public IP address of the *myVmMgmt* VM:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -Name myVmMgmt `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  | Select IpAddress
```

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session with the *myVmMgmt* VM from your local computer. Replace `<publicIpAddress>` with the IP address returned from the previous command.

```
mstsc /v:<publicIpAddress>
```

Open the downloaded RDP file. If prompted, select **Connect**.

Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the VM (you may need to select **More choices**, then **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM), then select **OK**. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Select **Yes** to proceed with the connection.

The connection succeeds, because port 3389 is allowed inbound from the internet to the *myAsgMgmtServers* application security group that the network interface attached to the *myVmMgmt* VM is in.

Use the following command to create a remote desktop connection to the *myVmWeb* VM, from the *myVmMgmt* VM, with the following command, from PowerShell:

``` 
mstsc /v:myvmWeb
```

The connection succeeds because a default security rule within each network security group allows traffic over all ports between all IP addresses within a virtual network. You can't create a remote desktop connection to the *myVmWeb* VM from the internet because the security rule for the *myAsgWebServers* doesn't allow port 3389 inbound from the internet.

Use the following command to install Microsoft IIS on the *myVmWeb* VM from PowerShell:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
```

After the IIS installation is complete, disconnect from the *myVmWeb* VM, which leaves you in the *myVmMgmt* VM remote desktop connection. To view the IIS welcome screen, open an internet browser and browse to http:\//myVmWeb.

Disconnect from the *myVmMgmt* VM.

On your computer, enter the following command from PowerShell to retrieve the public IP address of the *myVmWeb* server:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -Name myVmWeb `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  | Select IpAddress
```

To confirm that you can access the *myVmWeb* web server from outside of Azure, open an internet browser on your computer and browse to `http://<public-ip-address-from-previous-step>`. The connection succeeds, because port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet to the *myAsgWebServers* application security group that the network interface attached to the *myVmWeb* VM is in.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```

## Next steps

In this article, you created a network security group and associated it to a virtual network subnet. To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](security-overview.md) and [Manage a network security group](manage-network-security-group.md).

Azure routes traffic between subnets by default. You may instead, choose to route traffic between subnets through a VM, serving as a firewall, for example. To learn how, see [Create a route table](tutorial-create-route-table-powershell.md).
