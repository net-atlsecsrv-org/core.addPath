# Move Azure network security group (NSG) to another region using Azure PowerShell

There are various scenarios in which you'd want to move your existing NSGs from one region to another. For example, you may want to create an NSG with the same configuration and security rules for testing. You may also want to move an NSG to another region as part of disaster recovery planning.

Azure security groups can't be moved from one region to another. You can however, use an Azure Resource Manager template to export the existing configuration and security rules of an NSG.  You can then stage the resource in another region by exporting the NSG to a template, modifying the parameters to match the destination region, and then deploy the template to the new region.  For more information on Resource Manager and templates, see [Export resource groups to templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/manage-resource-groups-powershell#export-resource-groups-to-templates).


## Prerequisites

- Make sure that the Azure network security group is in the Azure region from which you want to move.

- Azure network security groups can't be moved between regions.  You'll have to associate the new NSG to resources in the target region.

- To export an NSG configuration and deploy a template to create an NSG in another region, you'll need the Network Contributor role or higher.
   
- Identify the source networking layout and all the resources that you're currently using. This layout includes but isn't limited to load balancers, public IPs, and virtual networks.

- Verify that your Azure subscription allows you to create NSGs in the target region that's used. Contact support to enable the required quota.

- Make sure that your subscription has enough resources to support the addition of NSGs for this process.  See [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#networking-limits).


## Prepare and move
The following steps show how to prepare the network security group for the configuration and security rule move using a Resource Manager template, and move the NSG configuration and security rules to the target region using Azure PowerShell.


[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

### Export the template and deploy from a script

1. Sign in to your Azure subscription with the [Connect-AzAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount?view=azps-2.5.0) command and follow the on-screen directions:
    
    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

2. Obtain the resource ID of the NSG you want to move to the target region and place it in a variable using [Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworksecuritygroup?view=azps-2.6.0):

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    $sourceNSGID = (Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name <source-nsg-name> -ResourceGroupName <source-resource-group-name>).Id

    ```
3. Export the source NSG to a .json file into the directory where you execute the command [Export-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/export-azresourcegroup?view=azps-2.6.0):
   
   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Export-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName <source-resource-group-name> -Resource $sourceNSGID -IncludeParameterDefaultValue
   ```

4. The file downloaded will be named after the resource group the resource was exported from.  Locate the file that was exported from the command named **\<resource-group-name>.json** and open it in an editor of your choice:
   
   ```azurepowershell
   notepad <source-resource-group-name>.json
   ```

5. To edit the parameter of the NSG name, change the property **defaultValue** of the source NSG name to the name of your target NSG, ensure the name is in quotes:
    
    ```json
            {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "networkSecurityGroups_myVM1_nsg_name": {
            "defaultValue": "<target-nsg-name>",
            "type": "String"
            }
        }

    ```


6. To edit the target region where the NSG configuration and security rules will be moved, change the **location** property under **resources**:

    ```json
            "resources": [
            {
            "type": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups",
            "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
            "name": "[parameters('networkSecurityGroups_myVM1_nsg_name')]",
            "location": "<target-region>",
            "properties": {
                "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                "resourceGuid": "2c846acf-58c8-416d-be97-ccd00a4ccd78", 
             }
            }
    ```
  
7. To obtain region location codes, you can use the Azure PowerShell cmdlet [Get-AzLocation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azlocation?view=azps-1.8.0) by running the following command:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive

    Get-AzLocation | format-table
    
    ```
8. You can also change other parameters in the **\<resource-group-name>.json** if you choose, and are optional depending on your requirements:

    * **Security rules** - You can edit which rules are deployed into the target NSG by adding or removing rules to the **securityRules** section in the **\<resource-group-name>.json** file:

        ```json
           "resources": [
                  {
                  "type": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups",
                  "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
                  "name": "[parameters('networkSecurityGroups_myVM1_nsg_name')]",
                  "location": "TARGET REGION",
                  "properties": {
                       "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                       "resourceGuid": "2c846acf-58c8-416d-be97-ccd00a4ccd78",
                  "securityRules": [
                    {
                        "name": "RDP",
                        "etag": "W/\"c630c458-6b52-4202-8fd7-172b7ab49cf5\"",
                        "properties": {
                             "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                             "protocol": "TCP",
                             "sourcePortRange": "*",
                             "destinationPortRange": "3389",
                             "sourceAddressPrefix": "*",
                             "destinationAddressPrefix": "*",
                             "access": "Allow",
                             "priority": 300,
                             "direction": "Inbound",
                             "sourcePortRanges": [],
                             "destinationPortRanges": [],
                             "sourceAddressPrefixes": [],
                             "destinationAddressPrefixes": []
                            }
                        ]
            }  
            
        ```

        To complete the addition or the removal of the rules in the target NSG, you must also edit the custom rule types at the end of the **\<resource-group-name>.json** file in the format of the example below:

        ```json
           {
            "type": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules",
            "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('networkSecurityGroups_myVM1_nsg_name'), '/Port_80')]",
            "dependsOn": [
                "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups', parameters('networkSecurityGroups_myVM1_nsg_name'))]"
            ],
            "properties": {
                "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                "protocol": "*",
                "sourcePortRange": "*",
                "destinationPortRange": "80",
                "sourceAddressPrefix": "*",
                "destinationAddressPrefix": "*",
                "access": "Allow",
                "priority": 310,
                "direction": "Inbound",
                "sourcePortRanges": [],
                "destinationPortRanges": [],
                "sourceAddressPrefixes": [],
                "destinationAddressPrefixes": []
            }
        ```

9. Save the **\<resource-group-name>.json** file.

10. Create a resource group in the target region for the target NSG to be deployed using [New-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup?view=azps-2.6.0):
    
    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name <target-resource-group-name> -location <target-region>
    ```
    
11. Deploy the edited **\<resource-group-name>.json** file to the resource group created in the previous step using [New-AzResourceGroupDeployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroupdeployment?view=azps-2.6.0):

    ```azurepowershell-interactive

    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName <target-resource-group-name> -TemplateFile <source-resource-group-name>.json
    
    ```

12. To verify the resources were created in the target region, use [Get-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azresourcegroup?view=azps-2.6.0) and [Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworksecuritygroup?view=azps-2.6.0):
    
    ```azurepowershell-interactive

    Get-AzResourceGroup -Name <target-resource-group-name>

    ```

    ```azurepowershell-interactive

    Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name <target-nsg-name> -ResourceGroupName <target-resource-group-name>

    ```

## Discard 

After the deployment, if you wish to start over or discard the NSG in the target, delete the resource group that was created in the target and the moved NSG will be deleted.  To remove the resource group, use [Remove-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup?view=azps-2.6.0):

```azurepowershell-interactive

Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name <target-resource-group-name>

```

## Clean up

To commit the changes and complete the move of the NSG, delete the source NSG or resource group, use [Remove-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup?view=azps-2.6.0) or [Remove-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/remove-aznetworksecuritygroup?view=azps-2.6.0):

```azurepowershell-interactive

Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name <source-resource-group-name>

```

``` azurepowershell-interactive

Remove-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name <source-nsg-name> -ResourceGroupName <source-resource-group-name>

```
