# Assign multiple IP addresses to virtual machines using the Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-intro.md](../../includes/virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-intro.md)]

This article explains how to create a virtual machine (VM) through the Azure Resource Manager deployment model using the Azure CLI. Multiple IP addresses cannot be assigned to resources created through the classic deployment model. To learn more about Azure deployment models, read the [Understand deployment models](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md) article.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-scenario.md](../../includes/virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-scenario.md)]

## <a name = "create"></a>Create a VM with multiple IP addresses

The steps that follow explain how to create an example virtual machine with multiple IP addresses, as described in the scenario. Change variable values in "" and IP address types, as required, for your implementation. 

1. Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if you don't already have it installed.
2. Create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs by completing the steps in the [Create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs](../virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
3. From a command shell, login with the command `az login` and select the subscription you're using.
4. Create the VM by executing the script that follows on a Linux or Mac computer. The script creates a resource group, one virtual network (VNet), one NIC with three IP configurations, and a VM with the two NICs attached to it. The NIC, public IP address, virtual network, and VM resources must all exist in the same location and subscription. Though the resources don't all have to exist in the same resource group, in the following script they do.

```bash
	
#!/bin/sh
	
RgName="myResourceGroup"
Location="westcentralus"
az group create --name $RgName --location $Location
	
# Create a public IP address resource with a static IP address using the `--allocation-method Static` option. If you
# do not specify this option, the address is allocated dynamically. The address is assigned to the resource from a pool
# of IP addresses unique to each Azure region. Download and view the file from
# https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653 that lists the ranges for each region.

PipName="myPublicIP"

# This name must be unique within an Azure location.
DnsName="myDNSName"

az network public-ip create \
--name $PipName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--dns-name $DnsName\
--allocation-method Static

# Create a virtual network with one subnet

VnetName="myVnet"
VnetPrefix="10.0.0.0/16"
VnetSubnetName="mySubnet"
VnetSubnetPrefix="10.0.0.0/24"

az network vnet create \
--name $VnetName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--address-prefix $VnetPrefix \
--subnet-name $VnetSubnetName \
--subnet-prefix $VnetSubnetPrefix

# Create a network interface connected to the subnet and associate the public IP address to it. Azure will create the
# first IP configuration with a static private IP address and will associate the public IP address resource to it.

NicName="MyNic1"
az network nic create \
--name $NicName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--subnet $VnetSubnet1Name \
--private-ip-address 10.0.0.4
--vnet-name $VnetName \
--public-ip-address $PipName
	
# Create a second public IP address, a second IP configuration, and associate it to the NIC. This configuration has a
# static public IP address and a static private IP address.

az network public-ip create \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--name myPublicIP2 \
--dns-name mypublicdns2 \
--allocation-method Static

az network nic ip-config create \
--resource-group $RgName \
--nic-name $NicName \
--name IPConfig-2 \
--private-ip-address 10.0.0.5 \
--public-ip-name myPublicIP2

# Create a third IP configuration, and associate it to the NIC. This configuration has  static private IP address and	# no public IP address.

az network nic ip-config create \
--resource-group $RgName \
--nic-name $NicName \
--private-ip-address 10.0.0.6 \
--name IPConfig-3

# Note: Though this article assigns all IP configurations to a single NIC, you can also assign multiple IP configurations
# to any NIC in a VM. To learn how to create a VM with multiple NICs, read the Create a VM with multiple NICs 
# article: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-deploy-multinic-arm-cli.

# Create a VM and attach the NIC.

VmName="myVm"

# Replace the value for the following **VmSize** variable with a value from the
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes article. The script fails if the VM size
# is not supported in the location you select. Run the `azure vm sizes --location eastcentralus` command to get a full list
# of VMs in US West Central, for example.

VmSize="Standard_DS1"

# Replace the value for the OsImage variable value with a value for *urn* from the output returned by entering the
# `az vm image list` command.

OsImage="credativ:Debian:8:latest"

Username="adminuser"

# Replace the following value with the path to your public key file. If you're creating a Windows VM, remove the following
# line and you'll be prompted for the password you want to configure for the VM.

SshKeyValue="~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

az vm create \
--name $VmName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--image $OsImage \
--location $Location \
--size $VmSize \
--nics $NicName \
--admin-username $Username \
--ssh-key-value $SshKeyValue
```

In addition to creating a VM with a NIC with 3 IP configurations, the script creates:

- A single premium managed disk by default, but you have other options for the disk type you can create. Read the [Create a Linux VM using the Azure CLI](../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article for details.
- A virtual network with one subnet and two public IP addresses. Alternatively, you can use *existing* virtual network, subnet, NIC, or public IP address resources. To learn how to use existing network resources rather than creating additional resources, enter `az vm create -h`.

Public IP addresses have a nominal fee. To learn more about IP address pricing, read the [IP address pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses) page. There is a limit to the number of public IP addresses that can be used in a subscription. To learn more about the limits, read the [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#networking-limits) article.

After the VM is created, enter the `az network nic show --name MyNic1 --resource-group myResourceGroup` command to view the NIC configuration. Enter the `az network nic ip-config list --nic-name MyNic1 --resource-group myResourceGroup --output table` to view a list of the IP configurations associated to the NIC.

Add the private IP addresses to the VM operating system by completing the steps for your operating system in the [Add IP addresses to a VM operating system](#os-config) section of this article.

## <a name="add"></a>Add IP addresses to a VM

You can add additional private and public IP addresses to an existing Azure network interface by completing the steps that follow. The examples build upon the [scenario](#scenario) described in this article.

1. Open a command shell and complete the remaining steps in this section within a single session. If you don't already have Azure CLI installed and configured, complete the steps in the [Azure CLI installation](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article and login to your Azure account with the `az-login` command.

2. Complete the steps in one of the following sections, based on your requirements:

	**Add a private IP address**
	
	To add a private IP address to a NIC, you must create an IP configuration using the command that follows. The static IP address must be an unused address for the subnet.

	```azurecli
	az network nic ip-config create \
	--resource-group myResourceGroup \
	--nic-name myNic1 \
	--private-ip-address 10.0.0.7 \
	--name IPConfig-4
    ```
	
	Create as many configurations as you require, using unique configuration names and private IP addresses (for configurations with static IP addresses).

	**Add a public IP address**
	
	A public IP address is added by associating it to either a new IP configuration or an existing IP configuration. Complete the steps in one of the sections that follow, as you require.

	Public IP addresses have a nominal fee. To learn more about IP address pricing, read the [IP address pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses) page. There is a limit to the number of public IP addresses that can be used in a subscription. To learn more about the limits, read the [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#networking-limits) article.

	- **Associate the resource to a new IP configuration**
	
		Whenever you add a public IP address in a new IP configuration, you must also add a private IP address, because all IP configurations must have a private IP address. You can either add an existing public IP address resource, or create a new one. To create a new one, enter the following command:
	
		```azurecli
		az network public-ip create \
		--resource-group myResourceGroup \
		--location westcentralus \
		--name myPublicIP3 \
		--dns-name mypublicdns3
        ```

 		To create a new IP configuration with a static private IP address and the associated *myPublicIP3* public IP address resource, enter the following command:

		```azurecli
		az network nic ip-config create \
		--resource-group myResourceGroup \
		--nic-name myNic1 \
		--name IPConfig-5 \
		--private-ip-address 10.0.0.8
		--public-ip-address myPublicIP3
        ```

	- **Associate the resource to an existing IP configuration**
		A public IP address resource can only be associated to an IP configuration that doesn't already have one associated. You can determine whether an IP configuration has an associated public IP address by entering the following command:

		```azurecli
		az network nic ip-config list \
		--resource-group myResourceGroup \
		--nic-name myNic1 \
		--query "[?provisioningState=='Succeeded'].{ Name: name, PublicIpAddressId: publicIpAddress.id }" --output table
        ```

		Returned output:
	
        ```output
		Name        PublicIpAddressId
		
		ipconfig1   /subscriptions/[Id]/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP1
		IPConfig-2  /subscriptions/[Id]/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP2
		IPConfig-3
        ```

		Since the **PublicIpAddressId** column for *IpConfig-3* is blank in the output, no public IP address resource is currently associated to it. You can add an existing public IP address resource to IpConfig-3, or enter the following command to create one:

		```azurecli
		az network public-ip create \
		--resource-group  myResourceGroup
		--location westcentralus \
		--name myPublicIP3 \
		--dns-name mypublicdns3 \
		--allocation-method Static
        ```
	
		Enter the following command to associate the public IP address resource to the existing IP configuration named *IPConfig-3*:
	
		```azurecli
		az network nic ip-config update \
		--resource-group myResourceGroup \
		--nic-name myNic1 \
		--name IPConfig-3 \
		--public-ip myPublicIP3
        ```

3. View the private IP addresses and the public IP address resource Ids assigned to the NIC by entering the following command:

	```azurecli
	az network nic ip-config list \
	--resource-group myResourceGroup \
	--nic-name myNic1 \
	--query "[?provisioningState=='Succeeded'].{ Name: name, PrivateIpAddress: privateIpAddress, PrivateIpAllocationMethod: privateIpAllocationMethod, PublicIpAddressId: publicIpAddress.id }" --output table
    ```

	Returned output: <br>

    ```output
	Name        PrivateIpAddress    PrivateIpAllocationMethod   PublicIpAddressId
	
	ipconfig1   10.0.0.4            Static                      /subscriptions/[Id]/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP1
	IPConfig-2  10.0.0.5            Static                      /subscriptions/[Id]/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP2
	IPConfig-3  10.0.0.6            Static                      /subscriptions/[Id]/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP3
    ```
	
4. Add the private IP addresses you added to the NIC to the VM operating system by following the instructions in the [Add IP addresses to a VM operating system](#os-config) section of this article. Do not add the public IP addresses to the operating system.
