# Create a virtual machine with a static public IP address using the Azure CLI

You can create a virtual machine with a static public IP address. A public IP address enables you to communicate to a virtual machine from the internet. Assign a static public IP address, rather than a dynamic address, to ensure that the address never changes. Learn more about [static public IP addresses](virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md#allocation-method). To change a public IP address assigned to an existing virtual machine from dynamic to static, or to work with private IP addresses, see [Add, change, or remove IP addresses](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md). Public IP addresses have a [nominal charge](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses), and there is a [limit](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits) to the number of public IP addresses that you can use per subscription.

## Create a virtual machine

You can complete the following steps from your local computer or by using the Azure Cloud Shell. To use your local computer, ensure you have the [Azure CLI installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). To use the Azure Cloud Shell, select **Try It** in the top right corner of any command box that follows. The Cloud Shell signs you into Azure.

1. If using the Cloud Shell, skip to step 2. Open a command session and sign into Azure with `az login`.
2. Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. The following example creates a resource group in the East US Azure region:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
   ```

3. Create a virtual machine with the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) command. The `--public-ip-address-allocation=static` option assigns a static public IP address to the virtual machine. The following example creates an Ubuntu virtual machine with a static, basic SKU public IP address named *myPublicIpAddress*:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm create \
     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --name myVM \
     --image UbuntuLTS \
     --admin-username azureuser \
     --generate-ssh-keys \
     --public-ip-address myPublicIpAddress \
     --public-ip-address-allocation static
   ```

   If the public IP address must be a standard SKU, add `--public-ip-sku Standard` to the previous command. Learn more about [Public IP address SKUs](virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md#sku). If the virtual machine will be added to the back-end pool of a public Azure Load Balancer, the SKU of the virtual machine's public IP address must match the SKU of the load balancer's public IP address. For details, see [Azure Load Balancer](../load-balancer/skus.md).

4. View the public IP address assigned and confirm that it was created as a static, basic SKU address, with [az network public-ip show](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-show):

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network public-ip show \
     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --name myPublicIpAddress \
     --query [ipAddress,publicIpAllocationMethod,sku] \
     --output table
   ```

   Azure assigned a public IP address from addresses used in the region you created the virtual machine in. You can download the list of ranges (prefixes) for the Azure [Public](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519), [US government](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063), [China](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57062), and [Germany](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57064) clouds.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not modify the IP address settings within the virtual machine's operating system. The operating system is unaware of Azure public IP addresses. Though you can add private IP address settings to the operating system, we recommend not doing so unless necessary, and not until after reading [Add a private IP address to an operating system](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#private).

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```
