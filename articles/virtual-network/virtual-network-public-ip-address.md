# Manage public IP addresses

Learn about a public IP address and how to create, change, and delete one. A public IP address is a resource with its own configurable settings. Assigning a public IP address to an Azure resource that supports public IP addresses enables:
- Inbound communication from the Internet to the resource, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), Azure Application Gateways, Azure Load Balancers, Azure VPN Gateways, and others. You can still communicate with some resources, such as VMs, from the Internet, if a VM doesn't have a public IP address assigned to it, as long as the VM is part of a load balancer back-end pool, and the load balancer is assigned a public IP address. To determine whether a resource for a specific Azure service can be assigned a public IP address, or whether it can be communicated with through the public IP address of a different Azure resource, see the documentation for the service.
- Outbound connectivity to the Internet using a predictable IP address. For example, a virtual machine can communicate outbound to the Internet without a public IP address assigned to it, but its address is network address translated by Azure to an unpredictable public address, by default. Assigning a public IP address to a resource enables you to know which IP address is used for the outbound connection. Though predictable, the address can change, depending on the assignment method chosen. For more information, see [Create a public IP address](#create-a-public-ip-address). To learn more about outbound connections from Azure resources, see [Understand outbound connections](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

Complete the following tasks before completing steps in any section of this article:

- If you don't already have an Azure account, sign up for a [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- If using the portal, open https://portal.azure.com, and log in with your Azure account.
- If using PowerShell commands to complete tasks in this article, either run the commands in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell), or by running PowerShell from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. This tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.
- If using Azure Command-line interface (CLI) commands to complete tasks in this article, either run the commands in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash), or by running the CLI from your computer. This tutorial requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.31 or later. Run `az --version` to find the installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you are running the Azure CLI locally, you also need to run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

The account you log into, or connect to Azure with, must be assigned to the [network contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) role or to a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) that is assigned the appropriate actions listed in [Permissions](#permissions).

Public IP addresses have a nominal charge. To view the pricing, read the [IP address pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses) page.

## Create a public IP address

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.
2. Enter *public ip address* in the *Search the Marketplace* box. When **Public IP address** appears in the search results, select it.
3. Under **Public IP address**, select **Create**.
4. Enter, or select values for the following settings, under **Create public IP address**, then select **Create**:

   |Setting|Required?|Details|
   |---|---|---|
   |IP Version|Yes| Select IPv4 or IPv6 or Both. Selecting Both will result in 2 Public IP addresses being create- 1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 address. Learn more about [IPv6 in Azure VNETs](../virtual-network/ipv6-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).|
   |SKU|Yes|All public IP addresses created before the introduction of SKUs are **Basic** SKU public IP addresses. You cannot change the SKU after the public IP address is created. A standalone virtual machine, virtual machines within an availability set, or virtual machine scale sets can use Basic or Standard SKUs. Mixing SKUs between virtual machines within availability sets or scale sets or standalone VMs is not allowed. **Basic** SKU: If you are creating a public IP address in a region that supports availability zones, the **Availability zone** setting is set to *None* by default. Basic Public IPs do not support Availability zones. **Standard** SKU: A Standard SKU public IP can be associated to a virtual machine or a load balancer front end. If you're creating a public IP address in a region that supports availability zones, the **Availability zone** setting is set to *Zone-redundant* by default. For more information about availability zones, see the **Availability zone** setting. The standard SKU is required if you associate the address to a Standard load balancer. To learn more about standard load balancers, see [Azure load balancer standard SKU](../load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). When you assign a standard SKU public IP address to a virtual machineâ€™s network interface, you must explicitly allow the intended traffic with a [network security group](security-overview.md#network-security-groups). Communication with the resource fails until you create and associate a network security group and explicitly allow the desired traffic.|
   |Name|Yes|The name must be unique within the resource group you select.|
   |IP address assignment|Yes|**Dynamic:** Dynamic addresses are assigned only after a public IP address is associated to an Azure resource, and the resource is started for the first time. Dynamic addresses can change if they're assigned to a resource, such as a virtual machine, and the virtual machine is stopped (deallocated), and then restarted. The address remains the same if a virtual machine is rebooted or stopped (but not deallocated). Dynamic addresses are released when a public IP address resource is dissociated from a resource it is associated to. **Static:** Static addresses are assigned when a public IP address is created. Static addresses are not released until a public IP address resource is deleted. If the address is not associated to a resource, you can change the assignment method after the address is created. If the address is associated to a resource, you may not be able to change the assignment method. If you select *IPv6* for the **IP version**, the assignment method must be *Dynamic* for Basic SKU.  Standard SKU addresses are *Static* for both IPv4 and IPv6. |
   |Idle timeout (minutes)|No|How many minutes to keep a TCP or HTTP connection open without relying on clients to send keep-alive messages. If you select IPv6 for **IP Version**, this value can't be changed. |
   |DNS name label|No|Must be unique within the Azure location you create the name in (across all subscriptions and all customers). Azure automatically registers the name and IP address in its DNS so you can connect to a resource with the name. Azure appends a default subnet such as *location.cloudapp.azure.com* (where location is the location you select) to the name you provide, to create the fully qualified DNS name. If you choose to create both address versions, the same DNS name is assigned to both the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Azure's default DNS contains both IPv4 A and IPv6 AAAA name records and responds with both records when the DNS name is looked up. The client chooses which address (IPv4 or IPv6) to communicate with. Instead of, or in addition to, using the DNS name label with the default suffix, you can use the Azure DNS service to configure a DNS name with a custom suffix that resolves to the public IP address. For more information, see [Use Azure DNS with an Azure public IP address](../dns/dns-custom-domain.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#public-ip-address).|
   |Name (Only visible if you select IP Version of **Both**)|Yes, if you select IP Version of **Both**|The name must be different than the name you enter for the first **Name** in this list. If you choose to create both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, the portal creates two separate public IP address resources, one with each IP address version assigned to it.|
   |IP address assignment (Only visible if you select IP Version of **Both**)|Yes, if you select IP Version of **Both**|Same restrictions as IP Address Assignment above|
   |Subscription|Yes|Must exist in the same [subscription](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#subscription) as the resource to which you'll associate the Public IP's.|
   |Resource group|Yes|Can exist in the same, or different, [resource group](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#resource-group) as the resource to which you'll associate the Public IP's.|
   |Location|Yes|Must exist in the same [location](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions), also referred to as region, as the resource to which you'll associate the Public IP's.|
   |Availability zone| No | This setting only appears if you select a supported location. For a list of supported locations, see [Availability zones overview](../availability-zones/az-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). If you selected the **Basic** SKU, *None* is automatically selected for you. If you prefer to guarantee a specific zone, you may select a specific zone. Either choice is not zone-redundant. If you selected the **Standard** SKU: Zone-redundant is automatically selected for you and makes your data path resilient to zone failure. If you prefer to guarantee a specific zone, which is not resilient to zone failure, you may select a specific zone.

**Commands**

Though the portal provides the option to create two public IP address resources (one IPv4 and one IPv6), the following CLI and PowerShell commands create one resource with an address for one IP version or the other. If you want two public IP address resources, one for each IP version, you must run the command twice, specifying different names and IP versions for the public IP address resources.

|Tool|Command|
|---|---|
|CLI|[az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create)|
|PowerShell|[New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress)|

## View, change settings for, or delete a public IP address

1. In the box that contains the text *Search resources* at the top of the Azure portal, type *public ip address*. When **Public IP addresses** appear in the search results, select it.
2. Select the name of the public IP address you want to view, change settings for, or delete from the list.
3. Complete one of the following options, depending on whether you want to view, delete, or change the public IP address.
   - **View**: The **Overview** section shows key settings for the public IP address, such as the network interface it's associated to (if the address is associated to a network interface). The portal does not display the version of the address (IPv4 or IPv6). To view the version information, use the PowerShell or CLI command to view the public IP address. If the IP address version is IPv6, the assigned address is not displayed by the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI.
   - **Delete**: To delete the public IP address, select **Delete** in the **Overview** section. If the address is currently associated to an IP configuration, it cannot be deleted. If the address is currently associated with a configuration, select **Dissociate** to dissociate the address from the IP configuration.
   - **Change**: select **Configuration**. Change settings using the information in step 4 of [Create a public IP address](#create-a-public-ip-address). To change the assignment for an IPv4 address from static to dynamic, you must first dissociate the public IPv4 address from the IP configuration it's associated to. You can then change the assignment method to dynamic and select **Associate** to associate the IP address to the same IP configuration, a different configuration, or you can leave it dissociated. To dissociate a public IP address, in the **Overview** section, select **Dissociate**.

   >[!WARNING]
   >When you change the assignment method from static to dynamic, you lose the IP address that was assigned to the public IP address. While the Azure public DNS servers maintain a mapping between static or dynamic addresses and any DNS name label (if you defined one), a dynamic IP address can change when the virtual machine is started after being in the stopped (deallocated) state. To prevent the address from changing, assign a static IP address.

**Commands**

|Tool|Command|
|---|---|
|CLI|[az network public-ip list](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-list) to list public IP addresses, [az network public-ip show](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-show) to show settings; [az network public-ip update](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-update) to update; [az network public-ip delete](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-delete) to delete|
|PowerShell|[Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) to retrieve a public IP address object and view its settings, [Set-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azpublicipaddress) to update settings; [Remove-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/remove-azpublicipaddress) to delete|
