| [Filter inbound and outbound VM network traffic](./scripts/virtual-network-cli-sample-filter-network-traffic.md) | Creates a virtual network with front-end and back-end subnets. Inbound network traffic to the front-end subnet is limited to HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH. Outbound traffic to the internet from the back-end subnet is not permitted. |
|[Configure IPv4 + IPv6 dual stack virtual network with Basic Load Balancer](./scripts/virtual-network-cli-sample-ipv6-dual-stack.md)|Deploys dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) virtual network with two VMs and an Azure Basic Load Balancer with IPv4 and IPv6 public IP addresses. |
