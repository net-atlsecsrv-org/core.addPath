# Azure Resource Manager template samples for virtual network

The following table includes links to Azure Resource Manager template samples. You can deploy templates using the Azure [portal](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json), Azure [CLI](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-cli.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json), or Azure [PowerShell](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). To learn how to author your own templates, see [Create your first template](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) and [Understand the structure and syntax of Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

For the JSON syntax and properties to use in templates, see [Microsoft.Network resource types](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/allversions).
