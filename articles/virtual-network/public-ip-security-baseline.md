# Azure security baseline for Azure Public IP

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Public IP. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Public IP. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Public IP have been excluded.

To see how Azure Public IP completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Public IP security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Azure Public IPs can be assigned tags. Use resource tags for network security groups and other resources related to network security.  Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" that ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.  

Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI can be used to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor configurations and detect changes to your Public IP instances. Other than at the control plane (for example, Azure portal), Public IP itself does not generate logs related to network traffic. 

Public IP provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network.

Instead, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md)

- [How to onboard Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/quickstart-onboard.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor configurations and detect changes for your Public IP instances. Other than at the control plane (for example, Azure portal), Public IP itself does not generate audit logs. Public IP provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network.

- [How to set log retention parameters](../azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage.md#change-the-data-retention-period)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 2.6: Monitor and review Logs

**Guidance**: Public IP provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network.

## Identity and access control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and access control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: 
Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage access to Azure resources like Public IP instances with role assignments. Assign these roles to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. 

Inventoried or query pre-defined Azure built-in roles exist for certain resources through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Implement integration with any SIEM/monitoring tool based on your access to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in activity, audit, and risk event log sources.
Streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics Workspace. Configure desired alerts within the Log Analytics workspace.

## Inventory and asset management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Inventory and asset management](../security/benchmarks/security-control-inventory-asset-management.md).*

### 6.1: Use automated asset discovery solution

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Graph to query/discover all resources (such as compute, storage, network, ports, and protocols and so on) within your subscriptions. Ensure appropriate (read) permissions in your tenant and enumerate all Azure subscriptions as well as resources within your subscriptions.

Although classic Azure resources may be discovered via Resource Graph, it is highly recommended that you create and use Azure Resource Manager resources going forward.

## Incident response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

- [How to configure Workflow Automation within Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-planning-and-operations-guide.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.
