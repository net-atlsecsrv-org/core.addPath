# Filter network traffic with a network security group using the Azure CLI

You can filter network traffic inbound to and outbound from a virtual network subnet with a network security group. Network security groups contain security rules that filter network traffic by IP address, port, and protocol. Security rules are applied to resources deployed in a subnet. In this article, you learn how to:

* Create a network security group and security rules
* Create a virtual network and associate a network security group to a subnet
* Deploy virtual machines (VM) into a subnet
* Test traffic filters

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.28 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 


## Create a network security group

A network security group contains security rules. Security rules specify a source and destination. Sources and destinations can be application security groups.

### Create application security groups

First create a resource group for all the resources created in this article with [az group create](/cli/azure/group). The following example creates a resource group in the *eastus* location: 

```azurecli-interactive
az group create \
  --name myResourceGroup \
  --location eastus
```

Create an application security group with [az network asg create](/cli/azure/network/asg). An application security group enables you to group servers with similar port filtering requirements. The following example creates two application security groups.

```azurecli-interactive
az network asg create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAsgWebServers \
  --location eastus

az network asg create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAsgMgmtServers \
  --location eastus
```

### Create a network security group

Create a network security group with [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg). The following example creates a network security group named *myNsg*: 

```azurecli-interactive 
# Create a network security group
az network nsg create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myNsg
```

### Create security rules

Create a security rule with [az network nsg rule create](/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule). The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *myWebServers* application security group over ports 80 and 443:

```azurecli-interactive
az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --nsg-name myNsg \
  --name Allow-Web-All \
  --access Allow \
  --protocol Tcp \
  --direction Inbound \
  --priority 100 \
  --source-address-prefix Internet \
  --source-port-range "*" \
  --destination-asgs "myAsgWebServers" \
  --destination-port-range 80 443
```

The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the Internet to the *myMgmtServers* application security group over port 22:

```azurecli-interactive
az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --nsg-name myNsg \
  --name Allow-SSH-All \
  --access Allow \
  --protocol Tcp \
  --direction Inbound \
  --priority 110 \
  --source-address-prefix Internet \
  --source-port-range "*" \
  --destination-asgs "myAsgMgmtServers" \
  --destination-port-range 22
```

In this article, SSH (port 22) is exposed to the internet for the *myAsgMgmtServers* VM. For production environments, instead of exposing port 22 to the internet, it's recommended that you connect to Azure resources that you want to manage using a [VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [private](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) network connection.

## Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network with [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet). The following example creates a virtual named *myVirtualNetwork*:

```azurecli-interactive 
az network vnet create \
  --name myVirtualNetwork \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16
```

Add a subnet to a virtual network with [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet). The following example adds a subnet named *mySubnet* to the virtual network and associates the *myNsg* network security group to it:

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet create \
  --vnet-name myVirtualNetwork \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name mySubnet \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/24 \
  --network-security-group myNsg
```

## Create virtual machines

Create two VMs in the virtual network so you can validate traffic filtering in a later step. 

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm). The following example creates a VM that will serve as a web server. The `--asgs myAsgWebServers` option causes Azure to make the network interface it creates for the VM a member of the *myAsgWebServers* application security group.

The `--nsg ""` option is specified to prevent Azure from creating a default network security group for the network interface Azure creates when it creates the VM. To streamline this article, a password is used. Keys are typically used in production deployments. If you use keys, you must also configure SSH agent forwarding for the remaining steps. For more information, see the documentation for your SSH client. Replace `<replace-with-your-password>` in the following command with a password of your choosing.

```azurecli-interactive
adminPassword="<replace-with-your-password>"

az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVmWeb \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --vnet-name myVirtualNetwork \
  --subnet mySubnet \
  --nsg "" \
  --asgs myAsgWebServers \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --admin-password $adminPassword
```

The VM takes a few minutes to create. After the VM is created, output similar to the following example is returned: 

```output
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVmWeb",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "13.90.242.231",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}
```

Take note of the **publicIpAddress**. This address is used to access the VM from the internet in a later step.  Create a VM to serve as a management server:

```azurecli-interactive
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVmMgmt \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --vnet-name myVirtualNetwork \
  --subnet mySubnet \
  --nsg "" \
  --asgs myAsgMgmtServers \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --admin-password $adminPassword
```

The VM takes a few minutes to create. After the VM is created, note the **publicIpAddress** in the returned output. This address is used to access the VM in the next step. Don't continue with the next step until Azure finishes creating the VM.

## Test traffic filters

Use the command that follows to create an SSH session with the *myVmMgmt* VM. Replace *\<publicIpAddress>* with the public IP address of your VM. In the example above, the IP address is *13.90.242.231*.

```bash 
ssh azureuser@<publicIpAddress>
```

When prompted for a password, enter the password you entered in [Create VMs](#create-virtual-machines).

The connection succeeds, because port 22 is allowed inbound from the Internet to the *myAsgMgmtServers* application security group that the network interface attached to the *myVmMgmt* VM is in.

Use the following command to SSH to the *myVmWeb* VM from the *myVmMgmt* VM:

```bash 
ssh azureuser@myVmWeb
```

The connection succeeds because a default security rule within each network security group allows traffic over all ports between all IP addresses within a virtual network. You can't SSH to the *myVmWeb* VM from the Internet because the security rule for the *myAsgWebServers* doesn't allow port 22 inbound from the Internet.

Use the following commands to install the nginx web server on the *myVmWeb* VM:

```bash 
# Update package source
sudo apt-get -y update

# Install NGINX
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

The *myVmWeb* VM is allowed outbound to the Internet to retrieve nginx because a default security rule allows all outbound traffic to the Internet. Exit the *myVmWeb* SSH session, which leaves you at the `username@myVmMgmt:~$` prompt of the *myVmMgmt* VM. To retrieve the nginx welcome screen from the *myVmWeb* VM, enter the following command:

```bash
curl myVmWeb
```

Logout of the *myVmMgmt* VM. To confirm that you can access the *myVmWeb* web server from outside of Azure, enter `curl <publicIpAddress>` from your own computer. The connection succeeds, because port 80 is allowed inbound from the Internet to the *myAsgWebServers* application security group that the network interface attached to the *myVmWeb* VM is in.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```

## Next steps

In this article, you created a network security group and associated it to a virtual network subnet. To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](security-overview.md) and [Manage a network security group](manage-network-security-group.md).

Azure routes traffic between subnets by default. You may instead, choose to route traffic between subnets through a VM, serving as a firewall, for example. To learn how, see [Create a route table](tutorial-create-route-table-cli.md).
