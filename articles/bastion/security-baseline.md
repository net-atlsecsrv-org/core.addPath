# Azure security baseline for Azure Bastion

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Bastion. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Bastion. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Bastion have been excluded.

To see how Azure Bastion completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Bastion security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security.md).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

**Guidance**: When you deploy Azure Bastion resources you must create or use an existing virtual network. Ensure that all Azure virtual networks follow an enterprise segmentation principle that aligns to the business risks. Any system that could incur higher risk for the organization should be isolated within its own virtual network and sufficiently secured with a network security group (NSG).

Azure Bastion service requires following ports need to be open for service to function properly:

- Ingress Traffic:
   - Ingress Traffic from public internet: The Azure Bastion will create a public IP that needs port 443 enabled on the public IP for ingress traffic. Port 3389/22 are NOT required to be opened on the AzureBastionSubnet. 

   - Ingress Traffic from Azure Bastion control plane: For control plane connectivity, enable port 443 inbound from GatewayManager service tag. This enables the control plane, that is, Gateway Manager to be able to communicate with Azure Bastion.

- Egress Traffic:

   - Egress Traffic to target virtual machines (VMs): Azure Bastion will reach the target VMs over private IP. The NSGs need to allow egress traffic to other target VM subnets for port 3389 and 22.

   - Egress Traffic to other public endpoints in Azure: Azure Bastion needs to be able to connect to various public endpoints within Azure (for example, for storing diagnostics logs and metering logs). For this reason, Azure Bastion needs outbound to 443 to AzureCloud service tag.

Connectivity to Gateway Manager and Azure service tag is protected (locked down) by Azure certificates. External entities, including the consumers of those resources, can't communicate on these endpoints.

### NS-2: Connect private networks together

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion does not expose any endpoints that can be accessed via a private network. Azure Bastion supports deploying into a peered network to centralize your Bastion deployment and enable cross-network connectivity.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management.md).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) which is Azure's default identity and access management service. Users can access the Azure portal using Azure AD authentication to manage Azure Bastion service (create, update, and delete Bastion resources).

Connecting to virtual machines using Azure Bastion relies on either an SSH key or username/password, and currently does not support the use of Azure AD credentials.

In addition to an SSH key or username/password, when connecting to virtual machines using Azure Bastion your user will need the following role assignments:
- Reader role on the target virtual machine
- Reader role on the NIC with the private IP of the target virtual machine
- Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource

For more information, see the following references:

- [Connect to a Linux virtual machine using Azure Bastion](bastion-connect-vm-ssh.md)

- [Connect to a Windows virtual machine using Azure Bastion](bastion-connect-vm-rdp.md)

- [Azure built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion doesn't support SSO for authentication when authenticating to virtual machine resources, only SSH or username/password are supported. However, Azure Bastion uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide identity and access management for the overall service. Users can authenticate to Azure AD to access and manage their Azure Bastion resources, and experience seamless single-sign on with their own synced enterprise identities via Azure AD Connect.

- [Connect to a Windows virtual machine using Azure Bastion](bastion-connect-vm-rdp.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for access and management of the service. Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for your Azure AD tenant. Azure AD supports strong authentication controls through multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong passwordless methods.  
- Multi-factor authentication: Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center identity and access management recommendations for your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all users, select users, or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors. 

- Passwordless authentication: Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app,  and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards. 

- [How to enable MFA in Azure](../active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted.md)

- [Introduction to passwordless authentication options for Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Enable diagnostics logs for Azure Bastion remote sessions and use these logs to view which users connected to which workloads, at what time, from where, and other such relevant logging information. Create alerts for certain logged Bastion sessions using Azure Monitor to be notified when there are anomalies detected in the logs.

- [You can find more information about how to enable diagnostics logging here](diagnostic-logs.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-6: Restrict Azure resource access based on conditions

**Guidance**: You can only access Azure Bastion service via the Azure portal, access to Azure portal can be restricted using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) conditional access. Use Azure AD conditional access for more granular access control based on user-defined conditions, such as requiring user logins from certain IP ranges to use MFA.

Customer can also use different role-based access control policies at domain joined virtual machines level to further restrict access to the virtual machine.

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access.md).*

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted access to connect to certain virtual machines. Be sure to follow the principle of least privilege so that users only have the permissions needed to perform their specific tasks.

Ensure that you also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts and Azure RBAC to manage its resources. Review user accounts and access assignment regularly to ensure the accounts and their access are valid. You can use Azure AD access reviews to review group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. Azure AD reporting can provide logs to help discover stale accounts. You can also use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to create access review report workflow to facilitate the review process.

In addition, Azure Privileged Identity Management can also be configured to alert when an excessive number of administrator accounts are created, and to identify administrator accounts that are stale or improperly configured.

- [How to use Azure AD identity and access reviews](../active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-4: Set up emergency access in Azure AD

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion is integrated with Azure Active Directory and Azure RBAC to manage its resources. To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.

- [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](../active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-5: Automate entitlement management 

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Azure RBAC to manage its resources. Use Azure AD entitlement management features to automate access request workflows, including access assignments, reviews, and expiration. Dual or multi-stage approval is also supported.

- [What is Azure AD entitlement management](../active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. Depending on your requirements, you can use highly secured user workstations for performing administrative management tasks with your Azure Bastion resources in production environments. Use Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and/or Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration, including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, and restricted logical and network access. 

- [Understand privileged access workstations](../active-directory/devices/concept-azure-managed-workstation.md)

- [Deploy a privileged access workstation](../active-directory/devices/howto-azure-managed-workstation.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion is integrated with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these built-in roles to users, groups, service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically. Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom roles when required.

When connecting to virtual machines using Azure Bastion your user will need the following role assignments:
- Reader role on the target virtual machine
- Reader role on the NIC with the private IP of the target virtual machine
- Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource

For more information, see the following references:

- [Connect to a Linux virtual machine using Azure Bastion](bastion-connect-vm-ssh.md)

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management.md).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Note: Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

- [Overview of Azure Management Groups](../governance/management-groups/overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-2: Ensure security team has access to asset inventory and metadata

**Guidance**: Apply tags to your Azure Bastion resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production. Ensure that security teams have access to a continuously updated inventory of assets on Azure. They can use Azure Resource Graph to query and discover all resources in your subscriptions, including Azure services, applications, and network resources.

- [How to create queries with Azure Resource Graph Explorer](../governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal.md)

- [Azure Security Center asset inventory management](../security-center/asset-inventory.md)

- [For more information about tagging assets, see the resource naming and tagging decision guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/decision-guides/resource-tagging/?toc=%2fazure%2fazure-resource-manager%2fmanagement%2ftoc.json)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-3: Use only approved Azure services

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy to audit and restrict which services users can provision in your environment, this includes being able to allow or deny deployments of Azure Bastion resources. Use Azure Resource Graph to query for and discover resources within their subscriptions. You can also use Azure Monitor to create rules to trigger alerts when a non-approved service is detected.

- [How to configure and manage Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

- [How to deny a specific resource type with Azure Policy](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md#general)

- [How to create queries with Azure Resource Graph Explorer](../governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-4: Ensure security of asset lifecycle management

**Guidance**: Remove access to Azure Bastion resources that have been deployed when they are no longer needed to minimize attack surface. Users can manage their Azure Bastion resources via the Azure portal, CLI, or REST APIs. You can also delete or force-disconnect an ongoing remote session if it is no longer needed or identified as a potential threat.

- [Azure network CLI](/powershell/module/az.network/?preserve-view=true&view=azps-5.1.0#networking)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-5: Limit users' ability to interact with Azure Resource Manager

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and authentication. You can use Azure Conditional Access to limit users' ability to interact with Azure Resources Manager by configuring "Block access" for the "Microsoft Azure Management" App.

- [How to configure Conditional Access to block access to Azure Resources Manager](../role-based-access-control/conditional-access-azure-management.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-data-protection).*

### LT-2: Enable threat detection for Azure identity and access management

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion integrates with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and the service is accessed over the Azure portal. By default management actions to the service (such as create, update, and delete) are captured via the Azure Activity Log. Users should also enable Azure Bastion resource logs, such as session BastionAuditLogs to track bastion sessions.

Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases: 
-	Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

-	Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

-	Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

-	Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as an excessive number of failed authentication attempts, and deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (such as virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (such as SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you to see account anomalies inside the individual resources.

- [Threat protection in Azure Security Center](../security-center/azure-defender.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-3: Enable logging for Azure network activities

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Bastion resource logs, use these diagnostics logs to view which users connected to which workloads, at what time, from where, and other such relevant logging information. Users can configure these logs to be sent to a storage account for long-term retention and auditing.

Enable and collect network security group (NSG) resource logs and NSG flow logs on the network security groups that are applied to the virtual networks you have your Azure Bastion resource deployed. These logs can then be used for analyzing network security and to support incident investigations, threat hunting, and security alert generation. You can send the flow logs to an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-5: Centralize security log management and analysis

**Guidance**: Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation. For each log source, ensure you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements.

Ensure you are integrating Azure activity logs into your central logging. Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

In addition, enable and onboard data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

Many organizations choose to use Azure Sentinel for “hot” data that is used frequently and Azure Storage for “cold” data that is used less frequently.

- [Incident response reference guide](/microsoft-365/downloads/IR-Reference-Guide.pdf)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-2: Preparation – setup incident notification

**Guidance**: Set up security incident contact information in Azure Security Center. This contact information is used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. You also have options to customize incident alert and notification in different Azure services based on your incident response needs. 

- [How to set the Azure Security Center security contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high-quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives.

High-quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high-quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

- [How to stream alerts into Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/connect-azure-security-center.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

### GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy 

**Guidance**: Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.
