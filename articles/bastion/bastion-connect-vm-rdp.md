# Connect to a Windows virtual machine using Azure Bastion

This article shows you how to securely and seamlessly RDP to your Windows VMs in an Azure virtual network using Azure Bastion. You can connect to a VM directly from the Azure portal. When using Azure Bastion, VMs don't require a client, agent, or additional software. For more information about Azure Bastion, see the [Overview](bastion-overview.md).

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have set up an Azure Bastion host for the virtual network in which the VM resides. For more information, see [Create an Azure Bastion host](bastion-create-host-portal.md). Once the Bastion service is provisioned and deployed in your virtual network, you can use it to connect to any VM in this virtual network. Bastion assumes that you are using RDP to connect to a Windows VM, and SSH to connect to your Linux VMs. For information about connection to a Linux VM, see [Connect to a VM - Linux](bastion-connect-vm-ssh.md).

In order to make a connection, the following roles are required:

* Reader role on the virtual machine
* Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine
* Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Navigate to the virtual machine that you want to connect to, then click **Connect**. The VM should be a Windows virtual machine when using an RDP connection.

1. After you click Connect, a side bar appears that has three tabs â€“ RDP, SSH, and Bastion. If Bastion was provisioned for the virtual network, the Bastion tab is active by default. If you didn't provision Bastion for the virtual network, you can click the link to configure Bastion. For configuration instructions, see [Configure Bastion](bastion-create-host-portal.md).

1. On the Bastion tab, the username and password for your virtual machine, then click **Connect**. The RDP connection to this virtual machine via Bastion will open directly in the Azure portal (over HTML5) using port 443 and the Bastion service.
