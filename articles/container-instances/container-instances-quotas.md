# Quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances

All Azure services include certain default limits and quotas for resources and features. This article details the default quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances.

Availability of compute, memory, and storage resources for Azure Container Instances varies by region and operating system. For details, see [Resource availability for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-region-availability.md).

Use the [List Usage](/rest/api/container-instances/location/listusage) API to review current quota usage in a region for a subscription.
