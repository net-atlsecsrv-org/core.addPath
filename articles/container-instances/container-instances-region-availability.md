# Resource availability for Azure Container Instances in Azure regions

This article details the availability of Azure Container Instances compute and memory resources in Azure regions. 

Values presented are the maximum resources available per deployment of a [container group](container-instances-container-groups.md). Values are current at time of publication. 

> [!NOTE]
> Container groups created within these resource limits are subject to availability within the deployment region. When a region is under heavy load, you may experience a failure when deploying instances. To mitigate such a deployment failure, try deploying instances with lower resource settings, or try your deployment at a later time.

For information about quotas and other limits in your deployments, see [Quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).
