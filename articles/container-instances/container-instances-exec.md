# Execute a command in a running Azure container instance

Azure Container Instances supports executing a command in a running container. Running a command in a container you've already started is especially helpful during application development and troubleshooting. The most common use of this feature is to launch an interactive shell so that you can debug issues in a running container.

## Run a command with Azure CLI

Execute a command in a running container with [az container exec][az-container-exec] in the [Azure CLI][azure-cli]:

```azurecli
az container exec --resource-group <group-name> --name <container-group-name> --exec-command "<command>"
```

For example, to launch a Bash shell in an Nginx container:

```azurecli
az container exec --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mynginx --exec-command "/bin/bash"
```

In the example output below, the Bash shell is launched in a running Linux container, providing a terminal in which `ls` is executed:

```console
$ az container exec --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mynginx --exec-command "/bin/bash"
root@caas-83e6c883014b427f9b277a2bba3b7b5f-708716530-2qv47:/# ls
bin   dev  home  lib64	mnt  proc  run	 srv  tmp  var
boot  etc  lib	 media	opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
root@caas-83e6c883014b427f9b277a2bba3b7b5f-708716530-2qv47:/# exit
exit
Bye.
```

In this example, Command Prompt is launched in a running Nanoserver container:

```console
$ az container exec --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myiis --exec-command "cmd.exe"

C:\>exit
Bye.
```

## Multi-container groups

If your [container group](container-instances-container-groups.md) has multiple containers, such as an application container and a logging sidecar, specify the name of the container in which to run the command with `--container-name`.

For example, in the container group *mynginx* are two containers, *nginx-app* and *logger*. To launch a shell on the *nginx-app* container:

```azurecli
az container exec --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mynginx --container-name nginx-app --exec-command "/bin/bash"
```

## Restrictions

Azure Container Instances currently supports launching a single process with [az container exec][az-container-exec], and you cannot pass command arguments. For example, you cannot chain commands like in `sh -c "echo FOO && echo BAR"`, or execute `echo FOO`.
