# Tutorial: Deploy a multi-container group using a YAML file

Azure Container Instances supports the deployment of multiple containers onto a single host using a [container group](container-instances-container-groups.md). A container group is useful when building an application sidecar for logging, monitoring, or any other configuration where a service needs a second attached process.

In this tutorial, you follow steps to run a simple two-container sidecar configuration by deploying a [YAML file](container-instances-reference-yaml.md) using the Azure CLI. A YAML file provides a concise format for specifying the instance settings. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure a YAML file
> * Deploy the container group
> * View the logs of the containers

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-container groups are currently restricted to Linux containers.

## Configure a YAML file

To deploy a multi-container group with the [az container create][az-container-create] command in the Azure CLI, you must specify the container group configuration in a YAML file. Then pass the YAML file as a parameter to the command.

Start by copying the following YAML into a new file named **deploy-aci.yaml**. In Azure Cloud Shell, you can use Visual Studio Code to create the file in your working directory:

```
code deploy-aci.yaml
```

This YAML file defines a container group named "myContainerGroup" with two containers, a public IP address, and two exposed ports. The containers are deployed from public Microsoft images. The first container in the group runs an internet-facing web application. The second container, the sidecar, periodically makes HTTP requests to the web application running in the first container via the container group's local network.

```YAML
apiVersion: 2019-12-01
location: eastus
name: myContainerGroup
properties:
  containers:
  - name: aci-tutorial-app
    properties:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1
          memoryInGb: 1.5
      ports:
      - port: 80
      - port: 8080
  - name: aci-tutorial-sidecar
    properties:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-tutorial-sidecar
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1
          memoryInGb: 1.5
  osType: Linux
  ipAddress:
    type: Public
    ports:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 80
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 8080
tags: {exampleTag: tutorial}
type: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
```

To use a private container image registry, add the `imageRegistryCredentials` property to the container group, with values modified for your environment:

```YAML
  imageRegistryCredentials:
  - server: imageRegistryLoginServer
    username: imageRegistryUsername
    password: imageRegistryPassword
```

## Deploy the container group

Create a resource group with the [az group create][az-group-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Deploy the container group with the [az container create][az-container-create] command, passing the YAML file as an argument:

```azurecli-interactive
az container create --resource-group myResourceGroup --file deploy-aci.yaml
```

Within a few seconds, you should receive an initial response from Azure.

## View deployment state

To view the state of the deployment, use the following [az container show][az-container-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerGroup --output table
```

If you'd like to view the running application, navigate to its IP address in your browser. For example, the IP is `52.168.26.124` in this example output:

```console
Name              ResourceGroup    Status    Image                                                                                               IP:ports              Network    CPU/Memory       OsType    Location
----------------  ---------------  --------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------  ---------  ---------------  --------  ----------
myContainerGroup  danlep0318r      Running   mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-tutorial-sidecar,mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest  20.42.26.114:80,8080  Public     1.0 core/1.5 gb  Linux     eastus
```

## View container logs

View the log output of a container using the [az container logs][az-container-logs] command. The `--container-name` argument specifies the container from which to pull logs. In this example, the `aci-tutorial-app` container is specified.

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerGroup --container-name aci-tutorial-app
```

Output:

```console
listening on port 80
::1 - - [02/Jul/2020:23:17:48 +0000] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "curl/7.54.0"
::1 - - [02/Jul/2020:23:17:51 +0000] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "curl/7.54.0"
::1 - - [02/Jul/2020:23:17:54 +0000] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "curl/7.54.0"
```

To see the logs for the sidecar container, run a similar command specifying the `aci-tutorial-sidecar` container.

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerGroup --container-name aci-tutorial-sidecar
```

Output:

```console
Every 3s: curl -I http://localhost                          2020-07-02 20:36:41

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0  1663    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

As you can see, the sidecar is periodically making an HTTP request to the main web application via the group's local network to ensure that it is running. This sidecar example could be expanded to trigger an alert if it received an HTTP response code other than `200 OK`.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you used a YAML file to deploy a multi-container group in Azure Container Instances. You learned how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure a YAML file for a multi-container group
> * Deploy the container group
> * View the logs of the containers

You can also specify a multi-container group using a [Resource Manager template](container-instances-multi-container-group.md). A Resource Manager template can be readily adapted for scenarios when you need to deploy additional Azure service resources with the container group.
