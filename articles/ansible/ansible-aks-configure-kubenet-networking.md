# Tutorial: Configure kubenet networking in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Ansible

[!INCLUDE [ansible-28-note.md](../../includes/ansible-28-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-intro-aks.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-intro-aks.md)]

Using AKS,  you can deploy a cluster using the following network models:

- [Kubenet networking](/azure/aks/configure-kubenet) - Network resources are typically created and configured as the AKS cluster is deployed.
- [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) networking](/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) - AKS cluster is connected to existing virtual network resources and configurations.

For more information about networking to your applications in AKS, see [Network concepts for applications in AKS](/azure/aks/concepts-network).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]
[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-create-service-principal.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-create-service-principal.md)]

## Create a virtual network and subnet

The playbook code in this section creates the following Azure resources:

- Virtual network
- Subnet within the virtual network

Save the following playbook as `vnet.yml`:

```yml
- name: Create vnet
  azure_rm_virtualnetwork:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ name }}"
      address_prefixes_cidr:
          - 10.0.0.0/8

- name: Create subnet
  azure_rm_subnet:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ name }}"
      address_prefix_cidr: 10.240.0.0/16
      virtual_network_name: "{{ name }}"
  register: subnet
```

## Create an AKS cluster in the virtual network

The playbook code in this section creates an AKS cluster within a virtual network. 

Save the following playbook as `aks.yml`:

```yml
- name: List supported kubernetes version from Azure
  azure_rm_aks_version:
      location: "{{ location }}"
  register: versions

- name: Create AKS cluster with vnet
  azure_rm_aks:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ name }}"
      dns_prefix: "{{ name }}"
      kubernetes_version: "{{ versions.azure_aks_versions[-1] }}"
      agent_pool_profiles:
        - count: 3
          name: nodepool1
          vm_size: Standard_D2_v2
          vnet_subnet_id: "{{ vnet_subnet_id }}"
      linux_profile:
          admin_username: azureuser
          ssh_key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
      service_principal:
          client_id: "{{ lookup('ini', 'client_id section=default file=~/.azure/credentials') }}"
          client_secret: "{{ lookup('ini', 'secret section=default file=~/.azure/credentials') }}"
      network_profile:
          network_plugin: kubenet
          pod_cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
          docker_bridge_cidr: 172.17.0.1/16
          dns_service_ip: 10.0.0.10
          service_cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  register: aks
```

Here are some key notes to consider when working with the sample playbook:

- Use `azure_rm_aks_version` module to find the supported version.
- The `vnet_subnet_id` is the subnet created in the previous section.
- The `network_profile` defines the properties for the kubenet network plug-in.
- The `service_cidr` is used to assign internal services in the AKS cluster to an IP address. This IP address range should be an address space that isn't used elsewhere in your network. 
- The `dns_service_ip` address should be the ".10" address of your service IP address range.
- The `pod_cidr` should be a large address space that isn't in use elsewhere in your network environment. The address range must be large enough to accommodate the number of nodes that you expect to scale up to. You can't change this address range once the cluster is deployed.
- The pod IP address range is used to assign a /24 address space to each node in the cluster. In the following example, the `pod_cidr` of 192.168.0.0/16 assigns the first node 192.168.0.0/24, the second node 192.168.1.0/24, and the third node 192.168.2.0/24.
- As the cluster scales or upgrades, Azure continues to assign a pod IP address range to each new node.
- The playbook loads `ssh_key` from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If you modify it, use the single-line format - starting with "ssh-rsa" (without the quotes).
- The `client_id` and `client_secret` values are loaded from `~/.azure/credentials`, which is the default credential file. You can set these values to your service principal or load these values from environment variables:

    ```yml
    client_id: "{{ lookup('env', 'AZURE_CLIENT_ID') }}"
    client_secret: "{{ lookup('env', 'AZURE_SECRET') }}"
    ```

## Associate the network resources

When you create an AKS cluster, a network security group and route table are created. These resources are managed by AKS and updated when you create and expose services. Associate the network security group and route table with your virtual network subnet as follows. 

Save the following playbook as `associate.yml`.

```yml
- name: Get route table
  azure_rm_routetable_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ node_resource_group }}"
  register: routetable

- name: Get network security group
  azure_rm_securitygroup_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ node_resource_group }}"
  register: nsg

- name: Parse subnet id
  set_fact:
      subnet_name: "{{ vnet_subnet_id | regex_search(subnet_regex, '\\1') }}"
      subnet_rg: "{{ vnet_subnet_id | regex_search(rg_regex, '\\1') }}"
      subnet_vn: "{{ vnet_subnet_id | regex_search(vn_regex, '\\1') }}"
  vars:
      subnet_regex: '/subnets/(.+)'
      rg_regex: '/resourceGroups/(.+?)/'
      vn_regex: '/virtualNetworks/(.+?)/'

- name: Associate network resources with the node subnet
  azure_rm_subnet:
      name: "{{ subnet_name[0] }}"
      resource_group: "{{  subnet_rg[0] }}"
      virtual_network_name: "{{ subnet_vn[0] }}"
      security_group: "{{ nsg.ansible_facts.azure_securitygroups[0].id }}"
      route_table: "{{ routetable.route_tables[0].id }}"
```

Here are some key notes to consider when working with the sample playbook:

- The `node_resource_group` is the resource group name in which the AKS nodes are created.
- The `vnet_subnet_id` is the subnet created in previous section.


## Run the sample playbook

This section lists the complete sample playbook that calls the tasks creating in this article. 

Save the following playbook as `aks-kubenet.yml`:

```yml
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
      resource_group: aksansibletest
      name: aksansibletest
      location: eastus
  tasks:
     - name: Ensure resource group exist
       azure_rm_resourcegroup:
           name: "{{ resource_group }}"
           location: "{{ location }}"

     - name: Create vnet
       include_tasks: vnet.yml

     - name: Create AKS
       vars:
           vnet_subnet_id: "{{ subnet.state.id }}"
       include_tasks: aks.yml

     - name: Associate network resources with the node subnet
       vars:
           vnet_subnet_id: "{{ subnet.state.id }}"
           node_resource_group: "{{ aks.node_resource_group }}"
       include_tasks: associate.yml

     - name: Get details of the AKS
       azure_rm_aks_facts:
           name: "{{ name }}"
           resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
           show_kubeconfig: user
       register: output

     - name: Show AKS cluster detail
       debug:
           var: output.aks[0]
```

In the `vars` section, make the following changes:

- For the `resource_group` key, change the `aksansibletest` value to your resource group name.
- For the `name` key, change the `aksansibletest` value to your AKS name.
- For the `Location` key, change the `eastus` value to your resource group location.

Run the complete playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook aks-kubenet.yml
```

Running the playbook shows results similar to the following output:

```Output

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resources created in this article. 

Save the following code as `cleanup.yml`:

```yml
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
      resource_group: aksansibletest
  tasks:
      - name: Clean up resource group
        azure_rm_resourcegroup:
            name: "{{ resource_group }}"
            state: absent
            force: yes
```

In the `vars` section, replace the `{{ resource_group_name }}` placeholder with the name of your resource group.

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook cleanup.yml
```
