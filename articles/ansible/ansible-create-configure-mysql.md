# Tutorial: Configure databases in Azure Database for MySQL using Ansible

[!INCLUDE [ansible-27-note.md](../../includes/ansible-27-note.md)]

[Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/overview) is a relational database service based on the MySQL Community Edition. Azure Database for MySQL enables you to manage MySQL databases in your web apps.

> * Create a MySql server
> * Create a MySql database
> * Configure a filewall rule so that an external app can connect to your server
> * Connect to your MySql server from the Azure cloud shell
> * Query your available MySQL servers
> * List all databases in your connected servers

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]
[!INCLUDE [ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md](../../includes/ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md)]

## Create a resource group

The playbook code in this section creates an Azure resource group. A resource group is a logical container in which Azure resources are deployed and managed.  

Save the following playbook as `rg.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    location: eastus 
  tasks:
    - name: Create a resource group
      azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: "{{ resource_group }}"
        location: "{{ location }}"
```

Before running the playbook, see the following notes:

* A resource group named `myResourceGroup` is created.
* The resource group is created in the `eastus` location:

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook rg.yml
```

## Create a MySQL server and database

The playbook code in this section creates a MySQL server and an Azure Database for MySQL instance. The new MySQL server is a Gen 5 Basic Purpose server with one vCore and is named `mysqlserveransible`. The database instance is named `mysqldbansible`.

For more information about pricing tiers, see [Azure Database for MySQL pricing tiers](/azure/mysql/concepts-pricing-tiers). 

Save the following playbook as `mysql_create.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    location: eastus
    mysqlserver_name: mysqlserveransible
    mysqldb_name: mysqldbansible
    admin_username: mysqladmin
    admin_password: <server_admin_password> 
  tasks:
    - name: Create MySQL Server
      azure_rm_mysqlserver:
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
        name: "{{ mysqlserver_name }}"
        sku:
          name: B_Gen5_1
          tier: Basic
        location: "{{ location }}"
        version: 5.6
        enforce_ssl: True
        admin_username: "{{ admin_username }}"
        admin_password: "{{ admin_password }}"
        storage_mb: 51200
    - name: Create instance of MySQL Database
      azure_rm_mysqldatabase:
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
        server_name: "{{ mysqlserver_name }}"
        name: "{{ mysqldb_name }}"
```

Before running the playbook, see the following notes:

* In the `vars` section, the value of `mysqlserver_name` must be unique.
* In the `vars` section, replace `<server_admin_password>` with a password.

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook mysql_create.yml
```

## Configure a firewall rule

A server-level firewall rule allows an external app to connect to your server through the Azure MySQL service firewall. Examples of external apps are the `mysql` command-line tool and the MySQL Workbench.

The playbook code in this section creates a firewall rule named `extenalaccess` that allows connections from any external IP address. 

Save the following playbook as `mysql_firewall.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    mysqlserver_name: mysqlserveransible
  tasks:
  - name: Open firewall to access MySQL Server from outside
    azure_rm_resource:
      api_version: '2017-12-01'
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      provider: dbformysql
      resource_type: servers
      resource_name: "{{ mysqlserver_name }}"
      subresource:
        - type: firewallrules
          name: externalaccess
      body:
        properties:
          startIpAddress: "0.0.0.0"
          endIpAddress: "255.255.255.255"
```

Before running the playbook, see the following notes:

* In the vars section, replace `startIpAddress` and `endIpAddress`. Use the range of IP addresses that correspond to the range from which you'll be connecting.
* Connections to Azure Database for MySQL communicate over port 3306. If you try to connect from within a corporate network, outbound traffic over port 3306 might not be allowed. In that case, you can't connect to your server unless your IT department opens port 3306.
* The playbook uses the `azure_rm_resource` module, which allows direct use of the REST API.

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook mysql_firewall.yml
```

## Connect to the server

In this section, you use the Azure cloud shell to connect to the server you created previously.

1. Select the **Try It** button in the following code:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    mysql -h mysqlserveransible.mysql.database.azure.com -u mysqladmin@mysqlserveransible -p
    ```

1. At the prompt, enter the following command to query the server status:

    ```sql
    mysql> status
    ```
    
    If everything goes well, you see output similar to the following results:
    
    ```
    demo@Azure:~$ mysql -h mysqlserveransible.mysql.database.azure.com -u mysqladmin@mysqlserveransible -p
    Enter password:

## Query MySQL servers

The playbook code in this section queries MySQL servers in `myResourceGroup` and lists the databases on the found servers.

Save the following playbook as `mysql_query.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    mysqlserver_name: mysqlserveransible
  tasks:
    - name: Query MySQL Servers in current resource group
      azure_rm_mysqlserver_facts:
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      register: mysqlserverfacts

    - name: Dump MySQL Server facts
      debug:
        var: mysqlserverfacts

    - name: Query MySQL Databases
      azure_rm_mysqldatabase_facts:
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
        server_name: "{{ mysqlserver_name }}"
      register: mysqldatabasefacts

    - name: Dump MySQL Database Facts
      debug:
        var: mysqldatabasefacts
```

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook mysql_query.yml
```

After running the playbook, you see output similar to the following results:

```json
"servers": [
    {
        "admin_username": "mysqladmin",
        "enforce_ssl": false,
        "fully_qualified_domain_name": "mysqlserveransible.mysql.database.azure.com",
        "id": "/subscriptions/685ba005-af8d-4b04-8f16-a7bf38b2eb5a/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/mysqlserveransible",
        "location": "eastus",
        "name": "mysqlserveransible",
        "resource_group": "myResourceGroup",
        "sku": {
            "capacity": 1,
            "family": "Gen5",
            "name": "B_Gen5_1",
            "tier": "Basic"
        },
        "storage_mb": 5120,
        "user_visible_state": "Ready",
        "version": "5.6"
    }
]
```

You also see the following output for the MySQL database:

```json
"databases": [
    {
        "charset": "utf8",
        "collation": "utf8_general_ci",
        "name": "information_schema",
        "resource_group": "myResourceGroup",
        "server_name": "mysqlserveransible"
    },
    {
        "charset": "latin1",
        "collation": "latin1_swedish_ci",
        "name": "mysql",
        "resource_group": "myResourceGroup",
        "server_name": "mysqlserveransibler"
    },
    {
        "charset": "latin1",
        "collation": "latin1_swedish_ci",
        "name": "mysqldbansible",
        "resource_group": "myResourceGroup",
        "server_name": "mysqlserveransible"
    },
    {
        "charset": "utf8",
        "collation": "utf8_general_ci",
        "name": "performance_schema",
        "resource_group": "myResourceGroup",
        "server_name": "mysqlserveransible"
    }
]
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resources created in this article. 

Save the following playbook as `cleanup.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
  tasks:
    - name: Delete a resource group
      azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: "{{ resource_group }}"
        state: absent
```

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook cleanup.yml
```
