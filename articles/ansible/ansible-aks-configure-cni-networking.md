# Tutorial: Configure Azure CNI networking in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Ansible

[!INCLUDE [ansible-28-note.md](../../includes/ansible-28-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-intro-aks.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-intro-aks.md)]

Using AKS,  you can deploy a cluster using the following network models:

- [Kubenet networking](/azure/aks/configure-kubenet) - Network resources are typically created and configured as the AKS cluster is deployed.
- [Azure CNI networking](/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) - AKS cluster is connected to existing virtual network (VNET) resources and configurations.

For more information about networking to your applications in AKS, see [Network concepts for applications in AKS](/azure/aks/concepts-network).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]
[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-create-service-principal.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-create-service-principal.md)]
[!INCLUDE [ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md](../../includes/ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md)] 

## Create a virtual network and subnet

The sample playbook code in this section is used to:

- Create a virtual network
- Create a subnet within the virtual network

Save the following playbook as `vnet.yml`:

```yml
- name: Create vnet
  azure_rm_virtualnetwork:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ name }}"
      address_prefixes_cidr:
          - 10.0.0.0/8

- name: Create subnet
  azure_rm_subnet:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ name }}"
      address_prefix_cidr: 10.240.0.0/16
      virtual_network_name: "{{ name }}"
  register: subnet
```

## Create an AKS cluster in the virtual network

The sample playbook code in this section is used to:

- Create an AKS cluster within a virtual network.

Save the following playbook as `aks.yml`:

```yml
- name: List supported kubernetes version from Azure
  azure_rm_aks_version:
      location: "{{ location }}"
  register: versions

- name: Create AKS cluster within a VNet
  azure_rm_aks:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ name }}"
      dns_prefix: "{{ name }}"
      kubernetes_version: "{{ versions.azure_aks_versions[-1] }}"
      agent_pool_profiles:
        - count: 3
          name: nodepool1
          vm_size: Standard_D2_v2
          vnet_subnet_id: "{{ vnet_subnet_id }}"
      linux_profile:
          admin_username: azureuser
          ssh_key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
      service_principal:
          client_id: "{{ lookup('ini', 'client_id section=default file=~/.azure/credentials') }}"
          client_secret: "{{ lookup('ini', 'secret section=default file=~/.azure/credentials') }}"
      network_profile:
          network_plugin: azure
          docker_bridge_cidr: 172.17.0.1/16
          dns_service_ip: 10.2.0.10
          service_cidr: 10.2.0.0/24
  register: aks
```

Here are some key notes to consider when working with the sample playbook:

- Use the `azure_rm_aks_version` module to find the supported version.
- The `vnet_subnet_id` is the subnet created in the previous section.
- The playbook loads `ssh_key` from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If you modify it, use the single-line format - starting with "ssh-rsa" (without the quotes).
- The `client_id` and `client_secret` values are loaded from `~/.azure/credentials`, which is the default credential file. You can set these values to your service principal or load these values from environment variables:

    ```yml
    client_id: "{{ lookup('env', 'AZURE_CLIENT_ID') }}"
    client_secret: "{{ lookup('env', 'AZURE_SECRET') }}"
    ```

## Run the sample playbook

The sample playbook code in this section is used to test various features shown throughout this tutorial.

Save the following playbook as `aks-azure-cni.yml`:

```yml
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
      resource_group: aksansibletest
      name: aksansibletest
      location: eastus
  tasks:
     - name: Ensure resource group exists
       azure_rm_resourcegroup:
           name: "{{ resource_group }}"
           location: "{{ location }}"

     - name: Create vnet
       include_tasks: vnet.yml

     - name: Create AKS
       vars:
           vnet_subnet_id: "{{ subnet.state.id }}"
       include_tasks: aks.yml

     - name: Show AKS cluster detail
       debug:
           var: aks
```

Here are some key notes to consider when working with the sample playbook:

- Change the `aksansibletest` value to your resource group name.
- Change the `aksansibletest` value to your AKS name.
- Change the `eastus` value to your resource group location.

Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command:

```bash
ansible-playbook aks-azure-cni.yml
```

After running the playbook, you see output similar to the following results:

```Output

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resources created in this article. 

The sample playbook code in this section is used to:

- Delete a resource group referred to in the `vars` section.

Save the following playbook as `cleanup.yml`:

```yml
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
      resource_group: {{ resource_group_name }}
  tasks:
      - name: Clean up resource group
        azure_rm_resourcegroup:
            name: "{{ resource_group }}"
            state: absent
            force: yes
```

Here are some key notes to consider when working with the sample playbook:

- Replace the `{{ resource_group_name }}` placeholder with the name of your resource group.
- All resources within the specified resource group will be deleted.

Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command:

```bash
ansible-playbook cleanup.yml
```
