# What is Azure Lighthouse?

Azure Lighthouse enables cross- and multi-tenant management, allowing for higher automation, scalability, and enhanced governance across resources and tenants. With Azure Lighthouse, service providers can deliver managed services using comprehensive and robust management tooling built into the Azure platform. This offering can also benefit enterprise IT organizations managing resources across multiple tenants.

## Benefits

Azure Lighthouse helps you to profitably and efficiently build and deliver managed services. The benefits include:

- **Management at scale**: Customer engagement and life-cycle operations to manage customer resources are easier and more scalable. Existing APIs, management tools, and workflows can be used with delegated resources, regardless of the regions in which theyâ€™re located.
- **Greater visibility and precision for customers**: Customers will have greater visibility into your actions and precise control over the scope they delegate for management, including the ability to remove access completely, while your IP is preserved.
- **Comprehensive and unified platform tooling**: Our tooling experience addresses key service provider scenarios, including multiple licensing models such as EA, CSP and pay-as-you-go. The new capabilities work with existing tools and APIs, licensing models, and partner programs such as the [Cloud Solution Provider program (CSP)](/partner-center/csp-overview). Azure Lighthouse can be integrated into your existing workflows and applications, and you can track your impact on customer engagements and receive partner earned credit by [linking your partner ID](./how-to/partner-earned-credit.md).

There are no additional costs associated with using Azure Lighthouse to manage Azure resources. Any Azure customer or partner can use Azure Lighthouse.

## Capabilities

Azure Lighthouse includes multiple ways to help streamline engagement and management:

- **Azure delegated resource management**: Manage your customers' Azure resources securely from within your own tenant, without having to switch context and control planes. Subscriptions and resource groups can be delegated to specified users and roles in the managing tenant, with the ability to remove access as needed. For more info, see [Azure delegated resource management](concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md).
- **New Azure portal experiences**: View cross-tenant information in the [**My customers** page](./how-to/view-manage-customers.md) in the Azure portal. A corresponding [**Service providers** page](how-to/view-manage-service-providers.md) lets customers view and manage their service provider access.
- **Azure Resource Manager templates**: Our templates help you perform cross-tenant management tasks and onboard delegated customer resources. For more info, see our [samples repo](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Lighthouse-samples/tree/master/templates) and [Onboard a customer to Azure Lighthouse](how-to/onboard-customer.md).
- **Managed Service offers in Azure Marketplace**: Offer your services to customers through private or public offers, and have them automatically onboarded to Azure Lighthouse. For more info, see [Managed Service offers in Azure Marketplace](concepts/managed-services-offers.md).
