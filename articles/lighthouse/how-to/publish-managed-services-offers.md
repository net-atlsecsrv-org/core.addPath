# Publish a Managed Service offer to Azure Marketplace

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting April 13th, 2020, we'll begin moving management of your Managed Service offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Create a new Managed Service offer](../../marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-managed-service-offer.md) to manage your migrated offers.

In this article, you'll learn how to publish a public or private Managed Service offer to [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) using [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). Customers who purchase the offer are then able to to onboard subscriptions and resource groups for [Azure delegated resource management](../concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md).

## Publishing requirements

You need to have a valid [account in Partner Center](../../marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account.md) to create and publish offers. If you don't have an account already, the [sign-up process](https://aka.ms/joinmarketplace) will lead you through the steps of creating an account in Partner Center and enrolling in the Commercial Marketplace program.

Per the [Managed Service offer certification requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#7004-business-requirements), you must have a [Silver or Gold Cloud Platform competency level](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/learn-about-competencies) or be an [Azure Expert MSP](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/azure-expert-msp) in order to publish a Managed Service offer.

Your Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID will be [automatically associated](../../billing/billing-partner-admin-link-started.md) with the offers you publish to track your impact across customer engagements.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to publish an offer to Azure Marketplace, you can onboard customers manually by using Azure Resource Manager templates. For more info, see [Onboard a customer to Azure delegated resource management](onboard-customer.md).

Publishing a Managed Service offer is similar to publishing any other type of offer to Azure Marketplace. To learn about the general publishing process, see [Azure Marketplace and AppSource Publishing Guide](../../marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide.md). You should also review the [commercial marketplace certification policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies), particularly the [Managed Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#700-managed-services) section.

Once a customer adds your offer, they will be able to delegate one or more subscriptions or resource groups, which will then be [onboarded for Azure delegated resource management](#the-customer-onboarding-process).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each plan in a Managed service offer includes a **Manifest Details** section, where you define the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entities in your tenant that will have access to the delegated resource groups and/or subscriptions for customers who purchase that plan. It's important to be aware that any group (or user or service principal) that you include will have the same permissions for every customer who purchases the plan. To assign different groups to work with each customer, you'll need to publish a separate [private plan](../../marketplace/private-offers.md) that is exclusive to each customer.

## Create your offer

1. Sign in to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).
2. From the left navigation menu, select **New offer**, then select **Managed services**.
3. You'll see an **Editor** section for your offer with four parts to fill in: **Offer Settings**, **Plans**, **Marketplace**, and **Support**. Read on for guidance on how to complete these sections.

### Enter offer settings

In the **Offer settings** section, provide the following:

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Offer ID**     | A unique identifier for your offer (within your publisher profile). This ID can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores, with a maximum of 50 characters. Keep in mind that the Offer ID may be visible to customers in places like in product URLs and billing reports. Once you publish the offer, you can't change this value.        |
|**Publisher ID**     | The publisher ID that will be associated with the offer. If you have more than one publisher ID, you can select the one you wish to use for this offer.       |
|**Name**     | The name (up to 50 characters) that customers will see for your offer in Azure Marketplace and in the Azure portal. Use a recognizable brand name that customers will understandâ€”if you're promoting this offer through your own website, be sure to use the exact same name here.        |

When you've finished, select **Save**. Now you're ready to move on to the **Plans** section.

### Create plans

Each offer must have one or more plans (sometimes referred to as SKUs). You might add multiple plans to support different feature sets at different prices or to customize a specific plan for a limited audience of specific customers. Customers can view the plans that are available to them under the parent offer.

In the Plans section, select **New Plan**. Then enter a **Plan ID**. This ID can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores, with a maximum of 50 characters. The plan ID may be visible to customers in places like in product URLs and billing reports. Once you publish the offer, you can't change this value.

#### Plan details

Complete the following sections in the **Plan Details** section:

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Title**     | Friendly name for the plan for display. Maximum length of 50 characters.        |
|**Summary**     | Succinct description of the plan for display under the title. Maximum length of 100 characters.        |
|**Description**     | Description text that provides a more detailed explanation of the plan.         |
|**Billing model**     | There are 2 billing models shown here, but you must choose **Bring your own license** for managed services offers. This means that you will bill your customers directly for costs related to this offer, and Microsoft does not charge any fees to you.   |
|**Is this a private Plan?**     | Indicates whether the SKU is private or public. The default is **No** (public). If you leave this selection, your plan will not be restricted to specific customers (or to a certain number of customers); after you publish a public plan, you can't later change it to private. To make this plan available only to specific customers, select **Yes**. When you do so, you'll need to identify the customers by providing their subscription IDs. These can be entered one by one (for up to 10 subscriptions) or by uploading a .csv file (for up to 20,000 subscriptions). Be sure to include your own subscriptions here so you can test and validate the offer. For more information, see [Private SKUs and Plans](../../marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-azure-private-skus.md).  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once a plan has been published as public, you can't change it to private. To control which customers can accept your offer and delegate resources, use a private plan. With a public plan, you can't restrict availability to certain customers or even to a certain number of customers (although you can stop selling the plan completely if you choose to do so). You can [remove access to a delegation](onboard-customer.md#remove-access-to-a-delegation) after a customer accepts an offer only if you included an **Authorization** with the **Role Definition** set to [Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-services-registration-assignment-delete-role) when you published the offer. You can also reach out to the  customer and ask them to [remove your access](view-manage-service-providers.md#add-or-remove-service-provider-offers).

#### Manifest details

Complete the **Manifest Details** section for your plan. This creates a manifest with authorization information for managing customer resources. This information is required in order to enable Azure delegated resource management.

> [!NOTE]
> As noted above, the users and roles in your **Authorization** entries will apply to every customer who purchases the plan. If you want to limit access to a specific customer, you'll need to publish a private plan for their exclusive use.

First, provide a **Version** for the manifest. Use the format *n.n.n* (for example, 1.2.5).

Next, enter your **Tenant ID**. This is a GUID associated with the Azure Active Directory tenant ID of your organization (i.e., the tenant which you will be working in to manage your customers' resources). If you don't have this handy, you can find it by hovering over your account name on the upper right-hand side of the Azure portal, or by selecting **Switch directory**.

Finally, add one or more **Authorization** entries to your plan. Authorizations define the entities who can access resources and subscriptions for customers who purchase the plan, and assign roles that grant specific levels of access.

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, you'll want to assign permissions to an Azure AD user group or service principal, rather than to a series of individual user accounts. This lets you add or remove access for individual users without having to update and republish the plan when your access requirements change. For additional recommendations, see [Tenants, roles, and users in Azure Lighthouse scenarios](../concepts/tenants-users-roles.md).

For each **Authorization**, you'll need to provide the following. You can then select **New authorization** as many times as needed to add more users and role definitions.

- **Azure AD Object ID**: The Azure AD identifier of a user, user group, or application which will be granted certain permissions (as described by the Role Definition) to your customers' resources.
- **Azure AD Object Display Name**: A friendly name to help the customer understand the purpose of this authorization. The customer will see this name when delegating resources.
- **Role Definition**: Select one of the available Azure AD built-in roles from the list. This role will determine the permissions that the user in the **Azure AD Object ID** field will have on your customers' resources. For descriptions of these roles, see [Built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) and [Role support for Azure delegated resource management](../concepts/tenants-users-roles.md#role-support-for-azure-delegated-resource-management).
  > [!NOTE]
  > As applicable new built-in roles are added to Azure, they will become available here, although there may be some delay before they appear.
- **Assignable Roles**: This is required only if you have selected User Access Administrator in the **Role Definition** for this authorization. If so, you must add one or more assignable roles here. The user in the **Azure AD Object ID** field will be able to assign these **Assignable Roles** to [managed identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md), which is required in order to [deploy policies that can be remediated](deploy-policy-remediation.md). Note that no other permissions normally associated with the User Access Administrator role will apply to this user. If you do not select one or more roles here, your submission will not pass certification. (If you did not select User Access Administrator for this user's Role Definition, this field has no effect.)

> [!TIP]
> To ensure you can [remove access to a delegation](onboard-customer.md#remove-access-to-a-delegation) if needed, include an **Authorization** with the **Role Definition** set to [Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-services-registration-assignment-delete-role). If this role is not assigned, delegated resources can only be removed by a user in the customer's tenant.

Once you've completed the info, you can select **New plan** as many times as you need to create additional plans. When you're done, select **Save**, and then continue to the **Marketplace** section.

### Provide Marketplace text and images

The **Marketplace** section is where you provide the text and images which customers will see in Azure Marketplace and the Azure portal.

Complete the following fields in the **Overview** section:

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Title**     |  Title of the offer, often the long, formal name. This title will be displayed prominently in the marketplace. Maximum length of 50 characters. In most cases, this should be the same as the **Name** you entered in the **Offer Settings** section.       |
|**Summary**     | Brief purpose or function of your offer. This is usually displayed under the title. Maximum length of 100 characters.        |
|**Long Summary**     | A longer summary of the purpose or function of your offer. Maximum length of 256 characters.        |
|**Description**     | More information about your offer. This field has a maximum length of 3000 characters and supports simple HTML formatting. You must include the words "managed service" or "managed services" somewhere in your description.       |
|**Marketing Identifier**     | A unique URL-friendly identifier. This identifier can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes. It will be used in Marketplace URLs for this offer. For example, if your publisher ID is *contoso* and your marketing identifier is *sampleApp*, the URL for your offer in Azure Marketplace will be *https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/contoso-sampleApp*.        |
|**Preview Subscription IDs**     | Add one to 100 subscription identifiers. The customers associated with these subscriptions will be able to view the offer in Azure Marketplace before it goes live. We suggest including your own subscriptions here so you can preview how your offer appears in the Azure Marketplace before making it available to customers.  (Microsoft support and engineering teams will also be able to view your offer during this preview period.)   |
|**Useful Links**     | URLs related to your offer, such as documentation, release notes, FAQs, etc.        |
|**Suggested Categories (Max 5)**     | One or more categories (up to five) which apply to your offer. These categories help customers discover your offer in Azure Marketplace and the Azure portal.        |

In the **Marketing Artifacts** section, you can upload logos and other assets to be shown with your offer. You can optionally upload screenshots or links to videos that can help customers understand your offer.

Four logo sizes are required: **Small (40x40)**, **Medium (90x90)**, **Large (115x115)**, and **Wide (255x115)**. Follow these guidelines for your logos:

- The Azure design has a simple color palette. Limit the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo.
- The theme colors of the portal are white and black. Don't use these colors as the background color for your logo. Use a color that makes your logo prominent in the portal. We recommend simple primary colors.
- If you use a transparent background, make sure that the logo and text aren't white, black, or blue.
- The look and feel of your logo should be flat and avoid gradients. Don't use a gradient background on the logo.
- Don't place text on the logo, not even your company or brand name.
- Make sure the logo isn't stretched.

The **Hero (815x290)** logo is optional but recommended. If you include a hero logo, follow these guidelines:

- Don't include any text in the hero logo, and be sure to leave 415 pixels of empty space on the right side of the logo. This is required to leave room for text elements that will be embedded programmatically: your publisher display name, plan title, offer long summary.
- Your hero logo's background may not be black, white, or transparent. Make sure your background color isn't too light, because the embedded text will be displayed in white.
- Once you publish your offer with a hero icon, you can't remove it (although you can update it with a different version if desired).

In the **Lead Management** section, you can select the CRM system where your leads will be stored. Note that per the [Managed Services certification policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#700-managed-services), a **Lead Destination** is required.

Finally, provide your **Privacy Policy URL** and **Terms of use** in the **Legal** section. You can also specify here whether or not to use the [Standard Contract](../../marketplace/standard-contract.md) for this offer.

Be sure to save your changes before moving on to the **Support** section.

### Add support info

In the **Support** section, provide the name, email, and phone number for an engineering contact and a customer support contact. You'll also need to provide support URLs. Microsoft may use this information when we need to contact you about business and support issues.

Once you've added this info, select **Save.**

## Publish your offer

Once you've completed all of the sections, your next step is to publish the offer to Azure Marketplace. Select the **Publish** button to initiate the process of making your offer live. For more about this process, see [Publish Azure Marketplace and AppSource offers](../../marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/manage-offers/cpp-publish-offer.md).

You can [publish an updated version of your offer](../../marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/manage-offers/cpp-update-offer.md) at any time. For example, you may want to add a new role definition to a previously-published offer. When you do so, customers who have already added the offer will see an icon in the [**Service providers**](view-manage-service-providers.md) page in the Azure portal that lets them know an update is available. Each customer will be able to [review the changes](view-manage-service-providers.md#update-service-provider-offers) and decide whether they want to update to the new version. 

## The customer onboarding process

After a customer adds your offer, they'll be able to [delegate one or more specific subscriptions or resource groups](view-manage-service-providers.md#delegate-resources), which will then be onboarded for Azure delegated resource management. If a customer has accepted an offer but has not yet delegated any resources, they'll see a note at the top of the **Provider offers** section of the [**Service providers**](view-manage-service-providers.md) page in the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Delegation must be done by a non-guest account in the customer's tenant which has the [Owner built-in role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) for the subscription being onboarded (or which contains the resource groups that are being onboarded). To see all users who can delegate the subscription, a user in the customer's tenant can select the subscription in the Azure portal, open **Access control (IAM)**, and [view all users with the Owner role](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal.md#list-owners-of-a-subscription).

Once the customer delegates a subscription (or one or more resource groups within a subscription), the **Microsoft.ManagedServices** resource provider will be registered for that subscription, and users in your tenant will be able to access the delegated resources according to the authorizations in your offer.
