# Link your partner ID to enable partner earned credit on delegated resources

If you're a member of the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/), you can link your partner ID with the credentials used to manage delegated customer resources. This lets you track your impact across customer engagements and receive [partner earned credit for managed services (PEC)](/partner-center/partner-earned-credit).

If you [onboard customers with Managed Service offers in Azure Marketplace](publish-managed-services-offers.md), this link happens automatically, using the MPN ID associated with the Partner Center account used to publish the offers. No further action is needed in order to receive PEC for these customers.

If you [onboard customers by using Azure Resource Management templates](onboard-customer.md), you'll need to take action to create this link. This is done by [linking your MPN ID](../../cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id.md) with at least one user account in your managing tenant that has access to each of your onboarded subscriptions.

## Associate your partner ID when you onboard new customers

When onboarding customers through Azure Resource manager templates, use the following process to link your partner ID and enable partner earned credit. You'll need to know your [MPN partner ID](/partner-center/partner-center-account-setup#locate-your-mpn-id) to complete these steps.

For simplicity, we recommend creating a service principal account in your tenant, associating it with your MPN ID, then granting it access to every customer you onboard with an [Azure built-in role that is eligible for PEC](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-roles-perms-pec).

1. [Create a service principal account](../../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md) in your managing tenant. For this example, we'll name this service principal PEC Automation Account.
1. Using that service principal account, [link to your partner ID](../../cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id.md#link-to-a-partner-id) in your managing tenant. You only need to do this one time.
1. When you [onboard a customer using Azure Resource Manager templates](onboard-customer.md), be sure to include an authorization which includes the PEC Automation Account as a user with an [Azure built-in role that is eligible for PEC](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-roles-perms-pec).

By following these steps, every customer tenant you manage will be associated with your partner ID, allowing you to receive PEC for those customers. The PEC Automation Account does not need to authenticate or perform any actions in the customer tenant.

## Add your partner ID to previously onboarded customers

If you have already onboarded a customer, you may not want to perform another deployment to add your PEC Automation Account service principal. Instead, you can associate the MPN ID with a user account which already has access to work in that customer's tenant. Be sure that the account has been granted an [Azure built-in role that is eligible for PEC](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-roles-perms-pec).

Once the account has been [linked to your partner ID](../../cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id.md#link-to-a-partner-id) in your managing tenant, you will be able to receive PEC for that customer.

## Confirm partner earned credit

You can [view PEC details in the Azure portal](/partner-center/partner-earned-credit-explanation#azure-cost-management) and confirm which costs have received the benefit of PEC.

If you have followed the steps above, and do not see the association, open a support request in the Azure portal.
