# Azure Lighthouse in ISV scenarios

A common scenario for [Azure Lighthouse](../overview.md) is a service provider managing resources in its customers’ Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. The capabilities of Azure Lighthouse can also be used by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) using SaaS-based offerings with their customers. Azure Lighthouse can be especially useful for ISVs who are offering managed services or support that require access to the subscription scope.

## Managed Service offers in Azure Marketplace

As an ISV, you may already have published solutions to the Azure Marketplace. If you offer managed services to your customers, you can do so by publishing a Managed Service offer. These offers streamline the onboarding process and make your services more scalable to as many customers as needed. Azure Lighthouse supports a wide range of [management tasks and scenarios](cross-tenant-management-experience.md#enhanced-services-and-scenarios) that can be used to provide value to your customers.

For more information, see [Publish a Managed Service offer to Azure Marketplace](../how-to/publish-managed-services-offers.md).

## Using Azure Lighthouse with Azure managed applications

[Azure managed applications](../../azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview.md) are another way that ISVs can provide services to their customers. You can use Azure Lighthouse along with your Azure managed applications to enable enhanced scenarios.

For more information, see [Azure Lighthouse and Azure managed applications](managed-applications.md).

## SaaS-based multi-tenant offerings

An additional scenario is where ISV hosts the resources in a subscription in their own tenant, then uses Azure Lighthouse to let customers access these resources. The customer can then log in to their own tenant and access these resources as needed. ISVs maintain their IP in their own tenant, and can use their own support plans to raise tickets related to the solution hosted in their tenant, rather than using the customer's plan. Since the resources are in the ISV's tenant, all actions can be performed directly by the ISV, such as logging into VMs, installing apps, and performing maintenance tasks.

In this scenario, users in the customer’s tenant are essentially granted access as a "managing tenant", even though the customer is not managing the ISV's resources. Because they are accessing the ISV's tenant directly, it’s important to grant only the minimum permissions necessary, so that customers cannot inadvertently make changes to the solution or other ISV resources.

To enable this architecture, the ISV needs to obtain the object ID for a user group in the customer’s Azure AD tenant, along with their tenant ID. The ISV then builds an ARM template granting this user group the appropriate permissions, and [deploys it on the ISV's subscription](../how-to/onboard-customer.md) that contains the resources which the customer will access.
