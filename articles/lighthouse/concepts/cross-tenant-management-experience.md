# Cross-tenant management experiences

As a service provider, you can use [Azure Lighthouse](../overview.md) to manage resources for multiple customers from within your own Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Many tasks and services can be performed across managed tenants by using [Azure delegated resource management](../concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md).

> [!TIP]
> Azure delegated resource management can also be used [within an enterprise which has multiple Azure AD tenants of its own](enterprise.md) to simplify cross-tenant administration.

## Understanding tenants and delegation

An Azure AD tenant is a representation of an organization. It's a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization receives when they create a relationship with Microsoft by signing up for Azure, Microsoft 365, or other services. Each Azure AD tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD tenants, and has its own tenant ID (a GUID). For more info, see [What is Azure Active Directory?](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md)

Typically, in order to manage Azure resources for a customer, service providers would have to sign in to the Azure portal using an account associated with that customer's tenant, requiring an administrator in the customer's tenant to create and manage user accounts for the service provider.

With Azure Lighthouse, the onboarding process specifies users within the service provider's tenant who will be able to work on delegated subscriptions and resource groups in the customer's tenant. These users can then sign in to the Azure portal using their own credentials. Within the Azure portal, they can manage resources belonging to all customers to which they have access. This can be done by visiting the [My customers](../how-to/view-manage-customers.md) page in the Azure portal, or by working directly within the context of that customer's subscription, either in the Azure portal or via APIs.

Azure Lighthouse allows greater flexibility to manage resources for multiple customers without having to sign in to different accounts in different tenants. For example, a service provider may have two customers with different responsibilities and access levels. Using Azure Lighthouse, authorized users can sign in to the service provider's tenant to access these resources.

## APIs and management tool support

You can perform management tasks on delegated resources either directly in the portal or by using APIs and management tools (such as Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell). All existing APIs can be used when working with delegated resources, as long as the functionality is supported for cross-tenant management and the user has the appropriate permissions.

The Azure PowerShell [Get-AzSubscription cmdlet](/powershell/module/Az.Accounts/Get-AzSubscription) shows the `HomeTenantId` and `ManagedByTenantIds` attributes for each subscription, allowing you to identify whether a returned subscription belongs to a managed tenant or to your managing tenant.

Similarly, Azure CLI commands such as [az account list](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list) show the `homeTenantId` and `managedByTenants` attributes. If you don't see these values when using Azure CLI, try clearing your cache by running `az account clear` followed by `az login --identity`.

In the Azure REST API, the [Subscriptions - Get](/rest/api/resources/subscriptions/get) and [Subscriptions - List](/rest/api/resources/subscriptions/list) commands include `ManagedByTenant`.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to tenant information related to Azure Lighthouse, tenants shown by these APIs may also reflect partner tenants for Azure Databricks or Azure managed applications.

We also provide APIs that are specific to performing Azure Lighthouse tasks. For more info, see the **Reference** section.

## Enhanced services and scenarios

Most tasks and services can be performed on delegated resources across managed tenants. Below are some of the key scenarios where cross-tenant management can be especially effective.

- Note that you can't use Azure Active Directory for remote login to VMs

Support requests:

- [Open support requests from **Help + support**](../../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md#getting-started) in the Azure portal for delegated resources (selecting the support plan available to the delegated scope)

## Current limitations

With all scenarios, please be aware of the following current limitations:

- Requests handled by Azure Resource Manager can be performed using Azure Lighthouse. The operation URIs for these requests start with `https://management.azure.com`. However, requests that are handled by an instance of a resource type (such as Key Vault secrets access or storage data access) aren't supported with Azure Lighthouse. The operation URIs for these requests typically start with an address that is unique to your instance, such as `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net` or `https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/`. The latter also are typically data operations rather than management operations.
- Role assignments must use [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md). All built-in roles are currently supported with Azure delegated resource management except for Owner or any built-in roles with [`DataActions`](../../role-based-access-control/role-definitions.md#dataactions) permission. The User Access Administrator role is supported only for limited use in [assigning roles to managed identities](../how-to/deploy-policy-remediation.md#create-a-user-who-can-assign-roles-to-a-managed-identity-in-the-customer-tenant).  Custom roles and [classic subscription administrator roles](../../role-based-access-control/classic-administrators.md) are not supported.
- While you can onboard subscriptions that use Azure Databricks, users in the managing tenant can't launch Azure Databricks workspaces on a delegated subscription at this time.
- While you can onboard subscriptions and resource groups that have resource locks, those locks will not prevent actions from being performed by users in the managing tenant. [Deny assignments](../../role-based-access-control/deny-assignments.md) that protect system-managed resources, such as those created by Azure managed applications or Azure Blueprints (system-assigned deny assignments), do prevent users in the managing tenant from acting on those resources; however, at this time users in the customer tenant can't create their own deny assignments (user-assigned deny assignments).

## Next steps

- Onboard your customers to Azure Lighthouse, either by [using Azure Resource Manager templates](../how-to/onboard-customer.md) or by [publishing a private or public managed services offer to Azure Marketplace](../how-to/publish-managed-services-offers.md).
- [View and manage customers](../how-to/view-manage-customers.md) by going to **My customers** in the Azure portal.
