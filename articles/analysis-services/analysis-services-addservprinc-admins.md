# Add a service principal to the server administrator role 

 To automate unattended PowerShell tasks, a service principal must have **server administrator** privileges on the Analysis Services server being managed. This article describes how to add a service principal to the server administrators role on an Azure AS server.

## Before you begin
Before completing this task, you must have a service principal registered in Azure Active Directory.

[Create service principal - Azure portal](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md)   
[Create service principal - PowerShell](../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md)

## Required permissions
To complete this task, you must have [server administrator](analysis-services-server-admins.md) permissions on the Azure AS server. 

## Add service principal to server administrators role

1. In SSMS, connect to your Azure AS server.
2. In **Server Properties** > **Security**, click **Add**.
3. In **Select a User or Group**, search for your registered app by name, select, and then click **Add**.
