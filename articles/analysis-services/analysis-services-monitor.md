# Monitor server metrics

Analysis Services provides metrics in Azure Metrics Explorer, a free tool in the portal, to help you monitor the performance and health of your servers. For example, monitor memory and CPU usage, number of client connections, and query resource consumption. Analysis Services uses the same monitoring framework as most other Azure services. To learn more, see [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started.md).

To perform more in-depth diagnostics, track performance, and identify trends across multiple service resources in a resource group or subscription, use [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). Azure Monitor (service) may result in a billable service.


## To monitor metrics for an Analysis Services server

1. In Azure portal, select **Metrics**.

2. In **Metric**, select the metrics to include in your chart.

## Server metrics

Use this table to determine which metrics are best for your monitoring scenario. Only metrics of the same unit can be shown on the same chart.
