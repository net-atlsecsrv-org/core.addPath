# How to Send Email Using SendGrid with Azure
## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to perform common programming tasks with the
SendGrid email service on Azure. The samples are written in C\#
and supports .NET Standard 1.3. The scenarios covered include constructing
email, sending email, adding attachments, and enabling various mail and
tracking settings. For more information on SendGrid and sending email, see
the [Next steps][Next steps] section.

## What is the SendGrid Email Service?
SendGrid is a [cloud-based email service] that provides reliable
[transactional email delivery], scalability, and real-time analytics along with flexible APIs
that make custom integration easy. Common SendGrid use cases include:

* Automatically sending receipts or purchase confirmations to customers.
* Administering distribution lists for sending customers monthly fliers and promotions.
* Collecting real-time metrics for things like blocked email and customer engagement.
* Forwarding customer inquiries.
* Processing incoming emails.

For more information, visit [https://sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com) or
SendGrid's [C# library][sendgrid-csharp] GitHub repo.

## Create a SendGrid Account
[!INCLUDE [sendgrid-sign-up](../includes/sendgrid-sign-up.md)]

## Reference the SendGrid .NET Class Library
The [SendGrid NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sendgrid) is the easiest way to get the SendGrid API and to configure your application with all dependencies. NuGet is a Visual Studio extension included with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and above that makes it easy to install and update libraries and tools.

> [!NOTE]
> To install NuGet if you are running a version of Visual Studio earlier than Visual Studio 2015, visit [https://www.nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org), and click the **Install NuGet** button.
>
>

To install the SendGrid NuGet package in your application, do the following:

1. Click on **New Project** and select a **Template**.

   ![Create a new project][create-new-project]
2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **References**, then click
   **Manage NuGet Packages**.

   ![SendGrid NuGet package][SendGrid-NuGet-package]
3. Search for **SendGrid** and select the **SendGrid** item in the
   results list.
4. Select the latest stable version of the Nuget package from the version dropdown to be able to work with the object model and APIs demonstrated in this article.

   ![SendGrid package][sendgrid-package]
5. Click **Install** to complete the installation, and then close this
   dialog.

SendGrid's .NET class library is called **SendGrid**. It contains the following namespaces:

* **SendGrid** for communicating with SendGrid's API.
* **SendGrid.Helpers.Mail** for helper methods to easily create SendGridMessage objects that specify how to send emails.

Add the following code namespace declarations to the top of any C# file in which you want to programmatically access the SendGrid email service.

```csharp
using SendGrid;
using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;
```

## How to: Create an Email
Use the **SendGridMessage** object to create an email message. Once the message object is created, you can set properties and methods, including the email sender, the email recipient, and the subject and body of the email.

The following example demonstrates how to create a fully populated email object:

```csharp
var msg = new SendGridMessage();

msg.SetFrom(new EmailAddress("dx@example.com", "SendGrid DX Team"));

var recipients = new List<EmailAddress>
{
    new EmailAddress("jeff@example.com", "Jeff Smith"),
    new EmailAddress("anna@example.com", "Anna Lidman"),
    new EmailAddress("peter@example.com", "Peter Saddow")
};
msg.AddTos(recipients);

msg.SetSubject("Testing the SendGrid C# Library");

msg.AddContent(MimeType.Text, "Hello World plain text!");
msg.AddContent(MimeType.Html, "<p>Hello World!</p>");
```

For more information on all properties and methods supported by the
**SendGrid** type, see [sendgrid-csharp][sendgrid-csharp] on GitHub.

## How to: Send an Email
After creating an email message, you can send it using SendGrid's API. Alternatively, you may use [.NET's built in library][NET-library].

Sending email requires that you supply your SendGrid API Key. If you need details about how to configure API Keys, please visit SendGrid's API Keys [documentation][documentation].

You may store these credentials via your Azure portal by clicking Application settings and adding the key/value pairs under App settings.

 ![Azure app settings][azure_app_settings]

Then, you may access them as follows:

```csharp
var apiKey = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SENDGRID_APIKEY");
var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
```

The following examples show how to send an email message using the SendGrid Web API with a console application.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using SendGrid;
using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;

namespace Example
{
    internal class Example
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            Execute().Wait();
        }

        static async Task Execute()
        {
            var apiKey = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SENDGRID_APIKEY");
            var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
            var msg = new SendGridMessage()
            {
                From = new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "DX Team"),
                Subject = "Hello World from the SendGrid CSharp SDK!",
                PlainTextContent = "Hello, Email!",
                HtmlContent = "<strong>Hello, Email!</strong>"
            };
            msg.AddTo(new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "Test User"));
            var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
        }
    }
}
```

## How to: Send email from ASP .NET Core API using MailHelper class

The below example can be used to send a single email to multiple persons from the ASP .NET Core API using the `MailHelper` class of `SendGrid.Helpers.Mail` namespace. For this example we are using ASP .NET Core 1.0. 

In this example, the API key has been stored in the `appsettings.json` file  which can be overridden from the Azure portal as  shown in the above examples.

The contents of `appsettings.json` file should look similar to:

```csharp
{
   "Logging": {
   "IncludeScopes": false,
   "LogLevel": {
   "Default": "Debug",
   "System": "Information",
   "Microsoft": "Information"
     }
   },
 "SENDGRID_API_KEY": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

First, we need to add the below code in the `Startup.cs` file of the .NET Core API project. This is required so that we can access the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` from the `appsettings.json` file by using dependency injection in the API controller. The `IConfiguration` interface can be injected at the constructor of the controller after adding it in the `ConfigureServices` method below. The content of `Startup.cs` file looks like the following after adding the required code:

```csharp
    public IConfigurationRoot Configuration { get; }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add mvc here
        services.AddMvc();
        services.AddSingleton<IConfiguration>(Configuration);
    }
```

At the controller, after injecting the `IConfiguration` interface, we can use the `CreateSingleEmailToMultipleRecipients` method of the `MailHelper` class to send a single email to multiple recipients. The method accepts one additional boolean parameter named `showAllRecipients`. This parameter can be used to control whether email recipients will be able to see each others email address in the To section of email header. The sample code for controller should be like below 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using SendGrid;
using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

namespace SendgridMailApp.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class NotificationController : Controller
    {
       private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

       public NotificationController(IConfiguration configuration)
       {
         _configuration = configuration;
       }      
    
       [Route("SendNotification")]
       public async Task PostMessage()
       {
          var apiKey = _configuration.GetSection("SENDGRID_API_KEY").Value;
          var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
          var from = new EmailAddress("test1@example.com", "Example User 1");
          List<EmailAddress> tos = new List<EmailAddress>
          {
              new EmailAddress("test2@example.com", "Example User 2"),
              new EmailAddress("test3@example.com", "Example User 3"),
              new EmailAddress("test4@example.com","Example User 4")
          };
        
          var subject = "Hello world email from Sendgrid ";
          var htmlContent = "<strong>Hello world with HTML content</strong>";
          var displayRecipients = false; // set this to true if you want recipients to see each others mail id 
          var msg = MailHelper.CreateSingleEmailToMultipleRecipients(from, tos, subject, "", htmlContent, false);
          var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
      }
   }
}
```

## How to: Add an attachment
Attachments can be added to a message by calling the **AddAttachment** method and minimally specifying the file name and Base64 encoded content you want to attach. You can include multiple attachments by calling this method once for each file you wish to attach or by using the **AddAttachments** method. The following example demonstrates adding an attachment to a message:

```csharp
var banner2 = new Attachment()
{
    Content = Convert.ToBase64String(raw_content),
    Type = "image/png",
    Filename = "banner2.png",
    Disposition = "inline",
    ContentId = "Banner 2"
};
msg.AddAttachment(banner2);
```

## How to: Use mail settings to enable footers, tracking, and analytics
SendGrid provides additional email functionality through the use of mail settings and tracking settings. These settings can be added to an email message to enable specific functionality such as click tracking, Google analytics, subscription tracking, and so on. For a full list of apps, see the [Settings Documentation][settings-documentation].

Apps can be applied to **SendGrid** email messages using methods implemented as part of the **SendGridMessage** class. The following examples demonstrate the footer and click tracking filters:

The following examples demonstrate the footer and click tracking
filters:

### Footer settings

```csharp
msg.SetFooterSetting(
                     true,
                     "Some Footer HTML",
                     "<strong>Some Footer Text</strong>");
```

### Click tracking

```csharp
msg.SetClickTracking(true);
```

## How to: Use Additional SendGrid Services
