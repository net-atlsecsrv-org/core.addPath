# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Confidential Computing VM in the Marketplace

Get started with Azure confidential computing by using the Azure Marketplace to create a virtual machine (VM) backed by Intel SGX. You'll then install the Open Enclave Software Development Kit (SDK) to set up your development environment. 

This tutorial is recommended if you want to quickly start deploying a confidential computing virtual machine. The VMs are run on specialty hardware and require specific configuration inputs to run as intended. The marketplace offering described in this quickstart makes it easier to deploy, by restricting user input.

If you're interested in deploying a confidential compute virtual machine with more custom configuration, follow the [Azure portal Confidential Compute virtual machine deployment steps](quick-create-portal.md).

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) before you begin.

> [!NOTE]
> Free trial accounts do not have access to the virtual machines used in this tutorial. Please upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

## Sign in to Azure

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. At the top, type **Azure confidential computing** into the search bar.

1. Select **Azure confidential computing (Virtual Machine)** in the **Marketplace** section. 

    ![Select Marketplace](media/quick-create-marketplace/portal-search-marketplace.png)    

1. On the Azure confidential compute deployment landing page, select **Create**.
 

## Configure your virtual machine

1. In the **Basics** tab, select your **Subscription** and **Resource Group**. Your resource group must be empty to deploy a virtual machine from this template into it.

1. Type or select the following values:

   * **Region**: Select the Azure region that's right for you.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Confidential compute virtual machines only run on specialized hardware available in specific regions. For the latest available regions for DCsv2-Series VMs, see [available regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines).
    
    * **Choose Image**: Select any image. If you would like to complete this specific tutorial, select Ubuntu 18.04 (Gen 2). Otherwise, you'll be redirected at the appropriate steps below. 

    * **Virtual machine name**, enter a name for your new VM.

    * **Authentication type**: 
    Select **SSH public key** if you're creating a Linux VM. 

         > [!NOTE]
         > You have the choice of using an SSH public key or a Password for authentication. SSH is more secure. For instructions on how to generate an SSH key, see [Create SSH keys on Linux and Mac for Linux VMs in Azure](../virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys.md).

    * **Username**: Enter the Administrator name for the VM.

    * **SSH public key**: If applicable, enter your RSA public key.
    
    * **Password**: If applicable, enter your password for authentication.
 
1. Select the **Next: Virtual machine settings** button at the bottom of your screen.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Wait for the page to update. You *should not* see a message that says "Confidential Computing DCsv2-series VMs are available in a limited number of regions." If this message persists, return to the previous page and select an available DCsv2-Series region.

1. For **change size**, choose a VM with confidential compute capabilities in the size selector. 

    > [!TIP]
    > You should see sizes **DC1s_v2**, **DC2s_v2**, **DC4s_V2**, and **DC8_v2**. These are the only virtual machine sizes that currently support confidential computing. [Learn more](virtual-machine-solutions.md).

1. For **OS Disk Type**, select a disk type.

1. For **Virtual Network**, create a new one or choose from an existing resource.

1. For **Subnet**, create a new one or choose from an existing resource.

1. For **Select public inbound ports**, choose **SSH(Linux)/RDP(Windows)**. In this quickstart, this step is necessary to connect to the VM and complete the Open Enclave SDK configuration. 

1. For **Boot Diagnostics**, leave it disabled for this quickstart. 

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. In the **Review + create** pane, select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> Proceed to the next section and continue with this tutorial if you deployed a Linux VM. If you deployed a Windows VM, [follow these steps to connect to your Windows VM](../virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon.md) and then [install the OE SDK on Windows](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Windows.md).


## Connect to the Linux VM

If you already use a BASH shell, connect to the Azure VM using the **ssh** command. In the following command, replace the VM user name and IP address to connect to your Linux VM.

```bash
ssh azureadmin@40.55.55.555
```

You can find the Public IP address of your VM in the Azure portal, under the Overview section of your virtual machine.

![IP address in Azure portal](media/quick-create-portal/public-ip-virtual-machine.png)

If you're running on Windows and don't have a BASH shell, install an SSH client, such as PuTTY.

1. [Download and install PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

1. Run PuTTY.

1. On the PuTTY configuration screen, enter your VM's public IP address.

1. Select **Open** and enter your username and password at the prompts.

For more information about connecting to Linux VMs, see [Create a Linux VM on Azure using the Portal](../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you see a PuTTY security alert about the server's host key not being cached in the registry, choose from the following options. If you trust this host, select **Yes** to add the key to PuTTy's cache and continue connecting. If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the cache, select **No**. If you don't trust this host, select **Cancel** to abandon the connection.

## Install the Open Enclave SDK (OE SDK) <a id="Install"></a>

Follow the step-by-step instructions to install the [OE SDK](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave) on your DCsv2-Series virtual machine running an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Gen 2 image. 

If your virtual machine runs on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Gen 2, you'll need to follow [installation instructions for Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Ubuntu_16.04.md). 

#### 1. Configure the Intel and Microsoft APT Repositories

```bash
echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu bionic main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list
wget -qO - https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic-7 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm-toolchain-bionic-7.list
wget -qO - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
wget -qO - https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

#### 2. Install the Intel SGX DCAP Driver

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install dkms
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.4/linux/distro/ubuntuServer18.04/sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.21.bin -O sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please use the latest Intel SGX DCAP driver from [Intel's SGX site](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads).

#### 3. Install the Intel and Open Enclave packages and dependencies

```bash
sudo apt -y install clang-7 libssl-dev gdb libsgx-enclave-common libsgx-enclave-common-dev libprotobuf10 libsgx-dcap-ql libsgx-dcap-ql-dev az-dcap-client open-enclave
```

> [!NOTE] 
> This step also installs the [az-dcap-client](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dcap-client) package which is necessary for performing remote attestation in Azure.

#### 4. **Verify the Open Enclave SDK install**

See [Using the Open Enclave SDK](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/Linux_using_oe_sdk.md) on GitHub for verifying and using the installed SDK.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. 

Select the resource group for the virtual machine, then select **Delete**. Confirm the name of the resource group to finish deleting the resources.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a confidential computing virtual machine, and installed the Open Enclave SDK. For more information about confidential computing virtual machines on Azure, see [Solutions on Virtual Machines](virtual-machine-solutions.md). 

Discover how you can build confidential computing applications, by continuing to the Open Enclave SDK samples on GitHub.
