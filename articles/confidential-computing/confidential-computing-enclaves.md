# Azure confidential computing virtual machines (VMs) overview


Azure is the first cloud provider to offer confidential computing in a virtualized environment. We've developed virtual machines that act as an abstraction layer between the hardware and your application. You can run workloads at scale and with redundancy and availability options.  

## Intel SGX-enabled Virtual Machines

In Azure confidential computing virtual machines, a part of the CPU's hardware is reserved for a portion of code and data in your application. This restricted portion is the enclave.

Azure confidential computing infrastructure is currently comprised of a specialty SKU of virtual machines (VMs). These VMs run on Intel processors with Software Guard Extension (Intel SGX). [Intel SGX](https://intel.com/sgx) is the component that allows the increased protection that we light up with confidential computing. 

Today, Azure offers the [DCsv2-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/dcv2-series) built on Intel SGX technology for hardware-based enclave creation. You can build secure enclave-based applications to run in the DCsv2-series of VMs to protect your application data and code in use. 

[Read more](virtual-machine-solutions.md) about deploying Azure confidential computing virtual machines with hardware-based trusted enclaves.

## Enclaves

Enclaves are secured portions of the hardwareâ€™s processor and memory. There's no way to view data or code inside the enclave, even with a debugger. If untrusted code attempts modify the content in enclave memory, the environment gets disabled and the operations are denied.

Fundamentally, think of an enclave as a secured box. You put encrypted code and data in the box. From the outside of the box, you can't see anything. You give the enclave a key to decrypt the data, the data is then processed and encrypted again, before being sent out of the enclave.

Each enclave has a set size of encrypted page cache (EPC) that determines the amount of memory each enclave can hold. Larger DCsv2 virtual machines have more EPC memory. Read the [DCsv2 specifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/dcv2-series) page for the maximum EPC per VM Size.



### Developing applications to run inside enclaves
When developing applications, you can use [software tools](application-development.md) to shield portions of your code and data inside the enclave. These tools will ensure your code and data can't be viewed or modified by anyone outside the trusted environment.
