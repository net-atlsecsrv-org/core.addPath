# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with confidential computing nodes (DCsv2) using Azure CLI

This quickstart is intended for developers or cluster operators who want to quickly create an AKS cluster and deploy an application to monitor applications using the managed Kubernetes service in Azure. You can also provision the cluster and add confidential computing nodes from Azure portal.

## Overview

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with confidential computing nodes using the Azure CLI and run a simple hello world application in an enclave. AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. To learn more, read the [AKS Introduction](../aks/intro-kubernetes.md) and the [AKS Confidential Nodes Overview](confidential-nodes-aks-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Confidential computing DCsv2 VMs leverage specialized hardware that is subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the virtual machines page for [available SKUs and supported regions](virtual-machine-solutions.md).

### Confidential computing node features (DCsv2)

1. Linux Worker Nodes supporting Linux Containers.
1. Generation 2 VM with Ubuntu 18.04 Virtual Machines Nodes.
1. Intel SGX-based CPU with Encrypted Page Cache Memory (EPC). Read more [here](./faq.md).
1. Support for Kubernetes version 1.16+.
1. Intel SGX DCAP Driver pre-installed on the AKS Nodes. Read more [here](./faq.md).

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

1. An active Azure Subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
1. Azure CLI version 2.0.64 or later installed and configured on your deployment machine (Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).
1. A minimum of six **DCsv2** cores available in your subscription for use. By default, the VM cores quota for the confidential computing per Azure subscription is eight cores. If you plan to provision a cluster that requires more than eight cores, follow [these](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md) instructions to raise a quota increase ticket.

## Create a new AKS cluster with confidential computing nodes and add-on

Follow the below instructions to add confidential computing capable nodes with add-on.

### Create an AKS cluster with a system node pool

If you already have an AKS cluster that meets the above requirements, [skip to the existing cluster section](#existing-cluster) to add a new confidential computing node pool.

First, create a resource group for the cluster using the [az group create][az-group-create] command. The following example creates a resource group name *myResourceGroup* in the *westus2* region:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus2
```

Now create an AKS cluster using the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -g myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --generate-ssh-keys --enable-addon confcom
```

The above creates a new AKS cluster with a system node pool with the add-on enabled. Next, add a user node pool with confidential computing capabilities to the AKS cluster.

### Add a confidential computing node pool to the AKS cluster 

Run the following command to add a user node pool of `Standard_DC2s_v2` size with three nodes. You can choose another SKU from the supported list of [DCsv2 SKUs and regions](../virtual-machines/dcv2-series.md).

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name confcompool1 --resource-group myResourceGroup --node-vm-size Standard_DC2s_v2
```

After running, a new node pool with **DCsv2** should be visible with confidential computing add-on daemonsets ([SGX Device Plugin](confidential-nodes-aks-overview.md#sgx-plugin)).

### Verify the node pool and add-on

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

Verify the nodes are created properly and the SGX-related daemonsets are running on **DCsv2** node pools using kubectl get pods & nodes command as shown below:

```console
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

kube-system     sgx-device-plugin-xxxx     1/1     Running
```

If the output matches the above, then your AKS cluster is now ready to run confidential applications.

Go to the [Hello World from Enclave](#hello-world) deployment section to test an app in an enclave. Or follow the below instructions to add additional node pools on AKS (AKS supports mixing SGX node pools and non-SGX node pools).

## Add a confidential computing node pool to an existing AKS cluster<a id="existing-cluster"></a>

This section assumes you have an AKS cluster running already that meets the criteria listed in the prerequisites section (applies to add-on).

### Enable the confidential computing AKS add-on on the existing cluster

Run the following command to enable the confidential computing add-on:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks enable-addons --addons confcom --name MyManagedCluster --resource-group MyResourceGroup 
```

### Add a **DCsv2** user node pool to the cluster

> [!NOTE]
> To use the confidential computing capability, your existing AKS cluster needs to have at minimum one **DCsv2** VM SKU based node pool. To learn more about confidential computing DCs-v2 VMs SKU's, see [available SKUs and supported regions](virtual-machine-solutions.md).

Run the following command to create a new node pool:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name confcompool1 --resource-group myResourceGroup --node-count 1 --node-vm-size Standard_DC4s_v2
```

Verify the new node pool with the name confcompool1 has been created:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool list --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### Verify that daemonsets are running on confidential node pools

Sign in to your existing AKS cluster to perform the following verification.

```console
kubectl get nodes
```

The output should show the newly added confcompool1 on the AKS cluster. You may also see other daemonsets.

```console
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

kube-system     sgx-device-plugin-xxxx     1/1     Running
```

If the output matches the above, then your AKS cluster is now ready to run confidential applications. Follow the instructions below to deploy a test application.

## Hello World from isolated enclave application <a id="hello-world"></a>
Create a file named *hello-world-enclave.yaml* and paste the following YAML manifest. This Open Enclave based sample application code can be found in the [Open Enclave project](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/tree/master/samples/helloworld). The following deployment assumes you have deployed the addon "confcom".

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: sgx-test
  labels:
    app: sgx-test
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sgx-test
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sgxtest
        image: oeciteam/sgx-test:1.0
        resources:
          limits:
            kubernetes.azure.com/sgx_epc_mem_in_MiB: 5 # This limit will automatically place the job into confidential computing node. Alternatively you can target deployment to nodepools
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 0
  ```

Now use the kubectl apply command to create a sample job that will launch in a secure enclave, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f hello-world-enclave.yaml

job "sgx-test" created
```

You can confirm that the workload successfully created a Trusted Execution Environment (Enclave) by running the following commands:

```console
$ kubectl get jobs -l app=sgx-test

NAME       COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
sgx-test   1/1           1s         23s
```

```console
$ kubectl get pods -l app=sgx-test

NAME             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
sgx-test-rchvg   0/1     Completed   0          25s
```

```console
$ kubectl logs -l app=sgx-test

Hello world from the enclave
Enclave called into host to print: Hello World!
```

## Clean up resources

To remove the associated node pools or delete the AKS cluster, use the following commands:

### Remove the confidential computing node pool

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool delete --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name myNodePoolName --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### Delete the AKS cluster

```azurecli-interactive
az aks delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

## Next steps

* Run Python, Node, etc. applications confidentially through confidential containers by visiting [confidential container samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/confidential-container-samples).

* Run Enclave aware applications by visiting [Enclave Aware Azure Container Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/confidential-computing/blob/main/containersamples/).
