# Frequently asked questions for Azure Confidential Computing

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about running [confidential computing workloads on Azure virtual machines](overview.md).

If your Azure issue is not addressed in this article, visit the Azure forums on [MSDN and Stack Overflow](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/forums/). You can post your issue in these forums, or post to [@AzureSupport on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AzureSupport). You can also submit an Azure support request.

## Confidential Computing Virtual Machines <a id="vm-faq"></a>

**How can I deploy DCsv2 series VMs on Azure?**

Here are some ways you can deploy a DCsv2 VM:
   - Using an [Azure Resource Manager Template](../virtual-machines/windows/template-description.md)
   - From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/hub)
   - In the [Azure Confidential Computing (Virtual Machine)](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-azure-compute.acc-virtual-machine-v2?tab=overview) marketplace solution template. The marketplace solution template will help constrain a customer to the supported scenarios (regions, images, availability, disk encryption). 

**Will all OS images work with Azure confidential computing?**

No. The virtual machines can only be deployed on Generation 2 operating machines with Ubuntu Server 18.04, Ubuntu Server 16.04, Windows Server 2019 Datacenter, and Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. Read more about Gen 2 VMs on [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/generation-2.md) and [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/generation-2.md)

**DCsv2 virtual machines are grayed out in the portal and I can't select one**

Based on the information bubble next to the VM, there are different actions to take:
   -	**UnsupportedGeneration**: Change the generation of the virtual machine image to “Gen2”.
   -	**NotAvailableForSubscription**: The region isn't yet available for your subscription. Select an available region.
   -	**InsufficientQuota**: [Create a support request to increase your quota](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md). Free trial subscriptions don't have quota for confidential computing VMs. 

**DCsv2 virtual machines don't show up when I try to search for them in the portal size selector**

Make sure you've selected an [available region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines). Also make sure you select “clear all filters” in the size selector. 

**I get an Azure Resource Manager template deployment failure error: "Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved standard DcsV2 Family Cores Quota"**

[Create a support request to increase your quota](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md). Free trial subscriptions don't have quota for confidential computing VMs. 

**What’s the difference between DCsv2-Series and DC-Series VMs?**

DC-Series VMs run on older 6-core Intel Processors with Intel SGX and have less total memory, less Enclave Page Cache (EPC) memory, and are available in only two regions (US East and Europe West in Standard_DC2s and Standard_DC4s sizes). There are no plans to make these VMs Generally Available and they are not recommended for production use. To deploy these VMs, use the  [Confidential Compute DC-Series VM [Preview]](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-azure-compute.confidentialcompute?tab=Overview) Marketplace instance.

**Are DCsv2 virtual machines available globally?**

No. At this time, these virtual machines are only available in select regions. Check the [products by regions page](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines) for the latest available regions. 

**How do I install the Open Enclave SDK on the DCsv2 virtual machines?**
   
For instructions on how to install the OE SDK on an Azure or on-premise Machine, follow the instructions on the [Open Enclave SDK GitHub](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave).
     
You can also look into the Open Enclave SDK GitHub for OS-specific installation instructions:
   - [Install the OE SDK on Windows](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Windows.md)
   - [Install the OE SDK on Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Ubuntu_18.04.md)
   - [Install the OE SDK on Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Ubuntu_16.04.md)
