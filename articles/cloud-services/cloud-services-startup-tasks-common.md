# Common Cloud Service startup tasks
This article provides some examples of common startup tasks you may want to perform in your cloud service. You can use startup tasks to perform operations before a role starts. Operations that you might want to perform include installing a component, registering COM components, setting registry keys, or starting a long running process. 

See [this article](cloud-services-startup-tasks.md) to understand how startup tasks work, and specifically how to create the entries that define a startup task.

> [!NOTE]
> Startup tasks are not applicable to Virtual Machines, only to Cloud Service Web and Worker roles.
> 

## Define environment variables before a role starts
If you need environment variables defined for a specific task, use the [Environment] element inside the [Task] element.

```xml
<ServiceDefinition name="MyService" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
    <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1">
        ...
        <Startup>
            <Task commandLine="Startup.cmd" executionContext="limited" taskType="simple">
                <Environment>
                    <Variable name="MyEnvironmentVariable" value="MyVariableValue" />
                </Environment>
            </Task>
        </Startup>
    </WorkerRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```

Variables can also use a [valid Azure XPath value](cloud-services-role-config-xpath.md) to reference something about the deployment. Instead of using the `value` attribute, define a [RoleInstanceValue] child element.

```xml
<Variable name="PathToStartupStorage">
    <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/LocalResources/LocalResource[@name='StartupLocalStorage']/@path" />
</Variable>
```


## Configure IIS startup with AppCmd.exe
The [AppCmd.exe](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/jj635852(v=ws.11)) command-line tool can be used to manage IIS settings at startup on Azure. *AppCmd.exe* provides convenient, command-line access to configuration settings for use in startup tasks on Azure. Using *AppCmd.exe*, Website settings can be added, modified, or removed for applications and sites.

However, there are a few things to watch out for in the use of *AppCmd.exe* as a startup task:

* Startup tasks can be run more than once between reboots. For instance, when a role recycles.
* If a *AppCmd.exe* action is performed more than once, it may generate an error. For example, attempting to add a section to *Web.config* twice could generate an error.
* Startup tasks fail if they return a non-zero exit code or **errorlevel**. For example, when *AppCmd.exe* generates an error.

It is a good practice to check the **errorlevel** after calling *AppCmd.exe*, which is easy to do if you wrap the call to *AppCmd.exe* with a *.cmd* file. If you detect a known **errorlevel** response, you can ignore it, or pass it back.

The errorlevel returned by *AppCmd.exe* are listed in the winerror.h file, and can also be seen on [MSDN](/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes--0-499-).

### Example of managing the error level
This example adds a compression section and a compression entry for JSON to the *Web.config* file, with error handling and logging.

The relevant sections of the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file are shown here, which include setting the [executionContext](/previous-versions/azure/reference/gg557552(v=azure.100)#task) attribute to `elevated` to give *AppCmd.exe* sufficient permissions to change the settings in the *Web.config* file:

```xml
<ServiceDefinition name="MyService" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
    <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1">
        ...
        <Startup>
            <Task commandLine="Startup.cmd" executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple" />
        </Startup>
    </WorkerRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```

The *Startup.cmd* batch file uses *AppCmd.exe* to add a compression section and a compression entry for JSON to the *Web.config* file. The expected **errorlevel** of 183 is set to zero using the VERIFY.EXE command-line program. Unexpected errorlevels are logged to StartupErrorLog.txt.

```cmd
REM   *** Add a compression section to the Web.config file. ***
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd set config /section:urlCompression /doDynamicCompression:True /commit:apphost >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

REM   ERRORLEVEL 183 occurs when trying to add a section that already exists. This error is expected if this
REM   batch file were executed twice. This can occur and must be accounted for in an Azure startup
REM   task. To handle this situation, set the ERRORLEVEL to zero by using the Verify command. The Verify
REM   command will safely set the ERRORLEVEL to zero.
IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 183 VERIFY > NUL

REM   If the ERRORLEVEL is not zero at this point, some other error occurred.
IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    ECHO Error adding a compression section to the Web.config file. >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
    GOTO ErrorExit
)

REM   *** Add compression for json. ***
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd set config  -section:system.webServer/httpCompression /+"dynamicTypes.[mimeType='application/json; charset=utf-8',enabled='True']" /commit:apphost >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 183 VERIFY > NUL
IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    ECHO Error adding the JSON compression type to the Web.config file. >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
    GOTO ErrorExit
)

REM   *** Exit batch file. ***
EXIT /b 0

REM   *** Log error and exit ***
:ErrorExit
REM   Report the date, time, and ERRORLEVEL of the error.
DATE /T >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
TIME /T >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
ECHO An error occurred during startup. ERRORLEVEL = %ERRORLEVEL% >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
EXIT %ERRORLEVEL%
```

## Add firewall rules
In Azure, there are effectively two firewalls. The first firewall controls connections between the virtual machine and the outside world. This firewall is controlled by the [EndPoints] element in the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file.

The second firewall controls connections between the virtual machine and the processes within that virtual machine. This firewall can be controlled by the `netsh advfirewall firewall` command-line tool.

Azure creates firewall rules for the processes started within your roles. For example, when you start a service or program, Azure automatically creates the necessary firewall rules to allow that service to communicate with the Internet. However, if you create a service that is started by a process outside your role (like a COM+ service or a Windows Scheduled Task), you need to manually create a firewall rule to allow access to that service. These firewall rules can be created by using a startup task.

A startup task that creates a firewall rule must have an [executionContext][Task] of **elevated**. Add the following startup task to the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file.

```xml
<ServiceDefinition name="MyService" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
    <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1">
        ...
        <Startup>
            <Task commandLine="AddFirewallRules.cmd" executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple" />
        </Startup>
    </WorkerRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```

To add the firewall rule, you must use the appropriate `netsh advfirewall firewall` commands in your startup batch file. In this example, the startup task requires security and encryption for TCP port 80.

```cmd
REM   Add a firewall rule in a startup task.

REM   Add an inbound rule requiring security and encryption for TCP port 80 traffic.
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Require Encryption for Inbound TCP/80" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=80 security=authdynenc action=allow >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

REM   If an error occurred, return the errorlevel.
EXIT /B %errorlevel%
```

## Block a specific IP address
You can restrict an Azure web role access to a set of specified IP addresses by modifying your IIS **web.config** file. You also need to use a command file which unlocks the **ipSecurity** section of the **ApplicationHost.config** file.

To do unlock the **ipSecurity** section of the **ApplicationHost.config** file, create a command file that runs at role start. Create a folder at the root level of your web role called **startup** and, within this folder, create a batch file called **startup.cmd**. Add this file to your Visual Studio project and set the properties to **Copy Always** to ensure that it is included in your package.

Add the following startup task to the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file.

```xml
<ServiceDefinition name="MyService" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
    <WebRole name="WebRole1">
        ...
        <Startup>
            <Task commandLine="startup.cmd" executionContext="elevated" />
        </Startup>
    </WebRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```

Add this command to the **startup.cmd** file:

```cmd
@echo off
@echo Installing "IPv4 Address and Domain Restrictions" feature 
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -command "Install-WindowsFeature Web-IP-Security"
@echo Unlocking configuration for "IPv4 Address and Domain Restrictions" feature 
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe unlock config -section:system.webServer/security/ipSecurity
```

This task causes the **startup.cmd** batch file to be run every time the web role is initialized, ensuring that the required **ipSecurity** section is unlocked.

Finally, modify the [system.webServer section](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/ipsecurity#005) your web role’s **web.config** file to add a list of IP addresses that are granted access, as shown in the following example:

This sample config **allows** all IPs to access the server except the two defined

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <security>
    <!--Unlisted IP addresses are granted access-->
    <ipSecurity>
        <!--The following IP addresses are denied access-->
        <add allowed="false" ipAddress="192.168.100.1" subnetMask="255.255.0.0" />
        <add allowed="false" ipAddress="192.168.100.2" subnetMask="255.255.0.0" />
    </ipSecurity>
    </security>
</system.webServer>
```

This sample config **denies** all IPs from accessing the server except for the two defined.

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <security>
    <!--Unlisted IP addresses are denied access-->
    <ipSecurity allowUnlisted="false">
        <!--The following IP addresses are granted access-->
        <add allowed="true" ipAddress="192.168.100.1" subnetMask="255.255.0.0" />
        <add allowed="true" ipAddress="192.168.100.2" subnetMask="255.255.0.0" />
    </ipSecurity>
    </security>
</system.webServer>
```

## Create a PowerShell startup task
Windows PowerShell scripts cannot be called directly from the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file, but they can be invoked from within a startup batch file.

PowerShell (by default) does not run unsigned scripts. Unless you sign your script, you need to configure PowerShell to run unsigned scripts. To run unsigned scripts, the **ExecutionPolicy** must be set to **Unrestricted**. The **ExecutionPolicy** setting that you use is based on the version of Windows PowerShell.

```cmd
REM   Run an unsigned PowerShell script and log the output
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted .\startup.ps1 >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

REM   If an error occurred, return the errorlevel.
EXIT /B %errorlevel%
```

If you're using a Guest OS that is runs PowerShell 2.0 or 1.0 you can force version 2 to run, and if unavailable, use version 1.

```cmd
REM   Attempt to set the execution policy by using PowerShell version 2.0 syntax.
PowerShell -Version 2.0 -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted .\startup.ps1 >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

REM   If PowerShell version 2.0 isn't available. Set the execution policy by using the PowerShell
IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU -393216 (
   PowerShell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
   PowerShell .\startup.ps1 >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
)

REM   If an error occurred, return the errorlevel.
EXIT /B %errorlevel%
```

## Create files in local storage from a startup task
You can use a local storage resource to store files created by your startup task that is accessed later by your application.

To create the local storage resource, add a [LocalResources] section to the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file and then add the [LocalStorage] child element. Give the local storage resource a unique name and an appropriate size for your startup task.

To use a local storage resource in your startup task, you need to create an environment variable to reference the local storage resource location. Then the startup task and the application are able to read and write files to the local storage resource.

The relevant sections of the **ServiceDefinition.csdef** file are shown here:

```xml
<ServiceDefinition name="MyService" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
  <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1">
    ...

    <LocalResources>
      <LocalStorage name="StartupLocalStorage" sizeInMB="5"/>
    </LocalResources>

    <Startup>
      <Task commandLine="Startup.cmd" executionContext="limited" taskType="simple">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="PathToStartupStorage">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/LocalResources/LocalResource[@name='StartupLocalStorage']/@path" />
          </Variable>
        </Environment>
      </Task>
    </Startup>
  </WorkerRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```

As an example, this **Startup.cmd** batch file uses the **PathToStartupStorage** environment variable to create the file **MyTest.txt** on the local storage location.

```cmd
REM   Create a simple text file.

ECHO This text will go into the MyTest.txt file which will be in the    >  "%PathToStartupStorage%\MyTest.txt"
ECHO path pointed to by the PathToStartupStorage environment variable.  >> "%PathToStartupStorage%\MyTest.txt"
ECHO The contents of the PathToStartupStorage environment variable is   >> "%PathToStartupStorage%\MyTest.txt"
ECHO "%PathToStartupStorage%".                                          >> "%PathToStartupStorage%\MyTest.txt"

REM   Exit the batch file with ERRORLEVEL 0.

EXIT /b 0
```

You can access local storage folder from the Azure SDK by using the [GetLocalResource](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee772845(v=azure.100)) method.

```csharp
string localStoragePath = Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("StartupLocalStorage").RootPath;

string fileContent = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(System.IO.Path.Combine(localStoragePath, "MyTestFile.txt"));
```

## Run in the emulator or cloud
You can have your startup task perform different steps when it is operating in the cloud compared to when it is in the compute emulator. For example, you may want to use a fresh copy of your SQL data only when running in the emulator. Or you may want to do some performance optimizations for the cloud that you don't need to do when running in the emulator.

This ability to perform different actions on the compute emulator and the cloud can be accomplished by creating an environment variable in the [ServiceDefinition.csdef] file. You then test that environment variable for a value in your startup task.

To create the environment variable, add the [Variable]/[RoleInstanceValue] element and create an XPath value of `/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated`. The value of the **%ComputeEmulatorRunning%** environment variable is `true` when running on the compute emulator, and `false` when running on the cloud.

```xml
<ServiceDefinition name="MyService" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
  <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1">

    ...

    <Startup>
      <Task commandLine="Startup.cmd" executionContext="limited" taskType="simple">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="ComputeEmulatorRunning">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
          </Variable>
        </Environment>
      </Task>
    </Startup>

  </WorkerRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```

The task can now check the **%ComputeEmulatorRunning%** environment variable to perform different actions based on whether the role is running in the cloud or the emulator. Here is a .cmd shell script that checks for that environment variable.

```cmd
REM   Check if this task is running on the compute emulator.

IF "%ComputeEmulatorRunning%" == "true" (
    REM   This task is running on the compute emulator. Perform tasks that must be run only in the compute emulator.
) ELSE (
    REM   This task is running on the cloud. Perform tasks that must be run only in the cloud.
)
```


## Detect that your task has already run
The role may recycle without a reboot causing your startup tasks to run again. There is no flag to indicate that a task has already run on the hosting VM. You may have some tasks where it doesn't matter that they run multiple times. However, you may run into a situation where you need to prevent a task from running more than once.

The simplest way to detect that a task has already run is to create a file in the **%TEMP%** folder when the task is successful and look for it at the start of the task. Here is a sample cmd shell script that does that for you.

```cmd
REM   If Task1_Success.txt exists, then Application 1 is already installed.
IF EXIST "%PathToApp1Install%\Task1_Success.txt" (
  ECHO Application 1 is already installed. Exiting. >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
  GOTO Finish
)

REM   Run your real exe task
ECHO Running XYZ >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
"%PathToApp1Install%\setup.exe" >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 (
  REM   The application installed without error. Create a file to indicate that the task
  REM   does not need to be run again.

  ECHO This line will create a file to indicate that Application 1 installed correctly. > "%PathToApp1Install%\Task1_Success.txt"

) ELSE (
  REM   An error occurred. Log the error and exit with the error code.

  DATE /T >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
  TIME /T >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
  ECHO  An error occurred running task 1. Errorlevel = %ERRORLEVEL%. >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

  EXIT %ERRORLEVEL%
)

:Finish

REM   Exit normally.
EXIT /B 0
```

## Task best practices
Here are some best practices you should follow when configuring task for your web or worker role.

### Always log startup activities
Visual Studio does not provide a debugger to step through batch files, so it's good to get as much data on the operation of batch files as possible. Logging the output of batch files, both **stdout** and **stderr**, can give you important information when trying to debug and fix batch files. To log both **stdout** and **stderr** to the StartupLog.txt file in the directory pointed to by the **%TEMP%** environment variable, add the text `>>  "%TEMP%\\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1` to the end of specific lines you want to log. For example, to execute setup.exe in the **%PathToApp1Install%** directory: `"%PathToApp1Install%\setup.exe" >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1`

To simplify your xml, you can create a wrapper *cmd* file that calls all of your startup tasks along with logging and ensures each child-task shares the same environment variables.

You may find it annoying though to use `>> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1` on the end of each startup task. You can enforce task logging by creating a wrapper that handles logging for you. This wrapper calls the real batch file you want to run. Any output from the target batch file will be redirected to the *Startuplog.txt* file.

The following example shows how to redirect all output from a startup batch file. In this example, the ServerDefinition.csdef file creates a startup task that calls *logwrap.cmd*. *logwrap.cmd* calls *Startup2.cmd*, redirecting all output to **%TEMP%\\StartupLog.txt**.

ServiceDefinition.cmd:

```xml
<Startup>
    <Task commandLine="logwrap.cmd startup2.cmd" executionContext="limited" taskType="simple" />
</Startup>
```

**logwrap.cmd:**

```cmd
@ECHO OFF

REM   logwrap.cmd calls passed in batch file, redirecting all output to the StartupLog.txt log file.

ECHO [%date% %time%] == START logwrap.cmd ============================================== >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
ECHO [%date% %time%] Running %1 >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

REM   Call the child command batch file, redirecting all output to the StartupLog.txt log file.
START /B /WAIT %1 >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

REM   Log the completion of child command.
ECHO [%date% %time%] Done >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1

IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 (

   REM   No errors occurred. Exit logwrap.cmd normally.
   ECHO [%date% %time%] == END logwrap.cmd ================================================ >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
   ECHO.  >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
   EXIT /B 0

) ELSE (

   REM   Log the error.
   ECHO [%date% %time%] An error occurred. The ERRORLEVEL = %ERRORLEVEL%.  >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
   ECHO [%date% %time%] == END logwrap.cmd ================================================ >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
   ECHO.  >> "%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt" 2>&1
   EXIT /B %ERRORLEVEL%

)
```

**Startup2.cmd:**

```cmd
@ECHO OFF

REM   This is the batch file where the startup steps should be performed. Because of the
REM   way Startup2.cmd was called, all commands and their outputs will be stored in the
REM   StartupLog.txt file in the directory pointed to by the TEMP environment variable.

REM   If an error occurs, the following command will pass the ERRORLEVEL back to the
REM   calling batch file.

ECHO [%date% %time%] Some log information about this task
ECHO [%date% %time%] Some more log information about this task

EXIT %ERRORLEVEL%
```

Sample output in the **StartupLog.txt** file:

```txt
[Mon 10/17/2016 20:24:46.75] == START logwrap.cmd ============================================== 
[Mon 10/17/2016 20:24:46.75] Running command1.cmd 
[Mon 10/17/2016 20:24:46.77] Some log information about this task
[Mon 10/17/2016 20:24:46.77] Some more log information about this task
[Mon 10/17/2016 20:24:46.77] Done 
[Mon 10/17/2016 20:24:46.77] == END logwrap.cmd ================================================ 
```

> [!TIP]
> The **StartupLog.txt** file is located in the *C:\Resources\temp\\{role identifier}\RoleTemp* folder.

### Set executionContext appropriately for startup tasks
Set privileges appropriately for the startup task. Sometimes startup tasks must run with elevated privileges even though the role runs with normal privileges.

The [executionContext][Task] attribute sets the privilege level of the startup task. Using `executionContext="limited"` means the startup task has the same privilege level as the role. Using `executionContext="elevated"` means the startup task has administrator privileges, which allows the startup task to perform administrator tasks without giving administrator privileges to your role.

An example of a startup task that requires elevated privileges is a startup task that uses **AppCmd.exe** to configure IIS. **AppCmd.exe** requires `executionContext="elevated"`.

### Use the appropriate taskType
The [taskType][Task] attribute determines the way the startup task is executed. There are three values: **simple**, **background**, and **foreground**. The background and foreground tasks are started asynchronously, and then the simple tasks are executed synchronously one at a time.

With **simple** startup tasks, you can set the order in which the tasks run by the order in which the tasks are listed in the ServiceDefinition.csdef file. If a **simple** task ends with a non-zero exit code, then the startup procedure stops and the role does not start.

The difference between **background** startup tasks and **foreground** startup tasks is that **foreground** tasks keep the role running until the **foreground** task ends. This also means that if the **foreground** task hangs or crashes, the role will not recycle until the **foreground** task is forced closed. For this reason, **background** tasks are recommended for asynchronous startup tasks unless you need that feature of the **foreground** task.

### End batch files with EXIT /B 0
The role will only start if the **errorlevel** from each of your simple startup task is zero. Not all programs set the **errorlevel** (exit code) correctly, so the batch file should end with an `EXIT /B 0` if everything ran correctly.

A missing `EXIT /B 0` at the end of a startup batch file is a common cause of roles that do not start.

> [!NOTE]
> I've noticed that nested batch files sometimes stop responding when using the `/B` parameter. You may want to make sure that this problem does not happen if another batch file calls your current batch file, like if you use the [log wrapper](#always-log-startup-activities). You can omit the `/B` parameter in this case.
> 
> 

### Expect startup tasks to run more than once
Not all role recycles include a reboot, but all role recycles include running all startup tasks. This means that startup tasks must be able to run multiple times between reboots without any problems. This is discussed in the [preceding section](#detect-that-your-task-has-already-run).

### Use local storage to store files that must be accessed in the role
If you want to copy or create a file during your startup task that is then accessible to your role, then that file must be placed in local storage. See the [preceding section](#create-files-in-local-storage-from-a-startup-task).
