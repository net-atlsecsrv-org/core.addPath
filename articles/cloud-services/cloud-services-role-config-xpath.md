# Expose role configuration settings as an environment variable with XPath
In the cloud service worker or web role service definition file, you can expose runtime configuration values as environment variables. The following XPath values are supported (which correspond to API values).

These XPath values are also available through the [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee773173(v=azure.100)) library. 

## App running in emulator
Indicates that the app is running in the emulator.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" |
| Code |var x = RoleEnvironment.IsEmulated; |

## Deployment ID
Retrieves the deployment ID for the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@id" |
| Code |var deploymentId = RoleEnvironment.DeploymentId; |

## Role ID
Retrieves the current role ID for the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/@id" |
| Code |var id = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.Id; |

## Update domain
Retrieves the update domain of the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/@updateDomain" |
| Code |var ud = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.UpdateDomain; |

## Fault domain
Retrieves the fault domain of the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/@faultDomain" |
| Code |var fd = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.FaultDomain; |

## Role name
Retrieves the role name of the instances.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/@roleName" |
| Code |var rname = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.Role.Name; |

## Config setting
Retrieves the value of the specified configuration setting.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/ConfigurationSettings/ConfigurationSetting[@name='Setting1']/@value" |
| Code |var setting = RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue("Setting1"); |

## Local storage path
Retrieves the local storage path for the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/LocalResources/LocalResource[@name='LocalStore1']/@path" |
| Code |var localResourcePath = RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("LocalStore1").RootPath; |

## Local storage size
Retrieves the size of the local storage for the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/LocalResources/LocalResource[@name='LocalStore1']/@sizeInMB" |
| Code |var localResourceSizeInMB = RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("LocalStore1").MaximumSizeInMegabytes; |

## Endpoint protocol
Retrieves the endpoint protocol for the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/Endpoints/Endpoint[@name='Endpoint1']/@protocol" |
| Code |var prot = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.InstanceEndpoints["Endpoint1"].Protocol; |

## Endpoint IP
Gets the specified endpoint's IP address.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/Endpoints/Endpoint[@name='Endpoint1']/@address" |
| Code |var address = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.InstanceEndpoints["Endpoint1"].IPEndpoint.Address |

## Endpoint port
Retrieves the endpoint port for the instance.

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XPath |xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/Endpoints/Endpoint[@name='Endpoint1']/@port" |
| Code |var port = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.InstanceEndpoints["Endpoint1"].IPEndpoint.Port; |

## Example
Here is an example of a worker role that creates a startup task with an environment variable named `TestIsEmulated` set to the [@emulated xpath value](#app-running-in-emulator). 

```xml
<WorkerRole name="Role1">
    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="Setting1" />
    </ConfigurationSettings>
    <LocalResources>
      <LocalStorage name="LocalStore1" sizeInMB="1024"/>
    </LocalResources>
    <Endpoints>
      <InternalEndpoint name="Endpoint1" protocol="tcp" />
    </Endpoints>
    <Startup>
      <Task commandLine="example.cmd inputParm">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="TestConstant" value="Constant"/>
          <Variable name="TestEmptyValue" value=""/>
          <Variable name="TestIsEmulated">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated"/>
          </Variable>
          ...
        </Environment>
      </Task>
    </Startup>
    <Runtime>
      <Environment>
        <Variable name="TestConstant" value="Constant"/>
        <Variable name="TestEmptyValue" value=""/>
        <Variable name="TestIsEmulated">
          <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated"/>
        </Variable>
        ...
      </Environment>
    </Runtime>
    ...
</WorkerRole>
```
