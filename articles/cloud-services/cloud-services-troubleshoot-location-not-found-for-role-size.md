# Troubleshoot LocationNotFoundForRoleSize when deploying a Cloud service (classic) to Azure

In this article, you'll troubleshoot allocation failures where a Virtual Machine (VM) size isn't available when you deploy an Azure Cloud service (classic).

When you deploy instances to a Cloud service (classic) or add new web or worker role instances, Microsoft Azure allocates compute resources.

You may occasionally receive errors during these operations even before you reach the Azure subscription limit.

> [!TIP]
> The information may also be useful when you plan the deployment of your services.

## Symptom

In Azure portal, navigate to your Cloud service (classic) and in the sidebar select *Operation log (classic)* to view the logs.

![Image shows the Operation log (classic) blade.](./media/cloud-services-troubleshoot-location-not-found-for-role-size/cloud-services-troubleshoot-allocation-logs.png)

When you're inspecting the logs of your Cloud service (classic), you'll see the following exception:

|Exception Type  |Error Message  |
|---------|---------|
|LocationNotFoundForRoleSize     |The operation '`{Operation ID}`' failed: 'The requested VM tier is currently not available in Region (`{Region ID}`) for this subscription. Please try another tier or deploy to a different location.'.|

## Cause

There's a capacity issue with the region or cluster that you're deploying to. The *LocationNotFoundForRoleSize* exception occurs when the resource SKU you've selected (VM size) isn't available for the region specified.

## Solution

In this scenario, you should select a different region or SKU to deploy your Cloud service (classic) to. Before deploying or upgrading your Cloud service (classic), you can determine which SKUs are available in a region or availability zone. Follow the [Azure CLI](#list-skus-in-region-using-azure-cli), [PowerShell](#list-skus-in-region-using-powershell), or [REST API](#list-skus-in-region-using-rest-api) processes below.

### List SKUs in region using Azure CLI

You can use the [az vm list-skus](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm.html#az_vm_list_skus) command.

- Use the `--location` parameter to filter output to location you're using.
- Use the `--size` parameter to search by a partial size name.
- For more information, see the [Resolve error for SKU not available](../azure-resource-manager/templates/error-sku-not-available.md#solution-2---azure-cli) guide.

    **For example:**

    ```azurecli
    az vm list-skus --location southcentralus --size Standard_F --output table
    ```

    **Example results:**
    ![Azure CLI output of running the 'az vm list-skus --location southcentralus --size Standard_F --output table' command, which shows the available SKUs.](./media/cloud-services-troubleshoot-constrained-allocation-failed/cloud-services-troubleshoot-constrained-allocation-failed-1.png)

#### List SKUs in region using PowerShell

You can use the [Get-AzComputeResourceSku](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azcomputeresourcesku) command.

- Filter the results by location.
- You must have the latest version of PowerShell for this command.
- For more information, see the [Resolve error for SKU not available](../azure-resource-manager/templates/error-sku-not-available.md#solution-1---powershell) guide.

**For example:**

```azurepowershell
Get-AzComputeResourceSku | where {$_.Locations -icontains "centralus"}
```

**Some other useful commands:**

Filter out the locations that contain size (Standard_DS14_v2):

```azurepowershell
Get-AzComputeResourceSku | where {$_.Locations.Contains("centralus") -and $_.ResourceType.Contains("virtualMachines") -and $_.Name.Contains("Standard_DS14_v2")}
```

Filter out all the locations that contain size (V3):

```azurepowershell
Get-AzComputeResourceSku | where {$_.Locations.Contains("centralus") -and $_.ResourceType.Contains("virtualMachines") -and $_.Name.Contains("v3")} | fc
```

#### List SKUs in region using REST API

You can use the [Resource Skus - List](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/resourceskus/list) operation. It returns available SKUs and regions in the following format:

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "resourceType": "virtualMachines",
      "name": "Standard_A0",
      "tier": "Standard",
      "size": "A0",
      "locations": [
        "eastus"
      ],
      "restrictions": []
    },
    {
      "resourceType": "virtualMachines",
      "name": "Standard_A1",
      "tier": "Standard",
      "size": "A1",
      "locations": [
        "eastus"
      ],
      "restrictions": []
    },
      <<The rest of your file is located here>>
  ]
}
    
```
