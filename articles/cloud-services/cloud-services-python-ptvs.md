## What are Python web and worker roles?
Azure provides three compute models for running applications: [Web Apps feature in Azure App Service][execution model-web sites], [Azure Virtual Machines][execution model-vms], and [Azure Cloud Services][execution model-cloud services]. All three models support Python. Cloud Services, which include web and worker roles, provide *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*. Within a cloud service, a web role provides a dedicated Internet Information Services (IIS) web server to host front end web applications, while a worker role can run asynchronous, long-running, or perpetual tasks independent of user interaction or input.

For more information, see [What is a Cloud Service?].

> [!NOTE]
> *Looking to build a simple website?*
> If your scenario involves just a simple website front end, consider using the lightweight Web Apps feature in Azure App Service. You can easily upgrade to a Cloud Service as your website grows and your requirements change. See the [Python Developer Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/develop/python/) for articles that cover development of the Web Apps feature in Azure App Service.

## Project creation
In Visual Studio, you can select **Azure Cloud Service** in the **New Project** dialog box, under **Python**.

![New Project Dialog](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/new-project-cloud-service.png)

In the Azure Cloud Service wizard, you can create new web and worker roles.

![Azure Cloud Service Dialog](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/new-service-wizard.png)

The worker role template comes with boilerplate code to connect to an Azure storage account or Azure Service Bus.

![Cloud Service Solution](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/worker.png)

You can add web or worker roles to an existing cloud service at any time.  You can choose to add existing projects in your solution, or create new ones.

![Add Role Command](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/add-new-or-existing-role.png)

Your cloud service can contain roles implemented in different languages.  For example, you can have a Python web role implemented using Django, with Python, or with C# worker roles.  You can easily communicate between your roles using Service Bus queues or storage queues.

## Install Python on the cloud service
> [!WARNING]
> The setup scripts that are installed with Visual Studio (at the time this article was last updated) do not work. This section describes a workaround.
> 
> 

The main problem with the setup scripts is that they do not install python. First, define two [startup tasks](cloud-services-startup-tasks.md) in the [ServiceDefinition.csdef](cloud-services-model-and-package.md#servicedefinitioncsdef) file. The first task (**PrepPython.ps1**) downloads and installs the Python runtime. The second task (**PipInstaller.ps1**) runs pip to install any dependencies you may have.

The following scripts were written targeting Python 3.5. If you want to use the version 2.x of python, set the **PYTHON2** variable file to **on** for the two startup tasks and the runtime task: `<Variable name="PYTHON2" value="<mark>on</mark>" />`.

```xml
<Startup>

  <Task executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple" commandLine="bin\ps.cmd PrepPython.ps1">
    <Environment>
      <Variable name="EMULATED">
        <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
      </Variable>
      <Variable name="PYTHON2" value="off" />
    </Environment>
  </Task>

  <Task executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple" commandLine="bin\ps.cmd PipInstaller.ps1">
    <Environment>
      <Variable name="EMULATED">
        <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
      </Variable>
      <Variable name="PYTHON2" value="off" />
    </Environment>

  </Task>

</Startup>
```

The **PYTHON2** and **PYPATH** variables must be added to the worker startup task. The **PYPATH** variable is only used if the **PYTHON2** variable is set to **on**.

```xml
<Runtime>
  <Environment>
    <Variable name="EMULATED">
      <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
    </Variable>
    <Variable name="PYTHON2" value="off" />
    <Variable name="PYPATH" value="%SystemDrive%\Python27" />
  </Environment>
  <EntryPoint>
    <ProgramEntryPoint commandLine="bin\ps.cmd LaunchWorker.ps1" setReadyOnProcessStart="true" />
  </EntryPoint>
</Runtime>
```

#### Sample ServiceDefinition.csdef
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceDefinition name="AzureCloudServicePython" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition" schemaVersion="2015-04.2.6">
  <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1" vmsize="Small">
    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString" />
      <Setting name="Python2" />
    </ConfigurationSettings>
    <Startup>
      <Task executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple" commandLine="bin\ps.cmd PrepPython.ps1">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="EMULATED">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
          </Variable>
          <Variable name="PYTHON2" value="off" />
        </Environment>
      </Task>
      <Task executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple" commandLine="bin\ps.cmd PipInstaller.ps1">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="EMULATED">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
          </Variable>
          <Variable name="PYTHON2" value="off" />
        </Environment>
      </Task>
    </Startup>
    <Runtime>
      <Environment>
        <Variable name="EMULATED">
          <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
        </Variable>
        <Variable name="PYTHON2" value="off" />
        <Variable name="PYPATH" value="%SystemDrive%\Python27" />
      </Environment>
      <EntryPoint>
        <ProgramEntryPoint commandLine="bin\ps.cmd LaunchWorker.ps1" setReadyOnProcessStart="true" />
      </EntryPoint>
    </Runtime>
    <Imports>
      <Import moduleName="RemoteAccess" />
      <Import moduleName="RemoteForwarder" />
    </Imports>
  </WorkerRole>
</ServiceDefinition>
```



Next, create the **PrepPython.ps1** and **PipInstaller.ps1** files in the **./bin** folder of your role.

#### PrepPython.ps1
This script installs python. If the **PYTHON2** environment variable is set to **on**, then Python 2.7 is installed, otherwise Python 3.5 is installed.

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "tls12, tls11, tls"
$is_emulated = $env:EMULATED -eq "true"
$is_python2 = $env:PYTHON2 -eq "on"
$nl = [Environment]::NewLine

if (-not $is_emulated){
    Write-Output "Checking if python is installed...$nl"
    if ($is_python2) {
        & "${env:SystemDrive}\Python27\python.exe"  -V | Out-Null
    }
    else {
        py -V | Out-Null
    }

    if (-not $?) {

        $url = "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-amd64.exe"
        $outFile = "${env:TEMP}\python-3.5.2-amd64.exe"

        if ($is_python2) {
            $url = "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.amd64.msi"
            $outFile = "${env:TEMP}\python-2.7.12.amd64.msi"
        }

        Write-Output "Not found, downloading $url to $outFile$nl"
        Invoke-WebRequest $url -OutFile $outFile
        Write-Output "Installing$nl"

        if ($is_python2) {
            Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList "/q", "/i", "$outFile", "ALLUSERS=1" -Wait
        }
        else {
            Start-Process "$outFile" -ArgumentList "/quiet", "InstallAllUsers=1" -Wait
        }

        Write-Output "Done$nl"
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "Already installed"
    }
}
```

#### PipInstaller.ps1
This script calls up pip and installs all of the dependencies in the **requirements.txt** file. If the **PYTHON2** environment variable is set to **on**, then Python 2.7 is used, otherwise Python 3.5 is used.

```powershell
$is_emulated = $env:EMULATED -eq "true"
$is_python2 = $env:PYTHON2 -eq "on"
$nl = [Environment]::NewLine

if (-not $is_emulated){
    Write-Output "Checking if requirements.txt exists$nl"
    if (Test-Path ..\requirements.txt) {
        Write-Output "Found. Processing pip$nl"

        if ($is_python2) {
            & "${env:SystemDrive}\Python27\python.exe" -m pip install -r ..\requirements.txt
        }
        else {
            py -m pip install -r ..\requirements.txt
        }

        Write-Output "Done$nl"
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "Not found$nl"
    }
}
```

#### Modify LaunchWorker.ps1
> [!NOTE]
> In the case of a **worker role** project, **LauncherWorker.ps1** file is required to execute the startup file. In a **web role** project, the startup file is instead defined in the project properties.
> 
> 

The **bin\LaunchWorker.ps1** was originally created to do a lot of prep work but it doesn't really work. Replace the contents in that file with the following script.

This script calls the **worker.py** file from your python project. If the **PYTHON2** environment variable is set to **on**, then Python 2.7 is used, otherwise Python 3.5 is used.

```powershell
$is_emulated = $env:EMULATED -eq "true"
$is_python2 = $env:PYTHON2 -eq "on"
$nl = [Environment]::NewLine

if (-not $is_emulated)
{
    Write-Output "Running worker.py$nl"

    if ($is_python2) {
        cd..
        iex "$env:PYPATH\python.exe worker.py"
    }
    else {
        cd..
        iex "py worker.py"
    }
}
else
{
    Write-Output "Running (EMULATED) worker.py$nl"

    # Customize to your local dev environment

    if ($is_python2) {
        cd..
        iex "$env:PYPATH\python.exe worker.py"
    }
    else {
        cd..
        iex "py worker.py"
    }
}
```

#### ps.cmd
The Visual Studio templates should have created a **ps.cmd** file in the **./bin** folder. This shell script calls out the PowerShell wrapper scripts above and provides logging based on the name of the PowerShell wrapper called. If this file wasn't created, here is what should be in it. 

```bat
@echo off

cd /D %~dp0

if not exist "%DiagnosticStore%\LogFiles" mkdir "%DiagnosticStore%\LogFiles"
%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File %* >> "%DiagnosticStore%\LogFiles\%~n1.txt" 2>> "%DiagnosticStore%\LogFiles\%~n1.err.txt"
```



## Run locally
If you set your cloud service project as the startup project and press F5, the cloud service runs in the local Azure emulator.

Although PTVS supports launching in the emulator, debugging (for example, breakpoints) does not work.

To debug your web and worker roles, you can set the role project as the startup project and debug that instead.  You can also set multiple startup projects.  Right-click the solution and then select **Set StartUp Projects**.

![Solution Startup Project Properties](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/startup.png)

## Publish to Azure
To publish, right-click the cloud service project in the solution and then select **Publish**.

![Microsoft Azure Publish Sign In](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/publish-sign-in.png)

Follow the wizard. If you need to, enable remote desktop. Remote desktop is helpful when you need to debug something.

When you are done configuring settings, click **Publish**.

Some progress appears in the output window, then you'll see the Microsoft Azure Activity Log window.

![Microsoft Azure Activity Log Window](./media/cloud-services-python-ptvs/publish-activity-log.png)

Deployment takes several minutes to complete, then your web and/or worker roles run on Azure!

### Investigate logs
After the cloud service virtual machine starts up and installs Python, you can look at the logs to find any failure messages. These logs are located in the **C:\Resources\Directory\\{role}\LogFiles** folder. **PrepPython.err.txt** has at least one error in it from when the script tries to detect if Python is installed and **PipInstaller.err.txt** may complain about an outdated version of pip.
