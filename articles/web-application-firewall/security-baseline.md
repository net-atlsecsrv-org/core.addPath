# Azure security baseline for Azure Web Application Firewall

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Web Application Firewall. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Web Application Firewall. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Web Application Firewall have been excluded. 

To see how Azure Web Application Firewall completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Web Application Firewall security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Use Microsoft Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) for centralized protection of web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. 

- Detection mode: Use this mode for learning the network traffic, understand and review false positives. It monitors and logs all threat alerts. Make sure that Diagnostics and WAF log are selected and turned on. Note that the WAF does not block incoming requests when it's operating in Detection mode.
- Prevention mode: Blocks intrusions and attacks detected by the rules. An attacker receives a "403 unauthorized access" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.

Baseline your network traffic with the WAF's Detection mode. After determining your traffic needs, configure the WAF in Prevention mode to bock unwanted traffic.

Follow up on high severity recommendations from Security Center for any web-enabled resources which are not protected by WAF.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Use custom rules with the Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) to allow and block traffic. For example, all traffic coming from a range of IP addresses can be blocked. 
Configure Azure WAF to run in Prevention mode which blocks intrusions and attacks detected by the rules. An attacker receives a "403 unauthorized access" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

**Guidance**: Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) is core component of Azure's web application protections. Use Azure WAF to provide centralized protection for web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities with pre-configured managed ruleset against known attack signatures from OWASP TOP 10 categories.

Customize Azure WAF with rules and rule groups to suit web application requirements and eliminate false positives. Associate an Azure WAF Policy for each site behind a WAF to allow for site-specific configuration. Azure WAF supports Geo-filtering, Rate-limiting, Azure-managed Default Rule Set rules. and custom rules can be created to suit the needs of an application. 

Configure the Azure WAF to run in Prevention mode after baselining the network traffic in Detection mode for a determined period of time. The Azure WAF blocks intrusions and attacks detected by the rules in Prevention mode. An attacker receives a "403 unauthorized access" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.
