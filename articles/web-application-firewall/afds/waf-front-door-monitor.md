# Azure Web Application Firewall monitoring and logging

Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) monitoring and logging are provided through logging and integration with Azure Monitor and Azure Monitor logs.

## Azure Monitor

WAF with FrontDoor log is integrated with [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md). Azure Monitor allows you to track diagnostic information including WAF alerts and logs. You can configure WAF monitoring within the Front Door resource in the portal under the **Diagnostics** tab or through the Azure Monitor service directly.

From Azure portal, go to Front Door resource type. From **Monitoring**/**Metrics** tab on the left, you can add **WebApplicationFirewallRequestCount** to track number of requests that match WAF rules. Custom filters can be created based on action types and rule names.

## Logs and diagnostics

WAF with Front Door provides detailed reporting on each threat it detects. Logging is integrated with Azure Diagnostics logs and alerts are recorded in a json format. These logs can be integrated with [Azure Monitor logs](../../azure-monitor/insights/azure-networking-analytics.md).

[FrontdoorAccessLog](../../frontdoor/front-door-diagnostics.md) logs all requests. FrontdoorWebApplicationFirewallLog logs any request that matches a WAF rule having the below schema:

| Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Action|Action taken on the request|
| ClientIp | The IP address of the client that made the request. If there was an X-Forwarded-For header in the request, then the Client IP is picked from the header field. |
| ClientPort | The IP port of the client that made the request. |
| Details|Additional details on the matched request |
|| matchVariableName:   http parameter name of the request matched, for example, header names|
|| matchVariableValue:  values that triggered the match|
| Host | The host header of the matched request |
| Policy | The name of the WAF policy that the request matched. |
| PolicyMode | Operations mode of the WAF policy. Possible values are "Prevention" and "Detection" |
| RequestUri | Full URI of the matched request. |
| RuleName | The name of the WAF rule that the request matched. |
| SocketIp | The source IP address seen by WAF. This IP address is based on TCP session, independent of any request headers.|
| TrackingReference | The unique reference string that identifies a request served by Front Door, also sent as X-Azure-Ref header to the client. Required for searching details in the access logs for a specific request. |

The following query example returns WAF logs on blocked requests:

``` WAFlogQuery
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "FRONTDOORS" and Category == "FrontdoorWebApplicationFirewallLog"
| where action_s == "Block"

```

Here is an example of a logged request in WAF log:

``` WAFlogQuerySample
{
    "time":  "2020-06-09T22:32:17.8376810Z",
    "category": "FrontdoorWebApplicationFirewallLog",
    "operationName": "Microsoft.Network/FrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLog/Write",
    "properties":
    {
        "clientIP":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
        "clientPort":"52097",
        "socketIP":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
        "requestUri":"https://wafdemofrontdoorwebapp.azurefd.net:443/?q=%27%20or%201=1",
        "ruleName":"Microsoft_DefaultRuleSet-1.1-SQLI-942100",
        "policy":"WafDemoCustomPolicy",
        "action":"Block",
        "host":"wafdemofrontdoorwebapp.azurefd.net",
        "trackingReference":"08Q3gXgAAAAAe0s71BET/QYwmqtpHO7uAU0pDRURHRTA1MDgANjMxNTAwZDAtOTRiNS00YzIwLTljY2YtNjFhNzMyOWQyYTgy",
        "policyMode":"prevention",
        "details":
            {
            "matches":
                [{
                "matchVariableName":"QueryParamValue:q",
                "matchVariableValue":"' or 1=1"
                }]
            }
     }
}
```

The following example query returns AccessLogs entries:

``` AccessLogQuery
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "FRONTDOORS" and Category == "FrontdoorAccessLog"

```

Here is an example of a logged request in Access log:

``` AccessLogSample
{
"time": "2020-06-09T22:32:17.8383427Z",
"category": "FrontdoorAccessLog",
"operationName": "Microsoft.Network/FrontDoor/AccessLog/Write",
 "properties":
    {
    "trackingReference":"08Q3gXgAAAAAe0s71BET/QYwmqtpHO7uAU0pDRURHRTA1MDgANjMxNTAwZDAtOTRiNS00YzIwLTljY2YtNjFhNzMyOWQyYTgy",
    "httpMethod":"GET",
    "httpVersion":"2.0",
    "requestUri":"https://wafdemofrontdoorwebapp.azurefd.net:443/?q=%27%20or%201=1",
    "requestBytes":"715",
    "responseBytes":"380",
    "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4157.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/85.0.531.1",
    "clientIp":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
    "socketIp":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
    "clientPort":"52097",
    "timeTaken":"0.003",
    "securityProtocol":"TLS 1.2",
    "routingRuleName":"WAFdemoWebAppRouting",
    "rulesEngineMatchNames":[],
    "backendHostname":"wafdemowebappuscentral.azurewebsites.net:443",
    "sentToOriginShield":false,
    "httpStatusCode":"403",
    "httpStatusDetails":"403",
    "pop":"SJC",
    "cacheStatus":"CONFIG_NOCACHE"
    }
}
