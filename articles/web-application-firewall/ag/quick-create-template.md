# Quickstart: Create an Azure WAF v2 on Application Gateway - Resource Manager template

In this quickstart, you use a Resource Manager template to create an Azure Web Application Firewall v2 on Application Gateway.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Create a Web Application Firewall

This template creates a simple Web Application Firewall v2 on Azure Application Gateway. This includes a public IP frontend IP address, HTTP settings, a rule with a basic listener on port 80, and a backend pool. A WAF policy with a custom rule is created to block traffic to the backend pool based on an IP address match type.

### Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/ag-docs-wafv2/azuredeploy.json)

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/ag-docs-wafv2/azuredeploy.json" range="001-404" highlight="314-358":::

Multiple Azure resources are defined in the template:

- [**Microsoft.Network/applicationgateways**](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/applicationgateways)
- [**Microsoft.Network/ApplicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallPolicies**](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/ApplicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallPolicies)
- [**Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses**](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/publicipaddresses) : one for the application gateway, and two for the virtual machines.
- [**Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups**](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/networksecuritygroups)
- [**Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks**](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/virtualnetworks)
- [**Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines**](/azure/templates/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines) : two virtual machines
- [**Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces**](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/networkinterfaces) : two for the virtual machines
- [**Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/extensions**](/azure/templates/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/extensions) : to configure IIS and the web pages

### Deploy the template

Deploy Resource Manager template to Azure:

1. Select **Deploy to Azure** to sign in to Azure and open the template. The template creates an application gateway, the network infrastructure, and two virtual machines in the backend pool running IIS.

   <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fag-docs-wafv2%2Fazuredeploy.json"><img src="../media/quick-create-template/deploy-to-azure.png" alt="deploy to azure"/></a>

2. Select or create your resource group.
3. Select **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** and then select **Purchase**. The deployment can take 10 minutes or longer to complete.

## Validate the deployment

Although IIS isn't required to create the application gateway, it's installed on the backend servers to verify if Azure successfully created a WAF v2 on the application gateway. 

Use IIS to test the application gateway:

1. Find the public IP address for the application gateway on its **Overview** page.![Record application gateway public IP address](../../application-gateway/media/application-gateway-create-gateway-portal/application-gateway-record-ag-address.png) Or, you can select **All resources**, enter *myAGPublicIPAddress* in the search box, and then select it in the search results. Azure displays the public IP address on the **Overview** page.
2. Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser to browse that IP address.
3. Check the response. A **403 Forbidden** response verifies that the WAF was successfully created and is blocking connections to the backend pool.
4. Change the custom rule to **Allow traffic**.
  Run the following Azure PowerShell script, replacing your resource group name:
   ```azurepowershell
   $rg = "<your resource group name>"
   $AppGW = Get-AzApplicationGateway -Name myAppGateway -ResourceGroupName $rg
   $pol = Get-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallPolicy -Name WafPol01 -ResourceGroupName $rg
   $pol[0].customrules[0].action = "allow"
   $rule = $pol.CustomRules
   Set-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallPolicy -Name WafPol01 -ResourceGroupName $rg -CustomRule $rule
   $AppGW.FirewallPolicy = $pol
   Set-AzApplicationGateway -ApplicationGateway $AppGW
   ```

   Refresh your browser multiple times and you should see connections to both myVM1 and myVM2.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources that you created with the application gateway, delete the resource group. This removes the application gateway and all the related resources.

To delete the resource group, call the `Remove-AzResourceGroup` cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "<your resource group name>"
```
