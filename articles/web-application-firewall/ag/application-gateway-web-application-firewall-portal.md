# Tutorial: Create an application gateway with a Web Application Firewall using the Azure portal

This tutorial shows you how to use the Azure portal to create an Application Gateway with a Web Application Firewall (WAF). The WAF uses [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project) rules to protect your application. These rules include protection against attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and session hijacks. After creating the application gateway, you test it to make sure it's working correctly. With Azure Application Gateway, you direct your application web traffic to specific resources by assigning listeners to ports, creating rules, and adding resources to a backend pool. For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses a simple setup with a public front-end IP, a basic listener to host a single site on this application gateway, two virtual machines used for the backend pool, and a basic request routing rule.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

<!---If you prefer, you can complete this tutorial using [Azure PowerShell](tutorial-restrict-web-traffic-powershell.md) or [Azure CLI](tutorial-restrict-web-traffic-cli.md).--->

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create an application gateway

For Azure to communicate between resources, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you create a new virtual network. You can create a virtual network at the same time that you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.

Select **Create a resource** on the left menu of the Azure portal. The **New** window appears.

Select **Networking** and then select **Application Gateway** in the **Featured** list.

### Basics tab

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter these values for the following application gateway settings:

   - **Resource group**: Select **myResourceGroupAG** for the resource group. If it doesn't exist, select **Create new** to create it.
   - **Application gateway name**: Enter *myAppGateway* for the name of the application gateway.
   - **Tier**: select **WAF V2**.

2.  For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network at the same time that you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.

    Under **Configure virtual network**, create a new virtual network by selecting **Create new**. In the **Create virtual network** window that opens, enter the following values to create the virtual network and two subnets:

    - **Name**: Enter *myVNet* for the name of the virtual network.

    - **Subnet name** (Application Gateway subnet): The **Subnets** grid will show a subnet named *Default*. Change the name of this subnet to *myAGSubnet*.<br>The application gateway subnet can contain only application gateways. No other resources are allowed.

    - **Subnet name** (backend server subnet): In the second row of the **Subnets** grid, enter *myBackendSubnet* in the **Subnet name** column.

    - **Address range** (backend server subnet): In the second row of the **Subnets** Grid, enter an address range that doesn't overlap with the address range of *myAGSubnet*. For example, if the address range of *myAGSubnet* is 10.0.0.0/24, enter *10.0.1.0/24* for the address range of *myBackendSubnet*.

    Select **OK** to close the **Create virtual network** window and save the virtual network settings.

     ![Create new application gateway: virtual network](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-create-vnet.png)
    
3. On the **Basics** tab, accept the default values for the other settings and then select **Next: Frontends**.

### Frontends tab

1. On the **Frontends** tab, verify **Frontend IP address type** is set to **Public**. <br>You can configure the Frontend IP to be Public or Private as per your use case. In this example, you'll choose a Public Frontend IP.
   > [!NOTE]
   > For the Application Gateway v2 SKU, you can only choose **Public** frontend IP configuration. Private frontend IP configuration is currently not enabled for this v2 SKU.

2. Choose **Create new** for the **Public IP address** and enter *myAGPublicIPAddress* for the public IP address name, and then select **OK**. 

     ![Create new application gateway: frontends](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-create-frontends.png)

3. Select **Next: Backends**.

### Backends tab

The backend pool is used to route requests to the backend servers that serve the request. Backend pools can be composed of NICs, virtual machine scale sets, public IPs, internal IPs, fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and multi-tenant back-ends like Azure App Service. In this example, you'll create an empty backend pool with your application gateway and then add backend targets to the backend pool.

1. On the **Backends** tab, select **+Add a backend pool**.

2. In the **Add a backend pool** window that opens, enter the following values to create an empty backend pool:

    - **Name**: Enter *myBackendPool* for the name of the backend pool.
    - **Add backend pool without targets**: Select **Yes** to create a backend pool with no targets. You'll add backend targets after creating the application gateway.

3. In the **Add a backend pool** window, select **Add** to save the backend pool configuration and return to the **Backends** tab.

     ![Create new application gateway: backends](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-create-backends.png)

4. On the **Backends** tab, select **Next: Configuration**.

### Configuration tab

On the **Configuration** tab, you'll connect the frontend and backend pool you created using a routing rule.

1. Select **Add a rule** in the **Routing rules** column.

2. In the **Add a routing rule** window that opens, enter *myRoutingRule* for the **Rule name**.

3. A routing rule requires a listener. On the **Listener** tab within the **Add a routing rule** window, enter the following values for the listener:

    - **Listener name**: Enter *myListener* for the name of the listener.
    - **Frontend IP**: Select **Public** to choose the public IP you created for the frontend.
  
      Accept the default values for the other settings on the **Listener** tab, then select the **Backend targets** tab to configure the rest of the routing rule.

   ![Create new application gateway: listener](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-create-rule-listener.png)

4. On the **Backend targets** tab, select **myBackendPool** for the **Backend target**.

5. For the **HTTP setting**, select **Create new** to create a new HTTP setting. The HTTP setting will determine the behavior of the routing rule. In the **Add an HTTP setting** window that opens, enter *myHTTPSetting* for the **HTTP setting name**. Accept the default values for the other settings in the **Add an HTTP setting** window, then select **Add** to return to the **Add a routing rule** window. 

     ![Create new application gateway: HTTP setting](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-create-httpsetting.png)

6. On the **Add a routing rule** window, select **Add** to save the routing rule and return to the **Configuration** tab.

     ![Create new application gateway: routing rule](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-create-rule-backends.png)

7. Select **Next: Tags** and then **Next: Review + create**.

### Review + create tab

Review the settings on the **Review + create** tab, and then select **Create** to create the virtual network, the public IP address, and the application gateway. It may take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. 

Wait until the deployment finishes successfully before moving on to the next section.

## Add backend targets

In this example, you'll use virtual machines as the target backend. You can either use existing virtual machines or create new ones. You'll create two virtual machines that Azure uses as backend servers for the application gateway.

To do this, you'll:

1. Create two new VMs, *myVM* and *myVM2*, to be used as backend servers.
2. Install IIS on the virtual machines to verify that the application gateway was created successfully.
3. Add the backend servers to the backend pool.

### Create a virtual machine

1. On the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**. The **New** window appears.
2. Select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** in the **Popular** list. The **Create a virtual machine** page appears.<br>Application Gateway can route traffic to any type of virtual machine used in its backend pool. In this example, you use a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.
3. Enter these values in the **Basics** tab for the following virtual machine settings:

    - **Resource group**: Select **myResourceGroupAG** for the resource group name.
    - **Virtual machine name**: Enter *myVM* for the name of the virtual machine.
    - **Username**: Enter *azureuser* for the administrator user name.
    - **Password**: Enter *Azure123456!* for the administrator password.
4. Accept the other defaults and then select **Next: Disks**.  
5. Accept the **Disks** tab defaults and then select **Next: Networking**.
6. On the **Networking** tab, verify that **myVNet** is selected for the **Virtual network** and the **Subnet** is set to **myBackendSubnet**. Accept the other defaults and then select **Next: Management**.<br>Application Gateway can communicate with instances outside of the virtual network that it is in, but you need to ensure there's IP connectivity.
7. On the **Management** tab, set **Boot diagnostics** to **Off**. Accept the other defaults and then select **Review + create**.
8. On the **Review + create** tab, review the settings, correct any validation errors, and then select **Create**.
9. Wait for the virtual machine creation to complete before continuing.

### Install IIS for testing

In this example, you install IIS on the virtual machines only to verify Azure created the application gateway successfully.

1. Open [Azure PowerShell](../../cloud-shell/quickstart-powershell.md). To do so, select **Cloud Shell** from the top navigation bar of the Azure portal and then select **PowerShell** from the drop-down list. 

    ![Install custom extension](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-extension.png)

2. Run the following command to install IIS on the virtual machine: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Set-AzVMExtension `
      -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupAG `
      -ExtensionName IIS `
      -VMName myVM `
      -Publisher Microsoft.Compute `
      -ExtensionType CustomScriptExtension `
      -TypeHandlerVersion 1.4 `
      -SettingString '{"commandToExecute":"powershell Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server; powershell Add-Content -Path \"C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Default.htm\" -Value $($env:computername)"}' `
      -Location EastUS
    ```

3. Create a second virtual machine and install IIS by using the steps that you previously completed. Use *myVM2* for the virtual machine name and for the **VMName** setting of the **Set-AzVMExtension** cmdlet.

### Add backend servers to backend pool

1. Select **All resources**, and then select **myAppGateway**.

2. Select **Backend pools** from the left menu.

3. Select **myBackendPool**.

4. Under **Targets**, select **Virtual machine** from the drop-down list.

5. Under **VIRTUAL MACHINE** and **NETWORK INTERFACES**, select the **myVM** and **myVM2** virtual machines and their associated network interfaces from the drop-down lists.

    ![Add backend servers](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-backend.png)

6. Select **Save**.

7. Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step.

## Create a storage account and configure diagnostics

### Create a storage account

For this article, the application gateway uses a storage account to store data for detection and prevention purposes. You could also use Azure Monitor logs or Event Hub to record data.

1. Select **Create a resource** on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.
1. Select **Storage**, and then select **Storage account**.
1. For *Resource group*, select **myResourceGroupAG** for the resource group.
1. Type *myagstore1* for the name of the storage account.
1. Accept the default values for the other settings and then select **Review + Create**.
1. Review the settings, and then select **Create**.

### Configure diagnostics

Configure diagnostics to record data into the ApplicationGatewayAccessLog, ApplicationGatewayPerformanceLog, and ApplicationGatewayFirewallLog logs.

1. In the left-hand menu, select **All resources**, and then select *myAppGateway*.
2. Under Monitoring, select **Diagnostics settings**.
3. select **Add diagnostics setting**.
4. Enter *myDiagnosticsSettings* as the name for the diagnostics settings.
5. Select **Archive to a storage account**, and then select **Configure** to select the *myagstore1* storage account that you previously created, and then select **OK**.
6. Select the application gateway logs to collect and keep.
7. Select **Save**.

    ![Configure diagnostics](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-diagnostics.png)

## Create and link a Web Application Firewall policy

All of the WAF customizations and settings are in a separate object, called a WAF Policy. The policy must be associated with your Application Gateway. To create a WAF Policy, see [Create a WAF Policy](create-waf-policy-ag.md). Once it's been created, you can then associate the policy to your WAF (or an individual listener) from the WAF Policy in the **Associated Application Gateways** tab. 

![Associated application gateways](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/associated-application-gateways.png)

## Test the application gateway

Although IIS isn't required to create the application gateway, you installed it to verify whether Azure successfully created the application gateway. Use IIS to test the application gateway:

1. Find the public IP address for the application gateway on its **Overview** page.![Record application gateway public IP address](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-record-ag-address.png) 

   Or, you can select **All resources**, enter *myAGPublicIPAddress* in the search box, and then select it in the search results. Azure displays the public IP address on the **Overview** page.
1. Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser.
1. Check the response. A valid response verifies that the application gateway was successfully created and it can successfully connect with the backend.

   ![Test application gateway](../media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal/application-gateway-iistest.png)

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources that you created with the application gateway, remove the resource group. By removing the resource group, you also remove the application gateway and all its related resources. 

To remove the resource group:

1. On the left menu of the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**.
2. On the **Resource groups** page, search for **myResourceGroupAG** in the list, then select it.
3. On the **Resource group page**, select **Delete resource group**.
4. Enter *myResourceGroupAG* for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and then select **Delete**.
