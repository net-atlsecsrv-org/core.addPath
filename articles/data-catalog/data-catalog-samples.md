# Data Catalog developer samples
Get started developing Data Catalog apps using the Data Catalog REST API. The Data Catalog REST API is a REST-based API that provides programmatic access to Data Catalog resources to register, annotate, and search data assets programmatically.

Here are the samples we have on GitHub:

* [Get started with Azure Data Catalog](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/data-catalog-dotnet-get-started/)
  
  A sample that shows you how to authenticate with Azure AD to Register, Search, and Delete a data asset using the Data Catalog REST API.
* [Bulk register and annotate](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/data-catalog-dotnet-excel-register-data-assets/)
  
  A sample that shows you how to bulk register data assets from an Excel workbook using Data Catalog REST API and Open XML.
* [Import/Export tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/data-catalog-dotnet-import-export/)
  
  A sample that shows how to use the Data Catalog REST API to fetch assets from the Azure Data Catalog and serialize them into a file. It also demonstrates how to take a set of assets serialized as JSON and push them into the catalog. It supports exporting a subset of the catalog using a search query.

* [Bulk import glossary terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/data-catalog-bulk-import-glossary/)

	This sample shows you how to import glossary terms from CSV files to ADC glossary.
