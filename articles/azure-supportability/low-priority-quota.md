# Spot quota: limit increase for all VM Series

Spot VMs provide a different model of Azure usage, trading a lower cost for letting Azure remove a VM as needed for Pay-as-you-go or Reserved VM Instance deployments. Read more about Spot VMs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot).

Resource Manager supports two types of vCPU quotas for virtual machines. **Pay-as-you-go VMs and Reserved VM Instances** use standard quota. **Spot VMs** use Spot quota. 

For **Spot quota** type, Resource Manager vCPU quotas are enforced across all available VM Series as a single regional limit.

Anytime a new Spot VM is to be deployed, the sum of new and existing vCPUs usage for all Spot VM instances must not exceed the approved Spot vCPU quota limit. If the Spot quota is exceeded, the Spot VM deployment will not be allowed. You can request an increase of the Spot vCPUs quota limit from Azure portal. 

Learn more about standard vCPU quotas on the Virtual machine vCPU quotas page and Azure subscription and service limits page. Learn more about increasing the regional vCPU limit for standard quota on this [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/regional-quota-requests).

You can now request an increase in **Spot quota limits for all VM Series** via **Help + Support** blade or the **Usages + Quota** blade in the portal.

## Request Spot quota limit increase for all VM Series per Subscription using the Help + Support blade

You can also **request Quota for multiple regions** through a single support case. Refer to Step 10 below for details.
