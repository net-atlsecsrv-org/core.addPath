# Add or edit Azure role assignment conditions using the Azure portal (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure ABAC and Azure role assignment conditions are currently in preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

For information about the prerequisites to add or edit role assignment conditions, see [Conditions prerequisites](conditions-prerequisites.md).


## Step 1: Determine the condition you need

To determine the conditions you need, review the examples in [Example Azure role assignment conditions](../storage/common/storage-auth-abac-examples.md).

Currently, conditions can be added to built-in or custom role assignments that have [storage blob data actions](conditions-format.md#actions). These include the following built-in roles:

- [Storage Blob Data Contributor](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor)
- [Storage Blob Data Owner](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-owner)
- [Storage Blob Data Reader](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader)

## Step 2: Choose how to add condition

There are two ways that you can add a condition. You can add a condition when you add a new role assignment or you can add a condition to an existing role assignment.

### New role assignment

1. Follow the steps to [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](role-assignments-portal.md).

1. On the **Condition** tab, click **Add condition**.

    If you don't see the Condition tab, be sure you selected a role that supports conditions.

    The Add role assignment condition page appears.

### Existing role assignment

1. In the Azure portal, open **Access control (IAM)** at the scope where you want to add a condition. For example, you can open a subscription, resource group, or a resource.

    Currently, you cannot use the Azure portal to add, view, edit, or delete a condition add at a management group scope.

1. Click the **Role assignments** tab to view all the role assignments at this scope.

1. Find a role assignment that has storage data actions that you want to add a condition to.

1. In the **Condition** column, click **Add**.

    If you don't see the Add link, be sure you are looking at the same scope as the role assignment.

    ![Role assignment list with a Condition column.](./media/conditions-role-assignments-portal/condition-role-assignments-list.png)

    The Add role assignment condition page appears.

## Step 3: Review basics

Once you have the Add role assignment condition page open, you can review the basics of the condition. **Role** indicates the role that the condition will be added to.

1. For the **Editor type** option, leave the default **Visual** selected.

    Once you add a condition, you can toggle between Visual and Code.

1. (Optional) If the **Description** box appears, enter a description.

    Depending on how you chose to add a condition, you might not see the Description box. A description can help you understand and remember the condition.

    ![Add role assignment condition page showing editor type and description.](./media/conditions-role-assignments-portal/condition-basics.png)

## Step 4: Add actions

1. In the **Add action** section, click **Add action**.

    The Select an action pane appears. This pane is a filtered list of data actions based on the role assignment that will be the target of your condition. 

    ![Select an action pane for condition with an action selected.](./media/conditions-role-assignments-portal/condition-actions-select.png)

1. Select the actions you want to allow if the condition is true.

    If you select multiple actions for a single condition, there might be fewer attributes to choose from for your condition because the attributes must be available across the selected actions.

1. Click **Select**.

    The selected actions appear in the action list.

## Step 5: Build expressions

1. In the **Build expression** section, click **Add expression**.

    The Expressions section expands.

1. In the Attribute source list, select where the attribute can be found.

    - **Resource** indicates that the attribute is on the resource, such as container name.
    - **Request** indicates that the attribute is part of the action request, such as setting the blob index tag.

1. In the Attribute list, select an attribute for the left side of the expression. For more information, see [Azure role assignment condition format and syntax](conditions-format.md#attributes).

    Depending on the attribute you select, boxes might be added to specify additional attribute details.

1. In the Operator list, select an operator.

1. In the Value box, enter a value for the right side of the expression.

## Step 6: Review and add condition

1. Scroll up to **Editor type** and click **Code**.

    The condition is displayed as code. You can make changes to the condition in this code editor. To go back to the visual editor, click **Visual**.

    ![Condition displayed in code editor with selected actions and added expression.](./media/conditions-role-assignments-portal/condition-code.png)

1. Click **Save** to add the condition to the role assignment.

## View, edit, or delete a condition

1. In the Azure portal, open **Access control (IAM)** for the role assignment that has a condition that you want to view, edit, or delete.

1. Click the **Role assignments** tab and find the role assignment.

1. In the **Condition** column, click **View/Edit**.

    If you don't see the View/Edit link, be sure you are looking at the same scope as the role assignment.

    ![Role assignment list with View/Edit link for condition.](./media/conditions-role-assignments-portal/condition-role-assignments-list-edit.png)

    The Add role assignment condition page appears.

1. Use the editor to view or edit the condition.

    ![Condition displayed in editor after clicking View/Edit link.](./media/conditions-role-assignments-portal/condition-edit.png)

1. When finished, click **Save**. To delete the entire condition, click **Delete condition**. Deleting the condition does not remove the role assignment.
