# Azure built-in roles

[Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](overview.md) has several Azure built-in roles that you can assign to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. Role assignments are the way you control access to Azure resources. If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own [Azure custom roles](custom-roles.md).

This article lists the built-in roles for Azure resources, which are always evolving. To get the latest roles, use [Get-AzRoleDefinition](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azroledefinition) or [az role definition list](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-list). If you are looking for administrator roles for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md).

## Descriptions and IDs

The following table provides a brief description and the unique ID of each built-in role. Select the role name to see the list of `Actions`, `NotActions`, `DataActions`, and `NotDataActions` for each role. For information about what these actions mean and how they apply to the management and data planes, see [Understand role definitions for Azure resources](role-definitions.md).
