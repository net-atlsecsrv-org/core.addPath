# Azure resource provider operations

This section lists the operations for Azure resource providers, which are used in built-in roles. You can use these operations in your own [Azure custom roles](custom-roles.md) to provide granular access control to resources in Azure. The resource provider operations are always evolving. To get the latest operations, use [Get-AzProviderOperation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azprovideroperation) or [az provider operation list](/cli/azure/provider/operation#az-provider-operation-list).

Click the resource provider name in the following table to see the list of operations.
