# Add or edit Azure role assignment conditions using the REST API (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure ABAC and Azure role assignment conditions are currently in preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

For information about the prerequisites to add or edit role assignment conditions, see [Conditions prerequisites](conditions-prerequisites.md).

## Add a condition

To add a role assignment condition, use the [Role Assignments - Create](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments/create) REST API. Set the `api-version` to `2020-03-01-preview` or later. If you want to utilize the `description` property for role assignments, use `2020-04-01-preview` or later.  [Role Assignments - Create](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments/create) includes the following parameters related to conditions.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | String | Condition under which the user can be granted permission. |
| `conditionVersion` | String | Version of the condition syntax. If `condition` is specified without `conditionVersion`, the version is set to the default value of 2.0. |

Use the following request and body:

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}?api-version=2020-04-01-preview
```

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "roleDefinitionId": "/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleDefinitionId}",
        "principalId": "{principalId}",
        "condition": "{condition}",
        "conditionVersion": "2.0",
        "description": "{description}"
    }
}
```

The following example shows how to assign the [Storage Blob Data Reader](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader) role with a condition. The condition checks whether container name equals 'blobs-example-container'.

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}?api-version=2020-04-01-preview
```

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/2a2b9908-6ea1-4ae2-8e65-a410df84e7d1",
        "principalId": "{principalId}",
        "condition": "((!(ActionMatches{'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read'})) OR (@Resource[Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers:name] StringEquals 'blobs-example-container'))",
        "conditionVersion": "2.0",
        "description": "Read access if container name equals blobs-example-container"
    }
}
```

The following shows an example of the output:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/2a2b9908-6ea1-4ae2-8e65-a410df84e7d1",
        "principalId": "{principalId}",
        "principalType": "User",
        "scope": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}",
        "condition": "((!(ActionMatches{'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read'})) OR (@Resource[Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers:name] StringEquals 'blobs-example-container'))",
        "conditionVersion": "2.0",
        "createdOn": "2021-04-20T06:20:44.0205560Z",
        "updatedOn": "2021-04-20T06:20:44.2955371Z",
        "createdBy": null,
        "updatedBy": "{updatedById}",
        "delegatedManagedIdentityResourceId": null,
        "description": "Read access if container name equals blobs-example-container"
    },
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}",
    "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
    "name": "{roleAssignmentId}"
}
```

## Edit a condition

To edit an existing role assignment condition, use the same [Role Assignments - Create](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments/create) REST API as you used to add the role assignment condition. The following shows an example JSON where `condition` and `description` are updated. Only the `condition`, `conditionVersion`, and `description` properties can be edited. You must specify the other properties to match the existing role assignment.

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}?api-version=2020-04-01-preview
```

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/2a2b9908-6ea1-4ae2-8e65-a410df84e7d1",
        "principalId": "{principalId}",
        "condition": "((!(ActionMatches{'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read'})) OR (@Resource[Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers:name] StringEquals 'blobs-example-container' OR @Resource[Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers:name] StringEquals 'blobs-example-container2'))",
        "conditionVersion": "2.0",
        "description": "Read access if container name equals blobs-example-container or blobs-example-container2"
    }
}
```


## List a condition

To list a role assignment condition, use the [Role Assignments - List](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments/list) API. Set the `api-version` to `2020-03-01-preview` or later. If you want to utilize the `description` property for role assignments, use `2020-04-01-preview` or later. For more information, see [List Azure role assignments using the REST API](role-assignments-list-rest.md).

## Delete a condition

To delete a role assignment condition, edit the role assignment condition and set both the condition and condition version to either an empty string or null.

Alternatively, if you want to delete both the role assignment and the condition, you can use the [Role Assignments - Delete](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments/delete) API. For more information, see [Remove Azure role assignments](role-assignments-remove.md).
