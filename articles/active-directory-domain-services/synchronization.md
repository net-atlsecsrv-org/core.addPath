# Synchronization in an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain
The following diagram illustrates how synchronization works in Azure AD Domain Services managed domains.

![Synchronization in Azure AD Domain Services](./media/active-directory-domain-services-design-guide/sync-topology.png)

## Synchronization from your on-premises directory to your Azure AD tenant
Azure AD Connect sync is used to synchronize user accounts, group memberships, and credential hashes to your Azure AD tenant. Attributes of user accounts such as the UPN and on-premises SID (security identifier) are synchronized. If you use Azure AD Domain Services, legacy credential hashes required for NTLM and Kerberos authentication are also synchronized to your Azure AD tenant.

If you configure write-back, changes occurring in your Azure AD directory are synchronized back to your on-premises Active Directory. For example, if you change your password using Azure AD self-service password management, the changed password is updated in your on-premises AD domain.

> [!NOTE]
> Always use the latest version of Azure AD Connect to ensure you have fixes for all known bugs.

## Synchronization from your Azure AD tenant to your managed domain
User accounts, group memberships, and credential hashes are synchronized from your Azure AD tenant to your Azure AD Domain Services managed domain. This synchronization process is automatic. You do not need to configure, monitor, or manage this synchronization process. Initial synchronization may take from a few hours to a couple of days depending on the number of objects in your Azure AD directory. After initial synchronization completes, it takes about 20-30 minutes for changes that are made in Azure AD to be updated in your managed domain. This synchronization interval applies to password changes or changes to attributes made in Azure AD.

The synchronization process is also one-way/unidirectional in nature. Your managed domain is largely read-only except for any custom OUs you create. Therefore, you cannot make changes to user attributes, user passwords, or group memberships within the managed domain. As a result, there is no reverse synchronization of changes from your managed domain back to your Azure AD tenant.

## Synchronization from a multi-forest on-premises environment
Many organizations have a fairly complex on-premises identity infrastructure consisting of multiple account forests. Azure AD Connect supports synchronizing users, groups, and credential hashes from multi-forest environments to your Azure AD tenant.

In contrast, your Azure AD tenant is a much simpler and flat namespace. To enable users to reliably access applications secured by Azure AD, resolve UPN conflicts across user accounts in different forests. Your Azure AD Domain Services managed domain bears close resemblance to your Azure AD tenant. You see a flat OU structure in your managed domain. All user accounts and groups are stored within the 'AADDC Users' container, despite being synchronized from different on-premises domains or forests. You may have configured a hierarchical OU structure on-premises. Your managed domain still has a simple flat OU structure.

## Exclusions - what isn't synchronized to your managed domain
The following objects or attributes are not synchronized to your Azure AD tenant or to your managed domain:

* **Excluded attributes:** You may choose to exclude certain attributes from synchronizing to your Azure AD tenant from your on-premises domain using Azure AD Connect. These excluded attributes are not available in your managed domain.
* **Group Policies:** Group Policies configured in your on-premises domain are not synchronized to your managed domain.
* **Sysvol share:** Similarly, the contents of the Sysvol share on your on-premises domain are not synchronized to your managed domain.
* **Computer objects:** Computer objects for computers joined to your on-premises domain are not synchronized to your managed domain. These computers do not have a trust relationship with your managed domain and belong to your on-premises domain only. In your managed domain, you find computer objects only for computers you have explicitly domain-joined to the managed domain.
* **SidHistory attributes for users and groups:** The primary user and primary group SIDs from your on-premises domain are synchronized to your managed domain. However, existing SidHistory attributes for users and groups are not synchronized from your on-premises domain to your managed domain.
* **Organization Units (OU) structures:** Organizational Units defined in your on-premises domain do not synchronize to your managed domain. There are two built-in OUs in your managed domain. By default, your managed domain has a flat OU structure. You may however choose to [create a custom OU in your managed domain](create-ou.md).

## How specific attributes are synchronized to your managed domain
The following table lists some common attributes and describes how they are synchronized to your managed domain.

| Attribute in your managed domain | Source | Notes |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| UPN |User's UPN attribute in your Azure AD tenant |The UPN attribute from your Azure AD tenant is synchronized as is to your managed domain. Therefore, the most reliable way to sign in to your managed domain is using your UPN. |
| SAMAccountName |User's mailNickname attribute in your Azure AD tenant or auto-generated |The SAMAccountName attribute is sourced from the mailNickname attribute in your Azure AD tenant. If multiple user accounts have the same mailNickname attribute, the SAMAccountName is auto-generated. If the user's mailNickname or UPN prefix is longer than 20 characters, the SAMAccountName is auto-generated to satisfy the 20 character limit on SAMAccountName attributes. |
| Passwords |User's password from your Azure AD tenant |Credential hashes required for NTLM or Kerberos authentication (also called supplemental credentials) are synchronized from your Azure AD tenant. If your Azure AD tenant is a synced tenant, these credentials are sourced from your on-premises domain. |
| Primary user/group SID |Auto-generated |The primary SID for user/group accounts is auto-generated in your managed domain. This attribute does not match the primary user/group SID of the object in your on-premises AD domain. This mismatch is because the managed domain has a different SID namespace than your on-premises domain. |
| SID history for users and groups |On-premises primary user and group SID |The SidHistory attribute for users and groups in your managed domain is set to match the corresponding primary user or group SID in your on-premises domain. This feature helps make lift-and-shift of on-premises applications to the managed domain easier, since you do not need to re-ACL resources. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Sign in to the managed domain using the UPN format:** The SAMAccountName attribute may be auto-generated for some user accounts in your managed domain. If multiple users have the same mailNickname attribute or users have overly long UPN prefixes, the SAMAccountName for these users may be auto-generated. Therefore, the SAMAccountName format (for example, 'CONTOSO100\joeuser') is not always a reliable way to sign in to the domain. Users' auto-generated SAMAccountName may differ from their UPN prefix. Use the UPN format (for example, 'joeuser@contoso100.com') to sign in to the managed domain reliably.

### Attribute mapping for user accounts
The following table illustrates how specific attributes for user objects in your Azure AD tenant are synchronized to corresponding attributes in your managed domain.

| User attribute in your Azure AD tenant | User attribute in your managed domain |
|:--- |:--- |
| accountEnabled |userAccountControl (sets or clears the ACCOUNT_DISABLED bit) |
| city |l |
| country |co |
| department |department |
| displayName |displayName |
| facsimileTelephoneNumber |facsimileTelephoneNumber |
| givenName |givenName |
| jobTitle |title |
| mail |mail |
| mailNickname |msDS-AzureADMailNickname |
| mailNickname |SAMAccountName (may sometimes be auto-generated) |
| mobile |mobile |
| objectid |msDS-AzureADObjectId |
| onPremiseSecurityIdentifier |sidHistory |
| passwordPolicies |userAccountControl (sets or clears the DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD bit) |
| physicalDeliveryOfficeName |physicalDeliveryOfficeName |
| postalCode |postalCode |
| preferredLanguage |preferredLanguage |
| state |st |
| streetAddress |streetAddress |
| surname |sn |
| telephoneNumber |telephoneNumber |
| userPrincipalName |userPrincipalName |

### Attribute mapping for groups
The following table illustrates how specific attributes for group objects in your Azure AD tenant are synchronized to corresponding attributes in your managed domain.

| Group attribute in your Azure AD tenant | Group attribute in your managed domain |
|:--- |:--- |
| displayName |displayName |
| displayName |SAMAccountName (may sometimes be auto-generated) |
| mail |mail |
| mailNickname |msDS-AzureADMailNickname |
| objectid |msDS-AzureADObjectId |
| onPremiseSecurityIdentifier |sidHistory |
| securityEnabled |groupType |

## Password hash synchronization and security considerations
When you enable Azure AD Domain Services, your Azure AD directory generates and stores password hashes in NTLM & Kerberos compatible formats. 

For existing cloud user accounts, since Azure AD never stores their clear-text passwords, these hashes cannot be automatically generated. Therefore, Microsoft requires [cloud-users to reset/change their passwords](active-directory-ds-getting-started-password-sync.md) in order for their password hashes to be generated and stored in Azure AD. For any cloud user account created in Azure AD after enabling Azure AD Domain Services, the password hashes are generated and stored in the NTLM and Kerberos compatible formats. 

For user accounts synced from on-premises AD using Azure AD Connect Sync, you need to [configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize password hashes in the NTLM and Kerberos compatible formats](active-directory-ds-getting-started-password-sync-synced-tenant.md).

The NTLM and Kerberos compatible password hashes are always stored in an encrypted manner in Azure AD. These hashes are encrypted such that only Azure AD Domain Services has access to the decryption keys. No other service or component in Azure AD has access to the decryption keys. The encryption keys are unique per-Azure AD tenant. Azure AD Domain Services synchronizes the password hashes into the domain controllers for your managed domain. These password hashes are stored and secured on these domain controllers similar to how passwords are stored and secured on Windows Server AD domain controllers. The disks for these managed domain controllers are encrypted at rest.

## Objects that are not synchronized to your Azure AD tenant from your managed domain
As described in a preceding section of this article, there is no synchronization from your managed domain back to your Azure AD tenant. You may choose to [create a custom Organizational Unit (OU)](create-ou.md) in your managed domain. Further, you can create other OUs, users, groups, or service accounts within these custom OUs. None of the objects created within custom OUs are synchronized back to your Azure AD tenant. These objects are available for use only within your managed domain. Therefore, these objects are not visible using Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets, Azure AD Graph API or using the Azure AD management UI.
