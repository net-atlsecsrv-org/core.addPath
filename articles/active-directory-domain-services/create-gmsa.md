# Create a group managed service account (gMSA) on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain
This article shows you how to create managed service accounts on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain.

## Managed Service Accounts
A standalone-Managed Service Account (sMSA) is a managed domain account whose password is automatically managed. It simplifies service principal name (SPN) management, and enables delegated management to other administrators. This type of managed service account (MSA) was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7.

The group-Managed Service Account (gMSA) provides the same benefits for many servers on the domain. All instances of a service hosted on a server farm need to use the same service principal for mutual authentication protocols to work. When a gMSA is used as service principal, the Windows operating system manages the account's password instead of relying on the administrator.

## Using service accounts in Azure AD Domain services
Azure AD Domain Services managed domains are locked down and managed by Microsoft. There are a couple of key considerations when using service accounts with Azure AD Domain Services.

### Create service accounts within custom organizational units (OU) on the managed domain
You can't create a service account in the built-in 'AADDC Users' or 'AADDC Computers' organizational units. [Create a custom OU](create-ou.md) on your managed domain and then create service accounts within that custom OU.

### The Key Distribution Services (KDS) root key is already pre-created
The Key Distribution Services (KDS) root key is pre-created on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain. You don't need to create a KDS root key and don't have privileges to do so either. You can't view the KDS root key on the managed domain either.

## Sample - create a gMSA using PowerShell
The following sample shows you how to create a custom OU using PowerShell. You can then create a gMSA within that OU by using the ```-Path``` parameter to specify the OU.

```powershell
# Create a new custom OU on the managed domain
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "MyNewOU" -Path "DC=CONTOSO100,DC=COM"

# Create a service account 'WebFarmSvc' within the custom OU.
New-ADServiceAccount -Name WebFarmSvc  `
-DNSHostName ` WebFarmSvc.contoso100.com  `
-Path "OU=MYNEWOU,DC=CONTOSO100,DC=com"  `
-KerberosEncryptionType AES128, AES256  ` -ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays 30  `
-ServicePrincipalNames http/WebFarmSvc.contoso100.com/contoso100.com, `
http/WebFarmSvc.contoso100.com/contoso100,  `
http/WebFarmSvc/contoso100.com, http/WebFarmSvc/contoso100  `
-PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword CONTOSO-SERVER$
```
