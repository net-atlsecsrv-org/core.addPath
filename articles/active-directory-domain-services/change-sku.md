# Change the SKU for an existing Azure AD Domain Services managed domain

In Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS), the available performance and features are based on the SKU type. These feature differences include the backup frequency or maximum number of one-way outbound forest trusts (currently in preview). You select a SKU when you create the managed domain, and you can switch SKUs up or down as your business needs change after the managed domain has been deployed. Changes in business requirements could include the need for more frequent backups or to create additional forest trusts. For more information on the limits and pricing of the different SKUs, see [Azure AD DS SKU concepts][concepts-sku] and [Azure AD DS pricing][pricing] pages.

This article shows you how to change the SKU for an existing Azure AD DS managed domain using the Azure portal.

## Before you begin

To complete this article, you need the following resources and privileges:

* An active Azure subscription.
    * If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* An Azure Active Directory tenant associated with your subscription, either synchronized with an on-premises directory or a cloud-only directory.
    * If needed, [create an Azure Active Directory tenant][create-azure-ad-tenant] or [associate an Azure subscription with your account][associate-azure-ad-tenant].
* An Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain enabled and configured in your Azure AD tenant.
    * If needed, complete the tutorial to [create and configure an Azure Active Directory Domain Services instance][create-azure-ad-ds-instance].

## SKU change limitations

You can change SKUs up or down after the Azure AD DS managed domain has been deployed. However, if you use a resource forest (currently in preview) and have created one-way outbound forest trusts from Azure AD DS to an on-premises AD DS environment, there are some limitations for the SKU change operation. The *Premium* and *Enterprise* SKUs define a limit on the number of trusts you can create. You can't change to a SKU with a lower maximum limit than you currently have configured.

For example:

* If you have created two forest trusts on the *Premium* SKU, you can't change down to the *Standard* SKU. The *Standard* SKU doesn't support forest trusts.
* Or, if you have created seven trusts on the *Premium* SKU, you can't change down to the *Enterprise* SKU. The *Enterprise* SKU supports a maximum of five trusts.

For more information on these limits, see [Azure AD DS SKU features and limits][concepts-sku].

## Select a new SKU

To change the SKU for an Azure AD DS managed domain using the Azure portal, complete the following steps:

1. At the top of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD Domain Services**. Choose your managed domain from the list, such as *aaddscontoso.com*.
1. In the menu on the left-hand side of the Azure AD DS page, select **Settings > SKU**.

    ![Select the SKU menu option for your Azure AD DS managed domain in the Azure portal](media/change-sku/overview-change-sku.png)

1. From the drop-down menu, select the SKU you wish for your Azure AD DS managed domain. If you have a resource forest, you can't select *Standard* SKU as forest trusts are only available on the *Enterprise* SKU or higher.

    Choose the SKU you want from the drop-down menu, then select **Save**.

It can take a minute or two to change the SKU type.

## Next steps

If you have a resource forest and want to create additional trusts after the SKU change, see [Create an outbound forest trust to an on-premises domain in Azure AD DS (preview)][create-trust].
