# Azure AD Domain Services - Contact Us
## Contact the product team
If you have issues with your managed domain, check to see if the steps outlined in the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshoot.md) resolve the issue. If you're still having trouble, feel free to contact us.

You may email us at: [Azure AD Domain Services Feedback](mailto:aaddsfb@microsoft.com).

Ensure that you include the following, so we can investigate the issue.

* The **tenant ID/directory ID** for your Azure AD directory. The tenant ID is the GUID you see in the directory ID field on the [Properties page for your directory](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Properties)
* The **DNS domain name** you've configured for your AAD Domain Services managed domain.

## Provide Feedback
We welcome your feedback about Azure AD Domain Services via the **[Azure Active Directory User Voice channel](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/)**.

Ensure that you pre-pend your question or feedback with the words **'AADDS'**, for it to reach us.
