# Create an Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain using an Azure Resource Manager template

Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, Kerberos/NTLM authentication that is fully compatible with Windows Server Active Directory. You consume these domain services without deploying, managing, and patching domain controllers yourself. Azure AD DS integrates with your existing Azure AD tenant. This integration lets users sign in using their corporate credentials, and you can use existing groups and user accounts to secure access to resources.

This article shows you how to create a managed domain using an Azure Resource Manager template. Supporting resources are created using Azure PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you need the following resources:

* Install and configure Azure PowerShell.
    * If needed, follow the instructions to [install the Azure PowerShell module and connect to your Azure subscription](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
    * Make sure that you sign in to your Azure subscription using the [Connect-AzAccount][Connect-AzAccount] cmdlet.
* Install and configure Azure AD PowerShell.
    * If needed, follow the instructions to [install the Azure AD PowerShell module and connect to Azure AD](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2).
    * Make sure that you sign in to your Azure AD tenant using the [Connect-AzureAD][Connect-AzureAD] cmdlet.
* You need *global administrator* privileges in your Azure AD tenant to enable Azure AD DS.
* You need *Contributor* privileges in your Azure subscription to create the required Azure AD DS resources.

## DNS naming requirements

When you create an Azure AD DS managed domain, you specify a DNS name. There are some considerations when you choose this DNS name:

* **Built-in domain name:** By default, the built-in domain name of the directory is used (a *.onmicrosoft.com* suffix). If you wish to enable secure LDAP access to the managed domain over the internet, you can't create a digital certificate to secure the connection with this default domain. Microsoft owns the *.onmicrosoft.com* domain, so a Certificate Authority (CA) won't issue a certificate.
* **Custom domain names:** The most common approach is to specify a custom domain name, typically one that you already own and is routable. When you use a routable, custom domain, traffic can correctly flow as needed to support your applications.
* **Non-routable domain suffixes:** We generally recommend that you avoid a non-routable domain name suffix, such as *contoso.local*. The *.local* suffix isn't routable and can cause issues with DNS resolution.

> [!TIP]
> If you create a custom domain name, take care with existing DNS namespaces. It's recommended to use a domain name separate from any existing Azure or on-premises DNS name space.
>
> For example, if you have an existing DNS name space of *contoso.com*, create a managed domain with the custom domain name of *aaddscontoso.com*. If you need to use secure LDAP, you must register and own this custom domain name to generate the required certificates.
>
> You may need to create some additional DNS records for other services in your environment, or conditional DNS forwarders between existing DNS name spaces in your environment. For example, if you run a webserver that hosts a site using the root DNS name, there can be naming conflicts that require additional DNS entries.
>
> In this sample and how-to articles, the custom domain of *aaddscontoso.com* is used as a short example. In all commands, specify your own domain name.

The following DNS name restrictions also apply:

* **Domain prefix restrictions:** You can't create a managed domain with a prefix longer than 15 characters. The prefix of your specified domain name (such as *aaddscontoso* in the *aaddscontoso.com* domain name) must contain 15 or fewer characters.
* **Network name conflicts:** The DNS domain name for your managed domain shouldn't already exist in the virtual network. Specifically, check for the following scenarios that would lead to a name conflict:
    * If you already have an Active Directory domain with the same DNS domain name on the Azure virtual network.
    * If the virtual network where you plan to enable the managed domain has a VPN connection with your on-premises network. In this scenario, ensure you don't have a domain with the same DNS domain name on your on-premises network.
    * If you have an existing Azure cloud service with that name on the Azure virtual network.

## Create required Azure AD resources

Azure AD DS requires a service principal and an Azure AD group. These resources let the managed domain synchronize data, and define which users have administrative permissions in the managed domain.

First, register the Azure AD Domain Services resource provider using the [Register-AzResourceProvider][Register-AzResourceProvider] cmdlet:

```powershell
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AAD
```

Create an Azure AD service principal using the [New-AzureADServicePrincipal][New-AzureADServicePrincipal] cmdlet for Azure AD DS to communicate and authenticate itself. A specific application ID is used named *Domain Controller Services* with an ID of *6ba9a5d4-8456-4118-b521-9c5ca10cdf84*. Don't change this application ID.

```powershell
New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId "6ba9a5d4-8456-4118-b521-9c5ca10cdf84"
```

Now create an Azure AD group named *AAD DC Administrators* using the [New-AzureADGroup][New-AzureADGroup] cmdlet. Users added to this group are then granted permissions to perform administration tasks on the managed domain.

```powershell
New-AzureADGroup -DisplayName "AAD DC Administrators" `
  -Description "Delegated group to administer Azure AD Domain Services" `
  -SecurityEnabled $true -MailEnabled $false `
  -MailNickName "AADDCAdministrators"
```

With the *AAD DC Administrators* group created, add a user to the group using the [Add-AzureADGroupMember][Add-AzureADGroupMember] cmdlet. You first get the *AAD DC Administrators* group object ID using the [Get-AzureADGroup][Get-AzureADGroup] cmdlet, then the desired user's object ID using the [Get-AzureADUser][Get-AzureADUser] cmdlet.

In the following example, the user object ID for the account with a UPN of `admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`. Replace this user account with the UPN of the user you wish to add to the *AAD DC Administrators* group:

```powershell
# First, retrieve the object ID of the newly created 'AAD DC Administrators' group.
$GroupObjectId = Get-AzureADGroup `
  -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AAD DC Administrators'" | `
  Select-Object ObjectId

# Now, retrieve the object ID of the user you'd like to add to the group.
$UserObjectId = Get-AzureADUser `
  -Filter "UserPrincipalName eq 'admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com'" | `
  Select-Object ObjectId

# Add the user to the 'AAD DC Administrators' group.
Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $GroupObjectId.ObjectId -RefObjectId $UserObjectId.ObjectId
```

Finally, create a resource group using the [New-AzResourceGroup][New-AzResourceGroup] cmdlet. In the following example, the resource group is named *myResourceGroup* and is created in the *westus* region. Use your own name and desired region:

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup `
  -Name "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "WestUS"
```

If you choose a region that supports Availability Zones, the Azure AD DS resources are distributed across zones for additional redundancy. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there's a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.

There's nothing for you to configure for Azure AD DS to be distributed across zones. The Azure platform automatically handles the zone distribution of resources. For more information and to see region availability, see [What are Availability Zones in Azure?][availability-zones].

## Resource definition for Azure AD DS

As part of the Resource Manager resource definition, the following configuration parameters are required:

| Parameter               | Value |
|-------------------------|---------|
| domainName              | The DNS domain name for your managed domain, taking into consideration the previous points on naming prefixes and conflicts. |
| filteredSync            | Azure AD DS lets you synchronize *all* users and groups available in Azure AD, or a *scoped* synchronization of only specific groups.<br /><br /> For more information about scoped synchronization, see [Azure AD Domain Services scoped synchronization][scoped-sync].|
| notificationSettings    | If there are any alerts generated in the managed domain, email notifications can be sent out. <br /><br />*Global administrators* of the Azure tenant and members of the *AAD DC Administrators* group can be *Enabled* for these notifications.<br /><br /> If desired, you can add additional recipients for notifications when there are alerts that require attention.|
| domainConfigurationType | By default, a managed domain is created as a *User* forest. This type of forest synchronizes all objects from Azure AD, including any user accounts created in an on-premises AD DS environment. You don't need to specify a *domainConfiguration* value to create a user forest.<br /><br /> A *Resource* forest only synchronizes users and groups created directly in Azure AD. Set the value to *ResourceTrusting* to create a resource forest.<br /><br />For more information on *Resource* forests, including why you may use one and how to create forest trusts with on-premises AD DS domains, see [Azure AD DS resource forests overview][resource-forests].|

The following condensed parameters definition shows how these values are declared. A user forest named *aaddscontoso.com* is created with all users from Azure AD synchronized to the managed domain:

```json
"parameters": {
    "domainName": {
        "value": "aaddscontoso.com"
    },
    "filteredSync": {
        "value": "Disabled"
    },
    "notificationSettings": {
        "value": {
            "notifyGlobalAdmins": "Enabled",
            "notifyDcAdmins": "Enabled",
            "additionalRecipients": []
        }
    },
    [...]
}
```

The following condensed Resource Manager template resource type is then used to define and create the managed domain. An Azure virtual network and subnet must already exist, or be created as part of Resource Manager template. The managed domain is connected to this subnet.

```json
"resources": [
    {
        "apiVersion": "2017-06-01",
        "type": "Microsoft.AAD/DomainServices",
        "name": "[parameters('domainName')]",
        "location": "[parameters('location')]",
        "dependsOn": [
            "[concat('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/', parameters('vnetName'))]"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "domainName": "[parameters('domainName')]",
            "subnetId": "[concat('/subscriptions/', subscription().subscriptionId, '/resourceGroups/', resourceGroup().name, '/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/', parameters('vnetName'), '/subnets/', parameters('subnetName'))]",
            "filteredSync": "[parameters('filteredSync')]",
            "notificationSettings": "[parameters('notificationSettings')]"
        }
    },
    [...]
]
```

These parameters and resource type can be used as part of a wider Resource Manager template to deploy a managed domain, as shown in the following section.

## Create a managed domain using sample template

The following complete Resource Manager sample template creates a managed domain and the supporting virtual network, subnet, and network security group rules. The network security group rules are required to secure the managed domain and make sure traffic can flow correctly. A user forest with the DNS name of *aaddscontoso.com* is created, with all users synchronized from Azure AD:

                            "networkSecurityGroup": {
                                "id": "[concat('/subscriptions/', subscription().subscriptionId, '/resourceGroups/', resourceGroup().name, '/providers/Microsoft.Network/NetworkSecurityGroups/', parameters('nsgName'))]"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ],
    "outputs": {}
}
```

This template can be deployed using your preferred deployment method, such as the [Azure portal][portal-deploy], [Azure PowerShell][powershell-deploy], or a CI/CD pipeline. The following example uses the [New-AzResourceGroupDeployment][New-AzResourceGroupDeployment] cmdlet. Specify your own resource group name and template filename:

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -TemplateFile <path-to-template>
```

It takes a few minutes to create the resource and return control to the PowerShell prompt. The managed domain continues to be provisioned in the background, and can take up to an hour to complete the deployment. In the Azure portal, the **Overview** page for your managed domain shows the current status throughout this deployment stage.

When the Azure portal shows that the managed domain has finished provisioning, the following tasks need to be completed:

* Update DNS settings for the virtual network so virtual machines can find the managed domain for domain join or authentication.
    * To configure DNS, select your managed domain in the portal. On the **Overview** window, you are prompted to automatically configure these DNS settings.
* [Enable password synchronization to Azure AD DS](tutorial-create-instance.md#enable-user-accounts-for-azure-ad-ds) so end users can sign in to the managed domain using their corporate credentials.

## Next steps
