# Azure security baseline for Event Grid

The Azure Security Baseline for Microsoft Azure Event Grid contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: You can use private endpoints to allow ingress of events directly from your virtual network to your Event Grid topics and domains securely over a private link without going through the public internet. When you create a private endpoint for your Event Grid topic or domain, it provides secure connectivity between clients on your VNet and your Event Grid resource. The private endpoint is assigned an IP address from the IP address range of your virtual network. The connection between the private endpoint and the Event Grid service uses a secure private link.

Azure Event Grid also supports public IP-based
access controls for publishing to topics and domains. With IP-based
controls, you can limit the publishers to a topic or domain to only a set of
approved set of machines and cloud services. This feature complements the
authentication mechanisms supported by Event Grid.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your Event Grid resources in Azure. If using
Azure virtual machines to access your Event Grid resources, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic

audit.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: 
You can configure IP firewall for your Event Grid resource to
restrict access over the public internet from only a select set of IP Addresses
or IP Address ranges.

You can configure
private endpoints to restrict access from only from selected virtual networks.

Enable DDoS Protection
Standard on these virtual networks to guard against distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat
Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP
addresses. For more information, see the following articles:

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: If you are using Azure virtual machines to access your Event Grid resources, enable
 network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

Note network policies are disabled by default when private endpoints are created for Event Grid so above workflow may not work.

If necessary for investigating anomalous activity, enable Network Watcher packet capture.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities.  When payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall threat intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall threat intelligence-based filtering is used to alert on and/or block traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or block malicious traffic.

## Malware defense

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Malware defense](../security/benchmarks/security-control-malware-defense.md).*

### 8.2: Pre-scan files to be uploaded to non-compute Azure resources

**Guidance**: Microsoft Anti-malware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure Event Grid), however it does not run on customer content.

It is your responsibility to pre-scan any content being uploaded to non-compute Azure resources. Microsoft cannot access customer data, and therefore cannot conduct anti-malware scans of customer content on your behalf.

## Incident response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Develop an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure there are written incident response plans that define all the roles of personnel as well as the phases of incident handling and management from detection to post-incident review. 

- [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not Applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytically used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

 
 
 
 Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
