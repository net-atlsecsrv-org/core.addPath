# Concepts in Azure Event Grid

This article describes the main concepts in Azure Event Grid.

## Events

An event is the smallest amount of information that fully describes something that happened in the system. Every event has common information like: source of the event, time the event took place, and unique identifier. Every event also has specific information that is only relevant to the specific type of event. For example, an event about a new file being created in Azure Storage has details about the file, such as the `lastTimeModified` value. Or, an Event Hubs event has the URL of the Capture file. 

An event of size up to 64 KB is covered by General Availability (GA) Service Level Agreement (SLA). The support for an event of size up to 1 MB is currently in preview. Events over 64 KB are charged in 64-KB increments. 


For the properties that are sent in an event, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

## Publishers

A publisher is the user or organization that decides to send events to Event Grid. Microsoft publishes events for several Azure services. You can publish events from your own application. Organizations that host services outside of Azure can publish events through Event Grid.

## Event sources

An event source is where the event happens. Each event source is related to one or more event types. For example, Azure Storage is the event source for blob created events. IoT Hub is the event source for device created events. Your application is the event source for custom events that you define. Event sources are responsible for sending events to Event Grid.

For information about implementing any of the supported Event Grid sources, see [Event sources in Azure Event Grid](event-sources.md).

## Topics

The event grid topic provides an endpoint where the source sends events. The publisher creates the event grid topic, and decides whether an event source needs one topic or more than one topic. A topic is used for a collection of related events. To respond to certain types of events, subscribers decide which topics to subscribe to.

System topics are built-in topics provided by Azure services. You don't see system topics in your Azure subscription because the publisher owns the topics, but you can subscribe to them. To subscribe, you provide information about the resource you want to receive events from. As long as you have access to the resource, you can subscribe to its events.

Custom topics are application and third-party topics. When you create or are assigned access to a custom topic, you see that custom topic in your subscription.

When designing your application, you have flexibility when deciding how many topics to create. For large solutions, create a custom topic for each category of related events. For example, consider an application that sends events related to modifying user accounts and processing orders. It's unlikely any event handler wants both categories of events. Create two custom topics and let event handlers subscribe to the one that interests them. For small solutions, you might prefer to send all events to a single topic. Event subscribers can filter for the event types they want.

## Event subscriptions

A subscription tells Event Grid which events on a topic you're interested in receiving. When creating the subscription, you provide an endpoint for handling the event. You can filter the events that are sent to the endpoint. You can filter by event type, or subject pattern. For more information, see [Event Grid subscription schema](subscription-creation-schema.md).

For examples of creating subscriptions, see:

* [Azure CLI samples for Event Grid](cli-samples.md)
* [Azure PowerShell samples for Event Grid](powershell-samples.md)
* [Azure Resource Manager templates for Event Grid](template-samples.md)

For information about getting your current event grid subscriptions, see [Query Event Grid subscriptions](query-event-subscriptions.md).

## Event subscription expiration
The event subscription is automatically expired after that date. Set an expiration for event subscriptions that are only needed for a limited time and you don't want to worry about cleaning up those subscriptions. For example, when creating an event subscription to test a scenario, you might want to set an expiration. 

For an example of setting an expiration, see [Subscribe with advanced filters](how-to-filter-events.md#subscribe-with-advanced-filters).

## Event handlers

From an Event Grid perspective, an event handler is the place where the event is sent. The handler takes some further action to process the event. Event Grid supports several handler types. You can use a supported Azure service or your own webhook as the handler. Depending on the type of handler, Event Grid follows different mechanisms to guarantee the delivery of the event. For HTTP webhook event handlers, the event is retried until the handler returns a status code of `200 â€“ OK`. For Azure Storage Queue, the events are retried until the Queue service successfully processes the message push into the queue.

For information about implementing any of the supported Event Grid handlers, see [Event handlers in Azure Event Grid](event-handlers.md).

## Security

Event Grid provides security for subscribing to topics, and publishing topics. When subscribing, you must have adequate permissions on the resource or event grid topic. When publishing, you must have a SAS token or key authentication for the topic. For more information, see [Event Grid security and authentication](security-authentication.md).

## Event delivery

If Event Grid can't confirm that an event has been received by the subscriber's endpoint, it redelivers the event. For more information, see [Event Grid message delivery and retry](delivery-and-retry.md).

## Batching

When using a custom topic, events must always be published in an array. This can be a batch of one for low-throughput scenarios, however, for high volume use cases, it's recommended that you batch several events together per publish to achieve higher efficiency. Batches can be up to 1 MB. Each event should still not be greater than 64 KB (General Availability) or 1 MB (preview).

> [!NOTE]
> An event of size up to 64 KB is covered by General Availability (GA) Service Level Agreement (SLA). The support for an event of size up to 1 MB is currently in preview. Events over 64 KB are charged in 64 KB increments.
