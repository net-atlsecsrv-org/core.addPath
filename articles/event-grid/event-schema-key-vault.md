### Event examples

The following example show schema for **Microsoft.KeyVault.SecretNewVersionCreated**:

```JSON

      "topic":"/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/sample-rg/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/sample-kv",
      "subject":"newsecret",
      "eventType":"Microsoft.KeyVault.SecretNewVersionCreated",
      "eventTime":"2019-07-25T01:08:33.1036736Z",
      "data":{
         "Id":"https://sample-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/newsecret/ee059b2bb5bc48398a53b168c6cdcb10",
         "vaultName":"sample-kv",
         "objectType":"Secret",
         "objectName ":"newsecret",
