[Configure private endpoints](configure-private-endpoints.md) |

## Troubleshoot event subscription validation

During event subscription creation, if you're seeing an error message such as `The attempt to validate the provided endpoint https://your-endpoint-here failed. For more details, visit https://aka.ms/esvalidation`, it indicates that there's a failure in the validation handshake. To resolve this error, verify the following aspects:

- Do a HTTP POST to your webhook url with a [sample SubscriptionValidationEvent](webhook-event-delivery.md#validation-details) request body using Postman or curl or similar tool.
- If your webhook is implementing synchronous validation handshake mechanism, verify that the ValidationCode is returned as part of the response.
- If your webhook is implementing asynchronous validation handshake mechanism, verify that you are the HTTP POST is returning 200 OK.
- If your webhook is returning 403 (Forbidden) in the response, check if your webhook is behind an Azure Application Gateway or Web Application Firewall. If it is, then your need to disable these firewall rules and do a HTTP POST again:

  920300 (Request Missing an Accept Header, we can fix this)

  942430 (Restricted SQL Character Anomaly Detection (args): # of special characters exceeded (12))

  920230 (Multiple URL Encoding Detected)

  942130 (SQL Injection Attack: SQL Tautology Detected.)

  931130 (Possible Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Attack = Off-Domain Reference/Link)
