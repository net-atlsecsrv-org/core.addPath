# Post to custom topic for Azure Event Grid

This article describes how to post an event to a custom topic. It shows the format of the post and event data. The [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/event-grid/v1_0/) only applies to posts that match the expected format.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Endpoint

When sending the HTTP POST to a custom topic, use the URI format: `https://<topic-endpoint>?api-version=2018-01-01`.

For example, a valid URI is: `https://exampletopic.westus2-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events?api-version=2018-01-01`.

To get the endpoint for a custom topic with Azure CLI, use:

```azurecli-interactive
az eventgrid topic show --name <topic-name> -g <topic-resource-group> --query "endpoint"
```

To get the endpoint for a custom topic with Azure PowerShell, use:

```powershell
(Get-AzEventGridTopic -ResourceGroupName <topic-resource-group> -Name <topic-name>).Endpoint
```

## Header

In the request, include a header value named `aeg-sas-key` that contains a key for authentication.

For example, a valid header value is `aeg-sas-key: VXbGWce53249Mt8wuotr0GPmyJ/nDT4hgdEj9DpBeRr38arnnm5OFg==`.

To get the key for a custom topic with Azure CLI, use:

```azurecli
az eventgrid topic key list --name <topic-name> -g <topic-resource-group> --query "key1"
```

To get the key for a custom topic with PowerShell, use:

```powershell
(Get-AzEventGridTopicKey -ResourceGroupName <topic-resource-group> -Name <topic-name>).Key1
```

## Event data

For custom topics, the top-level data contains the same fields as standard resource-defined events. One of those properties is a data property that contains properties unique to the custom topic. As event publisher, you determine the properties for that data object. Use the following schema:

```json
[
  {
    "id": string,    
    "eventType": string,
    "subject": string,
    "eventTime": string-in-date-time-format,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string
  }
]
```

For a description of these properties, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). When posting events to an event grid topic, the array can have a total size of up to 1 MB. Each event in the array is limited to 64 KB (General Availability) or 1 MB (preview).

> [!NOTE]
> An event of size up to 64 KB is covered by General Availability (GA) Service Level Agreement (SLA). The support for an event of size up to 1 MB is currently in preview. Events over 64 KB are charged in 64-KB increments. 

For example, a valid event data schema is:

```json
[{
  "id": "1807",
  "eventType": "recordInserted",
  "subject": "myapp/vehicles/motorcycles",
  "eventTime": "2017-08-10T21:03:07+00:00",
  "data": {
    "make": "Ducati",
    "model": "Monster"
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0"
}]
```

## Response

After posting to the topic endpoint, you receive a response. The response is a standard HTTP response code. Some common responses are:

|Result  |Response  |
|---------|---------|
|Success  | 200 OK  |
|Event data has incorrect format | 400 Bad Request |
|Invalid access key | 401 Unauthorized |
|Incorrect endpoint | 404 Not Found |
|Array or event exceeds size limits | 413 Payload Too Large |

For errors, the message body has the following format:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "<HTTP status code>",
        "message": "<description>",
        "details": [{
            "code": "<HTTP status code>",
            "message": "<description>"
    }]
  }
}
```
