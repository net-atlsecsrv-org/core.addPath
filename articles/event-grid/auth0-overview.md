# Auth0 partner topics
![Auth0 logo](./media/auth0-overview/auth0-logo.png)

Auth0, the identity platform for application builders, provides developers and enterprises with the building blocks they need to secure their applications.

The Auth0 partner topic allows you to use events that are emitted by Auth0's system to accomplish a number of tasks. Engage with users in meaningful ways after the authentication or automate security and infrastructure tasks.

The integration allows you to stream your Auth0 log events with high reliability into Azure. There, you can consume the events with your favorite Azure resources. This integration allows you to react to events, gain insights, monitor for security issues, and interact with other powerful data pipelines.

For organizations that use Auth0 and Azure, this integration allows you to seamlessly integrate data across your entire stack. 
 
## Available event types
The full list of available Auth0 event types and their descriptions is available on [this website](https://auth0.com/docs/logs/references/log-event-type-codes).

## Use cases

### Engage with your users
Delivering a strong user experience is critical to reducing churn and keeping your users. Deliver more customized application experiences by using Auth0 events with Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps. 

### Understand user behavior
Understand when users access your product, where they're signed in, and what devices they use. Develop an understanding of the product areas that matter most by keeping track of these signals. These signals help you determine:
- What browsers and devices to support. 
- What languages to localize your app in. 
- When your peak traffic times are. 

### Manage user data
Keeping and auditing your user actions is crucial for maintaining security and following industry regulations. The ability to edit, remove, or export user data is increasingly important to following privacy laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Secure your application
Combining security monitoring and incident response procedures is important when you protect a distributed system. For this reason, it's important to keep all the data in one place and monitor the entire stack.
