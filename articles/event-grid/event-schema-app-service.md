# Azure App Service as an Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for Azure App Service events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). It also gives you a list of quick starts and tutorials to use Azure App Service as an event source.

## Event Grid event schema

### Available event types

### The contents of an event response

When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoint.
This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each event. Each event has the following top-level data:

|     Property          |     Type     |     Description                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    topic              |    string    |    Full resource path to the event   source. This field is not writeable. Event Grid provides this value.                                      |
|    subject            |    string    |    Publisher-defined path to the   event subject.                                                                                              |
|    eventType          |    string    |    One of the registered event   types for this event source.                                                                                  |
|    eventTime          |    string    |    The time the event is generated   based on the provider's UTC time.                                                                         |
|    id                 |    string    |    Unique identifier for the event.                                                                                                            |
|    data               |    object    |    Blob storage event data.                                                                                                                    |
|    dataVersion        |    string    |    The schema version of the data   object. The publisher defines the schema version.                                                          |
|    metadataVersion    |    string    |    The schema version of the event   metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event   Grid provides this value.    |
