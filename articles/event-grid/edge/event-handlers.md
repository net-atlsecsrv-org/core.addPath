# Event Handlers and destinations in Event Grid on Edge

An event handler is the place where the event for further action or to process the event. With the Event Grid on Edge module, the event handler can be on the same edge device, another device, or in the cloud. You may can use any WebHook to handle events, or send events to one of the native handlers like Azure Event Grid.

This article provides information on how to configure each.

## WebHook

To publish to a WebHook endpoint, set the `endpointType` to `WebHook` and provide:

* endpointUrl: The WebHook endpoint URL

    ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "WebHook",
              "properties": {
                "endpointUrl": "<your-webhook-endpoint>"
              }
            }
          }
        }
    ```

## Azure Event Grid

To publish to an Azure Event Grid cloud endpoint, set the `endpointType` to `eventGrid` and provide:

* endpointUrl: Event Grid Topic URL in the cloud
* sasKey: Event Grid Topic's SAS key
* topicName: Name to stamp all outgoing events to Event Grid. Topic name is useful when posting to an Event Grid Domain topic.

   ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "eventGrid",
              "properties": {
                 "endpointUrl": "<your-event-grid-cloud-topic-endpoint-url>?api-version=2018-01-01",
                 "sasKey": "<your-event-grid-topic-saskey>",
                 "topicName": null
              }
            }
          }
    }
   ```

## IoT Edge Hub

To publish to an Edge Hub module, set the `endpointType` to `edgeHub` and provide:

* outputName: The output on which the Event Grid module will route events that match this subscription to edgeHub. For example, events that match the below subscription will be written to /messages/modules/eventgridmodule/outputs/sampleSub4.

    ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "edgeHub",
              "properties": {
                "outputName": "sampleSub4"
              }
            }
          }
        }
    ```

## Event Hubs

To publish to an Event Hub, set the `endpointType` to `eventHub` and provide:

* connectionString: Connection string for the specific Event Hub you're targeting generated via a Shared Access Policy.

    >[!NOTE]
    > The connection string must be entity specific. Using a namespace connection string will not work. You can generate an entity specific connection string by navigating to the specific Event Hub you would like to publish to in the Azure Portal and clicking **Shared access policies** to generate a new entity specific connecection string.

    ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "eventHub",
              "properties": {
                "connectionString": "<your-event-hub-connection-string>"
              }
            }
          }
        }
    ```

## Service Bus Queues

To publish to a Service Bus Queue, set the `endpointType` to `serviceBusQueue` and provide:

* connectionString: Connection string for the specific Service Bus Queue you're targeting generated via a Shared Access Policy.

    >[!NOTE]
    > The connection string must be entity specific. Using a namespace connection string will not work. Generate an entity specific connection string by navigating to the specific Service Bus Queue you would like to publish to in the Azure Portal and clicking **Shared access policies** to generate a new entity specific connecection string.

    ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "serviceBusQueue",
              "properties": {
                "connectionString": "<your-service-bus-queue-connection-string>"
              }
            }
          }
        }
    ```

## Service Bus Topics

To publish to a Service Bus Topic, set the `endpointType` to `serviceBusTopic` and provide:

* connectionString: Connection string for the specific Service Bus Topic you're targeting generated via a Shared Access Policy.

    >[!NOTE]
    > The connection string must be entity specific. Using a namespace connection string will not work. Generate an entity specific connection string by navigating to the specific Service Bus Topic you would like to publish to in the Azure Portal and clicking **Shared access policies** to generate a new entity specific connecection string.

    ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "serviceBusTopic",
              "properties": {
                "connectionString": "<your-service-bus-topic-connection-string>"
              }
            }
          }
        }
    ```

## Storage Queues

To publish to a Storage Queue, set the  `endpointType` to `storageQueue` and provide:

* queueName: Name of the Storage Queue you're publishing to.
* connectionString: Connection string for the Storage Account the Storage Queue is in.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Unline Event Hubs, Service Bus Queues, and Service Bus Topics, the connection string used for Storage Queues is not entity specific. Instead, it must but the connection string for the Storage Account.

    ```json
        {
          "properties": {
            "destination": {
              "endpointType": "storageQueue",
