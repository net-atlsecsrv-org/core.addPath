# Azure Event Grid event schema

This article describes the properties and schema that are present for all events.Â Events consist of a set of five required string properties and a required data object. The properties are common to all events from any publisher. The data object has properties that are specific to each publisher. For system topics, these properties are specific to the resource provider, such as Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs.

Event sources send events to Azure Event Grid in an array, which can have several event objects. When posting events to an event grid topic, the array can have a total size of up to 1 MB. Each event in the array is limited to 64 KB (General Availability) or 1 MB (preview). If an event or the array is greater than the size limits, you receive the response **413 Payload Too Large**.

> [!NOTE]
> An event of size up to 64 KB is covered by General Availability (GA) Service Level Agreement (SLA). The support for an event of size up to 1 MB is currently in preview. Events over 64 KB are charged in 64-KB increments. 

Event Grid sends the events to subscribers in an array that has a single event. This behavior may change in the future.

You can find the JSON schema for the Event Grid event and each Azure publisher's data payload in the [Event Schema store](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/eventgrid/data-plane).

## Event schema

The following example shows the properties that are used by all event publishers:

```json
[
  {
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

For example, the schema published for an Azure Blob storage event is:

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/Storage/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xstoretestaccount",
    "subject": "/blobServices/default/containers/oc2d2817345i200097container/blobs/oc2d2817345i20002296blob",
    "eventType": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",
    "eventTime": "2017-06-26T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
    "data": {
      "api": "PutBlockList",
      "clientRequestId": "6d79dbfb-0e37-4fc4-981f-442c9ca65760",
      "requestId": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e000000",
      "eTag": "0x8D4BCC2E4835CD0",
      "contentType": "application/octet-stream",
      "contentLength": 524288,
      "blobType": "BlockBlob",
      "url": "https://oc2d2817345i60006.blob.core.windows.net/oc2d2817345i200097container/oc2d2817345i20002296blob",
      "sequencer": "00000000000004420000000000028963",
      "storageDiagnostics": {
        "batchId": "b68529f3-68cd-4744-baa4-3c0498ec19f0"
      }
    },
    "dataVersion": "",
    "metadataVersion": "1"
  }
]
```

## Event properties

All events have the same following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| topic | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| subject | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| eventType | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| eventTime | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| data | object | Event data specific to the resource provider. |
| dataVersion | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| metadataVersion | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |

To learn about the properties in the data object, see the event source:

* [Azure subscriptions (management operations)](event-schema-subscriptions.md)
* [Container Registry](event-schema-container-registry.md)
* [Blob storage](event-schema-blob-storage.md)
* [Event Hubs](event-schema-event-hubs.md)
* [IoT Hub](event-schema-iot-hub.md)
* [Media Services](../media-services/latest/media-services-event-schemas.md?toc=%2fazure%2fevent-grid%2ftoc.json)
* [Resource groups (management operations)](event-schema-resource-groups.md)
* [Service Bus](event-schema-service-bus.md)

For custom topics, the event publisher determines the data object. The top-level data should have the same fields as standard resource-defined events.

When publishing events to custom topics, create subjects for your events that make it easy for subscribers to know whether they're interested in the event. Subscribers use the subject to filter and route events. Consider providing the path for where the event happened, so subscribers can filter by segments of that path. The path enables subscribers to narrowly or broadly filter events. For example, if you provide a three segment path like `/A/B/C` in the subject, subscribers can filter by the first segment `/A` to get a broad set of events. Those subscribers get events with subjects like `/A/B/C` or `/A/D/E`. Other subscribers can filter by `/A/B` to get a narrower set of events.

Sometimes your subject needs more detail about what happened. For example, the **Storage Accounts** publisher provides the subject `/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>/blobs/<file>` when a file is added to a container. A subscriber could filter by the path `/blobServices/default/containers/testcontainer` to get all events for that container but not other containers in the storage account. A subscriber could also filter or route by the suffix `.txt` to only work with text files.
