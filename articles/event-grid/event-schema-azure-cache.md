# Azure Cache for Redis as an Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for Azure Cache for Redis events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). 

## Available event types
These events are triggered when a client exports, imports, or scales by calling Azure Cache for Redis REST APIs. Patching event is triggered by Redis update.

 |Event name |Description|
 |----------|-----------|
 |**Microsoft.Cache.ExportRDBCompleted** |Triggered when cache data is exported. |
 |**Microsoft.Cache.ImportRDBCompleted** |Triggered when cache data is imported. |
 |**Microsoft.Cache.PatchingCompleted** |Triggered when patching is completed. |
 |**Microsoft.Cache.ScalingCompleted** |Triggered when scaling is completed. |

## Example event
When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoint. This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each Azure Cache for Redis event.
