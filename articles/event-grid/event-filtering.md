# Understand event filtering for Event Grid subscriptions

This article describes the different ways to filter which events are sent to your endpoint. When creating an event subscription, you have three options for filtering:

* Event types
* Subject begins with or ends with
* Advanced fields and operators

## Event type filtering

By default, all [event types](event-schema.md) for the event source are sent to the endpoint. You can decide to send only certain event types to your endpoint. For example, you can get notified of updates to your resources, but not notified for other operations like deletions. In that case, filter by the `Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess` event type. Provide an array with the event types, or specify `All` to get all event types for the event source.

The JSON syntax for filtering by event type is:

```json
"filter": {
  "includedEventTypes": [
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure",
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess"
  ]
}
```

## Subject filtering

For simple filtering by subject, specify a starting or ending value for the subject. For example, you can specify the subject ends with `.txt` to only get events related to uploading a text file to storage account. Or, you can filter the subject begins with `/blobServices/default/containers/testcontainer` to get all events for that container but not other containers in the storage account.

When publishing events to custom topics, create subjects for your events that make it easy for subscribers to know whether they're interested in the event. Subscribers use the subject property to filter and route events. Consider adding the path for where the event happened, so subscribers can filter by segments of that path. The path enables subscribers to narrowly or broadly filter events. If you provide a three segment path like `/A/B/C` in the subject, subscribers can filter by the first segment `/A` to get a broad set of events. Those subscribers get events with subjects like `/A/B/C` or `/A/D/E`. Other subscribers can filter by `/A/B` to get a narrower set of events.

The JSON syntax for filtering by subject is:

```json
"filter": {
  "subjectBeginsWith": "/blobServices/default/containers/mycontainer/log",
  "subjectEndsWith": ".jpg"
}

```

## Advanced filtering

To filter by values in the data fields and specify the comparison operator, use the advanced filtering option. In advanced filtering, you specify the:

* operator type - The type of comparison.
* key - The field in the event data that you're using for filtering. It can be a number, boolean, or string.
* values - The value or values to compare to the key.

If you specify a single filter with multiple values, an **OR** operation is performed, so the value of the key field must be one of these values. Here is an example:

```json
"advancedFilters": [
    {
        "operatorType": "StringContains",
        "key": "Subject",
        "values": [
            "/providers/microsoft.devtestlab/",
            "/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/"
        ]
    }
]
```

If you specify multiple different filters, an **AND** operation is performed, so each filter condition must be met. Here is an example: 

```json
"advancedFilters": [
    {
        "operatorType": "StringContains",
        "key": "Subject",
        "values": [
            "/providers/microsoft.devtestlab/"
        ]
    },
    {
        "operatorType": "StringContains",
        "key": "Subject",
        "values": [
            "/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/"
        ]
    }
]
```

### Operator

The available operators for numbers are:

* NumberGreaterThan
* NumberGreaterThanOrEquals
* NumberLessThan
* NumberLessThanOrEquals
* NumberIn
* NumberNotIn

The available operator for booleans is: BoolEquals

The available operators for strings are:

* StringContains
* StringBeginsWith
* StringEndsWith
* StringIn
* StringNotIn

All string comparisons are case-insensitve.

### Key

For events in the Event Grid schema, use the following values for the key:

* ID
* Topic
* Subject
* EventType
* DataVersion
* Event data (like Data.key1)

For events in Cloud Events schema, use the following values for the key:

* EventId
* Source
* EventType
* EventTypeVersion
* Event data (like Data.key1)

For custom input schema, use the event data fields (like Data.key1).

### Values

The values can be:

* number
* string
* boolean
* array

### Limitations

Advanced filtering has the following limitations:

* Five advanced filters per event grid subscription
* 512 characters per string value
* Five values for **in** and **not in** operators

The same key can be used in more than one filter.
