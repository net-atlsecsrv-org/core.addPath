# Tutorial: Stream big data into a data warehouse
Azure [Event Grid](overview.md) is an intelligent event routing service that enables you to react to notifications or events from apps and services. For example, it can trigger an Azure Function to process Event Hubs data that's captured to a Blob storage or Data Lake Storage. This [sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/e2e/EventHubsCaptureEventGridDemo) shows you how to use Event Grid and Azure Functions to migrate captured Event Hubs data from blob storage to Azure Synapse Analytics, specifically a dedicated SQL pool.
