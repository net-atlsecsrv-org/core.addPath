# Event Grid message delivery and retry

This article describes how Azure Event Grid handles events when delivery isn't acknowledged.

Event Grid provides durable delivery. It delivers each message at least once for each subscription. Events are sent to the registered endpoint of each subscription immediately. If an endpoint doesn't acknowledge receipt of an event, Event Grid retries delivery of the event.

## Batched event delivery

Event Grid defaults to sending each event individually to subscribers. The subscriber receives an array with a single event. You can configure Event Grid to batch events for delivery for improved HTTP performance in high-throughput scenarios.

Batched delivery has two settings:

* **Max events per batch** - Maximum number of events Event Grid will deliver per batch. This number will never be exceeded, however fewer events may be delivered if no other events are available at the time of publish. Event Grid does not delay events in order to create a batch if fewer events are available. Must be between 1 and 5,000.
* **Preferred batch size in kilobytes** - Target ceiling for batch size in kilobytes. Similar to max events, the batch size may be smaller if more events are not available at the time of publish. It is possible that a batch is larger than the preferred batch size *if* a single event is larger than the preferred size. For example, if the preferred size is 4 KB and a 10-KB event is pushed to Event Grid, the 10-KB event will still be delivered in its own batch rather than being dropped.

Batched delivery in configured on a per-event subscription basis via the portal, CLI, PowerShell, or SDKs.

### Azure portal: 
![Batch delivery settings](./media/delivery-and-retry/batch-settings.png)

### Azure CLI
When creating an event subscription, use the following parameters: 

- **max-events-per-batch** - Maximum number of events in a batch. Must be a number between 1 and 5000.
- **preferred-batch-size-in-kilobytes** - Preferred batch size in kilobytes. Must be a number between 1 and 1024.

```azurecli
storageid=$(az storage account show --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv)
endpoint=https://$sitename.azurewebsites.net/api/updates

az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  --resource-id $storageid \
  --name <event_subscription_name> \
  --endpoint $endpoint \
  --max-events-per-batch 1000 \
  --preferred-batch-size-in-kilobytes 512
```

## Retry schedule and duration

Event Grid waits 30 seconds for a response after delivering a message. After 30 seconds, if the endpoint hasnâ€™t responded, the message is queued for retry. Event Grid uses an exponential backoff retry policy for event delivery. Event Grid retries delivery on the following schedule on a best effort basis:

- 10 seconds
- 30 seconds
- 1 minute
- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- Hourly for up to 24 hours

If the endpoint responds within 3 minutes, Event Grid will attempt to remove the event from the retry queue on a best effort basis but duplicates may still be received.

Event Grid adds a small randomization to all retry steps and may opportunistically skip certain retries if an endpoint is consistently unhealthy, down for a long period, or appears to be overwhelmed.

For deterministic behavior, set the event time to live and max delivery attempts in the [subscription retry policies](manage-event-delivery.md).

By default, Event Grid expires all events that aren't delivered within 24 hours. You can [customize the retry policy](manage-event-delivery.md) when creating an event subscription. You provide the maximum number of delivery attempts (default is 30) and the event time-to-live (default is 1440 minutes).

## Delayed Delivery

As an endpoint experiences delivery failures, Event Grid will begin to delay the delivery and retry of events to that endpoint. For example, if the first 10 events published to an endpoint fail, Event Grid will assume that the endpoint is experiencing issues and will delay all subsequent retries *and new* deliveries for some time - in some cases up to several hours.

The functional purpose of delayed delivery is to protect unhealthy endpoints as well as the Event Grid system. Without back-off and delay of delivery to unhealthy endpoints, Event Grid's retry policy and volume capabilities can easily overwhelm a system.

## Dead-letter events
When Event Grid can't deliver an event within a certain time period or after trying to deliver the event a certain number of times, it can send the undelivered event to a storage account. This process is known as **dead-lettering**. Event Grid dead-letters an event when **one of the following** conditions is met. 

- Event isn't delivered within the time-to-live period
- The number of tries to deliver the event has exceeded the limit

If either of the conditions is met, the event is dropped or dead-lettered.  By default, Event Grid doesn't turn on dead-lettering. To enable it, you must specify a storage account to hold undelivered events when creating the event subscription. You pull events from this storage account to resolve deliveries.

Event Grid sends an event to the dead-letter location when it has tried all of its retry attempts. If Event Grid receives a 400 (Bad Request) or 413 (Request Entity Too Large) response code, it immediately sends the event to the dead-letter endpoint. These response codes indicate delivery of the event will never succeed.

There is a five-minute delay between the last attempt to deliver an event and when it is delivered to the dead-letter location. This delay is intended to reduce the number Blob storage operations. If the dead-letter location is unavailable for four hours, the event is dropped.

Before setting the dead-letter location, you must have a storage account with a container. You provide the endpoint for this container when creating the event subscription. The endpoint is in the format of:
`/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>`

You might want to be notified when an event has been sent to the dead letter location. To use Event Grid to respond to undelivered events, [create an event subscription](../storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-quickstart.md?toc=%2fazure%2fevent-grid%2ftoc.json) for the dead-letter blob storage. Every time your dead-letter blob storage receives an undelivered event, Event Grid notifies your handler. The handler responds with actions you wish to take for reconciling undelivered events. For an example of setting up a dead letter location and retry policies, see [Dead letter and retry policies](manage-event-delivery.md).

## Delivery event formats
This section gives you examples of events and dead-lettered events in different delivery schema formats (Event Grid schema, CloudEvents 1.0 schema, and custom schema). For more information about these formats, see [Event Grid schema](event-schema.md) and [Cloud Events 1.0 schema](cloud-event-schema.md) articles.

## Message delivery status

Event Grid uses HTTP response codes to acknowledge receipt of events. 

### Success codes

Event Grid considers **only** the following HTTP response codes as successful deliveries. All other status codes are considered failed deliveries and will be retried or deadlettered as appropriate. Upon receiving a successful status code, Event Grid considers delivery complete.

- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 202 Accepted
- 203 Non-Authoritative Information
- 204 No Content

### Failure codes

All other codes not in the above set (200-204) are considered failures and will be retried. Some have specific retry policies tied to them outlined below, all others follow the standard exponential back-off model. It's important to keep in mind that due to the highly parallelized nature of Event Grid's architecture, the retry behavior is non-deterministic. 

| Status code | Retry behavior |
| ------------|----------------|
| 400 Bad Request | Retry after 5 minutes or more (Deadletter immediately if deadletter setup) |
| 401 Unauthorized | Retry after 5 minutes or more |
| 403 Forbidden | Retry after 5 minutes or more |
| 404 Not Found | Retry after 5 minutes or more |
| 408 Request Timeout | Retry after 2 minutes or more |
| 413 Request Entity Too Large | Retry after 10 seconds or more (Deadletter immediately if deadletter setup) |
| 503 Service Unavailable | Retry after 30 seconds or more |
| All others | Retry after 10 seconds or more |
