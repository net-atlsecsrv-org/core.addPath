# Relay Hybrid connection as an event handler for Azure Event Grid events
An event handler is the place where the event is sent. The handler takes some further action to process the event. Several Azure services are automatically configured to handle events and **Azure Relay** is one of them. 

Use Azure **Relay Hybrid Connections** to send events to applications that are within an enterprise network and don't have a publicly accessible endpoint.

## Tutorials
See the following tutorial for an example of using an Azure Relay hybrid connection as an event handler. 

|Title  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| [Tutorial: send events to hybrid connection](custom-event-to-hybrid-connection.md) | Sends a custom event to an existing hybrid connection for processing by a listener application. |

## REST example (for PUT)

```json
{
	"properties": 
	{
		"destination": 
		{
			"endpointType": "HybridConnection",
			"properties": 
			{
				"resourceId": "/subscriptions/<AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Relay/namespaces/<RELAY NAMESPACE NAME>/hybridconnections/<HYBRID CONNECTION NAME>"
			}
		},
		"eventDeliverySchema": "EventGridSchema"
	}
}
```

## Next steps
