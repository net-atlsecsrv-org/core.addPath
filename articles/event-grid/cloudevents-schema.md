# Use CloudEvents v1.0 schema with Event Grid
In addition to its [default event schema](event-schema.md), Azure Event Grid natively supports events in the [JSON implementation of CloudEvents v1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/json-format.md) and [HTTP protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-protocol-binding.md). [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) is an [open specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md) for describing event data.

CloudEvents simplifies interoperability by providing a common event schema for publishing, and consuming cloud based events. This schema allows for uniform tooling, standard ways of routing & handling events, and universal ways of deserializing the outer event schema. With a common schema, you can more easily integrate work across platforms.

CloudEvents is being built by several [collaborators](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/community/contributors.md), including Microsoft, through the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). It's currently available as version 1.0.

This article describes how to use the CloudEvents schema with Event Grid.

## CloudEvent schema

Here is an example of an Azure Blob Storage event in CloudEvents format:

``` JSON
{
    "specversion": "1.0",
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",  
    "source": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-account}",
    "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e209",
    "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z",
    "subject": "blobServices/default/containers/{storage-container}/blobs/{new-file}",
    "dataschema": "#",
    "data": {
        "api": "PutBlockList",
        "clientRequestId": "4c5dd7fb-2c48-4a27-bb30-5361b5de920a",
        "requestId": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb549000000",
        "eTag": "0x8D76C39E4407333",
        "contentType": "image/png",
        "contentLength": 30699,
        "blobType": "BlockBlob",
        "url": "https://gridtesting.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer/{new-file}",
        "sequencer": "000000000000000000000000000099240000000000c41c18",
        "storageDiagnostics": {
            "batchId": "681fe319-3006-00a8-0022-9e7cde000000"
        }
    }
}
```

A detailed description of the available fields, their types, and definitions in CloudEvents v1.0 is [available here](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#required-attributes).

The headers values for events delivered in the CloudEvents schema and the Event Grid schema are the same except for `content-type`. For CloudEvents schema, that header value is `"content-type":"application/cloudevents+json; charset=utf-8"`. For Event Grid schema, that header value is `"content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8"`.

## Configure Event Grid for CloudEvents

You can use Event Grid for both input and output of events in CloudEvents schema. You can use CloudEvents for system events, like Blob Storage events and IoT Hub events, and custom events. It can also transform those events on the wire back and forth.


| Input schema       | Output schema
|--------------------|---------------------
| CloudEvents format | CloudEvents format
| Event Grid format  | CloudEvents format
| Event Grid format  | Event Grid format

For all event schemas, Event Grid requires validation when publishing to an event grid topic and when creating an event subscription. For more information, see [Event Grid security and authentication](security-authentication.md).

### Input schema

You set the input schema for a custom topic when you create the custom topic.

For Azure CLI, use:

```azurecli-interactive
# If you have not already installed the extension, do it now.
# This extension is required for preview features.
az extension add --name eventgrid

az eventgrid topic create \
  --name <topic_name> \
  -l westcentralus \
  -g gridResourceGroup \
  --input-schema cloudeventschemav1_0
```

For PowerShell, use:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# If you have not already installed the module, do it now.
# This module is required for preview features.
Install-Module -Name AzureRM.EventGrid -AllowPrerelease -Force -Repository PSGallery

New-AzureRmEventGridTopic `
  -ResourceGroupName gridResourceGroup `
  -Location westcentralus `
  -Name <topic_name> `
  -InputSchema CloudEventSchemaV1_0
```

### Output schema

You set the output schema when you create the event subscription.

For Azure CLI, use:

```azurecli-interactive
topicID=$(az eventgrid topic show --name <topic-name> -g gridResourceGroup --query id --output tsv)

az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  --name <event_subscription_name> \
  --source-resource-id $topicID \
  --endpoint <endpoint_URL> \
  --event-delivery-schema cloudeventschemav1_0
```

For PowerShell, use:
```azurepowershell-interactive
$topicid = (Get-AzureRmEventGridTopic -ResourceGroupName gridResourceGroup -Name <topic-name>).Id

New-AzureRmEventGridSubscription `
  -ResourceId $topicid `
  -EventSubscriptionName <event_subscription_name> `
  -Endpoint <endpoint_URL> `
  -DeliverySchema CloudEventSchemaV1_0
```

 Currently, you can't use an Event Grid trigger for an Azure Functions app when the event is delivered in the CloudEvents schema. Use an HTTP trigger. For examples of implementing an HTTP trigger that receives events in the CloudEvents schema, see [Using CloudEvents with Azure Functions](#azure-functions).

 ## Endpoint Validation with CloudEvents v1.0

If you are already familiar with Event Grid, you may be aware of Event Grid's endpoint validation handshake for preventing abuse. CloudEvents v1.0 implements its own [abuse protection semantics](security-authentication.md#webhook-event-delivery) using the HTTP OPTIONS method. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-webhook.md#4-abuse-protection). When using the CloudEvents schema for output, Event Grid uses with the CloudEvents v1.0 abuse protection in place of the Event Grid validation event mechanism.

## Use with Azure Functions

The [Azure Functions Event Grid binding](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid.md) does not natively support CloudEvents, so HTTP-triggered functions are used to read CloudEvents messages. When using an HTTP trigger to read CloudEvents, you have to write code for what the Event Grid trigger does automatically:

* Sends a validation response to a [subscription validation request](../event-grid/security-authentication.md#webhook-event-delivery).
* Invokes the function once per element of the event array contained in the request body.

For information about the URL to use for invoking the function locally or when it runs in Azure, see the [HTTP trigger binding reference documentation](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook.md)

The following sample C# code for an HTTP trigger simulates Event Grid trigger behavior.  Use this example for events delivered in the CloudEvents schema.

```csharp
[FunctionName("HttpTrigger")]
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", "options", Route = null)]HttpRequestMessage req, ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
    if (req.Method == "OPTIONS")
    {
        // If the request is for subscription validation, send back the validation code
        
        var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        response.Add("Webhook-Allowed-Origin", "eventgrid.azure.net");

        return response;
    }

    var requestmessage = await req.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var message = JToken.Parse(requestmessage);

    // The request is not for subscription validation, so it's for an event.
    // CloudEvents schema delivers one event at a time.
    log.LogInformation($"Source: {message["source"]}");
    log.LogInformation($"Time: {message["eventTime"]}");
    log.LogInformation($"Event data: {message["data"].ToString()}");

    return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
```

The following sample JavaScript code for an HTTP trigger simulates Event Grid trigger behavior. Use this example for events delivered in the CloudEvents schema.

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
    
    if (req.method == "OPTIONS) {
        // If the request is for subscription validation, send back the validation code
        
        context.log('Validate request received');
        context.res = { status: 200, body: { "ValidationResponse": code } };
        context.res.headers.append('Webhook-Allowed-Origin', 'eventgrid.azure.net');
    }
    else
    {
        var message = req.body;
        
        // The request is not for subscription validation, so it's for an event.
        // CloudEvents schema delivers one event at a time.
        var event = JSON.parse(message);
        context.log('Source: ' + event.source);
        context.log('Time: ' + event.eventTime);
        context.log('Data: ' + JSON.stringify(event.data));
    }
 
    context.done();
};
```
