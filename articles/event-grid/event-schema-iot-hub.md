# Azure Event Grid event schema for IoT Hub

This article provides the properties and schema for Azure IoT Hub events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). 

For a list of sample scripts and tutorials, see [IoT Hub event source](event-sources.md#iot-hub).

## Available event types

Azure IoT Hub emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Devices.DeviceCreated | Published when a device is registered to an IoT hub. |
| Microsoft.Devices.DeviceDeleted | Published when a device is deleted from an IoT hub. | 
| Microsoft.Devices.DeviceConnected | Published when a device is connected to an IoT hub. |
| Microsoft.Devices.DeviceDisconnected | Published when a device is disconnected from an IoT hub. | 
| Microsoft.Devices.DeviceTelemetry | Published when a telemetry message is sent to an IoT hub. |

All device events except device telemetry events are generally available in all regions supported by Event Grid. Device telemetry event is in public preview and is available in all regions except East US, West US, West Europe, [Azure Government](/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md), [Azure China 21Vianet](/azure/china/china-welcome.md), and [Azure Germany](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/germany/).

## Example event

The schema for DeviceConnected and DeviceDisconnected events have the same structure. This sample event shows the schema of an event raised when a device is connected to an IoT hub:

```json
[{
  "id": "f6bbf8f4-d365-520d-a878-17bf7238abd8", 
  "topic": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/<subscription ID>/RESOURCEGROUPS/<resource group name>/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.DEVICES/IOTHUBS/<hub name>", 
  "subject": "devices/LogicAppTestDevice", 
  "eventType": "Microsoft.Devices.DeviceConnected", 
  "eventTime": "2018-06-02T19:17:44.4383997Z", 
  "data": {
    "deviceConnectionStateEventInfo": {
      "sequenceNumber":
        "000000000000000001D4132452F67CE200000002000000000000000000000001"
    },
    "hubName": "egtesthub1",
    "deviceId": "LogicAppTestDevice",
    "moduleId" : "DeviceModuleID"
  }, 
  "dataVersion": "1", 
  "metadataVersion": "1" 
}]
```

The DeviceTelemetry event is raised when a telemetry event is sent to an IoT Hub. A sample schema for this event is shown below.

```json
[{
  "id": "9af86784-8d40-fe2g-8b2a-bab65e106785",

          },
          "Location": "USA"        
      },
        "properties": {

            "iothub-connection-auth-generation-id": "123455432199234570",
            "iothub-enqueuedtime": "2019-01-07T20:58:30.48Z",
            "iothub-message-source": "Telemetry"        
        }    
    },
  "dataVersion": "",

### Event properties

All events contain the same top-level data: 

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| topic | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field is not writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| subject | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| eventType | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| eventTime | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| data | object | IoT Hub event data.  |
| dataVersion | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| metadataVersion | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |

For all IoT Hub events, the data object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| hubName | string | Name of the IoT Hub where the device was created or deleted. |
| deviceId | string | The unique identifier of the device. This case-sensitive string can be up to 128 characters long, and supports ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric characters plus the following special characters: `- : . + % _ # * ? ! ( ) , = @ ; $ '`. |

The contents of the data object are different for each event publisher. 

For **Device Connected** and **Device Disconnected** IoT Hub events, the data object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| moduleId | string | The unique identifier of the module. This field is output only for module devices. This case-sensitive string can be up to 128 characters long, and supports ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric characters plus the following special characters: `- : . + % _ # * ? ! ( ) , = @ ; $ '`. |
| deviceConnectionStateEventInfo | object | Device connection state event information
| sequenceNumber | string | A number which helps indicate order of device connected or device disconnected events. Latest event will have a sequence number that is higher than the previous event. This number may change by more than 1, but is strictly increasing. See [how to use sequence number](../iot-hub/iot-hub-how-to-order-connection-state-events.md). |

For **Device Telemetry** IoT Hub event, the data object contains the device-to-cloud message in [IoT hub message format](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-construct.md) and has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| body | string | The content of the message from the device. |
| properties | string | Application properties are user-defined strings that can be added to the message. These fields are optional. |
| system properties | string | [System properties](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-routing-query-syntax.md#system-properties) help identify contents and source of the messages. Device telemetry message must be in a valid JSON format with the contentType set to JSON and contentEncoding set to UTF-8 in the message system properties. If this is not set, then IoT Hub will write the messages in base 64 encoded format.  |

For **Device Created** and **Device Deleted** IoT Hub events, the data object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| twin | object | Information about the device twin, which is the cloud representation of application device metadata. | 
| deviceID | string | The unique identifier of the device twin. | 
| etag | string | A validator for ensuring consistency of updates to a device twin. Each etag is guaranteed to be unique per device twin. |  
| deviceEtag| string | A validator for ensuring consistency of updates to a device registry. Each deviceEtag is guaranteed to be unique per device registry. |
| status | string | Whether the device twin is enabled or disabled. | 
| statusUpdateTime | string | The ISO8601 timestamp of the last device twin status update. |
| connectionState | string | Whether the device is connected or disconnected. | 
| lastActivityTime | string | The ISO8601 timestamp of the last activity. | 
| cloudToDeviceMessageCount | integer | Count of cloud to device messages sent to this device. | 
| authenticationType | string | Authentication type used for this device: either `SAS`, `SelfSigned`, or `CertificateAuthority`. |
| x509Thumbprint | string | The thumbprint is a unique value for the x509 certificate, commonly used to find a particular certificate in a certificate store. The thumbprint is dynamically generated using the SHA1 algorithm, and does not physically exist in the certificate. | 
| primaryThumbprint | string | Primary thumbprint for the x509 certificate. |
| secondaryThumbprint | string | Secondary thumbprint for the x509 certificate. | 
| version | integer | An integer that is incremented by one each time the device twin is updated. |
| desired | object | A portion of the properties that can be written only by the application back-end, and read by the device. | 
| reported | object | A portion of the properties that can be written only by the device, and read by the application back-end. |
| lastUpdated | string | The ISO8601 timestamp of the last device twin property update. |
