# Subscribe to events for a resource group and filter for a resource with Azure CLI

This script creates an Event Grid subscription to the events for a resource group. It uses a filter to get only events for a specified resource in the resource group.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

The preview sample script requires the Event Grid extension. To install, run `az extension add --name eventgrid`.

## Sample script - stable

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/event-grid/filter-events/filter-events.sh "Subscribe to Azure subscription")]

## Sample script - preview extension

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/event-grid/filter-events-preview/filter-events-preview.sh "Subscribe to Azure subscription")]
