# Metrics for Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files provides metrics on allocated storage, actual storage usage, volume IOPS, and latency. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain a better understanding on the usage pattern and volume performance of your NetApp accounts.  

## <a name="capacity_pools"></a>Usage metrics for capacity pools

- *Pool Allocated Size*   
    The provisioned size of the pool.

- *Pool Allocated to Volume Size*  
    The total of volume quota (GiB) in a given capacity pool (that is, the total of the volumes' provisioned sizes in the capacity pool).  
    This size is the size you selected during volume creation.  

- *Pool Consumed Size*  
    The total of logical space (GiB) used across volumes in a capacity pool.  

- *Total Snapshot Size for the Pool*    
    The sum of snapshot size from all volumes in the pool.

## <a name="volumes"></a>Usage metrics for volumes

<!-- ANF-5023: fixed version: 2020.08, 2020.09
- *Percentage Volume Consumed Size*    
    The percentage of the volume consumed, including snapshots.  
-->
- *Volume Allocated Size*   
    The provisioned size of a volume
- *Volume Quota Size*    
    The quota size (GiB) the volume is provisioned with.   
- *Volume Consumed Size*   
    Logical size of the volume (used bytes).  
    This size includes logical space used by active file systems and snapshots.  
- *Volume Snapshot Size*   
   The size of all snapshots in a volume.  

## Performance metrics for volumes

- *Average Read Latency*   
    The average time for reads from the volume in milliseconds.
- *Average Write Latency*   
    The average time for writes from the volume in milliseconds.
- *Read IOPS*   
    The number of reads to the volume per second.
- *Write IOPS*   
    The number of writes to the volume per second.
<!-- These two metrics are not yet available, until ~ 2020.09
- *Read MiB/s*   
    Read throughput in bytes per second.
- *Write MiB/s*   
    Write throughput in bytes per second.
--> 
<!-- ANF-4128; 2020.07
- *Pool Provisioned Throughput*	  
    The total throughput a capacity pool can provide to its volumes based on "Pool Provisioned Size" and "Service Level".
- *Pool Allocated to Volume Throughput*   
    The total throughput allocated to volumes in a given capacity pool (that is, the total of the volumes' allocated throughput in the capacity pool).
-->

<!-- ANF-6443; 2020.11
- *Pool Consumed Throughput*	
    The total throughput being consumed by volumes in a given capacity pool.
-->


## <a name="replication"></a>Volume replication metrics

- *Is volume replication status healthy*   
    The condition of the replication relationship. A healthy state is denoted by `1`. An unhealthy state is denoted by `0`.

- *Is volume replication transferring*    
    Whether the status of the volume replication is ‘transferring’. 
 
- *Volume replication lag time*   
    The amount of time in seconds by which the data on the mirror lags behind the source. 

- *Volume replication last transfer duration*   
    The amount of time in seconds it took for the last transfer to complete. 

- *Volume replication last transfer size*    
    The total number of bytes transferred as part of the last transfer. 

- *Volume replication progress*    
    The total amount of data transferred for the current transfer operation. 

- *Volume replication total transfer*   
    The cumulative bytes transferred for the relationship.
