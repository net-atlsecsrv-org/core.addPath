# Troubleshoot capacity pool issues

This article describes resolutions to issues you might have when managing capacity pools, including the pool change operation. 

## Issues managing a capacity pool 

|     Error condition    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| Issues creating a capacity pool |  Make sure that the capacity pool count does not exceed the limit. See [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md).  If the count is less than the limit and you still experience issues, file a support ticket and specify the capacity pool name. |
| Issues deleting a capacity pool  |  Make sure that you remove all Azure NetApp Files volumes and snapshots in the subscription where you are trying to delete the capacity pool. <br> If you already removed all volumes and snapshots and you still cannot delete the capacity pool, references to resources might still exist without showing in the portal. In this case, file a support ticket, and specify that you have performed the above recommended steps. |
| Volume creation or modification fails with `Requested throughput not available` error | Available throughput for a volume is determined by its capacity poolâ€™s size and the service level. If you do not have sufficient throughput, you should increase the pool size or adjust the existing volume throughput. | 

## Issues when changing the capacity pool of a volume 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The [Dynamically change the service level of a volume](dynamic-change-volume-service-level.md) public preview registration is on hold until further notice.

|     Error condition    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| Changing the capacity pool for a volume is not permitted. | You might not be authorized yet to use this feature. <br> The feature to move a volume to another capacity pool is currently in preview. If you are using this feature for the first time, you need to register the feature first and set `-FeatureName ANFTierChange`. See the registration steps in [Dynamically change the service level of a volume](dynamic-change-volume-service-level.md). |
| The capacity pool size is too small for total volume size. |  The error is a result of the destination capacity pool not having the available capacity for the volume being moved.  <br> Increase the size of the destination pool, or choose another pool that is larger.  See [Resize a capacity pool or a volume](azure-netapp-files-resize-capacity-pools-or-volumes.md).   |
|  The pool change cannot be completed because a volume called `'{source pool name}'` already exists in the target pool `'{target pool name}'` | This error occurs because the volume with same name already exists in the target capacity pool.  Select another capacity pool that does not have a volume with same name.   |
