# Troubleshoot capacity pool issues

This article describes resolutions to issues you might have when managing capacity pools. 

## Error conditions and resolutions 

|     Error condition    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| Issues creating a capacity pool |  Make sure that the capacity pool count does not exceed the limit. See [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md).  If the count is less than the limit and you still experience issues, file a support ticket and specify the capacity pool name. |
| Issues deleting a capacity pool  |  Make sure that you remove all Azure NetApp Files volumes and snapshots in the subscription where you are trying to delete the capacity pool. <br> If you already removed all volumes and snapshots and you still cannot delete the capacity pool, references to resources might still exist without showing in the portal. In this case, file a support ticket, and specify that you have performed the above recommended steps. |
| Volume creation or modification fails with `Requested throughput not available` error | Available throughput for a volume is determined by its capacity poolâ€™s size and the service level. If you do not have sufficient throughput, you should increase the pool size or adjust the existing volume throughput. |
