# Storage hierarchy of Azure NetApp Files

Before creating a volume in Azure NetApp Files, you must purchase and set up a pool for provisioned capacity.  To set up a capacity pool, you must have a NetApp account. Understanding the storage hierarchy helps you set up and manage your Azure NetApp Files resources.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure NetApp Files currently does not support resource migration between subscriptions.

## <a name="azure_netapp_files_account"></a>NetApp accounts

- A NetApp account serves as an administrative grouping of the constituent capacity pools.  
- A NetApp account is not the same as your general Azure storage account. 
- A NetApp account is regional in scope.   
- You can have multiple NetApp accounts in a region, but each NetApp account is tied to only a single region.

## <a name="capacity_pools"></a>Capacity pools

Understanding how capacity pools work helps you select the right capacity pool types for your storage needs. 

### General rules of capacity pools

- A capacity pool is measured by its provisioned capacity.   
    See [QoS types](#qos_types) for additional information.  
- The capacity is provisioned by the fixed SKUs that you purchased (for example, a 4-TiB capacity).
- A capacity pool can have only one service level.  
- Each capacity pool can belong to only one NetApp account. However, you can have multiple capacity pools within a NetApp account.  
- A capacity pool cannot be moved across NetApp accounts.   
  For example, in the [Conceptual diagram of storage hierarchy](#conceptual_diagram_of_storage_hierarchy) below, Capacity Pool 1 cannot be moved from US East NetApp account to US West 2 NetApp account.  
- A capacity pool cannot be deleted until all volumes within the capacity pool have been deleted.

### <a name="qos_types"></a>Quality of Service (QoS) types for capacity pools

The QoS type is an attribute of a capacity pool. Azure NetApp Files provides two QoS types of capacity pools. 

- *Automatic (or auto)* QoS type  

    When you create a capacity pool, the default QoS type is auto.

    In an auto QoS capacity pool, throughput is assigned automatically to the volumes in the pool, proportional to the size quota assigned to the volumes. 

    The maximum throughput allocated to a volume depends on the service level of the capacity pool and the size quota of the volume. See [Service levels for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-service-levels.md) for example calculation.

- <a name="manual_qos_type"></a>*Manual* QoS type  

     > [!IMPORTANT] 
     > Using the manual QoS type for a capacity pool requires registration.  See [Manage a manual QoS capacity pool](manage-manual-qos-capacity-pool.md).  

    You have the option to use the manual QoS type for a capacity pool.

    In a manual QoS capacity pool, you can assign the capacity and throughput for a volume independently. The total throughput of all volumes created with a manual QoS capacity pool is limited by the total throughput of the pool.  It is determined by the combination of the pool size and the service-level throughput. 

    For instance, a 4-TiB capacity pool with the Ultra service level have a total throughput capacity of 512 MiB/s (4 TiB x 128 MiB/s/TiB) available for the volumes.


## <a name="volumes"></a>Volumes

- A volume is measured by logical capacity consumption and is scalable. 
- A volume's capacity consumption counts against its pool's provisioned capacity.
- A volume’s throughput consumption counts against its pool’s available throughput. See [Manual QoS type](#manual_qos_type).
- Each volume belongs to only one pool, but a pool can contain multiple volumes.
