# What is Azure Application Consistent Snapshot tool (preview)

Azure Application Consistent Snapshot tool (AzAcSnap) is a command-line tool that enables you to simplify data protection for third-party databases (SAP HANA) in Linux environments (for example, SUSE and RHEL).  

## Benefits of using AzAcSnap

AzAcSnap leverages the volume snapshot and replication functionalities in Azure NetApp Files and Azure Large Instance.  It provides the following benefits:

- **Application-consistent data protection**
    AzAcSnap is a centralized solution for backing up critical database files. It ensures database consistency before performing a storage volume snapshot. As a result, it ensures that the storage volume snapshot can be used for database recovery.
- **Database catalog management**
    When you use AzAcSnap with a database that has a built-in backup catalog, the records within the catalog are kept current with storage snapshots.  This capability allows a database administrator to see the backup activity.
- **Ad hoc volume protection**
    This capability is helpful for non-database volumes that don't need application quiescing before taking a storage snapshot.  Examples include SAP HANA log-backup volumes or SAPTRANS volumes.
- **Cloning of storage volumes**
    This capability provides space-efficient storage volume clones for development and test purposes.
- **Support for disaster recovery**
    AzAcSnap leverages storage volume replication to provide options for recovering replicated application-consistent snapshots at a remote site.

AzAcSnap is a single binary.  It does not need additional agents or plug-ins to interact with the database or the storage (Azure NetApp Files via Azure Resource Manager, and Azure Large Instance via SSH).  AzAcSnap must be installed on a system that has connectivity to the database and the storage.  However, the flexibility of installation and configuration allows for either a single centralized installation or a fully distributed installation with copies installed on each database installation.

## Architecture overview

AzAcSnap can be installed on the same host as the database (SAP HANA), or it can be installed on a centralized system.  But, there must be network connectivity to the database servers and the storage back-end (Azure Resource Manager for Azure NetApp Files or SSH for Azure Large Instance).

AzAcSnap is a lightweight application that is typically executed from an external scheduler.  On most Linux systems, this operation is `cron`, which is what the documentation will focus on.  But the scheduler could be an alternative tool as long as it can import the `azacsnap` user's shell profile.  Importing the user's environment settings ensures file paths and permissions are initialized correctly.

## Command synopsis

The general format of the commands is as follows:
`azacsnap -c [command] --[command] [sub-command] --[flag-name] [flag-value]`.

## Command options

The command options are as follows with the commands as the main bullets and the associated sub-commands as indented bullets:

- **`-h`** provides extended command-line help with examples on AzAcSnap usage.
- **`-c configure`** This command provides an interactive Q&A style interface to create or modify the `azacsnap` configuration file (default = `azacsnap.json`).
  - **`--configuration new`** will create a new config file.
  - **`--configuration edit`** will edit an existing config file.
  - refer to [configure command reference](azacsnap-cmd-ref-configure.md).
- **`-c test`** validates the configuration file and test connectivity.
  - **`--test hana`**  tests the connection to the SAP HANA instance.
  - **`--test storage`** tests communication with the underlying storage interface by creating a temporary storage snapshot on all the configured `data` volumes, and then removing them.
  - **`--test all`** will perform both the `hana` and `storage` tests in sequence.
  - refer to [test command reference](azacsnap-cmd-ref-test.md).
- **`-c backup`** is the primary command to execute database consistent storage snapshots for data (SAP HANA data volumes) & other (for example, shared, log backups, or boot) volumes.
  - **`--volume data`** to snapshot all the volumes in the `dataVolume` stanza of the configuration file.
  - **`--volume other`** to snapshot all the volumes in the `otherVolume` stanza of the configuration file.
  - refer to [backup command reference](azacsnap-cmd-ref-backup.md).
- **`-c details`** provides information on snapshots or replication.
  - **`--details snapshots`** Provides a list of basic details about the snapshots for each volume that has been configured.
  - **`--details replication`** Provides basic details around the replication status from the production site to the disaster-recovery site.
  - refer to [details command reference](azacsnap-cmd-ref-details.md).
- **`-c delete`** This command deletes a storage snapshot or a set of snapshots. You can use either the SAP HANA Backup ID as found in HANA Studio or the storage snapshot name. The Backup ID is only tied to the `hana` snapshots, which are created for the data and shared volumes. Otherwise, if the snapshot name is entered, it searches for all snapshots that match the entered snapshot name.
  - see the [delete](azacsnap-cmd-ref-delete.md).
- **`-c restore`** provides two methods to restore a snapshot to a volume, by either creating a new volume based on the snapshot or rolling back a volume to a preview state.
  - **`--restore snaptovol`** Creates a new volume based on the latest snapshot on the target volume.
  - **`-c restore --restore revertvolume`** Reverts the target volume to a prior state based on the most recent snapshot.
  - refer to [restore command reference](azacsnap-cmd-ref-restore.md).
- **`[--configfile <configfilename>]`** The optional  command-line parameter to provide a different JSON configuration filename.  This is particularly useful for creating a separate configuration file per SID (e.g `--configfile H80.json`).
