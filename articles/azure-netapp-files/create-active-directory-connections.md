# Create and manage Active Directory connections for Azure NetApp Files

Several features of Azure NetApp Files require that you have an Active Directory connection.  For example, you need to have an Active Directory connection before you can create an [SMB volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md) or a [dual-protocol volume](create-volumes-dual-protocol.md).  This article shows you how to create and manage Active Directory connections for Azure NetApp Files.

## Before you begin  

You must have already set up a capacity pool.   
[Set up a capacity pool](azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool.md)   
A subnet must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files.  
[Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet.md)

## Requirements for Active Directory connections

 The requirements for Active Directory connections are as follows: 

* The admin account you use must have the capability to create machine accounts in the organizational unit (OU) path that you will specify.  

* Proper ports must be open on the applicable Windows Active Directory (AD) server.  
    The required ports are as follows: 

    |     Service           |     Port     |     Protocol     |
    |-----------------------|--------------|------------------|
    |    AD Web Services    |    9389      |    TCP           |
    |    DNS                |    53        |    TCP           |
    |    DNS                |    53        |    UDP           |
    |    ICMPv4             |    N/A       |    Echo Reply    |
    |    Kerberos           |    464       |    TCP           |
    |    Kerberos           |    464       |    UDP           |
    |    Kerberos           |    88        |    TCP           |
    |    Kerberos           |    88        |    UDP           |
    |    LDAP               |    389       |    TCP           |
    |    LDAP               |    389       |    UDP           |
    |    LDAP               |    3268      |    TCP           |
    |    NetBIOS name       |    138       |    UDP           |
    |    SAM/LSA            |    445       |    TCP           |
    |    SAM/LSA            |    445       |    UDP           |
    |    w32time            |    123       |    UDP           |

* The site topology for the targeted Active Directory Domain Services must adhere to the guidelines, in particular the Azure VNet where Azure NetApp Files is deployed.  

    The address space for the virtual network where Azure NetApp Files is deployed must be added to a new or existing Active Directory site (where a domain controller reachable by Azure NetApp Files is). 

* The specified DNS servers must be reachable from the [delegated subnet](./azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet.md) of Azure NetApp Files.  

    See [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](./azure-netapp-files-network-topologies.md) for supported network topologies.

    The Network Security Groups (NSGs) and firewalls must have appropriately configured rules to allow for Active Directory and DNS traffic requests. 

* The Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet must be able to reach all Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) domain controllers in the domain, including all local and remote domain controllers. Otherwise, service interruption can occur.  

    If you have domain controllers that are unreachable by the Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet, you can specify an Active Directory site during creation of the Active Directory connection.  Azure NetApp Files needs to communicate only with domain controllers in the site where the Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet address space is.

    See [Designing the site topology](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/designing-the-site-topology) about AD sites and services. 
    
* You can enable AES encryption for AD Authentication by checking the **AES Encryption** box in the [Join Active Directory](#create-an-active-directory-connection) window. Azure NetApp Files supports DES, Kerberos AES 128, and Kerberos AES 256 encryption types (from the least secure to the most secure). If you enable AES encryption, the user credentials used to join Active Directory must have the highest corresponding account option enabled that matches the capabilities enabled for your Active Directory.    

    For example, if your Active Directory has only the AES-128 capability, you must enable the AES-128 account option for the user credentials. If your Active Directory has the AES-256 capability, you must enable the AES-256 account option (which also supports AES-128). If your Active Directory does not have any Kerberos encryption capability, Azure NetApp Files uses DES by default.  

    You can enable the account options in the properties of the Active Directory Users and Computers Microsoft Management Console (MMC):   

    ![Active Directory Users and Computers MMC](../media/azure-netapp-files/ad-users-computers-mmc.png)

* Azure NetApp Files supports [LDAP signing](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-signing-in-windows-server), which enables secure transmission of LDAP traffic between the Azure NetApp Files service and the targeted [Active Directory domain controllers](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview). If you are following the guidance of Microsoft Advisory [ADV190023](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/ADV190023) for LDAP signing, then you should enable the LDAP signing feature in Azure NetApp Files by checking the **LDAP Signing** box in the [Join Active Directory](#create-an-active-directory-connection) window. 

    [LDAP channel binding](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4034879/how-to-add-the-ldapenforcechannelbinding-registry-entry) configuration alone has no effect on the Azure NetApp Files service. However, if you use both LDAP channel binding and secure LDAP (for example, LDAPS or `start_tls`), then the SMB volume creation will fail.

* For non-AD integrated DNS, you should add a DNS A/PTR record to enable Azure NetApp Files to function by using a â€œfriendly name". 

## Decide which Domain Services to use 

Azure NetApp Files supports both [Active Directory Domain Services](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/understanding-active-directory-site-topology) (ADDS) and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS) for AD connections.  Before you create an AD connection, you need to decide whether to use ADDS or AADDS.  

For more information, see [Compare self-managed Active Directory Domain Services, Azure Active Directory, and managed Azure Active Directory Domain Services](../active-directory-domain-services/compare-identity-solutions.md). 

### Active Directory Domain Services

You can use your preferred [Active Directory Sites and Services](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/understanding-active-directory-site-topology) scope for Azure NetApp Files. This option enables reads and writes to Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) domain controllers that are [accessible by Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-network-topologies.md). It also prevents the service from communicating with domain controllers that are not in the specified Active Directory Sites and Services site. 

To find your site name when you use ADDS, you can contact the administrative group in your organization that is responsible for Active Directory Domain Services. The example below shows the Active Directory Sites and Services plugin where the site name is displayed: 

![Active Directory Sites and Services](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-active-directory-sites-services.png)

When you configure an AD connection for Azure NetApp Files, you specify the site name in scope for the **AD Site Name** field.

### Azure Active Directory Domain Services 

For Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS) configuration and guidance, see [Azure AD Domain Services documentation](../active-directory-domain-services/index.yml).

Additional AADDS considerations apply for Azure NetApp Files: 

* Ensure the VNet or subnet where AADDS is deployed is in the same Azure region as the Azure NetApp Files deployment.
* If you use another VNet in the region where Azure NetApp Files is deployed, you should create a peering between the two VNets.
* Azure NetApp Files supports `user` and `resource forest` types.
* For synchronization type, you can select `All` or `Scoped`.   
    If you select `Scoped`, ensure the correct Azure AD group is selected for accessing SMB shares.  If you are uncertain, you can use the `All` synchronization type.
* Use of the Enterprise or Premium SKU is required. The Standard SKU is not supported.

When you create an Active Directory connection, note the following specifics for AADDS:

* You can find information for **Primary DNS**, **Secondary DNS**, and **AD DNS Domain Name** in the AADDS menu.  
For DNS servers, two IP addresses will be used for configuring the Active Directory connection. 
* The **organizational unit path** is `OU=AADDC Computers`.  
This setting is configured in the **Active Directory Connections** under **NetApp Account**:

  ![Organizational unit path](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-org-unit-path.png)

* **Username** credentials can be any user that is a member of the Azure AD group **Azure AD DC Administrators**.


## Create an Active Directory connection

1. From your NetApp account, click **Active Directory connections**, then click **Join**.  

    ![Active Directory Connections](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-active-directory-connections.png)

2. In the Join Active Directory window, provide the following information, based on the Domain Services you want to use:  

    For information specific to the Domain Services you use, see [Decide which Domain Services to use](#decide-which-domain-services-to-use). 

    * **Primary DNS**  
        This is the DNS that is required for the Active Directory domain join and SMB authentication operations. 
    * **Secondary DNS**   
        This is the secondary DNS server for ensuring redundant name services. 
    * **AD DNS Domain Name**  
        This is the domain name of your Active Directory Domain Services that you want to join.
    * **AD Site Name**  
        This is the site name that the domain controller discovery will be limited to. This should match the site name in Active Directory Sites and Services.
    * **SMB server (computer account) prefix**  
        This is the naming prefix for the machine account in Active Directory that Azure NetApp Files will use for creation of new accounts.

        For example, if the naming standard that your organization uses for file servers is NAS-01, NAS-02..., NAS-045, then you would enter "NAS" for the prefix. 

        The service will create additional machine accounts in Active Directory as needed.

        > [!IMPORTANT] 
        > Renaming the SMB server prefix after you create the Active Directory connection is disruptive. You will need to re-mount existing SMB shares after renaming the SMB server prefix.

    * **Organizational unit path**  
        This is the LDAP path for the organizational unit (OU) where SMB server machine accounts will be created. That is, OU=second level, OU=first level. 

        If you are using Azure NetApp Files with Azure Active Directory Domain Services, the organizational unit path is `OU=AADDC Computers` when you configure Active Directory for your NetApp account.

        ![Join Active Directory](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-join-active-directory.png)

    * **AES Encryption**   
        Select this checkbox if you want to enable AES encryption for an SMB volume. See [Requirements for Active Directory connections](#requirements-for-active-directory-connections) for requirements. 

        ![Active Directory AES encryption](../media/azure-netapp-files/active-directory-aes-encryption.png)

        The **AES Encryption** feature is currently in preview. If this is your first time using this feature, register the feature before using it: 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFAesEncryption
        ```

        Check the status of the feature registration: 

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is `Registered` before continuing.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFAesEncryption
        ```
        
        You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

    * **LDAP Signing**   
        Select this checkbox to enable LDAP signing. This functionality enables secure LDAP lookups between the Azure NetApp Files service and the user-specified [Active Directory Domain Services domain controllers](/windows/win32/ad/active-directory-domain-services). For more information, see [ADV190023 | Microsoft Guidance for Enabling LDAP Channel Binding and LDAP Signing](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/ADV190023).  

        ![Active Directory LDAP signing](../media/azure-netapp-files/active-directory-ldap-signing.png) 

        The **LDAP Signing** feature is currently in preview. If this is your first time using this feature, register the feature before using it: 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFLdapSigning
        ```

        Check the status of the feature registration: 

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is `Registered` before continuing.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFLdapSigning
        ```
        
        You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

     * **Security privilege users**   <!-- SMB CA share feature -->   
        You can grant security privilege (`SeSecurityPrivilege`) to users that require elevated privilege to access the Azure NetApp Files volumes. The specified user accounts will be allowed to perform certain actions on Azure NetApp Files SMB shares that require security privilege not assigned by default to domain users.   

        For example, user accounts used for installing SQL Server in certain scenarios must be granted elevated security privilege. If you are using a non-administrator (domain) account to install SQL Server and the account does not have the security privilege assigned, you should add security privilege to the account.  

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The domain account used for installing SQL Server must already exist before you add it to the **Security privilege users** field. When you add the SQL Server installer's account to **Security privilege users**, the Azure NetApp Files service might validate the account by contacting the domain controller. The command might fail if it cannot contact the domain controller.  

        For more information about `SeSecurityPrivilege` and SQL Server, see [SQL Server installation fails if the Setup account doesn't have certain user rights](/troubleshoot/sql/install/installation-fails-if-remove-user-right).

        ![Screenshot showing the Security privilege users box of Active Directory connections window.](../media/azure-netapp-files/security-privilege-users.png) 

     * **Backup policy users**  
        You can include additional accounts that require elevated privileges to the computer account created for use with Azure NetApp Files. The specified accounts will be allowed to change the NTFS permissions at the file or folder level. For example, you can specify a non-privileged service account used for migrating data to an SMB file share in Azure NetApp Files.  

        ![Active Directory backup policy users](../media/azure-netapp-files/active-directory-backup-policy-users.png)

        The **Backup policy users** feature is currently in preview. If this is your first time using this feature, register the feature before using it: 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFBackupOperator
        ```

        Check the status of the feature registration: 

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is `Registered` before continuing.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFBackupOperator
        ```
        
        You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

    * Credentials, including your **username** and **password**
