# Important upcoming changes to Azure Security Center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information on this page relates to pre-release products or features, which may be substantially modified before they are commercially released, if ever. Microsoft makes no commitments or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

On this page, you'll learn about changes that are planned for Security Center. It describes planned modifications to the product that might impact things like your secure score or workflows.

If you're looking for the latest release notes, you'll find them in the [What's new in Azure Security Center](release-notes.md).


## Planned changes

- ["Not applicable" resources to be reported as "Compliant" in Azure Policy assessments](#not-applicable-resources-to-be-reported-as-compliant-in-azure-policy-assessments)
- [35 preview recommendations added to increase coverage of Azure Security Benchmark](#35-preview-recommendations-being-added-to-increase-coverage-of-azure-security-benchmark)

### "Not applicable" resources to be reported as "Compliant" in Azure Policy assessments

**Estimated date for change:** January 2021

Currently, resources that are evaluated for a recommendation and found to be **not applicable** appear in Azure Policy as "Non-compliant". No user actions can change their state to "Compliant". From this planned change, they'll be reported as "Compliant" for improved clarity.

The only impact will be seen in Azure Policy where the number of compliant resources will increase. There will be no impact to your secure score in Azure Security Center.

### 35 preview recommendations being added to increase coverage of Azure Security Benchmark

**Estimated date for change:** December 2020

Azure Security Benchmark is the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. [Learn more about Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/introduction.md).

The following 35 preview recommendations will be added to Security Center to increase the coverage of this benchmark.

Preview recommendations don't render a resource unhealthy, and they aren't included in the calculations of your secure score. Remediate them wherever possible, so that when the preview period ends they'll contribute towards your score. Learn more about how to respond to these recommendations in [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).
