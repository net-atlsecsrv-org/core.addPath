We're releasing an enhanced version of the **System updates should be installed on your machines** recommendation. The new version will *replace* the current version in the apply system updates security control and brings the following improvements:

- Sub-recommendations for each missing update
- A redesigned experience in the Azure Security Center pages of the Azure portal
- Enriched data for the recommendation from Azure Resource Graph

#### Transition period

There will be a transition period of 36 hrs (approximately). To minimize any potential disruption, we've scheduled the update to take place over a weekend. During the transition, your secure scores might be affected.

#### Redesigned portal experience

The recommendation details page for **System updates should be installed on your machines** includes the list of findings as shown below. When you select a single finding, the details pane opens with a link to the remediation information and a list of affected resources.

#### Richer data from Azure Resource Graph

Azure Resource Graph is a service in Azure that is designed to provide efficient resource exploration. You can use ARG to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions so that you can effectively govern your environment. 

For Azure Security Center, you can use ARG and the [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) to query a wide range of security posture data.

If you query the current version of **System updates should be installed on your machines**, the only information available from ARG is that the recommendation needs to be remediated on a machine. When the updated version is released, the following query will return each missing system updates grouped by machine.

```kusto
securityresources
| where type =~ "microsoft.security/assessments/subassessments"
| where extract(@"(?i)providers/Microsoft.Security/assessments/([^/]*)", 1, id) == "4ab6e3c5-74dd-8b35-9ab9-f61b30875b27"
| where properties.status.code == "Unhealthy"
```
