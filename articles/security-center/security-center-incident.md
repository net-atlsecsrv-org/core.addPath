# Manage security incidents in Azure Security Center

Triage and investigating security alerts can be time consuming for even the most skilled security analysts, and for many it is hard to even know where to begin. By using [analytics](security-center-detection-capabilities.md) to connect the information between distinct [security alerts](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md), Security Center can provide you with a single view of an attack campaign and all of the related alerts â€“ you can quickly understand what actions the attacker took and what resources were impacted.

This topic explains about incidents in Security Center, and how to use remediate their alerts.

## What is a security incident?

In Security Center, a security incident is an aggregation of all alerts for a resource that align with [kill chain](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office365security/addressing-your-cxos-top-five-cloud-security-concerns/) patterns. Incidents appear in the [Security Alerts](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md) list. Click on an incident to view the related alerts, which enables you to obtain more information about each occurrence.

## Managing security incidents
