# Protect your Kubernetes workloads

This page describes how to use Azure Security Center's set of security recommendations dedicated to Kubernetes workload protection.

Learn more about these features in [Workload protection best-practices using Kubernetes admission control](container-security.md#workload-protection-best-practices-using-kubernetes-admission-control)

Security Center offers more container security features if you enable Azure Defender. Specifically:

- Scan your container registries for vulnerabilities with [Azure Defender for container registries](defender-for-container-registries-introduction.md)
- Get real-time threat detection alerts for your K8s clusters [Azure Defender for Kubernetes](defender-for-kubernetes-introduction.md)

> [!TIP]
> For a list of *all* security recommendations that might appear for Kubernetes clusters and nodes, see the [container section](recommendations-reference.md#recs-containers) of the recommendations reference table.

## Set up your workload protection

Azure Security Center includes a bundle of recommendations that are available when you've installed the **Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes**.

1. To configure the recommendations, first you must install the add on:

    1. From the recommendations page, search for the recommendation named **Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes should be installed and enabled on your clusters**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/defender-for-kubernetes-usage/recommendation-to-install-policy-add-on-for-kubernetes.png" alt-text="Recommendation **Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes should be installed and enabled on your clusters**":::

        > [!TIP]
        > The recommendation is included in five different security controls and it doesn't matter which one you select in the next step.

    1. From any of the security controls, select the recommendation to see the resources on which you can install the add on, and select **Remediate**. 

        :::image type="content" source="./media/defender-for-kubernetes-usage/recommendation-to-install-policy-add-on-for-kubernetes-details.png" alt-text="Recommendation details page for **Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes should be installed and enabled on your clusters**":::

1. Approximately 30 minutes after the add-on installation completes, Security Center shows the clusters’ health status for the following recommendations, each in the relevant security control as shown:

    > [!TIP]
    > Some recommendations have parameters that must be customized via Azure Policy to use them effectively. For example, to benefit from the recommendation **Container images should be deployed only from trusted registries**, you'll have to define your trusted registries.
    > 
    > If you don't enter the necessary parameters for the recommendations that require configuration, your workloads will be shown as unhealthy.

1. For the recommendations with parameters must be customized, set the parameters:

    1. From Security Center's menu, select **Security policy**.
    1. Select the relevant subscription.
    1. From the **Security Center default policy** section, select **View effective policy**.
    1. Select "ASC Default".
    1. Open the **Parameters** tab and modify the values as required.
    1. Select **Review + save**.
    1. Select **Save**.


1. To enforce any of the recommendations, 

    1. Open the recommendation details page and select **Deny**:

        :::image type="content" source="./media/defender-for-kubernetes-usage/enforce-workload-protection-example.png" alt-text="Deny option for Azure Policy parameter":::

        This will open the pane where you set the scope. 

    1. When you've set the scope, select **Change to deny**.

1. To see which recommendations apply to your clusters:

    1. Open Security Center's [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md) page and use the resource type filter to **Kubernetes services**.

    1. Select a cluster to investigate and review the available recommendations available for it. 

1. When viewing a recommendation from the workload protection set, you'll see the number of affected pods ("Kubernetes components") listed alongside the cluster. For a list of the specific pods, select the cluster and then select **Take action**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/defender-for-kubernetes-usage/view-affected-pods-for-recommendation.gif" alt-text="Viewing the affected pods for a K8s recommendation"::: 

1. To test the enforcement, use the two Kubernetes deployments below:

    - One is for a healthy deployment, compliant with the bundle of workload protection recommendations.
    - The other is for an unhealthy deployment, non-compliant with *any* of the recommendations.

    Deploy the example .yaml files as-is, or use them as a reference to remediate your own workload (step VIII)
