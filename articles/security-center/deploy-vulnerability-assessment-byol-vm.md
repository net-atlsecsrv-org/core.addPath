# Deploy a bring your own license (BYOL) vulnerability assessment solution

If you've enabled **Azure Defender for servers**, you're able to use Azure Security Center's built-in vulnerability assessment tool as described in [Integrated vulnerability scanner for virtual machines](./deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm.md). This tool is integrated into Azure Defender and doesn't require any external licenses - everything's handled seamlessly inside Security Center. In addition, the integrated scanner supports Azure Arc enabled machines.

Alternatively, you might want to deploy your own privately-licensed vulnerability assessment solution from [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/lp/azure) or [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/). You can install one of these partner solutions on multiple VMs belonging to the same subscription (but not to Azure Arc enabled machines).

## Deploy a BYOL solution from the Azure portal

The BYOL options refer to supported third-party vulnerability assessment solutions. Currently both Qualys and Rapid7 are supported providers.

Supported solutions report vulnerability data to the partner's management platform. In turn, that platform provides vulnerability and health monitoring data back to Security Center. You can identify vulnerable VMs on the Security Center dashboard and switch to the partner management console directly from Security Center for additional reports and information.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/), open **Security Center**.

1. From Security Center's menu, open the **Recommendations** page.

1. Select the recommendation **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm/recommendation-page-machine-groupings.png" alt-text="The groupings of the machines in the **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines** recommendation page" lightbox="./media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm/recommendation-page-machine-groupings.png":::

    Your VMs will appear in one or more of the following groups:

    * **Healthy resources** – Security Center has detected a vulnerability assessment solution running on these VMs.
    * **Unhealthy resources** – A vulnerability scanner extension can be deployed to these VMs. 
    * **Not applicable resources** – these VMs can't have a vulnerability scanner extension deployed.

1. From the list of unhealthy machines, select the ones to receive a vulnerability assessment solution and select **Remediate**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > Depending on your configuration, you may only see a subset of this list. 
    >
    > - If you haven't got a third-party vulnerability scanner configured, you won't be offered the opportunity to deploy it.
    > - If your selected VMs aren't protected with Azure Defender, the ASC integrated vulnerability scanner option will be unavailable.

1. If you're setting up a new BYOL configuration, select **Configure a new third-party vulnerability scanner**, select the relevant extension, select **Proceed**, and enter the details from the provider as follows:

    1. For **Resource group**, select **Use existing**.
    1. For **Location**, select where the solution is geographically located.
    1. For Qualys, enter the license provided by Qualys into the **License code** field.
    1. For Rapid7, upload the **Rapid7 Configuration File**.
    1. In the **Public key** box, enter the public key information provided by the partner.
    1. To automatically install this vulnerability assessment agent on all discovered VMs in the subscription of this solution, select **Auto deploy**.
    1. Select **OK**.

1. If you've already set up your BYOL solution, select **Deploy your configured third-party vulnerability scanner**, select the relevant extension, and select **Proceed**.

After the vulnerability assessment solution is installed on the target machines, Security Center performs a scan to detect and identify vulnerabilities in the system and application. It might take a couple of hours for the first scan to complete. After that, it runs hourly.



## Deploy a BYOL solution using PowerShell and the REST API

To programatically deploy your own privately licensed vulnerability assessment solution from [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/lp/azure) or [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/), use the supplied script [PowerShell > Vulnerability Solution](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/tree/master/Powershell%20scripts/Vulnerability%20Solution). This script uses the REST API to create a new security solution in ASC. You'll need a license and a key provided by your service provider (Qualys or Rapid7).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Only one solution can be created per license. Attempting to create another solution using the same name/license/key will fail.

### Prerequisites

Required PowerShell modules:

- Install-module Az
- Install-module Az.security

### Run the script

To run the script, you'll need the relevant information for the parameters below.

| **Parameter** | **Required** | **Notes** |
|----|:----:|----|
|**SubscriptionId**|✔|The subscriptionID of the Azure Subscription that contains the resources you want to analyze.|
|**ResourceGroupName**|✔|Name of the resource group. Use any existing resource group including the default ("DefaultResourceGroup-xxx"). Since the solution isn't an Azure resource, it won't be listed under the resource group, but still it is attached to it.|
|**vaSolutionName**|✔|The name of the new solution.|
|**vaType**|✔|Qualys or Rapid7.|
|**licenceCode**|✔|Vendor provided license string.|
|**publicKey**|✔|Vendor provided public key.|
|**autoUpdate**|-|Enable (true) or disable (false) auto deploy for this VA solution. When enabled, every new VM on the subscription will automatically attempt to link to the solution.<br/>(Default: False)|
||||

Syntax:

```azurepowershell
.\New-ASCVASolution.ps1 -subscriptionId <Subscription Id> -resourceGroupName <RG Name>
-vaSolutionName <New solution name> -vaType <Qualys / Rapid7> -autoUpdate <true/false>
-licenceCode <License code from vendor> -publicKey <Public Key received from vendor>
```

Example (this example doesn't include valid license details):

```azurepowershell
.\New-ASCVASolution.ps1 -subscriptionId 'f4cx1b69-dtgb-4ch6-6y6f-ea2e95373d3b' -resourceGroupName 'DefaultResourceGroup-WEU' -vaSolutionName 'QualysVa001' -vaType 'Qualys' -autoUpdate 'false' `
-licenceCode 'eyJjaWQiOiJkZDg5OTYzXe4iMTMzLWM4NTAtODM5FD2mZWM1N2Q3ZGU5MjgiLCJgbTYuOiIyMmM5NDg3MS1lNTVkLTQ1OGItYjhlMC03OTRhMmM3YWM1ZGQiLCJwd3NVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3FhZ3B1YmxpYy1wMDEuaW50LnF1YWx5cy5jb20vQ2xvdSKJY6VudC8iLCJwd3NQb3J0IjoiNDQzIn0=' `
-publicKey 'MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCOiOLXjOywMfLZIBGPZLwSocf1Q64GASLK9OHFEmanBl1nkJhZDrZ4YD5lM98fThYbAx1Rde2iYV1ze/wDlX4cIvFAyXuN7HbdkeIlBl6vWXEBZpUU17bOdJOUGolzEzNBhtxi/elEZLghq9Chmah82me/okGMIhJJsCiTtglVQIDAQAB'
```

## FAQ - BYOL vulnerability scanner

### If I deploy a Qualys agent, what communications settings are required?

The Qualys Cloud Agent is designed to communicate with Qualys's SOC at regular intervals for updates, and to perform the various operations required for product functionality. To allow the agent to communicate seamlessly with the SOC, configure your network security to allow inbound and outbound traffic to the Qualys SOC CIDR and URLs.

There are multiple Qualys platforms across various geographic locations. The SOC CIDR and URLs will differ depending on the host platform of your Qualys subscription. To identify your Qualys host platform, use this page https://www.qualys.com/platform-identification/.
