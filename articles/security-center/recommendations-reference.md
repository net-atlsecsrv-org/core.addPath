# Security recommendations - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Azure Security Center. The recommendations shown in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

Security Center's recommendations are based on best practices. Some are aligned with the **Azure Security Benchmark**, the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. [Learn more about Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/introduction).

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).

Your Secure Score is based on the number of Security Center recommendations you've completed. To decide which  recommendations to resolve first, look at the severity of each one and its potential impact on your Secure Score.

>[!TIP]
> If a recommendation's description says "No related policy", it's usually because that recommendation is dependent on a different recommendation and *its* policy. For example, the recommendation "Endpoint protection health failures should be remediated...", relies on the recommendation that checks whether an endpoint protection solution is even *installed* ("Endpoint protection solution should be installed..."). The underlying recommendation *does* have a policy. Limiting the policies to only the foundational recommendation simplifies policy management.

|Recommendation|Description & related policy|Severity|Quick fix enabled?([Learn more](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md#quick-fix-remediation))|Resource type|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|**Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines**|Azure Security Center has analyzed the internet traffic communication patterns of the virtual machines listed below, and determined that the existing rules in the NSGs associated to them are overly permissive, resulting in an increased potential attack surface.<br>This typically occurs when this IP address doesn't communicate regularly with this resource. Alternatively, the IP address has been flagged as malicious by Security Center's threat intelligence sources.<br>(Related policy: Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**All Internet traffic should be routed via your deployed Azure Firewall**|Azure Security Center has identified that some of your subnets aren't protected with a next generation firewall. Protect your subnets from potential threats by restricting access to them with Azure Firewall or a supported next generation firewall.<br>(Related policy: [Preview] All Internet traffic should be routed via your deployed Azure Firewall)|High|N|Subnet|
|**All network ports should be restricted on NSG associated to your VM**|Harden the network security groups of your Internet-facing VMs by restricting the access of your existing allow rules.<br>This recommendation is triggered when any port is opened to *all* sources (except for ports 22, 3389, 5985, 5986, 80, and 1443).<br>(Related policy: Access through internet facing endpoint should be restricted)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled**|Protect virtual networks containing applications with public IPs by enabling DDoS protection service standard. DDoS protection enables mitigation of network volumetric and protocol attacks.<br>(Related policy: DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled)|High|N|Virtual network|
|**Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS**|Enable "HTTPS only" access for function apps. Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.<br>(Related policy: Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS)|Medium|**Y**|Function app|
|**Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with Network Security Groups**|Enable Network Security Groups to control network access of your virtual machines.<br>(Related policy: Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with Network Security Groups)|High/ Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**Non-internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups**|    Protect your non-internet-facing virtual machines from potential threats by restricting access to them with network security groups (NSG).<br>NSGs contain access-control lists (ACL) and can be assigned to the VM's NIC or subnet. The ACL rules allow or deny network traffic to the assigned resource.<br>(Related policy: Non-internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups)|Low|N|Virtual machine|
|**IP forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled**|Disable IP forwarding. When IP forwarding is enabled on a virtual machine's NIC, the machine can receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (for example, when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled)|Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control**|Apply just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access control to permanently lock down access to selected ports, and enable authorized users to open them, via JIT, for a limited amount of time only.<br>(Related policy: Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines**|Harden the network security group of your virtual machines to restrict access to management ports.<br>(Related policy: Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled**|Enable secure transfer to storage accounts. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.<br>(Related policy: Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled)|High|**Y**|Storage account|
|**Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group**|Enable network security groups to control network access of resources deployed in your subnets.<br>(Related policy: Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group.<br>This policy is disabled by default)|High/ Medium|N|Subnet|
|**Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS**|Enable "HTTPS only" access for web applications. Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.<br>(Related policy: Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS)|Medium|**Y**|Web application|

|Recommendation|Description & related policy|Severity|Quick fix enabled?([Learn more](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md#quick-fix-remediation))|Resource type|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|**Azure Defender for container registries should be enabled**|To build secure containerized workloads, ensure the images that they're based on are free of known vulnerabilities. Azure Defender for container registries scans your registry for security vulnerabilities on each pushed container image and exposes detailed findings per image.<br>Important: Remediating this recommendation will result in charges for protecting your ACR registries. If you don't have any ACR registries in this subscription, no charges will be incurred. If you create any ACR registries on this subscription in the future, they will automatically be protected and charges will begin at that time.<br>(Related policy: [Advanced threat protection should be enabled on Azure Container Registry registries](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fc25d9a16-bc35-4e15-a7e5-9db606bf9ed4))|High|**Y**|Subscription|
|**Azure Defender for Kubernetes should be enabled**|Azure Defender for Kubernetes provides real-time threat protection for your containerized environments and generates alerts for suspicious activities. You can use this information to quickly remediate security issues and improve the security of your containers.<br>Important: Remediating this recommendation will result in charges for protecting your AKS clusters. If you don't have any AKS clusters in this subscription, no charges will be incurred. If you create any AKS clusters on this subscription in the future, they will automatically be protected and charges will begin at that time.<br>(Related policy: [Advanced threat protection should be enabled on Azure Kubernetes Service clusters](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f523b5cd1-3e23-492f-a539-13118b6d1e3a))|High|**Y**|Subscription|
|**Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services**|Restrict access to the Kubernetes service management API by granting API access only to IP addresses in specific ranges. It is recommended to configure authorized IP ranges so only applications from allowed networks can access the cluster.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services)|High|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes should be installed and enabled on your clusters (preview)**|Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes extends Gatekeeper v3, an admission controller webhook for Open Policy Agent (OPA), to apply at-scale automountServiceAccountToken enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. <br>Security Center requires the add-on to audit and enforce security capabilities and compliance inside your clusters. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes).<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Azure Policy add-on for Kubernetes should be installed and enabled on your clusters)|High|**Y**|Kubernetes Service|
|**Container CPU and memory limits should be enforced (preview)**|Enforcing CPU and memory limits prevents resource exhaustion attacks (a form of denial of service attack).<br>We recommend setting limits for containers to ensure the runtime prevents the container from using more than the configured resource limit.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Ensure container CPU and memory resource limits do not exceed the specified limits in Kubernetes cluster)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Container images should be deployed from trusted registries only (preview)**|Images running on your Kubernetes cluster should come from known and monitored container image registries.<br>Trusted registries reduce your cluster exposure risk by limiting the potential for the introduction of unknown vulnerabilities, security issues, and malicious images.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Ensure only allowed container images in Kubernetes cluster)|High|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Container with privilege escalation should be avoided (preview)**|Containers shouldn't run with privilege escalation to root in your Kubernetes cluster.<br>The AllowPrivilegeEscalation attribute controls whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process. <br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes clusters should not allow container privilege escalation)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Containers sharing sensitive host namespaces should be avoided (preview)**|To protect against privilege escalation outside the container, avoid pod access to sensitive host namespaces (host process ID and host IPC) in a Kubernetes cluster ​. <br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster containers should not share host process ID or host IPC namespace)|Medium| No|Kubernetes cluster|
|**Containers should listen on allowed ports only (preview)**|To reduce the attack surface of your Kubernetes cluster, restrict access to the cluster by limiting containers’ access to the configured ports.. <br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Ensure containers listen only on allowed ports in Kubernetes cluster)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Immutable (read-only) root filesystem should be enforced for containers (preview)**|Containers should run with a read only root file system in your Kubernetes cluster.<br>Immutable filesystem protects containers from changes at run-time with malicious binaries being added to PATH.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster containers should run with a read only root file system)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Least privileged Linux capabilities should be enforced for containers (preview)**|To reduce attack surface of your container, restrict Linux capabilities and grant specific privileges to containers without granting all the privileges of the root user.<br>We recommend dropping all capabilities, then adding those that are required.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed capabilities)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Overriding or disabling of containers AppArmor profile should be restricted (preview)**|Containers running on your Kubernetes cluster should be limited to allowed AppArmor profiles only.<br>AppArmor (Application Armor) is a Linux security module that protects an operating system and its applications from security threats. To use it, a system administrator associates an AppArmor security profile with each program. <br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed AppArmor profiles)|High|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Privileged containers should be avoided (preview)**|To prevent unrestricted host access, avoid privileged containers whenever possible.<br>Privileged containers have all of the root capabilities of a host machine. They can be used as entry points for attacks, and to spread malicious code or malware to compromised applications, hosts, and networks. <br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Do not allow privileged containers in Kubernetes cluster)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Role-Based Access Control should be used to restrict access to a Kubernetes Service Cluster**|To provide granular filtering of the actions that users can perform, use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions in Kubernetes Service Clusters and configure relevant authorization policies. For more information see [Azure role-based access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-identity#role-based-access-controls-rbac).<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be used on Kubernetes Services)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Running containers as root user should be avoided (preview)**|Containers should run as a non-root users in your Kubernetes cluster. <br>Running a process as the root user inside a container runs it as root on the host. <br>In case of compromise, an attacker has root in the container, and any misconfigurations become easier to exploit.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster containers should run as a non-root users)|High|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Services should listen on allowed ports only (preview)**|To reduce the attack surface of your Kubernetes cluster, restrict access to the cluster by limiting services’ access to the configured ports.. <br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Ensure services listen only on allowed ports in Kubernetes cluster)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**The Kubernetes Service should be upgraded to the latest Kubernetes version**|Upgrade Azure Kubernetes Service clusters to the latest Kubernetes version in order to benefit from up-to-date vulnerability patches. For details regarding specific Kubernetes vulnerabilities see [Kubernetes CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=kubernetes).<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes Services should be upgraded to a non-vulnerable Kubernetes version)|High|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Usage of host networking and ports should be restricted (preview)**|Restrict pod access to the host network and the allowable host port range in a Kubernetes cluster.<br>Pods created with the hostNetwork attribute enabled will share the node’s network space. To avoid compromised container from sniffing network traffic, we recommend not putting your pods on the host network. If you need to expose a container port on the node’s network, and using a Kubernetes Service node port does not meet your needs, another possibility is to specify a hostPort for the container in the pod spec.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster pods should only use approved host network and port range)|Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Usage of pod HostPath volume mounts should be restricted to a known list (preview)**|To reduce the attack surface of your Kubernetes cluster, limitipod HostPath volume mounts in your Kubernetes cluster to the configured allowed host paths.<br>In case of compromise, the container node access from the containers should be restricted.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Kubernetes cluster pod hostPath volumes should only use allowed host paths)| Medium|N|Kubernetes Service|
|**Vulnerabilities in Azure Container Registry images should be remediated (powered by Qualys)**|Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for security vulnerabilities on each pushed container image and exposes detailed findings per image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks.<br>(No related policy)|High|N|Container Registry|

Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) leverages the industry standard BitLocker feature of Windows and the DM-Crypt feature of Linux to provide OS and data disk encryption to help protect and safeguard your data and help meet your organizational security and compliance commitments in customer Azure key vault. When your compliance and security requirement requires you to encrypt the data end to end using your encryption keys, including encryption of the ephemeral (locally attached temporary) disk, use Azure disk encryption.

| **Log Analytics agent health issues should be resolved on your machines**                                 | Security Center uses the Log Analytics agent, formerly known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA).   To make sure your virtual machines are successfully monitored, you need to make sure the agent is both installed on the virtual machines and properly collects security events to the configured workspace. In some cases, the agent may fail to properly report security events, due to multiple reasons. In these cases, coverage may be partial - security events won't be properly processed, and in turn threat detection for the affected VMs may fail to function.
