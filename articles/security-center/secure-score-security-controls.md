# Enhanced secure score in Azure Security Center

## Introduction to secure score

Azure Security Center has two main goals: to help you understand your current security situation, and to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security. The central aspect of Security Center that enables you to achieve those goals is secure score.

Security Center continually assesses your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

The secure score page of Security Center includes:

- **The score** - The secure score is shown as a percentage value, but the underlying values are also clear:

    [![Secure score shown as a percentage value with the underlying numbers clear too](media/secure-score-security-controls/secure-score-with-percentage.png)](media/secure-score-security-controls/secure-score-with-percentage.png#lightbox)

- **Security controls** - Each control is a logical group of related security recommendations, and reflects your vulnerable attack surfaces. A control is a set of security recommendations, with instructions that help you implement those recommendations. Your score only improves when you remediate *all* of the recommendations for a single resource within a control.

    To immediately see how well your organization is securing each individual attack surface, review the scores for each security control.

    For more information, see [How your secure score is calculated](secure-score-security-controls.md#how-your-secure-score-is-calculated) below. 


>[!TIP]
> Earlier versions of Security Center awarded points at the recommendation level: when you remediated a recommendation for a single resource, your secure score improved. 
> Today, your score only improves if you remediate *all* of the recommendations for a single resource within a control. So your score only improves when you've improved the security of a resource.


## Accessing your secure score

You can find your overall secure score, as well as your score per subscription, through the Azure portal or programatically with the Azure Security Center REST API.

### Getting your secure score from the portal

Security Center displays your score prominently in the portal: it's the first thing shown in the Overview page. If you click through to the dedicated secure score page, you'll see the score broken down by subscription. Click a single subscription to see the detailed list of prioritized recommendations and the potential impact that remediating them will have on the subscription's score.

![Overall secure score as shown in the portal](media/secure-score-security-controls/single-secure-score-via-ui.png)

### Getting your secure score from the REST API

You can access your score via the [secure score API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/securescores/) (currently in preview). The API methods provide the flexibility to query the data and build your own reporting mechanism of your secure scores over time. For example, you can use the **Secure Scores** API to get the score for a specific subscription. In addition, you can use the **Secure Score Controls** API to list the security controls and the current score of your subscriptions.

![Retrieving a single secure score via the API](media/secure-score-security-controls/single-secure-score-via-api.png)

For examples of tools built on top of the secure score API, see [the secure score area of our GitHub community](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/tree/master/Secure%20Score). 

## How your secure score is calculated 

The contribution of each security control towards the overall secure score is shown clearly on the recommendations page.

[![The enhanced secure score introduces security controls](media/secure-score-security-controls/security-controls.png)](media/secure-score-security-controls/security-controls.png#lightbox)

To get all the possible points for a security control, all your resources must comply with all of the security recommendations within the security control. For example, Security Center has multiple recommendations regarding how to secure your management ports. In the past, you could remediate some of those related and interdependent recommendations while leaving others unsolved, and your secure score would improve. When looked at objectively, it's easy to argue that your security hadn't improved until you had resolved them all. Now, you must remediate them all to make a difference to your secure score.

For example, the security control called "Apply system updates" has a maximum score of six points, which you can see in the tooltip on the potential increase value of the control:

[![The security control "Apply system updates"](media/secure-score-security-controls/apply-system-updates-control.png)](media/secure-score-security-controls/apply-system-updates-control.png#lightbox)

The maximum score for this control, Apply system updates, is always 6. In this example, there are 50 resources. So we divide the max score by 50, and the result is that every resource contributes 0.12 points. 

* **Potential increase** (0.12 x 8 unhealthy resources = 0.96) - The remaining points available to you within the control. If you remediate all the recommendations in this control, your score will increase by 2% (in this case, 0.96 points rounded up to 1 point). 
* **Current score** (0.12 x 42 healthy resources = 5.04) - The current score for this control. Each control contributes towards the total score. In this example, the control is contributing 5.04 points to current secure total.
* **Max score** - The maximum number of points you can gain by completing all recommendations within a control. The maximum score for a control indicates the relative significance of that control. Use the max score values to triage the issues to work on first. 


### Calculations - understanding your score

|Metric|Formula and example|
|-|-|
|**Security control's current score**|<br>![Equation for calculating a security control's current score](media/secure-score-security-controls/security-control-scoring-equation.png)<br><br>Each individual security control contributes towards the Security Score. Each resource affected by a recommendation within the control, contributes towards the control's current score. The current score for each control is a measure of the status of the resources *within* the control.<br>![Tooltips showing the values used when calculating the security control's current score](media/secure-score-security-controls/security-control-scoring-tooltips.png)<br>In this example, the max score of 6 would be divided by 78 because that's the sum of the healthy and unhealthy resources.<br>6 / 78 = 0.0769<br>Multiplying that by the number of healthy resources (4) results in the current score:<br>0.0769 * 4 = **0.31**<br><br>|
|**Secure score**<br>Single subscription|<br>![Equation for calculating the current secure score](media/secure-score-security-controls/secure-score-equation.png)<br><br>![Single subscription secure score with all controls enabled](media/secure-score-security-controls/secure-score-example-single-sub.png)<br>In this example, there is a single subscription with all security controls available (a potential maximum score of 60 points). The score shows 28 points out of a possible 60 and the remaining 32 points are reflected in the "Potential score increase" figures of the security controls.<br>![List of controls and the potential score increase](media/secure-score-security-controls/secure-score-example-single-sub-recs.png)|
|**Secure score**<br>Multiple subscriptions|<br>The current scores for all resources across all subscriptions are added and the calculation is then the same as for a single subscription<br><br>When viewing multiple subscriptions, secure score evaluates all resources within all enabled policies and groups their combined impact on each security control's maximum score.<br>![Secure score for multiple subscriptions with all controls enabled](media/secure-score-security-controls/secure-score-example-multiple-subs.png)<br>The combined score is **not** an average; rather it's the evaluated posture of the status of all resources across all subscriptions.<br>Here too, if you go to the recommendations page and add up the potential points available, you will find that it's the difference between the current score (24) and the maximum score available (60).|

## Improving your secure score

To improve your secure score, remediate security recommendations from your recommendations list. You can remediate each recommendation manually for each resource, or by using the **Quick Fix!** option (when available) to apply a remediation for a recommendation to a group of resources quickly. For more information, see [Remediate recommendations](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Only built-in recommendations have an impact on the secure score.


## Security controls and their recommendations

The table below lists the security controls in Azure Security Center. For each control, you can see the maximum number of points you can add to your secure score if you remediate *all* of the recommendations listed in the control, for *all* of your resources.

That encryption key is also used to decrypt that data as it is readied for use in memory. Keys must be stored in a secure location with identity-based access control and audit policies. One such secure location is Azure Key Vault. If an attacker obtains the encrypted data but not the encryption keys, the attacker can't access the data without breaking the encryption.</td>

## Secure score FAQ

### Why has my secure score gone down?
Security Center has switched to an enhanced secure score which includes changes in the way the score is calculated. Now, you must solve all recommendation for a resource to receive points. The scores also changed to a scale of 0-10.

### If I address only three out of four recommendations in a security control, will my secure score change?
No. It won't change until you remediate all of the recommendations for a single resource. To get the maximum score for a control, you must remediate all recommendations, for all resources.

### Is the previous experience of the secure score still available? 
No. For a while they ran side by side to ease the transition. The previous model has now been deprecated. 

### If a recommendation isn't applicable to me, and I disable it in the policy, will my security control be fulfilled and my secure score updated?
Yes. We recommend disabling recommendations when they're inapplicable in your environment. For instructions on how to disable a specific recommendation, see [Disable security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies).

### If a security control offers me zero points towards my secure score, should I ignore it?
In some cases, you'll see a control max score greater than zero, but the impact is zero. When the incremental score for fixing resources is negligible, it's rounded to zero. Don't ignore these recommendations as they still bring security improvements. The only exception is the "Additional Best Practice" control. Remediating these recommendations won't increase your score, but it will enhance your overall security.
