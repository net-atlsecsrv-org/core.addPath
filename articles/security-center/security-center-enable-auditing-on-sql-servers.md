# Enable auditing and threat detection on SQL servers in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center will recommend that you turn on auditing and threat detection for all databases on your Azure SQL servers if auditing is not already enabled. Auditing and threat detection can help you maintain regulatory compliance, understand database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations.

Once you’ve turned on auditing you can configure Threat Detection settings and emails to receive security alerts. Threat Detection detects anomalous database activities indicating potential security threats to the database. This enables you to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur.

This recommendation applies to the Azure SQL service only; it doesn’t include SQL Server running on your virtual machines in Azure Infrastructure Services (Azure IaaS).

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Enable Auditing & Threat detection on SQL servers**.  This opens the **Enable Auditing & Threat detection on SQL servers** blade.

   ![Enable auditing on SQL servers][1]
2. Select a SQL server to enable auditing and threat detection on. This opens the **Auditing & Threat Detection** blade.

3. On the **Auditing & Threat Detection** blade, select **ON** under **Auditing**.

   ![Turn on auditing settings][2]
4. Follow the steps in [SQL database auditing in the Azure portal](../sql-database/sql-database-auditing-portal.md) to configure storage where your audit logs will be stored. The subscription's storage account for data collection is the default storage account.
5. Follow the steps in [Get started with SQL Database Threat Detection](../sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection.md) to turn on and configure Threat Detection and to configure the list of emails that will receive security alerts upon detection of anomalous activities.
