#  Connect your GCP accounts to Azure Security Center

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same.

Azure Security Center protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Onboarding your GCP account into Security Center, integrates GCP Security Command and Azure Security Center. Security Center thus provides visibility and protection across both of these cloud environments to provide:

- Detection of security misconfigurations
- A single view showing Security Center recommendations and GCP Security Command Center findings
- Incorporation of your GCP resources into Security Center's secure score calculations
- Integration of GCP Security Command Center recommendations based on the CIS standard into the Security Center's regulatory compliance dashboard

In the screenshot below you can see GCP projects displayed in Security Center's overview dashboard.

## Connect your GCP account

### Step 1. Set up GCP Security Command Center with Security Health Analytics

For all the GCP projects in your organization, you must also:

1. Set up **GCP Security Command Center** using [these instructions from the GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-scc-setup).
1. Enable **Security Health Analytics** using [these instructions from the GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-use-security-health-analytics).
1. Verify that there is data flowing to the Security Command Center.

The instructions for connecting your GCP environment for security configuration follow Google's recommendations for consuming security configuration recommendations. The integration leverages Google Security Command Center and will consume additional resources that might impact your billing.

When you first enable Security Health Analytics, it might take several hours for data to be available.


### Step 2. Enable GCP Security Command Center API

1. From Google's **Cloud Console API Library**, select the project you want to connect to Azure Security Center.
1. In the API Library, find and select **Security Command Center API**.
1. On the API's page, select **ENABLE**.

Learn more about the [Security Command Center API](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/).


### Step 3. Create a dedicated service account for the security configuration integration

1. In the **GCP Console**, select the project you want to connect to Security Center.
1. In the **Navigation menu**, Under **IAM & admin** options, select **Service accounts**.
1. Select **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
1. Enter an account name, and select **Create**.
1. Specify the **Role** as **Security Center Admin Viewer**, and select **Continue**.
1. The **Grant users access to this service account** section is optional. Select **Done**.
1. Copy the **Email value** of the created service account, and save it for later use.
1. In the **Navigation menu**, Under **IAM & admin** options, select **IAM**
    1. Switch to organization level.
    1. Select **ADD**.
    1. In the **New members** field, paste the **Email value** you copied earlier.
    1. Specify the Role as **Security Center Admin Viewer** and then select Save.

### Step 4. Create a private key for the dedicated service account
1. Switch to project level.
1. In the **Navigation menu**, Under **IAM & admin** options, select **Service accounts**.
1. Open the dedicated service account and select Edit.
1. In the **Keys** section, select **ADD KEY** and then **Create new key**.
1. In the Create private key screen, select **JSON**, and then select **CREATE**.
1. Save this JSON file for later use.


### Step 5. Connect GCP to Security Center 
1. From Security Center's menu, select **Cloud connectors**.
1. Select add GCP account.
1. In the onboarding page, do the following and then select **Next**.
    1. Validate the chosen subscription.
    1. In the **Display name** field, enter a display name for the connector.
    1. In the **Organization ID** field, enter your organization's ID. If you don't know it, see [Creating and managing organizations](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).
    1. In the **Private key** file box, browse to the JSON file you downloaded in [Step 4. Create a private key for the dedicated service account](#step-4-create-a-private-key-for-the-dedicated-service-account).


### Step 6. Confirmation

When the connector is successfully created and GCP Security Command Center has been configured properly:

- The GCP CIS standard will be shown in the Security Center's regulatory compliance dashboard.
- Security recommendations for your GCP resources will appear in the Security Center portal and the regulatory compliance dashboard 5-10 minutes after onboard completes:

## Monitoring your GCP resources

As shown above, Azure Security Center's security recommendations page displays your GCP resources together with your Azure and AWS resources for a true multi-cloud view.

To view all the active recommendations for your resources by resource type, use Security Center's asset inventory page and filter to the GCP resource type in which you're interested:
