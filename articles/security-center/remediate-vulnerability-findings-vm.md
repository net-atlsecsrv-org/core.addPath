# View and remediate findings from vulnerability assessment solutions on your VMs

When your vulnerability assessment tool reports vulnerabilities to Security Center, Security Center presents the findings and related information as recommendations. In addition, the findings include related information such as remediation steps, relevant CVEs, CVSS scores, and more. You can view the identified vulnerabilities for one or more subscriptions, or for a specific VM.

To view vulnerability assessment findings (from all of your configured scanners) and remediate identified vulnerabilities:

1. Open Azure Security Center and go to the **Recommendations** page. 

1. Select the recommendation "**Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated**".

    Security Center shows you all the findings for all VMs in the currently selected subscriptions. The findings are ordered by severity.

1. To filter the findings by a specific VM, open the "Affected resources" section and click the VM that interests you. Or you can select a VM from the resource health view, and view all relevant recommendations for that resource.

    Security Center shows the findings for that VM, ordered by severity. 

1. To learn more about a specific vulnerability, select it.

    The details pane that appears contains extensive information about the vulnerability, including:
    
    * Links to all relevant CVEs (where available)
    * Remediation steps
    * Any additional reference pages

1. To remediate a finding, follow the remediation steps from this details pane.



## Export the results

To export vulnerability assessment results, you'll need to use [Azure Resource Graph](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/resource-graph/) (ARG). This tool provides instant access to resource information across your cloud environments with robust filtering, grouping, and sorting capabilities. It's a quick and efficient way to query information across Azure subscriptions programmatically or from within the Azure portal.

For full instructions and a sample ARG query, see the following Tech Community post: [Exporting Vulnerability Assessment Results in Azure Security Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/exporting-vulnerability-assessment-results-in-azure-security/ba-p/1212091).
