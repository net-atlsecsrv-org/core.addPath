# Create rich, interactive reports of Security Center data

[Azure Monitor Workbooks](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) provide a flexible canvas for data analysis and the creation of rich visual reports within the Azure portal. They allow you to tap into multiple data sources from across Azure, and combine them into unified interactive experiences.

Workbooks provide a rich set of capabilities for visualizing your Azure data. For detailed examples of each visualization type, see the [visualizations examples and documentation](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-text-visualizations.md). 

Within Azure Security Center, you can access the built-in reports to track your organizationâ€™s security posture. You can also build custom reports to view a wide range of data from Security Center or other supported data sources.

## Workbooks gallery in Azure Security Center

With the integrated Azure Workbooks functionality, Azure Security Center makes it straightforward to build your own custom, interactive reports. Security Center also includes a workbook gallery with the following reports ready for your customization:

- **Secure Score Over Time** - Track your subscriptions' scores and changes to recommendations for your resources
- **System Updates** - View missing system updates by resources, OS, severity, and more
- **Vulnerability Assessment Findings** - View the findings of vulnerability scans of your Azure resources

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/workbooks-gallery-security-center.png" alt-text="Gallery of built-in workbooks in Azure Security Center":::

Choose one of the supplied reports or create your own.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Edit** button to customize any of the supplied reports to your satisfaction. When you're done editing, select **Save** and your changes will be saved to a new workbook.

### Use the 'Secure Score Over Time' report

This report uses secure score data from your Log Analytics workspace. That data needs to be exported from the continuous export tool as described in [Configure continuous export from the Security Center pages in Azure portal](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-portal).

When you set up the continuous export, set the export frequency to both **streaming updates** and **snapshots**.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/export-frequency-both.png" alt-text="For the secure score over time workbook you'll need to select both of these options from the export frequency settings in your continuous export configuration":::

> [!NOTE]
> Snapshots get exported weekly, so you'll need to wait at least one week for the first snapshot to be exported before you can view data in this report.

> [!TIP]
> To configure continuous export across your organization, use the supplied Azure Policy 'DeployIfNotExist' policies described in [Configure continuous export at scale](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-policy).

The secure score over time report has five graphs for the subscriptions reporting to the selected workspaces:


|Graph  |Example  |
|---------|---------|
|**Score trends for the last week and month**<br>Use this section to monitor the current score and general trends of the scores for your subscriptions.|:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/secure-score-over-time-table-1.png" alt-text="Trends for secure score on the built-in report":::|
|**Aggregated score for all selected subscriptions**<br>Hover your mouse over any point in the trend line to see the aggregated score at any date in the selected time range.|:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/secure-score-over-time-table-2.png" alt-text="Aggregated score for all selected subscriptions":::|
|**Recommendations with the most unhealthy resources**<br>This table helps you triage the recommendations that have had the most resources changed to unhealthy over the selected period.|:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/secure-score-over-time-table-3.png" alt-text="Recommendations with the most unhealthy resources":::|
|**Scores for specific security controls**<br>Security Center's security controls are logical groupings of recommendations. This chart shows you, at a glance, the weekly scores for all of your controls.|:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/secure-score-over-time-table-4.png" alt-text="Scores for your security controls over the selected time period":::|
|**Resources changes**<br>Recommendations with the most resources that have changed state (healthy, unhealthy, or not applicable) during the selected period are listed here. Select any recommendation from the list to open a new table listing the specific resources.|:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/secure-score-over-time-table-5.png" alt-text="Recommendations with the most resources that have changed health state":::|

### Use the 'System Updates' report

This report is based on the security recommendation "System updates should be installed on your machines".

The report helps you identify machines with outstanding updates.

You can view the situation for the selected subscriptions according to:

- The list of resources with outstanding updates
- The list of updates missing from your resources

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/system-updates-report.png" alt-text="Security Center's system updates report based on the missing updates security recommendation":::

### Use the 'Vulnerability Assessment Findings' report

Security Center includes vulnerability scanners for your machines, containers in container registries, and SQL servers.

Learn more about using these scanners:

- [Scan your machines with the integrated VA scanner](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm.md)
- [Scan your registry images for vulnerabilities](defender-for-container-registries-usage.md)
- [Scan your SQL resources for vulnerabilities](defender-for-sql-on-machines-vulnerability-assessment.md)

Findings for each of these scanners are reported in separate recommendations:

- Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated
- Vulnerabilities in Azure Container Registry images should be remediated (powered by Qualys)
- Vulnerability assessment findings on your SQL databases should be remediated
- Vulnerability assessment findings on your SQL servers on machines should be remediated

This report gathers these findings and organizes them by severity, resource type, and category.

## Import workbooks from other workbook galleries

If you've built workbooks in other Azure services and want to move them into your Azure Security Center workbooks gallery:

1. Open the target workbook.

1. From the toolbar, select **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/editing-workbooks.png" alt-text="Editing an Azure Monitor workbook":::

1. From the toolbar, select **</>** to enter the Advanced Editor.

    :::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/editing-workbooks-advanced-editor.png" alt-text="Launching the advanced editor to get the Gallery Template JSON code":::

1. Select the **</>** to enter the Advanced Editor.
1. Paste in the entire Gallery Template JSON.
1. Select **Apply**.
1. From the toolbar, select **Save As**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/editing-workbooks-save-as.png" alt-text="Saving the workbook to the gallery in Security Center":::

1. Enter the required details for saving the workbook:
   1. A name for the workbook
   2. The desired region
   3. Subscription, resource group, and sharing as appropriate.

You'll find your saved workbook in the **Recently modified workbooks** category.
