# Encryption for Azure storage account in Azure Security Center

Azure Storage encryption for data at rest is enabled by default for all Azure storage accounts. Azure Storage encrypts data when it is written to Azure 
Storage and decrypts it before retrieval. For more information, see [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md).
