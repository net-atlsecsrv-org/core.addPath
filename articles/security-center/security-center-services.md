>To experiment with features that are only available with Azure Defender, you can enroll in a 30-day trial. For more information, see the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/security-center/).


## Supported endpoint protection solutions <a name="endpoint-supported"></a>

The following table provides a matrix of:

 - Whether you can use Azure Security Center to install each solution for you.
 - Which endpoint protection solutions Security Center can discover. If an endpoint protection solution from this list is discovered, Security Center won't recommend installing one.

For information about when recommendations are generated for each of these protections, see [Endpoint Protection Assessment and Recommendations](security-center-endpoint-protection.md).

| Endpoint Protection| Platforms | Security Center Installation | Security Center Discovery |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Microsoft Defender Antivirus| Windows Server 2016 or later| No, Built in to OS| Yes |
| System Center Endpoint Protection (Microsoft Antimalware) | Windows Server 2012 R2, 2012, 2008 R2 (see note below) | Via Extension | Yes |
| Trend Micro – Deep Security | Windows Server Family  | No | Yes |
| Symantec v12.1.1100+| Windows Server Family  | No | Yes |
| McAfee v10+ | Windows Server Family  | No | Yes |
| McAfee v10+ | Linux Server Family  | No | Yes **\*** |
| Sophos V9+| Linux Server Family  | No | Yes  **\***  |

 **\*** The coverage state and supporting data is currently only available in the Log Analytics workspace associated to your protected subscriptions. It isn't reflected in the Azure Security Center portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Detection of System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP) on a Windows Server 2008 R2 virtual machine requires SCEP to be installed after PowerShell (v3.0 or newer).
