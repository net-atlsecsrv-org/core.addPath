# Azure security baseline for Security Center

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Security Center. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Security Center. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Security Center have been excluded. To see how Azure Security Center completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Security Center security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center is a core Azure offering. You cannot associate a virtual network, subnet, or network security group directly to Security Center. If you enable data collection for your compute resources then Security Center stores the data it collects via a Log Analytics workspace, you can configure that workspace to use Private Link for access to your workspace data over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Also, if using data collection Security Center relies on the Log Analytics agent being deployed to your servers to collect security data and provide protection to these compute resources. The Log Analytics agent requires specific ports and protocols to be opened for proper operation with Security Center. Lock down your networks to only allow these required ports and protocols and only add additional rules that your application requires to operate via network security groups.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: The Azure Security Center offering does not directly integrate with a virtual network but it can collect data from servers configured with the Log Analytics agent which are deployed on your networks. Your servers that are configured to send data to Security Center require certain ports and protocols to be allowed to communicate properly. Define and enforce standard security configurations for these network resources with Azure Policy.

You can also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, role assignments, and Azure Policy assignments, in a single blueprint definition. You can apply the blueprint to new subscriptions to deploy Security Center configurations and related networking resources consistently and securely.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: The Azure Security Center offering does not directly integrate with a virtual network but it can collect data from servers configured with the Log Analytics agent which are deployed on your networks. Your servers that are configured to send data to Security Center require certain ports and protocols to be allowed to communicate properly. Define and enforce standard security configurations for these network resources with Azure Policy.

Use resource tags for network security groups and other resources like servers on your networks that are configured to send security logs to Azure Security Center. For individual network security group rules, use the "Description" field to document the rules that allow traffic to/from a network. 

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You can use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Use Azure DevOps to securely store and manage your code like custom Azure Policy definitions and Azure Resource Manager templates. To protect resources you manage in Azure DevOps, you can grant or deny permissions to specific users, built-in security groups, or groups defined in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) if integrated with Azure DevOps, or Active Directory if integrated with TFS. Use role-based access control to protect customer-managed keys.

Additionally, Enable Soft-Delete and purge protection in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.  If Azure Storage is used to store Azure Resource Manager template backups, enable soft delete to save and recover your data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted.

## Incident response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Develop an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure there are written incident response plans that define all the roles of personnel as well as the phases of incident handling and management from detection to post-incident review. 

- [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems' incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and then revise your response plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the continuous export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You can use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

## Penetration tests and red team exercises

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Penetration tests and red team exercises](../security/benchmarks/security-control-penetration-tests-red-team-exercises.md).*

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

**Guidance**: Follow the Microsoft Cloud Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement to ensure your penetration tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies. Use Microsoft's strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications.
