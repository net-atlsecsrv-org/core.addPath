# Review your security recommendations

This topic explains how to view and understand the recommendations in Azure Security Center to help you protect your Azure resources.

## Monitor recommendations <a name="monitor-recommendations"></a>

Security Center analyzes the security state of your resources to identify potential vulnerabilities. 

1. From Security Center's menu, open the **Recommendations** page to see the recommendations applicable to your environment. Recommendations are grouped into security controls.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/security-center-recommendations/view-recommendations.png" alt-text="Recommendations grouped by security control" lightbox="./media/security-center-recommendations/view-recommendations.png":::

1. To find recommendations specific to the resource type, severity, environment, or other criteria that are important to you, use the optional filters above the list of recommendations.

    The page includes:

    1. For supported recommendations, the top toolbar shows any or all of the following buttons:
        - **Enforce** and **Deny** (see [Prevent misconfigurations with Enforce/Deny recommendations](prevent-misconfigurations.md))
        - **View policy definition** to go directly to the Azure Policy entry for the underlying policy
    1. **Severity indicator**
    1. **Freshness interval** (where relevant)
    1. **Count of exempted resources** if exemptions exist for this recommendation, this shows the number of resources that have been exempted
    1. **Description** - A short description of the issue
    1. **Remediation steps** - A description of the manual steps required to remediate the security issue on the affected resources. For recommendations with 'quick fix', you can select **View remediation logic** before applying the suggested fix to your resources. 
    1. **Affected resources** - Your resources are grouped into tabs:
        - **Healthy resources** – Relevant resources which either aren't impacted or on which you've already  remediated the issue.
        - **Unhealthy resources** – Resources which are still impacted by the identified issue.
        - **Not applicable resources** – Resources for which the recommendation can't give a definitive answer. The not applicable tab also includes reasons for each resource. 

            :::image type="content" source="./media/security-center-recommendations/recommendations-not-applicable-reasons.png" alt-text="Not applicable resources with reasons.":::
    1. Action buttons to remediate the recommendation or trigger a logic app.

## Preview recommendations

Recommendations flagged as **Preview** aren't included in the calculations of your secure score.

They should still be remediated wherever possible, so that when the preview period ends they'll contribute towards your score.
