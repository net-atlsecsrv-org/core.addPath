## What are security recommendations?

Recommendations are actions for you to take in order to secure your resources.

Security Center periodically analyzing the security state of your Azure resources to identify potential security vulnerabilities. It then provides you with recommendations on how to remove them.

Each recommendation provides you with:

- A short description of what is being recommended.
- The remediation steps to carry out in order to implement the recommendation. <!-- In some cases, Quick Fix remediation is available. -->
- Which resources are in need of you performing the recommended action on them.
- The **secure score impact**, which is the amount that your secure score will go up if you implement this recommendation.

Security Center analyzes the security state of your resources to identify potential vulnerabilities. The **Recommendations** tile under **Overview** shows the total number of recommendations identified by Security Center.

      ![View recommendations](./media/security-center-recommendations/view-recommendations.png)

    You can filter recommendations. To filter the recommendations, select **Filter** on the **Recommendations** blade. The **Filter** blade opens and you select the severity and state values you wish to see.

   * **RECOMMENDATIONS**: The recommendation.
   * **SECURE SCORE IMPACT**: A score generated by Security Center using your security recommendations, and applying advanced algorithms to determine how crucial each recommendation is. For more information, see [Secure score calculation](security-center-secure-score.md#secure-score-calculation).
   * **RESOURCE**: Lists the resources to which this recommendation applies.
   * **STATUS BARS**:  Describes the severity of that particular recommendation:
       * **High (Red)**: A vulnerability exists with a meaningful resource (such as an application, a VM, or a network security group) and requires attention.
       * **Medium (Orange)**: A vulnerability exists and non-critical or additional steps are required to eliminate it or to complete a process.
       * **Low (Blue)**: A vulnerability exists that should be addressed but does not require immediate attention. (By default, low recommendations aren't presented, but you can filter on low recommendations if you want to see them.) 
       * **Healthy (Green)**:
       * **Not Available (Grey)**:
