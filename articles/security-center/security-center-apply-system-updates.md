# Apply system updates in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center monitors daily Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) and computers for missing operating system updates. Security Center retrieves a list of available security and critical updates from Windows Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), depending on which service is configured on a Windows computer. Security Center also checks for the latest updates in Linux systems. If your VM or computer is missing a system update, Security Center will recommend that you apply system updates.

## Implement the recommendation
Apply system updates is presented as a recommendation in Security Center. If your VM or computer is missing a system update, this recommendation will be displayed under **Recommendations** and under **Compute**.  Selecting the recommendation opens the **Apply system updates** dashboard.

In this example, we will use **Compute**.

1. Select **Compute** under the Security Center main menu.

   ![Select Compute][1]

2. Under **Compute**, select **Missing system updates**. The **Apply system updates** dashboard opens.

   ![Apply system updates dashboard][2]

   The top of the dashboard provides:

    - The total number of Windows and Linux VMs and computers missing system updates.
    - The total number of critical updates missing across your VMs and computers.
    - The total number of security updates missing across your VMs and computers.

   The bottom of the dashboard lists all missing updates across your VMs and computers, and the severity of the missing update.  The list includes:

    - NAME: Name of the missing update.
    - NO. OF VMs & COMPUTERS: Total number of VMs and computers that are missing this update.
    - STATE: The current state of the recommendation:

      - Open: The recommendation has not been addressed yet.
      - In Progress: The recommendation is currently being applied to those resources, and no action is required by you.
      - Resolved: The recommendation was already finished. (When the issue has been resolved, the entry is dimmed).

    - SEVERITY: Describes the severity of that particular recommendation:

      - High: A vulnerability exists with a meaningful resource (application, virtual machine, or network security group) and requires attention.
      - Medium: Non-critical or additional steps are required to complete a process or eliminate a vulnerability.
      - Low: A vulnerability should be addressed but does not require immediate attention. (By default, low recommendations are not presented, but you can filter on low recommendations if you want to view them.)

3. Select a missing update in the list to view details.

   ![Missing security update][3]

4. Select the **Search** icon in the top ribbon.  An Azure Monitor logs search query opens filtered to the computers missing the update.

   ![Azure Monitor logs search][4]

5. Select a computer from the list for more information. Another search result opens with information filtered only for that computer.
