#  Connect your AWS accounts to Azure Security Center

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same.

Azure Security Center protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Onboarding your AWS account into Security Center, integrates AWS Security Hub and Azure Security Center. Security Center thus provides visibility and protection across both of these cloud environments to provide:

- Automatic agent provisioning (Security Center uses [Azure Arc](../azure-arc/servers/overview.md) to deploy the Log Analytics agent to your AWS instances)
- Policy management
- Vulnerability management
- Embedded Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Detection of security misconfigurations
- A single view showing Security Center recommendations and AWS Security Hub findings
- Incorporation of your AWS resources into Security Center's secure score calculations
- Regulatory compliance assessments of your AWS resources

In the screenshot below you can see AWS accounts displayed in Security Center's overview dashboard.

## Connect your AWS account

### Step 1. Set up AWS Security Hub:

1. To view security recommendations for multiple regions, repeat the following steps for each relevant region.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're using an AWS master account, repeat the following three steps to configure the master account and all connected member accounts across all relevant regions

    1. Enable [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.html).
    1. Enable [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html).
    1. Verify that there is data flowing to the Security Hub.

        When you first enable Security Hub, it may take several hours for data to be available.

### Step 2. Set up authentication for Security Center in AWS

There are two ways to allow Security Center to authenticate to AWS:

- **Create an IAM role for Security Center** - This is the most secure method and is recommended
- **AWS user for Security Center** - A less secure option if you don't have IAM enabled

#### Create an IAM role for Security Center
1. From your Amazon Web Services console, under **Security, Identity & Compliance**, select **IAM**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-onboard-aws/aws-identity-and-compliance.png" alt-text="AWS services":::

1. Select **Roles** and **Create role**.
1. Select **Another AWS account**.
1. Enter the following details:

    - **Account ID** - enter the Microsoft Account ID (**158177204117**) as shown in the AWS connector page in Security Center.
    - **Require External ID** - should be selected
    - **External ID** - enter the subscription ID as shown in the AWS connector page in Security Center 

1. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Attach permission policies** section, select the following policies:

    - SecurityAudit
    - AmazonSSMAutomationRole
    - AWSSecurityHubReadOnlyAccess

1. Optionally add tags. Adding Tags to the user doesn't affect the connection.
1. Select **Next**.

1. In The Roles list, choose the role you created

1. Save the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for later. 

#### Create an AWS user for Security Center 
1. Open the **Users** tab and select **Add user**.
1. In the **Details** step, enter a username for Security Center and ensure that you select **Programmatic access** for the AWS Access Type. 
1. Select **Next Permissions**.
1. Select **Attach existing policies directly** and apply the following policies:
    - SecurityAudit
    - AmazonSSMAutomationRole
    - AWSSecurityHubReadOnlyAccess
    
1. Select **Next: Tags**. Optionally add tags. Adding Tags to the user doesn't affect the connection.
1. Select **Review**.
1. Save the automatically generated **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** CSV file for later.
1. Review the summary and click **Create user**.


### Step 3. Configure the SSM Agent

AWS Systems Manager is required for automating tasks across your AWS resources. If your EC2 instances don't have the SSM Agent, follow the relevant instructions from Amazon:

- [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Windows Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-win.html)
- [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Amazon EC2 Linux Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html)


### Step 4. Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale

As an **Owner** on the subscription you want to use for the onboarding, create a a service principal for Azure Arc onboarding as described in [Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale](../azure-arc/servers/onboard-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale)


### Step 5. Connect AWS to Security Center

1. From Security Center's menu, select **Multi cloud connectors**.
1. Select **Add AWS account**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-onboard-aws/add-aws-account.png" alt-text="Add AWS account button on Security Center's multi cloud connectors page":::
1. Configure the options in the **AWS authentication** tab:
    1. Enter a **Display name** for the connector.
    1. Confirm that the subscription is correct. It is the subscription that will include the connector and AWS Security Hub recommendations.
    1. Depending on the authentication option you chose in [Step 2. Set up authentication for Security Center in AWS](#step-2-set-up-authentication-for-security-center-in-aws):
        - Select  **Assume Role** and paste the ARN from [Create an IAM role for Security Center](#create-an-iam-role-for-security-center)
            :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-onboard-aws/paste-arn-in-portal.png" alt-text="Pasting the ARN file in the relevant field of the AWS connection wizard in the Azure Portal":::

            OR

        - Select **Credentials** and paste the **access key** and **secret key** from the .csv file you saved in [Create an AWS user for Security Center](#create-an-aws-user-for-security-center).
1. Select **Next**.
1. Configure the options in the **Azure Arc Configuration** tab:

    Security Center discovers the EC2 instances in the connected AWS account and uses SSM to onboard them to Azure Arc. 

    > [!TIP]
    > The list of supported operating systems is in the FAQ below.

    1. Select the **Resource Group** and **Azure Region** that the discovered AWS EC2s will be onboarded to in the selected subscription.
    1. Enter the **Service Principal ID** and **Service Principal Client Secret** for Azure Arc as described here [Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale](../azure-arc/servers/onboard-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale)
    1. If the machine is connecting to the internet via a proxy server, specify the proxy server IP address or the name and port number that the machine uses to communicate with the proxy server. Enter the value in the format ```http://<proxyURL>:<proxyport>```
    1. Select **Review + create**.

        Review the summary information

        The Tags sections will list all Azure Tags that will be automatically created for each onboarded EC2 with its own relevant details to easily recognize it in Azure. 

        Learn more about Azure Tags in [Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md).

### Step 7. Confirmation

When the connector is successfully created and AWS Security Hub has been configured properly:

- Security Center scans the environment for AWS EC2 instances, onboarding them to Azure Arc, enabling to install the Log Analytics agent and providing threat protection and security recommendations. 
- The ASC service scans for new AWS EC2 instances every 6 hours and onboards them according to the configuration.
- The AWS CIS standard will be shown in the Security Center's regulatory compliance dashboard.
- If Security Hub policy is enabled, recommendations will appear in the Security Center portal and the  regulatory compliance dashboard 5-10 minutes after onboard completes.

## Monitoring your AWS resources

As shown above, Azure Security Center's security recommendations page displays your AWS resources together with your Azure and GCP resources for a true multi-cloud view.

To view all the active recommendations for your resources by resource type, use Security Center's asset inventory page and filter to the AWS resource type in which you're interested:
