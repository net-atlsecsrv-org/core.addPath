# Azure security policies monitored by Security Center
This article provides a list of Azure Policy definitions that you can monitor in Azure Security Center. For more information about security policies, see [Working with security policies](tutorial-security-policy.md).

## Available security policies

To learn about the built-in policies that are monitored by Security Center, see the following table:

| Policy | What the policy does |
| --- | --- |
|Diagnostics logs in Virtual Machine Scale Sets should be enabled|We recommend that you enable logs so that an activity trail is available for investigation after an incident or compromise.|
|All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Event Hub namespace|Azure Event Hubs clients shouldn't use a namespace-level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least-privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity.|
|Authorization rules on the Event Hub entity should be defined|Audit the existence of authorization rules on Event Hubs entities to grant least-privilege access.|
|Access to storage accounts with firewall and virtual network configurations should be restricted|Audit unrestricted network access in your storage account firewall settings. Configure network rules so that only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premises clients, grant access to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges.|
|Audit usage of custom RBAC rules|Audit built-in roles, such as "Owner, Contributor, Reader" instead of custom role-based access control (RBAC) roles, which are error prone. Use of custom roles is treated as an exception and requires rigorous review and threat modeling.|
|Diagnostics logs in Azure Stream Analytics should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled|Audit requirements of secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service. It also protects data in transit from network layer attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.|
|Azure AD administrator for SQL server should be provisioned|Audit provisioning of an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrator for SQL Server to enable Azure AD authentication. Azure AD authentication supports simplified permission management and centralized identity management of database users and other Microsoft services.|
|All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Service Bus namespace|Azure Service Bus clients shouldn't use a namespace-level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least-privilege security model, create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity.|
|Diagnostics logs in Service Bus should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them up for to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|The ClusterProtectionLevel property to EncryptAndSign in Service Fabric should be set|Service Fabric provides three levels of protection for node-to-node communication that uses a primary cluster certificate: None, Sign, and EncryptAndSign. Set the protection level to ensure that all node-to-node messages are encrypted and digitally signed.|
|Client authentication should use Azure Active Directory|Audit use of client authentication only via Azure AD in Service Fabric.|
|Diagnostics logs in Search services should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Only secure connections to your Redis Cache should be enabled|Audit enabling only of connections via SSL to Azure Cache for Redis. Use of secure connections ensures authentication between the server and the service. It also protects data in transit from network layer attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.|
|Diagnostics logs in Logic Apps should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Diagnostics logs in Key Vault should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Diagnostics logs in Event Hub should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Diagnostics logs in Azure Data Lake Store should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Diagnostics logs in Data Lake Analytics should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Storage accounts should be migrated to new AzureRM resources|Use Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements. These include: <br>- Stronger access control (RBAC)<br>- Better auditing<br>- Azure Resource Manager-based deployment and governance<br>- Access to managed identities<br>- Access to Azure Key Vault for secrets<br>- Azure AD-based authentication<br>- Support for tags and resource groups for easier security management|
|Virtual machines should be migrated to new AzureRM resources|Use Azure Resource Manager for your virtual machines to provide security enhancements. These include: <br>- Stronger access control (RBAC)<br>- Better auditing<br>- Azure Resource Manager-based deployment and governance<br>- Access to managed identities<br>- Access to Azure Key Vault for secrets<br>- Azure AD-based authentication<br>- Support for tags and resource groups for easier security management|
|Metric alert rules should be configured on Batch accounts|Audit configuration of metric alert rules on Azure Batch accounts to enable the required metric.|
|Diagnostic logs in Batch accounts should be enabled|Audit enabling of logs and keep them for up to a year. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Encryption should be enabled on Automation account variables|It's important to enable encryption of Azure Automation account variable assets when you store sensitive data.|
|Diagnostics logs in App Services should be enabled|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs on the app. This creates activity trails for investigation when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Transparent Data Encryption on SQL databases should be enabled|Audit transparent data encryption status for SQL databases.|
|SQL server auditing should be enabled|Audit the existence of SQL auditing at the server level.|
|\[Preview]: Monitor unencrypted SQL database in Azure Security Center|Azure Security Center monitors unencrypted SQL servers or databases as recommended.|
|\[Preview]: Monitor unaudited SQL database in Azure Security Center|Azure Security Center monitors SQL servers and databases that don't have SQL auditing turned on as recommended.|
