# What are security policies, initiatives, and recommendations?

Security Center applies security initiatives to your subscriptions. These initiatives contain one or more security policies. Each of those policies results in a security recommendation for improving your security posture. This page explains each of these ideas in detail.


## What is a security policy?

An Azure policy definition, created in Azure Policy, is a rule about specific security conditions that you want controlled. Built in definitions include things like controlling what type of resources can be deployed or enforcing the use of tags on all resources. You can also create your own custom policy definitions.

To implement these policy definitions (whether built-in or custom), you'll need to assign them. You can assign any of these policies through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

There are different types of policies in Azure Policy. Security Center mainly uses 'Audit' policies that check specific conditions and configurations then report on compliance. There are also "Enforce' policies that can be used to apply secure settings.

## What is a security initiative?

An Azure initiative is a collection of Azure policy definitions, or rules, that are grouped together towards a specific goal or purpose. Azure initiatives simplify management of your policies by grouping a set of policies together, logically, as a single item.

A security initiative defines the desired configuration of your workloads and helps ensure you're complying with the security requirements of your company or regulators.

Like security policies, Security Center initiatives are also created in Azure Policy. You can use [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) to manage your policies, build initiatives, and assign initiatives to multiple subscriptions or for entire management groups.

The default initiative automatically assigned to every subscription in Azure Security Center is Azure Security Benchmark. This benchmark is the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. This widely respected benchmark builds on the controls from the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) and the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) with a focus on cloud-centric security. Learn more about [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/introduction.md).

Security Center offers the following options for working with security initiatives and policies:

- **View and edit the built-in default initiative** - When you enable Security Center, the initiative named 'Azure Security Benchmark' is automatically assigned to all Security Center registered subscriptions. To customize this initiative, you can enable or disable individual policies within it by editing a policy's parameters. See the list of [built-in security policies](./policy-reference.md) to understand the options available out-of-the-box.

- **Add your own custom initiatives** - If you want to customize the security initiatives applied to your subscription, you can do so within Security Center. You'll then receive recommendations if your machines don't follow the policies you create. For instructions on building and assigning custom policies, see [Using custom security initiatives and policies](custom-security-policies.md).

- **Add regulatory compliance standards as initiatives** - Security Center's regulatory compliance dashboard shows the status of all the assessments within your environment in the context of a particular standard or regulation (such as Azure CIS, NIST SP 800-53 R4, SWIFT CSP CSCF-v2020). For more information, see [Improve your regulatory compliance](security-center-compliance-dashboard.md).

## What is a security recommendation?

Using the policies, Security Center periodically analyzes the compliance status of your resources to identify potential security misconfigurations and weaknesses. It then provides you with recommendations on how to remediate those issues. Recommendations are the result of assessing your resources against the relevant policies and identifying resources that aren't meeting your defined requirements.

Security Center makes its security recommendations based on your chosen initiatives. When a policy from your initiative is compared against your resources and finds one or more that aren't compliant it is presented as a recommendation in Security Center.

Recommendations are actions for you to take to secure and harden your resources. Each recommendation provides you with the following information:

- A short description of the issue
- The remediation steps to carry out in order to implement the recommendation
- The affected resources

In practice, it works like this:

1. Azure Security Benchmark is an ***initiative***
1. It includes a ***policy*** to require all Azure Storage accounts to restrict network access so reduce their attack surface. This policy is called "Storage accounts should restrict network access using virtual network rules" and can be disabled or enabled from Azure Policy
1. If Azure Security Center finds an Azure Storage account on any of your protected subscriptions, it assesses those accounts to see whether they're protected with virtual network rules. If they aren't, it displays a ***recommendation*** to fix that situation and harden the security of those resources. 

So, an initiative (1) includes policies (2) that generate recommendations when appropriate (3). 

## Viewing the relationship between a recommendation and a policy

As mentioned above, Security Center's built in recommendations are based on the Azure Security Benchmark. Almost every recommendation has an underlying policy that is derived from a requirement in the benchmark.

When you're reviewing the details of a recommendation, it's often helpful to be able to see the underlying policy. For every recommendation supported by a policy, use the **View policy definition** link from the recommendation details page to go directly to the Azure Policy entry for the relevant policy:

Use this link to view the policy definition and review the evaluation logic. 

If you're reviewing the list of recommendations on our [Security recommendations reference guide](recommendations-reference.md), you'll also see links to the policy definition pages:
