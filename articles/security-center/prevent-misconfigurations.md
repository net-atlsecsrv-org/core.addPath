# Prevent misconfigurations with Enforce/Deny recommendations

Security misconfigurations are a major cause of security incidents. Security Center now has the ability to help *prevent* misconfigurations of new resources with regards to specific recommendations. 

This feature can help keep your workloads secure and stabilize your secure score.

Enforcing a secure configuration, based on a specific recommendation, is offered in two modes:

- Using the **Deny** effect of Azure Policy, you can stop unhealthy resources from being created

- Using the **Enforce** option, you can take advantage of Azure policy's **DeployIfNotExist** effect and automatically remediate non-compliant resources upon creation
 
This is available for selected security recommendations and can be found at the top of the resource details page.

## Prevent resource creation

1. Open the recommendation that your new resources must satisfy, and select the **Deny** button at the top of the page.

    The configuration pane opens listing the scope options. 

1. Set the scope by selecting the relevant subscription or management group.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use the three dots at the end of the row to change a single subscription, or use the checkboxes to select multiple subscriptions or groups then select **Change to Deny**.

## Enforce a secure configuration

1. Open the recommendation that you'll deploy a template deployment for if new resources don't  satisfy it, and select the **Enforce** button at the top of the page.
