# Alert validation (EICAR test file) in Azure Security Center
This document helps you learn how to verify if your system is properly configured for Azure Security Center alerts.

## What are security alerts?
Alerts are the notifications that Security Center generates when it detects threats on your resources. It prioritizes and lists the alerts along with the information needed for you to quickly investigate the problem. Security Center also provides recommendations for how you can remediate an attack.
For more information, see [Security Alerts in Azure Security Center](security-center-alerts-overview.md) and [Managing and responding to security alerts in Azure Security Center](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md)

## Alert validation

* [Windows](#validate-windows)
* [Linux](#validate-linux)

## Validate alert on Windows VM <a name="validate-windows"></a>

After Security Center agent is installed on your computer, follow these steps from the computer where you want to be the attacked resource of the alert:

1. Copy an executable (for example **calc.exe**) to the computerâ€™s desktop, or other directory of your convenience, and rename it as **ASC_AlertTest_662jfi039N.exe**.
1. Open the command prompt and execute this file with an argument (just a fake argument name), such as: ```ASC_AlertTest_662jfi039N.exe -foo```
1. Wait 5 to 10 minutes and open Security Center Alerts. An alert similar to the [example](#alert-validate) below should be displayed:

> [!NOTE]
> When reviewing this test alert for Windows, make sure the field **Arguments Auditing Enabled** is **true**. If it is **false**, then you need to enable command-line arguments auditing. To enable it, use the following command line:
>
>```reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system\Audit" /f /v "ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"```

## Validate alert on Linux VM <a name="validate-linux"></a>

After Security Center agent is installed on your computer, follow these steps from the computer where you want to be the attacked resource of the alert:
1. Copy an executable to a convenient location and rename it to **./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n**, for example:

    ```cp /bin/echo ./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n```

1. Open the command prompt and execute this file:

    ```./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n testing eicar pipe```

1. Wait 5 to 10 minutes and open Security Center Alerts. An alert similar to the [example](#alert-validate) below should be displayed:
