# Alert validation in Azure Security Center
This document helps you learn how to verify if your system is properly configured for Azure Security Center alerts.

## What are security alerts?
Alerts are the notifications that Security Center generates when it detects threats on your resources. It prioritizes and lists the alerts along with the information needed to quickly investigate the problem. Security Center also provides recommendations for how you can remediate an attack.
For more information, see [Security alerts in Security Center](security-center-alerts-overview.md) and [Managing and responding to security alerts](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md)

## Alert validation

* [Windows](#validate-windows)
* [Linux](#validate-linux)
* [Kubernetes](#validate-kubernetes)

## Validate alerts on Windows VMs <a name="validate-windows"></a>

After Security Center agent is installed on your computer, follow these steps from the computer where you want to be the attacked resource of the alert:

1. Copy an executable (for example **calc.exe**) to the computer's desktop, or other directory of your convenience, and rename it as **ASC_AlertTest_662jfi039N.exe**.
1. Open the command prompt and execute this file with an argument (just a fake argument name), such as: ```ASC_AlertTest_662jfi039N.exe -foo```
1. Wait 5 to 10 minutes and open Security Center Alerts. An alert should appear.

> [!NOTE]
> When reviewing this test alert for Windows, make sure the field **Arguments Auditing Enabled** is **true**. If it is **false**, then you need to enable command-line arguments auditing. To enable it, use the following command:
>
>```reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system\Audit" /f /v "ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"```

## Validate alerts on Linux VMs <a name="validate-linux"></a>

After Security Center agent is installed on your computer, follow these steps from the computer where you want to be the attacked resource of the alert:
1. Copy an executable to a convenient location and rename it to **./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n**, for example:

    ```cp /bin/echo ./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n```

1. Open the command prompt and execute this file:

    ```./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n testing eicar pipe```

1. Wait 5 to 10 minutes and open Security Center Alerts. An alert should appear.


## Validate alerts on Kubernetes <a name="validate-kubernetes"></a>

If you've integrated Azure Kubernetes Service with Security Center, you can test that your alerts are working with the following kubectl command:

```kubectl get pods --namespace=asc-alerttest-662jfi039n```
