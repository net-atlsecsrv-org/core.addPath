## Microsoft Defender ATP features in Security Center

Microsoft Defender ATP provides:

- **Advanced post-breach detection sensors**: Microsoft Defender ATP sensors for Windows servers collect a vast array of behavioral signals.

- **Analytics-based, cloud-powered post breach detection**: Microsoft Defender ATP quickly adapts to changing threats. It uses advanced analytics and big data. Microsoft Defender ATP is amplified by the power of the Intelligent Security Graph with signals across Windows, Azure, and Office to detect unknown threats. It provides actionable alerts and enables you to respond quickly.

- **Threat intelligence**: Microsoft Defender ATP generates alerts when it identifies attacker tools, techniques, and procedures. It uses data generated by Microsoft threat hunters and security teams, augmented by intelligence provided by partners.


By integrating Defender ATP with Azure Security Center, you can also benefit from the following additional capabilities:

- **Automated onboarding**: The integration automatically enables the Microsoft Defender ATP sensor for Windows servers that monitored by Azure Security Center (unless they're running Windows Server 2019).

- **Single pane of glass**: The Azure Security Center console displays Microsoft Defender ATP alerts. To investigate further, use Microsoft Defender ATP. Microsoft Defender ATP provides additional information such as the alert process tree and the incident graph. You can also see a detailed machine timeline that shows every behavior for a historical period of up to six months.

## Platform support

Microsoft Defender ATP in Security Center supports detection on Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2, and 2008 R2 SP1. For Azure VMs you need a to enable Azure Defender on your subscription, and for Non-Azure VMs you need Azure Defender to be enabled at the workspace level only.

Server endpoint monitoring using this integration has been disabled for Office 365 GCC customers.

## Data storage location

When you use Azure Security Center to monitor servers, a Microsoft Defender ATP tenant is automatically created. Data collected by Microsoft Defender ATP is stored in the geo-location of the tenant as identified during provisioning. Customer data in pseudonymized form may also be stored in the central storage and processing systems in the United States. 

Once configured, you cannot change the location where your data is stored. If you need to move your data to another location, contact Microsoft Support to reset the tenant.


## Onboard servers to Security Center 

To onboard servers to Security Center, click **Go to Azure Security Center to onboard servers** from the Microsoft Defender ATP server onboarding.

1. In the **Onboarding** area, select or create a workspace in which to store the data.

2. If you can't see all your workspaces, it may be due to a lack of permissions, make sure your workspace is protected by Azure Defender.
    
3. Select **Add servers** to view instructions on how to install the Log Analytics agent. 

4. After onboarding, you can monitor the machines in [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md).

## Enable Microsoft Defender ATP integration

To view if Microsoft Defender ATP integration is enabled, select **Security center** > **Pricing & settings** > select your subscription.

Here you can see the integrations currently enabled.

- If you've already enabled Azure Defender, no further action is necessary. Azure Security Center will automatically onboard the servers to Microsoft Defender ATP. Onboarding might take up to 24 hours.

- If you've never onboarded the servers to Azure Security Center, onboard them to Azure Security Center and enable Azure Defender as usual.

- If you've onboarded the servers through Microsoft Defender ATP:
  - Refer to the documentation for guidance on [how to offboard server machines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=852906).
  - Onboard these servers to Azure Security Center.

## Access to the Microsoft Defender ATP portal

1. Follow the instructions in [Assign user access to the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/assign-portal-access).

1. Check whether you have a proxy or firewall that is blocking anonymous traffic. The Defender ATP sensor connects from the system context, so anonymous traffic must be permitted. To ensure unhindered access to the Microsoft Defender ATP portal, follow the instructions in [Enable access to Microsoft Defender ATP service URLs in the proxy server](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-proxy-internet#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-atp-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server).

## Test the feature

To generate a benign Microsoft Defender ATP test alert:

1. Create a folder 'C:\test-MDATP-test'.

1. Use Remote Desktop to access either a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM or a Windows Server 2016 VM. Open a command-line window.

1. At the prompt, copy and run the following command. The Command Prompt window will close automatically.

    ```
    powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'); Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
    ```

   ![A Command Prompt window with the command above](media/security-center-wdatp/image4.jpeg)

1. If the command is successful, you'll see a new alert on the Azure Security Center dashboard and the Microsoft Defender ATP portal. This alert might take a few minutes to appear.

1. To review the alert in Security Center, go to **Security alerts** > **Suspicious PowerShell CommandLine**.

1. From the investigation window, select the link to go to the Microsoft Defender ATP portal.
