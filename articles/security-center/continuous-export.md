# Export security alerts and recommendations

Azure Security Center generates detailed security alerts and recommendations. You can view them in the portal or through programmatic tools. You may also need to export this information or send it to other monitoring tools in your environment. 

This article describes the set of tools that allow you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

Using these tools you can:

* Continuously export to Log Analytics workspaces
* Continuously export to Azure Event Hubs (for integrations with third-party SIEMs)
* Export to CSV (one time)


## Setting up a continuous export

The steps below are necessary whether you're setting up a continuous export to Log Analytics workspace or Azure Event Hubs.

1. From Security Center's sidebar, select **Pricing & settings**.

1. Select the specific subscription for which you want to configure the data export.
    
1. From the sidebar of the settings page for that subscription, select **Continuous Export**.

    [![Export options in Azure Security Center](media/continuous-export/continuous-export-options-page.png)](media/continuous-export/continuous-export-options-page.png#lightbox)
    Here you see the export options. There's a tab for each available export target. 

1. Select the data type you'd like to export and choose from the filters on each type (for example, export only high severity alerts).

1. From the "Export target" area, choose where you'd like the data saved. Data can be saved in a target on a different subscription (for example on a Central Event Hub instance or a central Log Analytics workspace).

1. Click **Save**.



## Configuring SIEM integration via Azure Event Hubs

Azure Event Hubs is a great solution for programatically consuming any streaming data. For Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations, it's the preferred way to integrate with a third-party SIEM.

> [!NOTE]
> The most effective method to stream monitoring data to external tools in most cases is using Azure Event Hubs. [This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs) provides a brief description for how you can stream monitoring data from different sources to an Event Hub and links to detailed guidance.

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously exported Security Center alerts to a SIEM using Azure Activity log, the procedure below replaces that methodology.

To view the event schemas of the exported data types, visit the [Event Hub event schemas](https://aka.ms/ASCAutomationSchemas).


### To integrate with a SIEM 

After you have configured continuous export of your chosen Security Center data to Azure Event Hubs, you can set up the appropriate connector for your SIEM:

* **Azure Sentinel** - Use the native Azure Security Center alerts [data connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-security-center) offered there.
* **Splunk** - Use the [Azure Monitor Add-On for Splunk](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureMonitorAddonForSplunk/blob/master/README.md)
* **IBM QRadar** - Use [a manually configured log source](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS42VS_DSM/com.ibm.dsm.doc/t_dsm_guide_microsoft_azure_enable_event_hubs.html)
* **ArcSight** â€“ Use [SmartConnector](https://community.microfocus.com/t5/ArcSight-Connectors/SmartConnector-for-Microsoft-Azure-Monitor-Event-Hub/ta-p/1671292)

Also, if you'd like to move the continuously exported data automatically from your configured Event Hub to Azure Data Explorer, use the instructions in [Ingest data from Event Hub into Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-event-hub).



## Continuous export to a Log Analytics workspace

If you want to analyze Azure Security Center data inside a Log Analytics workspace or use Azure alerts together with Security Center, setup continuous export to your Log Analytics workspace.

To export to a Log Analytics workspace, you must have Security Center's Log Analytics solutions enabled on your workspace. If you're using the Azure portal, Security Center's free tier solution is automatically enabled when you enable continuous export. However, if you're configuring your continuous export settings programmatically, you must manually select the free or standard pricing tier for the required workspace from within **Pricing & settings**.  

### Log Analytics tables and schemas

Security alerts and recommendations are stored in the *SecurityAlert* and *SecurityRecommendations* tables respectively. The name of the Log Analytics solution containing these tables depends on whether you are on the free or standard tier (see [pricing](security-center-pricing.md)): Security('Security and Audit') or SecurityCenterFree.

To view the event schemas of the exported data types, visit the [Log Analytics table schemas](https://aka.ms/ASCAutomationSchemas).

###  View exported security alerts and recommendations in Azure Monitor

In some cases, you may choose to view the exported Security Alerts and/or recommendations in [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview). 

Azure Monitor provides a unified alerting experience for a variety of Azure alerts including Diagnostic Log, Metric alerts, and custom alerts based on Log Analytics workspace queries.

To view alerts and recommendations from Security Center in Azure Monitor, configure an Alert rule based on Log Analytics queries (Log Alert):

1. From Azure Monitor's **Alerts** page, click **New alert rule**.

    ![Azure Monitor's alerts page](./media/continuous-export/azure-monitor-alerts.png)

1. In the create rule page, configure your new rule (in the same way you'd configure a [log alert rule in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log)):

    * For **Resource**, select the Log Analytics workspace to which you exported security alerts and recommendations.

    * For **Condition**, select **Custom log search**. In the page that appears, configure the query, lookback period, and frequency period. In the search query, you can type *SecurityAlert* or *SecurityRecommendation* to query the data types that Security Center continuously exports to as you enable the Continuous export to Log Analytics feature. 
    
    * Optionally, configure the [Action Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/action-groups) that you'd like to trigger. Action groups can trigger email sending, ITSM tickets, WebHooks, and more.
    ![Azure Monitor alert rule](./media/continuous-export/azure-monitor-alert-rule.png)

You'll now see new Azure Security Center alerts or recommendations (depending on your configuration) in Azure Monitor alerts, with automatic triggering of an action group (if provided).

## Manual one-time export of security alerts

To download a CSV report for alerts or recommendations, open the **Security alerts** or **Recommendations** page and click the **Download CSV report** button.

[![Download alerts data as a CSV file](media/continuous-export/download-alerts-csv.png)](media/continuous-export/download-alerts-csv.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> These reports contain alerts and recommendations for resources from the currently selected subscriptions.
