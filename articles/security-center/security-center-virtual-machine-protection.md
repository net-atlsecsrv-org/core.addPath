# Protecting your machines and applications in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources, non-Azure servers, and virtual machines. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations that guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls. Recommendations apply to Azure resource types: virtual machines (VMs) and computers, applications, networking, SQL, and Identity and Access.

This article addresses recommendations that apply to machines and applications.

## Monitoring security health
You can monitor the security state of your resources on the **Security Center – Overview** dashboard. The **Resources** section provides the number of issues identified and the security state for each resource type.

You can view a list of all issues by selecting **Recommendations**. For more information about how to apply recommendations, see [Implementing security recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-recommendations.md).

For a complete list of Compute and App services recommendations, see [Recommendations](security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations.md).

To continue, select **Compute & apps** under **Resources** or the Security Center main menu.
![Security Center dashboard](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/overview.png)

## Monitor compute and app services
Under **Compute & apps**, there are the following tabs:

- **Overview**: monitoring and recommendations identified by Security Center.
- **VMs and computers**: list of your VMs, computers, and current security state of each.
- **Cloud Services**: list of your web and worker roles monitored by Security Center.
- **App services**: list of your App service environments and current security state of each.
- **Containers (Preview)**: list of your containers hosted on IaaS Linux machines and security assessment of their Docker configurations.
- **Compute resources (Preview)**: list of recommendations for your compute resources, such as Service Fabric clusters and Event hubs.

To continue, select **Compute & apps** under **Resource security hygiene**.

![Compute](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/compute.png)

In each tab you can have multiple sections, and in each section, you can select an individual option to see more details about the recommended steps to address that particular issue.

### Unmonitored VMs and computers <a name="unmonitored-vms-and-computers"></a>
A VM or computer is unmonitored by Security Center if the machine is not running the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension. A machine may have a local agent already installed, for example the OMS direct agent or the System Center Operations Manager agent. Machines with these agents are identified as unmonitored because these agents are not fully supported in Security Center. To fully benefit from all of Security Center’s capabilities, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension is required.

You can install the extension on the unmonitored VM or computer in addition to the already installed local agent. Configure both agents the same, connecting them to the same workspace. This enables Security Center to interact with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension and collect data. See [Enable the VM extension](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-azurevm.md) for instructions on how to install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension.

See [Monitoring agent health issues](security-center-troubleshooting-guide.md#mon-agent) to learn more about the reasons Security Center is unable to successfully monitor VMs and computers initialized for automatic provisioning.

### Recommendations
This section has a set of recommendations for each VM and computer, web and worker roles, Azure App Service Web Apps, and Azure App Service Environment that Security Center monitors. The first column lists the recommendation. The second column shows the total number of resources that are affected by that recommendation. The third column shows the severity of the issue.

Each recommendation has a set of actions that you can perform after you select it. For example, if you select **Missing system updates**, the number of VMs and computers that are missing patches, and the severity of the missing update appears.

**Apply system updates** has a summary of critical updates in a graph format, one for Windows, and one for Linux. The second part has a table with the following information:

- **NAME**: Name of the missing update.
- **NO. OF VMs & COMPUTERS**: Total number of VMs and computers that are missing this update.
- **UPDATE SEVERITY**: Describes the severity of that particular recommendation:

    - **Critical**: A vulnerability exists with a meaningful resource (application, virtual machine, or network security group) and requires attention.
    - **Important**: Non-critical or additional steps are required to complete a process or eliminate a vulnerability.
    - **Moderate**: A vulnerability should be addressed but does not require immediate attention. (By default, low recommendations are not presented, but you can filter on low recommendations if you want to view them.)


- **STATE**: The current state of the recommendation:

    - **Open**: The recommendation has not been addressed yet.
    - **In Progress**: The recommendation is currently being applied to those resources, and no action is required by you.
    - **Resolved**: The recommendation was already finished. (When the issue has been resolved, the entry is dimmed).

To view the recommendation details, click the name of the missing update from the list.


> [!NOTE]
> The security recommendations here are the same as those under the **Recommendations** tile. See [Implementing security recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-recommendations.md) for more information about how to resolve recommendations.

### VMs and computers
The VMs and computers section gives you an overview of all VM and computer recommendations. Each column represents one set of recommendations.

![VM and computer recommendations](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/vm-computers.png)

There are four types of icons represented in this list:

![Non-Azure computer](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/security-center-monitoring-icon1.png) Non-Azure computer.

![Azure Resource Manager VM](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/security-center-monitoring-icon2.png) Azure Resource Manager VM.

![Azure Classic VM](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/security-center-monitoring-icon3.png) Azure Classic VM.


![VMs identified from the workspace](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/security-center-monitoring-icon4.png) VMs that are identified only from the workspace that is part of the viewed subscription. This includes VMs from other subscriptions that report to the workspace in this subscription, and VMs that were installed with Operations Manager direct agent, and have no resource ID.

The icon that appears under each recommendation helps you to quickly identify the VM and computer that needs attention, and the type of recommendation. You can also use the filters to search the list by **Resource type** and by **Severity**.

To drill down into the security recommendations for each VM, click on the VM.
Here you see the security details for the VM or computer. At the bottom you can see the recommended action and the severity of each issue.
![Cloud services](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/recommendation-list.png)

### Cloud services
For cloud services, a recommendation is created when the operating system version is out of date.

![Cloud services](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/security-center-monitoring-fig1-new006-2017.png)

In a scenario where you do have a recommendation (which is not the case for the previous example), you need to follow the steps in the recommendation to update the operating system version. When an update is available, you will have an alert (red or orange - depends on the severity of the issue). When you select this alert in the WebRole1 (runs Windows Server with your web app automatically deployed to IIS) or WorkerRole1 (runs Windows Server with your web app automatically deployed to IIS) rows, you see more details about this recommendation.

To see a more prescriptive explanation about this recommendation, click **Update OS version** under the **DESCRIPTION** column.



![Update OS version](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/security-center-monitoring-fig8-new4.png)

### App services
You need to enable App Service in your subscription in order to view the App Service information. For instructions on how to enable this feature, see [Protect App Service with Azure Security Center](security-center-app-services.md).
[!NOTE]
> Monitoring App Service is in preview and available only on the Standard tier of Security Center.


Under **App services**, you find a list of your App service environments and the health summary based on the assessment Security Center performed.

![App services](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/app-services.png)

There are three types of icons represented in this list:

![App services environment](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/ase.png) App services environment.

![Web application](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/web-app.png) Web application.

![Function application](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/function-app.png) Function application.

1. Select a web application. A summary view opens with three tabs:

   - **Recommendations**:  based on assessments performed by Security Center that failed.
   - **Passed assessments**: list of assessments performed by Security Center that passed.
   - **Unavailable assessments**: list of assessments that failed to run due to an error or the recommendation is not relevant for the specific App service

   Under **Recommendations** is a list of the recommendations for the selected web application and severity of each recommendation.

   ![App Services recommendations](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/app-services-rec.png)

2. Select a recommendation to see a description of the recommendation and a list of unhealthy resources, healthy resources, and unscanned resources.

   - Under the **Passed assessments** column is a list of passed assessments.  Severity of these assessments is always green.

   - Select a passed assessment from the list for a description of the assessment, a list of unhealthy and healthy resources, and a list of unscanned resources. There is a tab for unhealthy resources but that list is always empty since the assessment passed.

## Virtual machine scale sets
Security Center automatically discovers whether you have scales sets and recommends that you install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on these scale sets. 

To install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent: 

1. Select the recommendation **Install the monitoring agent on virtual machine scale set**. You get a list of unmonitored scale sets.
2. Select an unhealthy scale set. Follow the instructions to install the monitoring agent using an existing populated workspace or create a new one. Make sure to set the workspace [pricing tier](security-center-pricing.md) if it’s not set.

   ![Install MMS](./media/security-center-virtual-machine-recommendations/install-mms.png)

If you want to set new scale sets to automatically install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent:
1. Go to Azure Policy and click **Definitions**.
2. Search for the policy **Deploy Log Analytics agent for Windows virtual machine scale sets** and click on it.
3. Click **Assign**.
4. Set the **Scope** and **Log Analytics workspace** and click **Assign**.

If you want to set all existing scale sets to install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, in Azure Policy, go to **Remediation** and apply the existing policy to existing scale sets.
