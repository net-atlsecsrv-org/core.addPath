# Enable VM Agent in Azure Security Center
The VM Agent must be installed on virtual machines (VMs) in order to [enable data collection](security-center-enable-data-collection.md).  Azure Security Center enables you to see which VMs require the VM Agent and will recommend that you enable the VM Agent on those VMs.

The VM Agent is installed by default for VMs that are deployed from the Azure Marketplace. The article [VM Agent and Extensions â€“ Part 2](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/vm-agent-and-extensions-part-2/) provides information on how to install the VM Agent.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment. This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations blade**, select **Enable VM Agent**.
   ![Enable VM Agent][1]
2. This opens the blade **VM Agent Is Missing Or Not Responding**. This blade lists the VMs that require the VM Agent. Follow the instructions on the blade to install the VM agent.
   ![VM Agent is missing][2]
