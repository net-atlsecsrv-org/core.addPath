[Further details and notes](threat-protection.md#windows-machines)

|Alert|Description|Intent ([Learn more](#intentions))|Severity|
|----|----|:----:|--|
|**A logon from a malicious IP has been detected**|A successful remote authentication for the account 'tristan.schleining' and process 'Advapi' occurred, however the logon IP address (x.x.x.x) has previously been reported as malicious or highly unusual. A successful attack has probably occurred.|-|High|
|**A logon from a malicious IP has been detected. [seen multiple times]**|A successful remote authentication for the account 'IUSR_10001' and process 'Advapi' occurred, however the logon IP address (x.x.x.x) has previously been reported as malicious or highly unusual. A successful attack has probably occurred. Files with the .scr extensions are screen saver files and are normally reside and execute from the Windows system directory.|-|High|
|**Addition of Guest account to Local Administrators group**|Analysis of host data has detected the addition of the built-in Guest account to the Local Administrators group on %{Compromised Host}, which is strongly associated with attacker activity.|-|Medium|
|**An event log was cleared**|Machine logs indicate a suspicious event log clearing operation by user: '%{user name}' in Machine: '%{CompromisedEntity}'. The %{log channel} log was cleared.|-|Informational|
|**Detected Petya ransomware indicators**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected indicators associated with Petya ransomware. See https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-old-techniques-petya-adds-worm-capabilities/ for more information. Review the commandline associated in this alert and escalate this alert to your security team.|-|High|
|**Detected actions indicative of disabling and deleting IIS log files**|Analysis of host data detected actions that show IIS log files being disabled and/or deleted.|-|Medium|
|**Detected anomalous mix of upper and lower case characters in command-line**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a command line with anomalous mix of upper and lower case characters. This kind of pattern, while possibly benign, is also typical of attackers trying to hide from case-sensitive or hash-based rule matching when performing administrative tasks on a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected change to a registry key that can be abused to bypass UAC**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected that a registry key that can be abused to bypass UAC (User Account Control) was changed. This kind of configuration, while possibly benign, is also typical of attacker activity when trying to move from unprivileged (standard user) to privileged (for example administrator) access on a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected decoding of an executable using built-in certutil.exe tool**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected that certutil.exe, a built-in administrator utility, was being used to decode an executable instead of its mainstream purpose that relates to manipulating certificates and certificate data. Attackers are known to abuse functionality of legitimate administrator tools to perform malicious actions, for example using a tool such as certutil.exe to decode a malicious executable that will then be subsequently executed.|-|High|
|**Detected enabling of the WDigest UseLogonCredential registry key**|Analysis of host data  detected a change in the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\ "UseLogonCredential". Specifically this key has been updated to allow logon credentials to be stored in clear text in LSA memory. Once enabled an attacker can dump clear text passwords from LSA memory with credential harvesting tools such as Mimikatz.|-|Medium|
|**Detected encoded executable in command line data**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a base-64 encoded executable. This has previously been associated with attackers attempting to construct executables on-the-fly through a sequence of commands, and attempting to evade intrusion detection systems by ensuring that no individual command would trigger an alert. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Detected obfuscated command line**|Attackers use increasingly complex obfuscation techniques to evade detections that run against the underlying data. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious indicators of obfuscation on the commandline.|-|Informational|
|**Detected possible execution of keygen executable**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected execution of a process whose name is indicative of a keygen tool; such tools are typically used to defeat software licensing mechanisms but their download is often bundled with other malicious software.

Attackers are known to abuse this service to transfer malicious binaries to any other computer, phone, or tablet.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suppression of legal notice displayed to users at logon**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected changes to the registry key that controls whether a legal notice is displayed to users when they log on. Microsoft security analysis has determined that this is a common activity undertaken by attackers after having compromised a host.|-|Low|
|**Detected suspicious combination of HTA and PowerShell**|mshta.exe (Microsoft HTML Application Host) which is a signed Microsoft binary is being used by the attackers to launch malicious PowerShell commands.  Attackers often resort to having an HTA file with inline VBScript.  When a victim browses to the HTA file and chooses to run it, the PowerShell commands and scripts that it contains are executed. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected mshta.exe launching PowerShell commands.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious commandline arguments**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious commandline arguments that have been used in conjunction with a reverse shell used by activity group HYDROGEN.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious commandline used to start all executables in a directory**|Analysis of host data has detected a suspicious process running on %{Compromised Host}. The commandline indicates an attempt to start all executables (*.exe) that may reside in a directory. This could be an indication of a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious credentials in commandline**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a suspicious password being used to execute a file by activity group BORON. This activity group has been known to use this password to execute Pirpi malware on a victim host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious document credentials**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a suspicious, common precomputed password hash used by malware being used to execute a file. Activity group HYDROGEN has been known to use this password to execute malware on a victim host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious execution of VBScript.Encode command**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected the execution of VBScript.Encode command. This encodes the scripts into unreadable text, making it more difficult for users to examine the code. Microsoft threat research shows that attackers often use encoded VBscript files as part of their attack to evade detection systems. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious execution via rundll32.exe**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected rundll32.exe being used to execute a process with an uncommon name, consistent with the process naming scheme previously seen used by activity group GOLD when installing their first stage implant on a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious file cleanup commands**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a combination of systeminfo commands that has previously been associated with one of activity group GOLD's methods of performing post-compromise self-cleanup activity.  While 'systeminfo.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool, executing it twice in succession, followed by a delete command in the way that has occurred here is rare.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious file creation**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected creation or execution of a process which has previously indicated post-compromise action taken on a victim host by activity group BARIUM. This activity group has been known to use this technique to download additional malware to a compromised host after an attachment in a phishing doc has been opened.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious named pipe communications**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected data being written to a local named pipe from a Windows console command. Named pipes are known to be a channel used by attackers to task and communicate with a malicious implant. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious network activity**|Analysis of network traffic from %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious network activity. Such traffic, while possibly benign, is typically used by an attacker to communicate with malicious servers for downloading of tools, command-and-control and exfiltration of data. Typical related attacker activity includes copying remote administration tools to a compromised host and exfiltrating user data from it.|-|Low|
|**Detected suspicious new firewall rule**|Analysis of host data detected a new Firewall rule has been added via netsh.exe to allow traffic from an executable in a suspicious location.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security state of the system**|Attackers use myriad ways like brute force, spear phishing etc. to achieve initial compromise and get a foothold on the network. Once initial compromise is achieved they often take steps to lower the security settings of a system. Cacls—short for change access control list is Microsoft Windows native command-line utility often used for modifying the security permission on folders and files. A lot of time the binary is used by the attackers to lower the security settings of a system. This is done by giving Everyone full access to some of the system binaries like ftp.exe, net.exe, wscript.exe etc. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security of a system.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious use of FTP -s Switch**|Analysis of process creation data from the %{Compromised Host} detected the use of FTP's "-s:filename" switch. This switch is used to specify an FTP script file for the client to run. Malware or malicious processes are known to use this FTP switch (-s:filename) to point to a script file which is configured to connect to a remote FTP server and download additional malicious binaries.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious use of Pcalua.exe to launch executable code**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected the use of pcalua.exe to launch executable code. Pcalua.exe is component of the Microsoft Windows "Program Compatibility Assistant" which detects compatibility issues during the installation or execution of a program. Attackers are known to abuse functionality of legitimate Windows system tools to perform malicious actions, for example using pcalua.exe with the -a switch to launch malicious executables either locally or from remote shares.|-|Medium|
|**Detected the disabling of critical services**|The analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected execution of "net.exe stop" command being used to stop critical services like SharedAccess or Windows Security Center. The stopping of either of these services can be indication of a malicious behavior.|-|Medium|

In both cases a ransom message is typically displayed, requesting payment in order to restore file access.|-|High|
|**Rare SVCHOST service group executed**|The system process SVCHOST was observed running a rare service group. Malware often uses SVCHOST to masquerade its malicious activity.|-|Informational|
|**Sticky keys attack detected**|Analysis of host data indicates that an attacker may be subverting an accessibility binary (for example sticky keys, onscreen keyboard, narrator) in order to provide backdoor access to the host %{Compromised Host}.|-|Medium|
|**Successful brute force attack**|Multiple failed authentication attempts, originating from the same source, were detected across multiple hosts in Azure subscriptions. This resembles a password spray attack, in which an attacker performs numerous authentication attempts spread across multiple hosts. Some of the authentication attempts successfully signed in to a host in this subscription.|-|High|
|**Suspect integrity level indicative of RDP hijacking**|Analysis of host data has detected the tscon.exe running with SYSTEM privileges - this can be indicative of an attacker abusing this binary in order to switch context to any other logged on user on this host; it is a known attacker technique to compromise additional user accounts and move laterally across a network.|-|Medium|
|**Suspect service installation**|Analysis of host data has detected the installation of tscon.exe as a service: this binary being started as a service potentially allows an attacker to trivially switch to any other logged on user on this host by hijacking RDP connections; it is a known attacker technique to compromise additional user accounts and move laterally across a network.|-|Medium|
|**Suspected Kerberos Golden Ticket attack parameters observed**|Analysis of host data detected commandline parameters consistent with a Kerberos Golden Ticket attack.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious Account Creation Detected**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected creation or use of a local account %{Suspicious account name} : this account name closely resembles a standard Windows account or group name '%{Similar To Account Name}'.

|**Suspicious Screensaver process executed**|The process '%{process name}' was observed executing from an uncommon location. Files with the .scr extensions are screen saver files and are normally reside and execute from the Windows system directory.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious Volume Shadow Copy Activity**|Analysis of host data has detected a shadow copy deletion activity on the resource. Volume Shadow Copy (VSC) is an important artifact that stores data snapshots. Some malware and specifically Ransomware, targets VSC to sabotage backup strategies.|-|High|
|**Suspicious WindowPosition registry value detected**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected an attempted WindowPosition registry configuration change that could be indicative of hiding application windows in non-visible sections of the desktop.  This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised machine: this type of activity has been previously associated with known adware (or unwanted software) such as Win32/OneSystemCare and Win32/SystemHealer and malware such as Win32/Creprote. When the WindowPosition value is set to 201329664,  (Hex: 0x0c00 0c00, corresponding to X-axis=0c00 and the Y-axis=0c00) this places the console app's window in a non-visible section of the user's screen in an area that is hidden from view below the visible start menu/taskbar. Known suspect Hex value includes, but not limited to c000c000|-|Low|
|**Suspicious authentication activity**|Although none of them succeeded, some of them used accounts were recognized by the host. This resembles a dictionary attack, in which an attacker performs numerous authentication attempts using a dictionary of predefined account names and passwords in order to find valid credentials to access the host. This indicates that some of your host account names might exist in a well-known account name dictionary.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious code segment detected**|Indicates that a code segment has been allocated by using non-standard methods, such as reflective injection and process hollowing. The alert provides additional characteristics of the code segment that have been processed to provide context for the capabilities and behaviors of the reported code segment.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious command execution**|Machine logs indicate a suspicious command-line execution by user %{user name}.|-||

## Intentions

Understanding the intention of an attack can help you investigate and report the event more easily. Azure Security Center alerts include the 'intent' field to help with these efforts.

The series of steps that describe the progression of a cyberattack from reconnaissance to data exfiltration is often referred to as a "kill chain". 

Security Center's supported kill chain intents are based on the [MITRE ATT&CK&trade; framework](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise) and described in the table below.

|Intent|Description|
|------|-------|
|**PreAttack**|PreAttack could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point. </br>Further details on the PreAttack stage can be read in [MITRE's page](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/pre/).||**InitialAccess**|InitialAccess is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage.|
|**Persistence**|Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. Threat actors will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or provide an alternate backdoor for them to regain access.|
|**PrivilegeEscalation**|Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.|
|**DefenseEvasion**|Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as (or variations of) techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.|
|**CredentialAccess**|Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.|
|**Discovery**|Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.|
|**LateralMovement**|Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an effect.|
|**Execution**|The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.|
|**Collection**|Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.|
|**Exfiltration**|Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.|
|**CommandAndControl**|The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network.|
|**Impact**|Impact events primarily try to directly reduce the availability or integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of data to impact a business or operational process. This would often refer to techniques such as ransomware, defacement, data manipulation, and others.|
