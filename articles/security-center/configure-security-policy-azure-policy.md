# Configure a security policy in Azure Policy using the REST API

As part of the native integration with Azure Policy, Azure Security Center enables you to take advantage Azure Policy’s REST API to create policy assignments. The following instructions walk you through creation of policy assignments, as well as customization of existing assignments. 

Important concepts in Azure Policy: 

- A **policy definition** is a rule 

- An **initiative** is a collection of policy definitions (rules) 

- An **assignment** is an application of an initiative or a policy to a specific scope (management group, subscription, etc.) 

Security Center has a built-in initiative that includes all of its security policies. To assess Security Center’s policies on your Azure resources, you should create an assignment on the management group, or subscription you want to assess.

The built-in initiative has all of Security Center’s policies enabled by default. You can choose to disable certain policies from the built-in initiative. For example, to apply all of Security Center’s policies except **web application firewall**, change the value of the policy’s effect parameter to **Disabled**. 

## API examples

In the following examples, replace these variables:

- **{scope}** enter the name of the management group or subscription to which you're applying the policy.
- **{policyAssignmentName}** enter the [name of the relevant policy assignment](#policy-names).
- **{name}** enter your name, or the name of the administrator who approved the policy change.

This example shows you how to assign the built-in Security Center initiative on a subscription or management group
 
 ```
    PUT  
    https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}?api-version=2018-05-01 

    Request Body (JSON) 

    { 

      "properties":{ 

    "displayName":"Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center", 

    "metadata":{ 

    "assignedBy":"{Name}" 

    }, 

    "policyDefinitionId":"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8", 

    "parameters":{}, 

    } 

    } 
 ```

This example shows you how to assign the built-in Security Center initiative on a subscription, with the following policies disabled: 

- System updates (“systemUpdatesMonitoringEffect”) 

- Security configurations ("systemConfigurationsMonitoringEffect") 

- Endpoint protection ("endpointProtectionMonitoringEffect") 

 ```
    PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}?api-version=2018-05-01 
    
    Request Body (JSON) 
    
    { 
    
      "properties":{ 
    
    "displayName":"Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center", 
    
    "metadata":{ 
    
    "assignedBy":"{Name}" 
    
    }, 
    
    "policyDefinitionId":"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8", 
    
    "parameters":{ 
    
    "systemUpdatesMonitoringEffect":{"value":"Disabled"}, 
    
    "systemConfigurationsMonitoringEffect":{"value":"Disabled"}, 
    
    "endpointProtectionMonitoringEffect":{"value":"Disabled"}, 
    
    }, 
    
     } 
    
    } 
 ```
This example shows you how to remove an assignment:
 ```
    DELETE   
    https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}?api-version=2018-05-01 
 ```
