# Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Security Center

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions related to Azure Security Center. The following groupings of policy definitions are
available:

- The [initiatives](#azure-security-center-initiatives) group lists the Azure Policy initiative
  definitions in the "Security Center" category.
- The [default initiative](#azure-security-center-initiatives) group lists all the Azure Policy
  definitions that are part of Security Center's default initiative,
  [Azure Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction). This Microsoft-authored,
  widely respected benchmark builds on controls from the
  [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) and the
  [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) with a focus on
  cloud-centric security.
- The [category](#azure-security-center-category) group lists all the Azure Policy definitions in
  the "Security Center" category.

For more information about security policies, see
[Working with security policies](./tutorial-security-policy.md). For additional Azure Policy
built-ins for other services, see
[Azure Policy built-in definitions](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
