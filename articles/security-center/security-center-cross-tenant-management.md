# Cross-tenant management in Security Center

Cross-tenant management enables you to view and manage the security posture of multiple tenants in Security Center by leveraging [Azure delegated resource management](../lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md)
. Manage multiple tenants efficiently, from a single view, without having to sign in to each tenant's directory.

- Service providers can manage the security posture of resources, for multiple customers, from within their own tenant.

- Security teams of organizations with multiple tenants can view and manage their security posture from a single location.

## Set up cross-tenant management

Set up cross-tenant management by delegating access to resources of managed tenants to your own tenant using [Azure delegated resource management](../lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure delegated resource management is one of the key components of Azure Lighthouse.

## How does cross-tenant management work in Security Center

You are able to review and manage subscriptions across multiple tenants in the same way that you manage multiple subscriptions in a single tenant.

From the top menu bar, click the filter icon, and select the subscriptions, from each tenant's directory, you'd like to view.

  ![Filter tenants](./media/security-center-cross-tenant-management/cross-tenant-filter.png)

The views and actions are basically the same. Here are some examples:

- **Manage security policies**: From one view, manage the security posture of many resources with [policies](tutorial-security-policy.md), take actions with security recommendations, and collect and manage security-related data.
- **Improve secure score and compliance posture**: Cross-tenant visibility enables you to view the overall security posture of all your tenants and where and how to best improve the [secure score](security-center-secure-score.md) and [compliance posture](security-center-compliance-dashboard.md) for each of them.
- **Remediate recommendations**: Monitor and remediate a [recommendation](security-center-recommendations.md) for many resources from various tenants at one time. You can then immediately tackle the vulnerabilities that present the highest risk across all tenants.
- **Manage Alerts**: Detect [alerts](security-center-alerts-overview.md) throughout the different tenants. Take action on resources that are out of compliance with actionable [remediation steps](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

- **Manage advanced cloud defense features and more**: Manage the various threat detection and protection services, such as [Just-in-time (JIT) VM access](security-center-just-in-time.md), [Adaptive Network Hardening](security-center-adaptive-network-hardening.md), [adaptive application controls](security-center-adaptive-application.md), and more.
