# Security alerts schemas

If your subscription has Azure Defender enabled, you'll receive security alerts when Security Center detects threats to their resources.

You can view these security alerts in Azure Security Center's **Threat Protection** pages, or through external tools such as:

- [Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/) - Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM. The Sentinel Connector gets alerts from Azure Security Center and sends them to the [Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace) for Azure Sentinel.
- Third-party SIEMs - Use Security Center's [continuous export](continuous-export.md) tools to send data to [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/). Then integrate your Event Hub data with a third-party SIEM.
- [The REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/) - If you're using the REST API to access alerts, see the [online Alerts API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/alerts).

If you're using any programmatic methods to consume the alerts, you'll need the correct schema to find the fields that are relevant to you. Also, if you're exporting to an Event Hub or trying to trigger Workflow Automation with generic HTTP connectors, use the schemas to properly parse the JSON objects.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The schema is slightly different for each of these scenarios, so make sure you select the relevant tab below.


## The schemas 


### [Workflow automation and continuous export to Event Hub](#tab/schema-continuousexport)

### Sample JSON for alerts sent to Logic Apps, Event Hub, and third-party SIEMs

Below you'll find the schema of the alert events passed to:

- Azure Logic App instances that were configured in Security Center's workflow automation
- Azure Event Hub using Security Center's continuous export feature

For more information about the workflow automation feature, see [Automate responses to alerts and recommendations](workflow-automation.md).
For more information about continuous export, see [Export alerts and recommendations](continuous-export.md).

[!INCLUDE [Workflow schema](../../includes/security-center-alerts-schema-workflow-automation.md)]




### [Azure Sentinel and Log Analytics workspaces](#tab/schema-sentinel)

The Sentinel Connector gets alerts from Azure Security Center and sends them to the Log Analytics Workspace for Azure Sentinel. 

To create a Sentinel case or incident using Security Center alerts, you'll need the schema for those alerts shown below. 

For more information about Azure Sentinel, see [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/).

[!INCLUDE [Sentinel and workspace schema](../../includes/security-center-alerts-schema-log-analytics-workspace.md)]




### [Azure Activity Log](#tab/schema-activitylog)

Azure Security Center audits generated Security alerts as events in Azure Activity Log.

You can view the security alerts events in Activity Log by searching for the Activate Alert event as shown:

[![Searching the Activity log for the Activate Alert event](media/alerts-schemas/sample-activity-log-alert.png)](media/alerts-schemas/sample-activity-log-alert.png#lightbox)


### Sample JSON for alerts sent to Azure Activity Log

### [MS Graph API](#tab/schema-graphapi)

Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Microsoft 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. Use the wealth of data in Microsoft Graph to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with millions of users.

The schema and a JSON representation for security alerts sent to MS Graph, are available in [the Microsoft Graph documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/alert?view=graph-rest-1.0).
