# Part-of-Speech Tagging

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Linguistic Analysis preview was decommissioned on August 9, 2018. We recommend using [Azure Machine Learning text analytics modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/text-analytics) for text processing and analysis.

## Background and Motivation

Once a text has been separated into sentences and tokens, the next step of analysis is to identify the category or part-of-speech of each word.
These include categories like *noun* (generally representing people, places, things, ideas, etc.) and *verb* (generally representing actions, changes of state, etc.
For some words, the part-of-speech is unambiguous (for instance, *quagmire* is only a noun), but for many others, it's hard to tell.
*Table* could be a place where you sit (or 2-D layout of numbers), but you can also "table a discussion".
