# Analyzers Method

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Linguistic Analysis preview was decommissioned on August 9, 2018. We recommend using [Azure Machine Learning text analytics modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/text-analytics) for text processing and analysis.

The **analyzers** REST API provides a list of analyzers currently supported by the service.
The response includes their [names](Analyzer-Names.md) and the languages supported by each (such as "en" for English).
