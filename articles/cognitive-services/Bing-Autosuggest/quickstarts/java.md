# Quickstart: Suggest search queries with the Bing Autosuggest REST API and Java

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmove).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmigration).

Follow this quickstart to learn how to make calls to the Bing Autosuggest API and read the JSON response. This simple Java application sends a partial search query to the API, and returns suggestions for searches. While this application is written in Java, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages. The source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/java/Search/BingAutosuggestv7.java)

## Prerequisites

* The [Java Development Kit(JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)
* The [Gson library](https://github.com/google/gson)

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-news-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-autosuggest-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create and initialize a project

1. Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE or editor, and import the following libraries.

    ```java
    import java.io.*;
    import java.net.*;
    import java.util.*;
    import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
    import com.google.gson.Gson;
    import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;
    import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
    import com.google.gson.JsonParser;
    ```

2. Create variables for your subscription key, the API host and path, your [market code](/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference#market-codes), and a search query. Use the global endpoint below, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.
    
    ```java
    static String subscriptionKey = "enter key here";
    static String host = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com";
    static String path = "/bing/v7.0/Suggestions";
    static String mkt = "en-US";
    static String query = "sail";
    ```


## Format the response

Create a method named `prettify()` to format the response returned from the Bing Video API. Use the Gson library's `JsonParser` to take in a JSON string and convert it into an object. Then, use `GsonBuilder()` and `toJson()` to create the formatted string.

```java
// pretty-printer for JSON; uses GSON parser to parse and re-serialize
public static String prettify(String json_text) {
    JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
    JsonObject json = parser.parse(json_text).getAsJsonObject();
    Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
    return gson.toJson(json);
}
```

## Construct and send the search request

1. Create a new method named  `get_suggestions()` and perform the following steps:

   1. Construct the URL for your request by combining your API host, path, and encoding your search query. Be sure to url-encode the query before appending it. Create a parameters string for your query by appending the market code to the `mkt=` parameter, and your query to the `q=` parameter.
    
      ```java
  
      public static String get_suggestions () throws Exception {
         String encoded_query = URLEncoder.encode (query, "UTF-8");
         String params = "?mkt=" + mkt + "&q=" + encoded_query;
         //...
      }
      ```
    
   2. Create a new URL for the request with the API host, path, and parameters that you created in the previous step. 
    
       ```java
       //...
       URL url = new URL (host + path + params);
       //...
       ```
    
   3. Create a `HttpsURLConnection` object, and use  `openConnection()` to create a connection. Set the request method to `GET`, and add your subscription key to the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

      ```java
       //...
       HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
       connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
       connection.setRequestProperty("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey);
       connection.setDoOutput(true);
       //...
      ```

   4. Store the API response in `StringBuilder`. After the response has been captured, close the `InputStreamReader` stream, and return the response.

       ```java
       //...
       StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder ();
       BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
       new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
       String line;
       while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
         response.append(line);
       }
       in.close();
    
       return response.toString();
       ```

2. In the main function of your application, call `get_suggestions()`, and print the response by using `prettify()`.
    
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
        String response = get_suggestions ();
        System.out.println (prettify (response));
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println (e);
      }
    }
    ```

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json

  "_type": "Suggestions",
  "queryContext": {
    "originalQuery": "sail"
  },
  "suggestionGroups": [
    {
