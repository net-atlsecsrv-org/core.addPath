# Quickstart: Suggest search queries with the Bing Autosuggest REST API and Python

Follow this quickstart to learn how to make calls to the Bing Autosuggest API and read the JSON response. This simple Python application sends a partial search query to the API, and returns suggestions for searches. While this application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages. The source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/python/Search/BingAutosuggestv7.py)

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-news-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-autosuggest-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create a new application

1. Create a new Python file in your favorite IDE or editor. Add the following imports:

    ```python
    import http.client, urllib.parse, json
    ```

2. Create variables for your API host and path, [market code](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference#market-codes), and partial search query. Use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.

    ```python
    subscriptionKey = 'enter key here'
    host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
    path = '/bing/v7.0/Suggestions'
    mkt = 'en-US'
    query = 'sail'
    ```

3. Create a parameters string by appending your market code to the `mkt=` parameter, and appending your query to the `q=` parameter.

    ```python
    params = '?mkt=' + mkt + '&q=' + query
    ```

## Create and send an API request

1. Add your subscription key to a `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.
    
    ```python
    headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey}
    ```

2. Connect to the API using `HTTPSConnection()`, and send the `GET` request containing your request parameters.
    
    ```python
    conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(host)
    conn.request ("GET", path + params, None, headers)
    response = conn.getresponse ()
    return response.read ()
    ```

3. Get and print the JSON response.

    ```python
    result = get_suggestions ()
    print (json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=4))
    ```

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json

    "originalQuery": "sail"
