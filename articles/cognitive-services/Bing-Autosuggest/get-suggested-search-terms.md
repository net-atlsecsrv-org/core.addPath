# What is Bing Autosuggest?

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).

If your application sends queries to any of the Bing Search APIs, you can use the Bing Autosuggest API to improve your users' search experience. The Bing Autosuggest API returns a list of suggested queries based on the partial query string in the search box. As characters are entered into the search box, you can display suggestions in a drop-down list.

## Workflow

The Bing Autosuggest API is a RESTful web service, easy to call from any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON.

1. Create a [Cognitive Services API account](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) with access to the Bing Search APIs. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) for free.
2. Send a request to this API each time a user types a new character in your application's search box.
3. Process the API response by parsing the returned JSON message.

Typically, you'd call this API each time the user types a new character in your application's search box. As more characters are entered, the API will return more relevant suggested search queries. For example, the suggestions the API might return for a single `s` are likely to be less relevant than ones for `sail`.

The following example shows a drop-down search box with suggested query terms from the Bing Autosuggest API.

When a user selects a suggestion from the drop-down list, you can use it to begin searching with one of the Bing Search APIs, or directly go to the Bing search results page.

## Next steps

To get started quickly with your first request, see [Making Your First Query](quickstarts/csharp.md).

Familiarize yourself with the [Bing Autosuggest API v7](/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference) reference. The reference contains the list of endpoints, headers, and query parameters that you'd use to request suggested query terms, and the definitions of the response objects.
