# Migrate from the Translator Speech API to the Speech service

Use this article to migrate your applications from the Microsoft Translator Speech API to the [Speech service](index.yml). This guide outlines the differences between the Translator Speech API and Speech service, and suggests strategies for migrating your applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Translator Speech API subscription key won't be accepted by the Speech service. You'll need to create a new Speech service subscription.

## Migration strategies

If you or your organization have applications in development or production that use the Translator Speech API, you should update them to use the Speech service. See the [Speech service](index.yml) documentation for available SDKs, code samples, and tutorials. Consider the following when you are migrating:

* The Speech service doesn't offer a global endpoint. Determine if your application functions efficiently when it uses a single regional endpoint for all of its traffic. If not, use geolocation to determine the most efficient endpoint.

* If your application uses long-lived connections and can't use the available SDKs, you can use a WebSockets connection. Manage the 10-minute timeout limit by reconnecting at the appropriate times.

* If your application uses the Translator service and Translator Speech API to enable custom translation models, you can add Category IDs directly by using the Speech service.

* Unlike the Translator Speech API, the Speech service can complete translations into multiple languages in a single request.
