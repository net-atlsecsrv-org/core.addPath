# Migrate from the Translator Speech API to the Speech Service

Use this article to migrate your applications from the Microsoft Translator Speech API to the [Speech Service](index.md). This guide outlines the differences between the Translator Speech API and Speech Service, and suggests strategies for migrating your applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Translator Speech API subscription key won't be accepted by the Speech Service. You'll need to create a new Speech Services subscription.

## Migration strategies

If you or your organization have applications in development or production that use the Translator Speech API, you should update them to use the Speech Service. See the [Speech Service](index.md) documentation for available SDKs, code samples, and tutorials. Consider the following when you are migrating:

* The Speech Services don't offer a global endpoint. Determine if your application functions efficiently when it uses a single regional endpoint for all of its traffic. If not, use geolocation to determine the most efficient endpoint.

* If your application uses long-lived connections and can't use the available SDKs, you can use a WebSockets connection. Manage the 10-minute timeout limit by reconnecting at the appropriate times.

* If your application uses the Translator Text API and Translator Speech API to enable custom translation models, you can add Category IDs directly by using the Speech Service.

* Unlike the Translator Speech API, the Speech Services can complete translations into multiple languages in a single request.
