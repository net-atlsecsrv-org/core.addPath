# Guidelines for responsible deployment of synthetic voice technology
Here are Microsoft’s general design guidelines for using synthetic voice technology. These were developed in studies that Microsoft conducted with voice talent, consumers, as well as individuals with speech disorders to guide the responsible development of synthetic voice.

## General considerations
For deployment of synthetic speech technology, the following guidelines apply across most scenarios.

### Disclose when the voice is synthetic
Disclosing that a voice is computer generated not only minimizes the risk of harmful outcomes from deception but also increases the trust in the organization delivering the voice. Learn more about [how to disclose](concepts-disclosure-guidelines.md).

### Select appropriate voice types for your scenario
Carefully consider the context of use and the potential harms associated with using synthetic voice. For example, high-fidelity synthetic voices may not be appropriate in high-risk scenarios, such as for personal messaging, financial transactions, or complex situations that require human adaptability or empathy. Users may also have different expectations for voice types. For example, when listening to sensitive news being read by a synthetic voice, some users prefer a more empathetic and human-like reading of the news, while others preferred a more monotone, unbiased voice. Consider testing your application to better understand user preferences.

### Be transparent about capabilities and limitations
Users are more likely to have higher expectations when interacting with high-fidelity synthetic voice agents. Consequently, when system capabilities don't meet those expectations, trust can suffer, and may result in unpleasant, or even harmful experiences.

### Provide optional human support
In ambiguous, transactional scenarios (for example, a call support center), users don't always trust a computer agent to appropriately respond to their requests. Human support may be necessary in these situations, regardless of the realistic quality of the voice or capability of the system.

## Considerations for voice talent
When working with voice talent, such as voice actors, to create synthetic voices, the guideline below applies.

### Obtain meaningful consent from voice talent
Voice talent expect to have control over their voice font (how and where it will be used) and be compensated anytime it's used. System owners should therefore obtain explicit written permission from voice talent, and have clear contractual specifications on use cases, duration of use, compensation, and so on. Some voice talent are unaware of the potential malicious uses of the technology and should be educated by system owners about the capabilities of the technology. For more on voice talent and consent, read our [Disclosure for Voice Talent](/legal/cognitive-services/speech-service/disclosure-voice-talent).


## Considerations for those with speech disorders
When working with individuals with speech disorders, to create or deploy synthetic voice technology, the following guidelines apply.

### Provide guidelines to establish contracts
Provide guidelines for establishing contracts with individuals who use synthetic voice for assistance in speaking. The contract should consider specifying the parties who own the voice, duration of use, ownership transfer criteria, procedures for deleting the voice font, and how to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, enable the contractual transfer of voice font ownership after death to family members if that person has given permission.

### Account for inconsistencies in speech patterns
For individuals with speech disorders who record their own voice fonts, inconsistencies in their speech pattern (slurring or inability to pronounce certain words) may complicate the recording process. In these cases, synthetic voice technology and recording sessions should accommodate them (that is, provide breaks and additional number of recording sessions).

### Allow modification over time
Individuals with speech disorders desire to make updates to their synthetic voice to reflect aging (for example, a child reaching puberty). Individuals may also have stylistic preferences that change over time, and may want to make changes to pitch, accent, or other voice characteristics.
