# About the Speech SDK

The Speech Software Development Kit (SDK) gives your applications access to the functions of the Speech service, making it easier to develop speech-enabled software. Currently, the SDKs provide access to **speech-to-text**, **text-to-speech**, **speech translation**, **intent recognition**, and **Bot Frameworkâ€™s Direct Line Speech channel**.

You can easily capture audio from a microphone, read from a stream, or access audio files from storage with the Speech SDK. The Speech SDK supports WAV/PCM 16-bit, 16 kHz/8 kHz, single-channel audio for speech recognition. Additional audio formats are supported using the [speech-to-text REST endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-apis) or the [batch transcription service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-transcription#supported-formats).

A general overview about the capabilities and supported platforms can be found on the documentation [entry page](https://aka.ms/csspeech).

## Get the SDK

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

> [!WARNING]
> The Speech SDK supports Windows 10 or later versions. Earlier Windows versions are **not supported**.

For Windows, we support the following languages:

* C# (UWP and .NET), C++:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK NuGet package. The package includes 32-bit and 64-bit client libraries and managed (.NET) libraries. The SDK can be installed in Visual Studio by using NuGet, [Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech).

* Java:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK Maven package, which supports only Windows x64. In your Maven project, add `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` as an additional repository and reference `com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.8.0` as a dependency.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, we only support Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, and CentOS 8 on the following target architectures:
> - x86 (Debian/Ubuntu), x64, ARM32 (Debian/Ubuntu), and ARM64 (Debian/Ubuntu) for C++ development
> - x64, ARM32 (Debian/Ubuntu), and ARM64 (Debian/Ubuntu) for Java
> - x64 for .NET Core and Python

Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running the following shell commands:

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0 libasound2
```

On Debian 9:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.2 libasound2
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```sh
sudo yum update
sudo yum install alsa-lib openssl
```

> [!NOTE]
> On RHEL/CentOS 8, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).

* C#:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK NuGet package. To reference the SDK, add the following package reference to your project:

  ```xml
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech" Version="1.8.0" />
  ```

* Java:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK Maven package. In your Maven project, add `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` as an additional repository and reference `com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.7.0` as a dependency.

* C++: Download the SDK as a [.tar package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary) and unpack the files in a directory of your choice. The following table shows the SDK folder structure:

  |Path|Description|
  |-|-|
  |`license.md`|License|
  |`ThirdPartyNotices.md`|Third-party notices|
  |`include`|Header files for C and C++|
  |`lib/x64`|Native x64 library for linking with your application|
  |`lib/x86`|Native x86 library for linking with your application|

  To create an application, copy or move the required binaries (and libraries) into your development environment. Include them as required in your build process.

# [Android](#tab/android)

The Java SDK for Android is packaged as an [AAR (Android Library)](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), which includes the necessary libraries and required Android permissions. It's hosted in a Maven repository at `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` as package `com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.7.0`.

To consume the package from your Android Studio project, make the following changes:

* In the project-level build.gradle file, add the following to the `repository` section:

  ```gradle
  maven { url 'https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/' }
  ```

* In the module-level build.gradle file, add the following to the `dependencies` section:

  ```gradle
  implementation 'com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.7.0'
  ```

The Java SDK is also part of the [Speech Devices SDK](speech-devices-sdk.md).
