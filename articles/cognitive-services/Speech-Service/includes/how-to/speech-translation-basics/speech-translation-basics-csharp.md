One of the core features of the Speech service is the ability to recognize human speech and translate it to other languages. In this quickstart you learn how to use the Speech SDK in your apps and products to perform high-quality speech translation. This quickstart covers topics including:

* Translating speech-to-text
* Translating speech to multiple target languages
* Performing direct speech-to-speech translation

## Skip to samples on GitHub

If you want to skip straight to sample code, see the [C# quickstart samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/csharp/dotnet/translate-speech-to-text) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

## Install the Speech SDK

Before you can do anything, you'll need to install the Speech SDK. Depending on your platform, follow the instructions under the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk#get-the-speech-sdk" target="_blank">Get the Speech SDK <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> section of the _About the Speech SDK_ article.

## Import dependencies

To run the examples in this article, include the following `using` statements at the top of the *Program.cs* file.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Translation;
```

## Sensitive data and environment variables

The example source code in this article depends on environment variables for storing sensitive data, such as the Speech resource subscription key and region. The `Program` class contains two `static readonly string` values that are assigned from the host machines environment variables, namely `SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY` and `SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION`. Both of these fields are at the class scope, making them accessible within method bodies of the class. For more information on environment variables, see [environment variables and application configuration](../../../../cognitive-services-security.md#environment-variables-and-application-configuration).

```csharp
public class Program
{
    static readonly string SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY =
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(nameof(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY));
    
    static readonly string SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION =
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(nameof(SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION));

    static Task Main() => Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

## Create a speech translation configuration

To call the Speech service using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config]. This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token.

> [!TIP]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

There are a few ways that you can initialize a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config]:

* With a subscription: pass in a key and the associated region.
* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

Let's take a look at how a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config] is created using a key and region. Get these credentials by following steps in [Try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

```csharp
public class Program
{
    static readonly string SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY =
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(nameof(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY));
    
    static readonly string SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION =
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(nameof(SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION));

    static Task Main() => TranslateSpeechAsync();

    static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
    {
        var translationConfig =
            SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
    }
}
```

## Change source language

One common task of speech translation is specifying the input (or source) language. Let's take a look at how you would change the input language to Italian. In your code, interact with the [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config] instance, assigning to the `SpeechRecognitionLanguage` property.

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    // Source (input) language
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";
}
```

The [`SpeechRecognitionLanguage`][recognitionlang] property expects a language-locale format string. You can provide any value in the **Locale** column in the list of supported [locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).

## Add translation language

Another common task of speech translation is to specify target translation languages, at least one is required but multiples are supported. The following code snippet sets both French and German as translation language targets.

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";
    
    // Translate to languages. See, https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
    translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("fr");
    translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("de");
}
```

With every call to [`AddTargetLanguage`][addlang], a new target translation language is specified. In other words, when speech is recognized from the source language, each target translation is available as part of the resulting translation operation.

## Initialize a translation recognizer

After you've created a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config], the next step is to initialize a [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer]. When you initialize a [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer], you'll need to pass it your `translationConfig`. The configuration object provides the credentials that the speech service requires to validate your request.

If you're recognizing speech using your device's default microphone, here's what the [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer] should look like:

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    var fromLanguage = "en-US";
    var toLanguages = new List<string> { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
    toLanguages.ForEach(translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage);

    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig);
}
```

If you want to specify the audio input device, then you'll need to create an [`AudioConfig`][audioconfig] and provide the `audioConfig` parameter when initializing your [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer].

> [!TIP]
> [Learn how to get the device ID for your audio input device](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md).

First, you'll reference the `AudioConfig` object as follows:

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
    
    var fromLanguage = "en-US";
    var toLanguages = new List<string> { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
    toLanguages.ForEach(translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage);

    using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig, audioConfig);
}
```

If you want to provide an audio file instead of using a microphone, you'll still need to provide an `audioConfig`. However, when you create an [`AudioConfig`][audioconfig], instead of calling `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput`, you'll call `FromWavFileInput` and pass the `filename` parameter.

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
    
    var fromLanguage = "en-US";
    var toLanguages = new List<string> { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
    toLanguages.ForEach(translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage);

    using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig, audioConfig);
}
```

## Translate speech

To translate speech, the Speech SDK relies on a microphone or an audio file input. Speech recognition occurs before speech translation. After all objects have been initialized, call the recognize-once function and get the result.

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
    
    var fromLanguage = "en-US";
    var toLanguages = new List<string> { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
    toLanguages.ForEach(translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage);

    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig);

    Console.Write($"Say something in '{fromLanguage}' and ");
    Console.WriteLine($"we'll translate into '{string.Join("', '", toLanguages)}'.\n");
    
    var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
    if (result.Reason == ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Recognized: \"{result.Text}\":");
        foreach (var (language, translation) in result.Translations)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Translated into '{language}': {translation}");
        }
    }
}
```

For more information about speech-to-text, see [the basics of speech recognition](../../../get-started-speech-to-text.md).

## Synthesize translations

After a successful speech recognition and translation, the result contains all the translations in a dictionary. The [`Translations`][translations] dictionary key is the target translation language and the value is the translated text. Recognized speech can be translated, then synthesized in a different language (speech-to-speech).

### Event-based synthesis

The `TranslationRecognizer` object exposes a `Synthesizing` event. The event fires several times, and provides a mechanism to retrieve the synthesized audio from the translation recognition result. If you're translating to multiple languages, see [manual synthesis](#manual-synthesis). Specify the synthesis voice by assigning a [`VoiceName`][voicename] and provide an event handler for the `Synthesizing` event, get the audio. The following example saves the translated audio as a *.wav* file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The event-based synthesis only works with a single translation, **do not** add multiple target translation languages. Additionally, the [`VoiceName`][voicename] should be the same language as the target translation language, for example; `"de"` could map to `"de-DE-Hedda"`.

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
    
    var fromLanguage = "en-US";
    var toLanguage = "de";
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
    translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage(toLanguage);

    // See: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion#standard-and-neural-voices
    translationConfig.VoiceName = "de-DE-Hedda";

    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig);

    recognizer.Synthesizing += (_, e) =>
    {
        var audio = e.Result.GetAudio();
        Console.WriteLine($"Audio synthesized: {audio.Length:#,0} byte(s) {(audio.Length == 0 ? "(Complete)" : "")}");

        if (audio.Length > 0)
        {
            File.WriteAllBytes("YourAudioFile.wav", audio);
        }
    };

    Console.Write($"Say something in '{fromLanguage}' and ");
    Console.WriteLine($"we'll translate into '{toLanguage}'.\n");

    var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
    if (result.Reason == ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Recognized: \"{result.Text}\"");
        Console.WriteLine($"Translated into '{toLanguage}': {result.Translations[toLanguage]}");
    }
}
```

### Manual synthesis

The [`Translations`][translations] dictionary can be used to synthesize audio from the translation text. Iterate through each translation, and synthesize the translation. When creating a `SpeechSynthesizer` instance, the `SpeechConfig` object needs to have its [`SpeechSynthesisVoiceName`][speechsynthesisvoicename] property set to the desired voice. The following example translates to five languages, and each translation is then synthesized to an audio file in the corresponding neural language.

```csharp
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync()
{
    var translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SERVICE__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    var fromLanguage = "en-US";
    var toLanguages = new List<string> { "de", "en", "it", "pt", "zh-Hans" };
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
    toLanguages.ForEach(translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage);

    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig);

    Console.Write($"Say something in '{fromLanguage}' and ");
    Console.WriteLine($"we'll translate into '{string.Join("', '", toLanguages)}'.\n");

    var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
    if (result.Reason == ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech)
    {
        // See: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion#standard-and-neural-voices
        var languageToVoiceMap = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            ["de"] = "de-DE-KatjaNeural",
            ["en"] = "en-US-AriaNeural",
            ["it"] = "it-IT-ElsaNeural",
            ["pt"] = "pt-BR-FranciscaNeural",
            ["zh-Hans"] = "zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural"
        };

        Console.WriteLine($"Recognized: \"{result.Text}\"");

        foreach (var (language, translation) in result.Translations)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Translated into '{language}': {translation}");

            var speechConfig =
                SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(
                    SPEECH__SERVICE__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
            speechConfig.SpeechSynthesisVoiceName = languageToVoiceMap[language];

            using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileOutput($"{language}-translation.wav");
            using var synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
            
            await synthesizer.SpeakTextAsync(translation);
        }
    }
}
```
