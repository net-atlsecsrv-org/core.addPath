Handling compressed audio is implemented using [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org). For licensing reasons GStreamer binaries are not compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. Developers need to install several dependencies and plugins, see [Installing on Windows](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-windows.html?gi-language=c). Gstreamer binaries need to be in the system path, so that the speech SDK can load gstreamer binaries during runtime. If speech SDK is able to find libgstreamer-1.0-0.dll during runtime it means the gstreamer binaries are in the system path.
