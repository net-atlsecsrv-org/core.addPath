First, load your keyword model file using the `FromFile()` static function, which returns a `KeywordRecognitionModel`. Use the path to the `.table` file you downloaded from Speech Studio. Additionally, you create an `AudioConfig` using the default microphone, then instantiate a new `KeywordRecognizer` using the audio configuration.

```csharp
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

var keywordModel = KeywordRecognitionModel.FromFile("your/path/to/Activate_device.table");
using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
using var keywordRecognizer = new KeywordRecognizer(audioConfig);
```

Next, running keyword recognition is done with one call to `RecognizeOnceAsync()` by passing your model object. This starts a keyword recognition session that lasts until the keyword is recognized. Thus, you generally use this design pattern in multi-threaded applications, or in use cases where you may be waiting for a wake-word indefinitely.

```csharp
KeywordRecognitionResult result = await keywordRecognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync(keywordModel);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The example shown here uses local keyword recognition, since it does not require a `SpeechConfig` 
object for authentication context, and does not contact the back-end. However, you can run both keyword recognition and verification [utilizing a continuous back-end connection](../../../tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk.md#view-the-source-code-that-enables-keyword).
