First, load your keyword model file using the `FromFile()` static function, which returns a `KeywordRecognitionModel`. Use the path to the `.table` file you downloaded from Speech Studio. Additionally, you create an `AudioConfig` using the default microphone, then instantiate a new `KeywordRecognizer` using the audio configuration.

```csharp
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

var keywordModel = KeywordRecognitionModel.FromFile("your/path/to/Activate_device.table");
using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
using var keywordRecognizer = new KeywordRecognizer(audioConfig);
```

Next, running keyword recognition is done with one call to `RecognizeOnceAsync()` by passing your model object. This starts a keyword recognition session that lasts until the keyword is recognized. Thus, you generally use this design pattern in multi-threaded applications, or in use cases where you may be waiting for a wake-word indefinitely.

```csharp
KeywordRecognitionResult result = await keywordRecognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync(keywordModel);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The example shown here uses local keyword recognition, since it does not require a `SpeechConfig` 
object for authentication context, and does not contact the back-end. However, you can run both keyword recognition and verification [utilizing a direct back-end connection](../../../tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk.md#view-the-source-code-that-enables-keyword).

### Continuous recognition

Other classes in the Speech SDK support continuous recognition (for both speech and intent recognition) with keyword recognition. This allows you to use the same code you would normally use for continuous recognition, with the ability to reference a `.table` file for your keyword model.

For speech-to-text, follow the same design pattern shown in the [quickstart](../../../get-started-speech-to-text.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=script%2cbrowser%2cwindowsinstall#continuous-recognition) to set up continuous recognition. Then, replace the call to `recognizer.StartContinuousRecognitionAsync()` with `recognizer.StartKeywordRecognitionAsync(KeywordRecognitionModel)`, and pass your `KeywordRecognitionModel` object. To stop continuous recognition with keyword recognition, use `recognizer.StopKeywordRecognitionAsync()` instead of `recognizer.StopContinuousRecognitionAsync()`.

Intent recognition uses an identical pattern with the [`StartKeywordRecognitionAsync`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.intent.intentrecognizer.startkeywordrecognitionasync#Microsoft_CognitiveServices_Speech_Intent_IntentRecognizer_StartKeywordRecognitionAsync_Microsoft_CognitiveServices_Speech_KeywordRecognitionModel_) and [`StopKeywordRecognitionAsync`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.intent.intentrecognizer.stopkeywordrecognitionasync#Microsoft_CognitiveServices_Speech_Intent_IntentRecognizer_StopKeywordRecognitionAsync) functions.
