One of the core features of the Speech service is the ability to recognize and transcribe human speech (often referred to as speech-to-text). In this quickstart, you learn how to use the Speech SDK in your apps and products to perform high-quality speech-to-text conversion.

## Skip to samples on GitHub

If you want to skip straight to sample code, see the [C# quickstart samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/csharp/dotnet) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

## Install the Speech SDK

If you just want the package name to get started, run `Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` in the NuGet console.

For platform-specific installation instructions, see the following links:

## Create a speech configuration

To call the Speech service using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-dotnet). This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token. Create a [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-dotnet) by using your key and region. See the [Find keys and region](../../../overview.md#find-keys-and-region) page to find your key-region pair.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
    }
}
```

There are a few other ways that you can initialize a [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-dotnet):

* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

## Recognize from microphone

To recognize speech using your device microphone, create an `AudioConfig` using `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`. Then initialize a [`SpeechRecognizer`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?view=azure-dotnet), passing your `audioConfig` and `speechConfig`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task FromMic(SpeechConfig speechConfig)
    {
        using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
        using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        Console.WriteLine("Speak into your microphone.");
        var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
    }

    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
        await FromMic(speechConfig);
    }
}
```

If you want to use a *specific* audio input device, you need to specify the device ID in the `AudioConfig`. Learn [how to get the device ID](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md) for your audio input device.

## Recognize from file

If you want to recognize speech from an audio file instead of a microphone, you still need to create an `AudioConfig`. However, when you create the [`AudioConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.audioconfig?view=azure-dotnet), instead of calling `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`, you call `FromWavFileInput()` and pass the file path.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task FromFile(SpeechConfig speechConfig)
    {
        using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("PathToFile.wav");
        using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
    }

    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
        await FromFile(speechConfig);
    }
}
```

## Recognize from in-memory stream

For many use-cases, it is likely your audio data will be coming from blob storage, or otherwise already be in-memory as a `byte[]` or similar raw data structure. The following example uses a [`PushAudioInputStream`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.pushaudioinputstream?view=azure-dotnet) to recognize speech, which is essentially an abstracted memory stream. The sample code does the following:

* Writes raw audio data (PCM) to the `PushAudioInputStream` using the `Write()` function, which accepts a `byte[]`.
* Reads a `.wav` file using a `FileReader` for demonstration purposes, but if you already have audio data in a `byte[]`, you can skip directly to writing the content to the input stream.
* The default format is 16 bit, 16khz mono PCM. To customize the format, you can pass an [`AudioStreamFormat`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.audiostreamformat?view=azure-dotnet) object to `CreatePushStream()` using the static function `AudioStreamFormat.GetWaveFormatPCM(sampleRate, (byte)bitRate, (byte)channels)`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task FromStream(SpeechConfig speechConfig)
    {
        var reader = new BinaryReader(File.OpenRead("PathToFile.wav"));
        using var audioInputStream = AudioInputStream.CreatePushStream();
        using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromStreamInput(audioInputStream);
        using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        byte[] readBytes;
        do
        {
            readBytes = reader.ReadBytes(1024);
            audioInputStream.Write(readBytes, readBytes.Length);
        } while (readBytes.Length > 0);

        var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
    }

    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
        await FromStream(speechConfig);
    }
}
```

Using a push stream as input assumes that the audio data is a raw PCM, e.g. skipping any headers.
The API will still work in certain cases if the header has not been skipped, but for the best results consider implementing logic to read off the headers so the `byte[]` starts at the *start of the audio data*.

## Error handling

The previous examples simply get the recognized text from `result.text`, but to handle errors and other responses, you'll need to write some code to handle the result. The following code evaluates the [`result.Reason`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.recognitionresult.reason?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet) property and:

* Prints the recognition result: `ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech`
* If there is no recognition match, inform the user: `ResultReason.NoMatch`
* If an error is encountered, print the error message: `ResultReason.Canceled`

```csharp
switch (result.Reason)
{
    case ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
        break;
    case ResultReason.NoMatch:
        Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
        break;
    case ResultReason.Canceled:
        var cancellation = CancellationDetails.FromResult(result);
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");

        if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={cancellation.ErrorDetails}");
            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
        }
        break;
}
```

## Continuous recognition

The previous examples use single-shot recognition, which recognizes a single utterance. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed.

In contrast, continuous recognition is used when you want to **control** when to stop recognizing. It requires you to subscribe to the `Recognizing`, `Recognized`, and `Canceled` events to get the recognition results. To stop recognition, you must call [`StopContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.stopcontinuousrecognitionasync?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet). Here's an example of how continuous recognition is performed on an audio input file.

Start by defining the input and initializing a [`SpeechRecognizer`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet):

```csharp
using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
```

Then create a `TaskCompletionSource<int>` to manage the state of speech recognition.

```csharp
var stopRecognition = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();
```

Next, subscribe to the events sent from the [`SpeechRecognizer`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?view=azure-dotnet).

* [`Recognizing`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.recognizing?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet): Signal for events containing intermediate recognition results.
* [`Recognized`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.recognized?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet): Signal for events containing final recognition results (indicating a successful recognition attempt).
* [`SessionStopped`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer.sessionstopped?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet): Signal for events indicating the end of a recognition session (operation).
* [`Canceled`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.canceled?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet): Signal for events containing canceled recognition results (indicating a recognition attempt that was canceled as a result or a direct cancellation request or, alternatively, a transport or protocol failure).

```csharp
recognizer.Recognizing += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZING: Text={e.Result.Text}");
};

recognizer.Recognized += (s, e) =>
{
    if (e.Result.Reason == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={e.Result.Text}");
    }
    else if (e.Result.Reason == ResultReason.NoMatch)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
    }
};

recognizer.Canceled += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={e.Reason}");

    if (e.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={e.ErrorDetails}");
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
    }

    stopRecognition.TrySetResult(0);
};

recognizer.SessionStopped += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("\n    Session stopped event.");
    stopRecognition.TrySetResult(0);
};
```

With everything set up, call `StartContinuousRecognitionAsync` to start recognizing.

```csharp
await recognizer.StartContinuousRecognitionAsync();

// Waits for completion. Use Task.WaitAny to keep the task rooted.
Task.WaitAny(new[] { stopRecognition.Task });

// make the following call at some point to stop recognition.
// await recognizer.StopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
```

### Dictation mode

When using continuous recognition, you can enable dictation processing by using the corresponding "enable dictation" function. This mode will cause the speech config instance to interpret word descriptions of sentence structures such as punctuation. For example, the utterance "Do you live in town question mark" would be interpreted as the text "Do you live in town?".

To enable dictation mode, use the [`EnableDictation`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.enabledictation?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet) method on your [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet).

```csharp
speechConfig.EnableDictation();
```

## Change source language

A common task for speech recognition is specifying the input (or source) language. Let's take a look at how you would change the input language to Italian. In your code, find your [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet), then add this line directly below it.

```csharp
speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";
```

The [`SpeechRecognitionLanguage`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.speechrecognitionlanguage?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet) property expects a language-locale format string. You can provide any value in the **Locale** column in the list of supported [locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).

## Improve recognition accuracy

There are a few ways to improve recognition accuracy with the Speech SDK. Let's take a look at Phrase Lists. Phrase Lists are used to identify known phrases in audio data, like a person's name or a specific location. Single words or complete phrases can be added to a Phrase List. During recognition, an entry in a phrase list is used if an exact match for the entire phrase is included in the audio. If an exact match to the phrase is not found, recognition is not assisted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Phrase List feature is only available in English.

To use a phrase list, first create a [`PhraseListGrammar`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.phraselistgrammar?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet) object, then add specific words and phrases with [`AddPhrase`](//dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.phraselistgrammar.addphrase?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet).

Any changes to [`PhraseListGrammar`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.phraselistgrammar?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet) take effect on the next recognition or after a reconnection to the Speech service.

```csharp
var phraseList = PhraseListGrammar.FromRecognizer(recognizer);
phraseList.AddPhrase("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious");
```

If you need to clear your phrase list: 

```csharp
phraseList.Clear();
```
