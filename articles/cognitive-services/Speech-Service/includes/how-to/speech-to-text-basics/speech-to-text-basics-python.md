## Prerequisites

This article assumes:

* You have an Azure account and Speech service subscription. If you don't have and account and subscription -- [Try the Speech service for free](../../../get-started.md).

## Install and import the Speech SDK

Before you can do anything, you'll need to install the Speech SDK.

```Python
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
```

If you're on macOS and run into install issues, you may need to run this command first.

```Python
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

After the Speech SDK is installed, import it into your Python project with this statement.

```Python
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk
```

## Create a speech configuration

To call the Speech service using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python). This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

There are a few ways that you can initialize a [`SpeechConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python):

* With a subscription: pass in a key and the associated region.
* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

Let's take a look at how a [`SpeechConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python) is created using a key and region. See the [region support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions#speech-sdk) page to find your region identifier.

```Python
speech_key, service_region = "YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion"
speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)
```

## Initialize a recognizer

After you've created a [`SpeechConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python), the next step is to initialize a [`SpeechRecognizer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?view=azure-python). When you initialize a [`SpeechRecognizer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?view=azure-python), you pass it your `speech_config`. This provides the credentials that the speech service requires to validate your request.

```Python
speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config)
```

## Recognize from microphone or file

If you want to specify the audio input device, you need to create an [`AudioConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.audioconfig?view=azure-python) and pass it as a parameter when initializing your [`SpeechRecognizer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?view=azure-python).

To recognize speech using your device microphone, simply create a `SpeechRecognizer` without passing an `AudioConfig`

```Python
speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config)
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to reference a device by ID, create an `AudioConfig` using `AudioConfig(device_name="<device id>")`
> [Learn how to get the device ID for your audio input device](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md).

If you want to recognize speech from an audio file instead of using a microphone, create an [`AudioConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.audioconfig?view=azure-python) and use the `filename` parameter.

```Python
audio_input = speechsdk.AudioConfig(filename="your_file_name.wav")
speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_input)
```

## Recognize speech

The [Recognizer class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python) for the Speech SDK for Python exposes a few methods that you can use for speech recognition.

* Single-shot recognition (sync) - Performs recognition in a blocking (synchronous) mode. Returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed. The task returns the recognition text as result.
* Single-shot recognition (async) - Performs recognition in a non-blocking (asynchronous) mode. This will recognize a single utterance. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed.
* Continuous recognition (sync) - Synchronously initiates continuous recognition. The client must connect to `EventSignal` to receive recognition results. To stop recognition, call [stop_continuous_recognition()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#stop-continuous-recognition--).
* Continuous recognition (async) - Asynchronously initiates continuous recognition operation. User has to connect to EventSignal to receive recognition results. To stop asynchronous continuous recognition, call [stop_continuous_recognition()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#stop-continuous-recognition-async--).

> [!NOTE]
> Learn more about how to [choose a speech recognition mode](../../../how-to-choose-recognition-mode.md).

### Single-shot recognition

Here's an example of synchronous single-shot recognition using [`recognize_once()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#recognize-once):

```Python
result = speech_recognizer.recognize_once()
```

Here's an example of asynchronous single-shot recognition using [`recognize_once_async()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#recognize-once-async------azure-cognitiveservices-speech-resultfuture):

```Python
result = speech_recognizer.recognize_once_async()
```

Regardless of whether you've used the synchronous or asynchronous method, you'll need to write some code to iterate through the result. This sample evaluates the [`result.reason`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.resultreason?view=azure-python):

* Prints the recognition result: `speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech`
* If there is no recognition match, inform the user: `speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch `
* If an error is encountered, print the error message: `speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled`

```Python
if result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
    print("Recognized: {}".format(result.text))
elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch:
    print("No speech could be recognized: {}".format(result.no_match_details))
elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
    cancellation_details = result.cancellation_details
    print("Speech Recognition canceled: {}".format(cancellation_details.reason))
    if cancellation_details.reason == speechsdk.CancellationReason.Error:
        print("Error details: {}".format(cancellation_details.error_details))
```

### Continuous recognition

Continuous recognition is a bit more involved than single-shot recognition. It requires you to connect to the `EventSignal` to get the recognition results, and in to stop recognition, you must call [stop_continuous_recognition()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#stop-continuous-recognition--) or [stop_continuous_recognition()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#stop-continuous-recognition-async--). Here's an example of how continuous recognition is performed on an audio input file.

Let's start by defining the input and initializing a [`SpeechRecognizer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer?view=azure-python):

```Python
audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(filename=weatherfilename)
speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_config)
```

Next, let's create a variable to manage the state of speech recognition. To start, we'll set this to `False`, since at the start of recognition we can safely assume that it's not finished.

```Python
done = False
```

Now, we're going to create a callback to stop continuous recognition when an `evt` is received. There's a few things to keep in mind.

* When an `evt` is received, the `evt` message is printed.
* After an `evt` is received, [stop_continuous_recognition()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#stop-continuous-recognition--) is called to stop recognition.
* The recognition state is changed to `True`.

```Python
def stop_cb(evt):
    print('CLOSING on {}'.format(evt))
    speech_recognizer.stop_continuous_recognition()
    nonlocal done
    done = True
```

This code sample shows how to connect callbacks to events sent from the [`SpeechRecognizer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#start-continuous-recognition--).

* [`recognizing`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#recognizing): Signal for events containing intermediate recognition results.
* [`recognized`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#recognized): Signal for events containing final recognition results (indicating a successful recognition attempt).
* [`session_started`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#session-started): Signal for events indicating the start of a recognition session (operation).
* [`session_stopped`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#session-stopped): Signal for events indicating the end of a recognition session (operation).
* [`canceled`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#canceled): Signal for events containing canceled recognition results (indicating a recognition attempt that was canceled as a result or a direct cancellation request or, alternatively, a transport or protocol failure).

```Python
speech_recognizer.recognizing.connect(lambda evt: print('RECOGNIZING: {}'.format(evt)))
speech_recognizer.recognized.connect(lambda evt: print('RECOGNIZED: {}'.format(evt)))
speech_recognizer.session_started.connect(lambda evt: print('SESSION STARTED: {}'.format(evt)))
speech_recognizer.session_stopped.connect(lambda evt: print('SESSION STOPPED {}'.format(evt)))
speech_recognizer.canceled.connect(lambda evt: print('CANCELED {}'.format(evt)))

speech_recognizer.session_stopped.connect(stop_cb)
speech_recognizer.canceled.connect(stop_cb)
```

With everything set up, we can call [start_continuous_recognition()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer?view=azure-python#session-stopped).

```Python
speech_recognizer.start_continuous_recognition()
while not done:
    time.sleep(.5)
```

### Dictation mode

When using continuous recognition, you can enable dictation processing by using the corresponding "enable dictation" function. This mode will cause the speech config instance to interpret word descriptions of sentence structures such as punctuation. For example, the utterance "Do you live in town question mark" would be interpreted as the text "Do you live in town?".

To enable dictation mode, use the [`enable_dictation()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python#enable-dictation--) method on your [`SpeechConfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python).

```Python 
SpeechConfig.enable_dictation()
```

## Change source language

A common task for speech recognition is specifying the input (or source) language. Let's take a look at how you would change the input language to German. In your code, find your SpeechConfig, then add this line directly below it.

```Python
speech_config.speech_recognition_language="de-DE"
```

[`speech_recognition_language`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig?view=azure-python#speech-recognition-language) is a parameter that takes a string as an argument. You can provide any value in the list of supported [locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).

## Improve recognition accuracy

There are a few ways to improve recognition accuracy with the Speech SDK. Let's take a look at Phrase Lists. Phrase Lists are used to identify known phrases in audio data, like a person's name or a specific location. Single words or complete phrases can be added to a Phrase List. During recognition, an entry in a phrase list is used if an exact match for the entire phrase is included in the audio. If an exact match to the phrase is not found, recognition is not assisted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Phrase List feature is only available in English.

To use a phrase list, first create a [`PhraseListGrammar`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.phraselistgrammar?view=azure-python) object, then add specific words and phrases with [`addPhrase`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.phraselistgrammar?view=azure-python#addphrase-phrase--str-).

Any changes to [`PhraseListGrammar`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.phraselistgrammar?view=azure-python) take effect on the next recognition or after a reconnection to the Speech service.

```Python
phrase_list_grammar = speechsdk.PhraseListGrammar.from_recognizer(reco)
phrase_list_grammar.addPhrase("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")
```

If you need to clear your phrase list: 

```Python
phrase_list_grammar.clear()
```
