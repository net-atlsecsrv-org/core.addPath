In this quickstart, you learn how to convert text to speech using the Speech service and cURL.

For a high-level look at Text-To-Speech concepts, see the [overview](../../../text-to-speech.md) article.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

## Convert text to speech

At a command prompt, run the following command. You will need to insert the following values into the command.
- Your Speech service subscription key.
- Your Speech service region.

You might also wish to change the following values.
- The `X-Microsoft-OutputFormat` header value, which controls the audio output format. You can find a list of supported audio output formats in the [text-to-speech REST API reference](../../../rest-text-to-speech.md#audio-outputs).
- The output voice. To get a list of voices available for your Speech endpoint, see the next section.
- The output file. In this example, we direct the response from the server into a file named `output.wav`.

:::code language="curl" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/curl/speech/text-to-speech.sh":::

## List available voices for your Speech endpoint

To list the available voices for your Speech endpoint, run the following command.

:::code language="curl" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/curl/speech/get-voices.sh" id="request":::

You should receive a response like the following one.

:::code language="curl" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/curl/speech/get-voices.sh" id="response":::
