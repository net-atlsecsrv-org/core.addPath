In this quickstart you will use the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) to interactively translate speech from one language to text in another language. After satisfying a few prerequisites, translating speech-to-text only takes five steps:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a ````SpeechConfig```` object from your subscription key and region.
> * Update the ````SpeechConfig```` object to specify the source and target languages.
> * Create a ````TranslationRecognizer```` object using the ````SpeechConfig```` object from above.
> * Using the ````TranslationRecognizer```` object, start the recognition process for a single utterance.
> * Inspect the ````TranslationRecognitionResult```` returned.
