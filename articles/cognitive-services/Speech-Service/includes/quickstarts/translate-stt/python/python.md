## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment and create an empty project](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=python)

## Add sample code

1. Open `quickstart.py`, and replace all the code in it with the following.

    ````python
    import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

    speech_key, service_region = "YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion"

    def translate_speech_to_text():

        # Creates an instance of a speech translation config with specified subscription key and service region.
        # Replace with your own subscription key and region identifier from here: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion
        translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

        # Sets source and target languages.
        # Replace with the languages of your choice, from list found here: https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
        fromLanguage = 'en-US'
        toLanguage = 'de'
        translation_config.speech_recognition_language = fromLanguage
        translation_config.add_target_language(toLanguage)

        # Creates a translation recognizer using and audio file as input.
        recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(translation_config=translation_config)

        # Starts translation, and returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a
        # single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15
        # seconds of audio is processed. It returns the recognized text as well as the translation.
        # Note: Since recognize_once() returns only a single utterance, it is suitable only for single
        # shot recognition like command or query.
        # For long-running multi-utterance recognition, use start_continuous_recognition() instead.
        print("Say something...")
        result = recognizer.recognize_once()

        # Check the result
        if result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech:
            print("RECOGNIZED '{}': {}".format(fromLanguage, result.text))
            print("TRANSLATED into {}: {}".format(toLanguage, result.translations['de']))
        elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
            print("RECOGNIZED: {} (text could not be translated)".format(result.text))
        elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch:
            print("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized: {}".format(result.no_match_details))
        elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
            print("CANCELED: Reason={}".format(result.cancellation_details.reason))
            if result.cancellation_details.reason == speechsdk.CancellationReason.Error:
                print("CANCELED: ErrorDetails={}".format(result.cancellation_details.error_details))

    translate_speech_to_text()
    ````

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](../../../../regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save the changes you've made to `quickstart.py`.

## Build and run your app

1. Run the sample from the console or in your IDE:

   ```
   python quickstart.py
   ```

2. Speak an English phrase or sentence. The application transmits your speech to the Speech service, which translates and transcribes to text (in this case, to German). The Speech service then sends the text back to the application for display.

   ````
   Say something...
   RECOGNIZED 'en-US': What's the weather in Seattle?
   TRANSLATED into 'de': Wie ist das Wetter in Seattle?
   ````
