## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=uwp)
> * [Create an empty sample project](../../../../quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=uwp)

## Add sample code

Now add the XAML code that defines the user interface of the application, and add the C# code-behind implementation.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open `MainPage.xaml`.

1. In the designer's XAML view, insert the following XAML snippet into the **Grid** tag (between `<Grid>` and `</Grid>`):

   [!code-xml[UI elements](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/uwp/translate-speech-to-text/helloworld/MainPage.xaml#StackPanel)]

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open the code-behind source file `MainPage.xaml.cs`. (It's grouped under `MainPage.xaml`.)

1. Replace all the code in it with the following snippet:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/uwp/translate-speech-to-text/helloworld/MainPage.xaml.cs#code)]

1. In the `SpeechTranslationFromMicrophone_ButtonClicked` handler in this file, find the string `YourSubscriptionKey`, and replace it with your subscription key.

1. In the `SpeechTranslationFromMicrophone_ButtonClicked` handler, find the string `YourServiceRegion`, and replace it with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription. (For example, use `westus` for the free trial subscription.)

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All** to save your changes.

## Build and run the application

Now you are ready to build and test your application.

1. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or press **F5**) to start the application. The **helloworld** window appears.

1. Select **Enable Microphone**, and when the access permission request pops up, select **Yes**.

1. Select **Translate speech from the microphone input**, and speak an English phrase or sentence into your device's microphone. The application transmits your speech to the Speech service, which translates the speech into text in another language (in this case, German). The Speech service sends the translated text back to the application, which displays the translation in the window.
