## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech resource](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started.md)
> * [Set up your development environment and create an empty project](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=jre&pivots=programming-language-java)
> * Create a bot connected to the [Direct Line Speech channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-directlinespeech)
> * Make sure that you have access to a microphone for audio capture

  > [!NOTE]
  > Please refer to [the list of supported regions for voice assistants](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions.md#voice-assistants) and ensure your resources are deployed in one of those regions.

## Create and configure project

[!INCLUDE [](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-java-create-proj.md)]

Additionally, to enable logging, update the _pom.xml_ file to include the following dependency:

```xml
 <dependency>
     <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
     <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
     <version>1.7.5</version>
 </dependency>
```

## Add sample code

1. To add a new empty class to your Java project, select **File** > **New** > **Class**.

1. In the **New Java Class** window, enter _speechsdk.quickstart_ in the **Package** field and _Main_ in the **Name** field.

   ![Screenshot of New Java Class window](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/media/sdk/qs-java-jre-06-create-main-java.png)

1. Open the newly created `Main` class, and replace the contents of the `Main.java` file with the following starting code:

   ```java
   package speechsdk.quickstart;

   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.AudioConfig;
   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.PullAudioOutputStream;
   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.DialogServiceConfig;
   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.DialogServiceConnector;
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

   import javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat;
   import javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem;
   import javax.sound.sampled.DataLine;
   import javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine;
   import java.io.InputStream;

   public class Main {
       final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // New code will go here
       }

       private void playAudioStream(PullAudioOutputStream audio) {
           ActivityAudioStream stream = new ActivityAudioStream(audio);
           final ActivityAudioStream.ActivityAudioFormat audioFormat = stream.getActivityAudioFormat();
           final AudioFormat format = new AudioFormat(
                   AudioFormat.Encoding.PCM_SIGNED,
                   audioFormat.getSamplesPerSecond(),
                   audioFormat.getBitsPerSample(),
                   audioFormat.getChannels(),
                   audioFormat.getFrameSize(),
                   audioFormat.getSamplesPerSecond(),
                   false);
           try {
               int bufferSize = format.getFrameSize();
               final byte[] data = new byte[bufferSize];

               SourceDataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(SourceDataLine.class, format);
               SourceDataLine line = (SourceDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
               line.open(format);

               if (line != null) {
                   line.start();
                   int nBytesRead = 0;
                   while (nBytesRead != -1) {
                       nBytesRead = stream.read(data);
                       if (nBytesRead != -1) {
                           line.write(data, 0, nBytesRead);
                       }
                   }
                   line.drain();
                   line.stop();
                   line.close();
               }
               stream.close();

           } catch (Exception e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }

   }
   ```

1. In the `main` method, you first configure your `DialogServiceConfig` and use it to create a `DialogServiceConnector` instance. This instance connects to the Direct Line Speech channel to interact with your bot. An `AudioConfig` instance is also used to specify the source for audio input. In this example, the default microphone is used with `AudioConfig.fromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`.

   - Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key, which you can get from [this website](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started.md).
   - Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions.md) associated with your subscription.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Please refer to [the list of supported regions for voice assistants](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions.md#voice-assistants) and ensure your resources are deployed in one of those regions.

   ```java
   final String subscriptionKey = "YourSubscriptionKey"; // Your subscription key
   final String region = "YourServiceRegion"; // Your speech subscription service region
   final BotFrameworkConfig botConfig = BotFrameworkConfig.fromSubscription(subscriptionKey, region);

   // Configure audio input from a microphone.
   final AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromDefaultMicrophoneInput();

   // Create a DialogServiceConnector instance.
   final DialogServiceConnector connector = new DialogServiceConnector(botConfig, audioConfig);
   ```

1. The connector `DialogServiceConnector` relies on several events to communicate its bot activities, speech recognition results, and other information. Add these event listeners next.

   ```java
   // Recognizing will provide the intermediate recognized text while an audio stream is being processed.
   connector.recognizing.addEventListener((o, speechRecognitionResultEventArgs) -> {
       log.info("Recognizing speech event text: {}", speechRecognitionResultEventArgs.getResult().getText());
   });

   // Recognized will provide the final recognized text once audio capture is completed.
   connector.recognized.addEventListener((o, speechRecognitionResultEventArgs) -> {
       log.info("Recognized speech event reason text: {}", speechRecognitionResultEventArgs.getResult().getText());
   });

   // SessionStarted will notify when audio begins flowing to the service for a turn.
   connector.sessionStarted.addEventListener((o, sessionEventArgs) -> {
       log.info("Session Started event id: {} ", sessionEventArgs.getSessionId());
   });

   // SessionStopped will notify when a turn is complete and it's safe to begin listening again.
   connector.sessionStopped.addEventListener((o, sessionEventArgs) -> {
       log.info("Session stopped event id: {}", sessionEventArgs.getSessionId());
   });

   // Canceled will be signaled when a turn is aborted or experiences an error condition.
   connector.canceled.addEventListener((o, canceledEventArgs) -> {
       log.info("Canceled event details: {}", canceledEventArgs.getErrorDetails());
       connector.disconnectAsync();
   });

   // ActivityReceived is the main way your bot will communicate with the client and uses Bot Framework activities.
   connector.activityReceived.addEventListener((o, activityEventArgs) -> {
       final String act = activityEventArgs.getActivity().serialize();
           log.info("Received activity {} audio", activityEventArgs.hasAudio() ? "with" : "without");
           if (activityEventArgs.hasAudio()) {
               playAudioStream(activityEventArgs.getAudio());
           }
       });
   ```

1. Connect `DialogServiceConnector` to Direct Line Speech by invoking the `connectAsync()` method. To test your bot, you can invoke the `listenOnceAsync` method to send audio input from your microphone. Additionally, you can also use the `sendActivityAsync` method to send a custom activity as a serialized string. These custom activities can provide additional data that your bot uses in the conversation.

   ```java
   connector.connectAsync();
   // Start listening.
   System.out.println("Say something ...");
   connector.listenOnceAsync();

   // connector.sendActivityAsync(...)
   ```

1. Save changes to the `Main` file.

1. To support response playback, add an additional class that transforms the PullAudioOutputStream object returned from the getAudio() API to a Java InputStream for ease of handling. This `ActivityAudioStream` is a specialized class that handles audio response from the Direct Line Speech channel. It provides accessors to fetch audio format information that's required for handling playback. For that, select **File** > **New** > **Class**.

1. In the **New Java Class** window, enter _speechsdk.quickstart_ in the **Package** field and _ActivityAudioStream_ in the **Name** field.

1. Open the newly created `ActivityAudioStream` class, and replace it with the following code:

   ```java
   package com.speechsdk.quickstart;

   import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.PullAudioOutputStream;

   import java.io.IOException;
   import java.io.InputStream;

1. Save changes to the `ActivityAudioStream` file.

## Build and run the app

Select F11, or select **Run** > **Debug**.
The console displays the message "Say something."
At this point, speak an English phrase or sentence that your bot can understand. Your speech is transmitted to your bot through the Direct Line Speech channel where it's recognized and processed by your bot. The response is returned as an activity. If your bot returns speech as a response, the audio is played back by using the `AudioPlayer` class.
