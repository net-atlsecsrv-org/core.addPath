## Run the Speech CLI

Now you're ready to run the Speech CLI to synthesize speech from text.

From the command line, change to the directory that contains the Speech CLI binary file, and type:

```bash
spx synthesize --text "The speech synthesizer greets you!"
```

The Speech CLI will produce natural language in English through the computer speaker.
