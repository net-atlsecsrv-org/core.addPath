In this quickstart, you use the Speech CLI from the command line to convert text to speech you hear from your computer's audio speaker. The text-to-speech service provides many options for synthesized voices, under [text-to-speech language support](../../../../language-support.md#text-to-speech). After a one-time configuration, the Speech CLI lets you synthesize speech from text using commands from the command line.
