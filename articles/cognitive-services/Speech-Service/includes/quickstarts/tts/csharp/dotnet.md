## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment and create an empty project](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=dotnet)

## Add sample code

1. Open **Program.cs** and replace the automatically generated code with this sample:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/dotnet/text-to-speech/helloworld/Program.cs#code)]

1. Find the string `YourSubscriptionKey`, and replace it with your Speech service subscription key.

1. Find the string `YourServiceRegion`, and replace it with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription. For example, if you're using the free trial subscription, the region is `westus`.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or select **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Enter an English phrase or sentence. The application transmits your text to the Speech service, which sends synthesized speech to the application to play on your speaker.
