> [!NOTE]
> .NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform .NET platform that implements the [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard) specification.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment and create an empty project](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=dotnetcore)

## Add sample code

1. Open `Program.cs`, and replace all the code in it with the following.

    [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/dotnetcore/text-to-speech/helloworld/Program.cs#code)]

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Also replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save changes to the project.

## Build and run the app

1. Build the application. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**. The code should compile without errors.

1. Start the application. From the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

1. A console window appears, prompting you to type some text. Type a few words or a sentence. The text that you typed is transmitted to the Speech service and synthesized to speech, which plays on your speaker.
