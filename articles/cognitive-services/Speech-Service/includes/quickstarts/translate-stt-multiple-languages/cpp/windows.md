## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=windows)
> * [Create an empty sample project](../../../../quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=windows)

## Add sample code

1. Open the source file **helloworld.cpp**.

1. Replace all the code with the following snippet:

   ```C++
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <speechapi_cxx.h>

   using namespace std;
   using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech;
   using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Translation;

   void TranslateSpeechToText()
   {
       // Creates an instance of a speech translation config with specified subscription key and service region.
       // Replace with your own subscription key and service region (e.g., "westus").
       auto config = SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");

       // Sets source and target languages.
       // Replace with the languages of your choice, from list found here: https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
       auto fromLanguage = "en-US";
       config->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
       config->AddTargetLanguage("de");
       config->AddTargetLanguage("fr");

       // Creates a translation recognizer using the default microphone audio input device.
       auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(config);

       // Starts translation, and returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a
       // single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15
       // seconds of audio is processed. The task returns the recognized text as well as the translation.
       // Note: Since RecognizeOnceAsync() returns only a single utterance, it is suitable only for single
       // shot recognition like command or query.
       // For long-running multi-utterance recognition, use StartContinuousRecognitionAsync() instead.
       cout << "Say something...\n";
       auto result = recognizer->RecognizeOnceAsync().get();

       // Checks result.
       if (result->Reason == ResultReason::TranslatedSpeech)
       {
           cout << "RECOGNIZED '" << fromLanguage << "': " << result->Text << std::endl;
           for (const auto& it : result->Translations)
           {
               cout << "TRANSLATED into '" << it.first.c_str() << "': " << it.second.c_str() << std::endl;
           }
       }
       else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::RecognizedSpeech)
       {
           cout << "RECOGNIZED '" << fromLanguage << "' " << result->Text << " (text could not be translated)" << std::endl;
       }
       else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::NoMatch)
       {
           cout << "NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized." << std::endl;
       }
       else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::Canceled)
       {
           auto cancellation = CancellationDetails::FromResult(result);
           cout << "CANCELED: Reason=" << (int)cancellation->Reason << std::endl;

           if (cancellation->Reason == CancellationReason::Error)
           {
               cout << "CANCELED: ErrorCode=" << (int)cancellation->ErrorCode << std::endl;
               cout << "CANCELED: ErrorDetails=" << cancellation->ErrorDetails << std::endl;
               cout << "CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?" << std::endl;
           }
       }
   }

   int wmain()
   {
       TranslateSpeechToText();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or press **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Speak an English phrase or sentence. The application transmits your speech to the Speech service, which translates and transcribes to text (in this case, to French and German). The Speech service then sends the text back to the application for display.

Say something...
RECOGNIZED 'en-US': What's the weather in Seattle?
TRANSLATED into 'de': Wie ist das Wetter in Seattle?
TRANSLATED into 'fr': Quel temps fait-il Ã  Seattle ?
