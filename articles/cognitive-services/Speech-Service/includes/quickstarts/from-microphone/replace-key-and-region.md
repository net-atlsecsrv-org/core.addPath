Replace the `YourSubscriptionKey` and `YourServiceRegion` values with actual values from the Speech resource.

- Navigate to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Azure portal <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a>, and open the Speech resource
- Under the **Keys** on the left, there are two available subscription keys
    - Use either one as the `YourSubscriptionKey` value replacement
- Under the **Overview** on the left, note the region and map it to the <a href="https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion" target="_blank">region identifier <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a>
    - Use the **Region identifier** as the `YourServiceRegion` value replacement, for example: `"westus"` for **West US**
