## Prerequisites

Before you get started:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment and create an empty project](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=linux)
> * Make sure that you have access to a microphone for audio capture

## Add sample code

1. Create a C++ source file named `helloworld.cpp`, and paste the following code into it.

   [!code-cpp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/cpp/linux/from-microphone/helloworld.cpp#code)]

1. In this new file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech service subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the **Region identifier** from [region](https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK will default to recognizing using en-us for the language, see [Specify source language for speech to text](../../../../how-to-specify-source-language.md) for information on choosing the source language.

## Build the app

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to enter the commands below as a _single command line_. The easiest way to do that is to copy the command by using the **Copy** button next to each command, and then paste it at your shell prompt.

* On an **x64**  (64-bit) system, run the following command to build the application.

  ```sh
  g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/cxx_api" -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api" --std=c++14 -lpthread -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core -L "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x64" -l:libasound.so.2
  ```

* On an **x86** (32-bit) system, run the following command to build the application.

  ```sh
  g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/cxx_api" -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api" --std=c++14 -lpthread -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core -L "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x86" -l:libasound.so.2
  ```

* On an **ARM64**  (64-bit) system, run the following command to build the application.

  ```sh
  g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/cxx_api" -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api" --std=c++14 -lpthread -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core -L "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/arm64" -l:libasound.so.2
  ```

## Run the app

1. Configure the loader's library path to point to the Speech SDK library.

   * On an **x64** (64-bit) system, enter the following command.

     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x64"
     ```

   * On an **x86** (32-bit) system, enter this command.

     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x86"
     ```

   * On an **ARM64** (64-bit) system, enter the following command.

     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/arm64"
     ```

1. Run the application.

   ```sh
   ./helloworld
   ```

1. In the console window, a prompt appears, requesting that you say something. Speak an English phrase or sentence. Your speech is transmitted to the Speech service and transcribed to text, which appears in the same window.

   ```text
   Say something...
   We recognized: What's the weather like?
   ```
