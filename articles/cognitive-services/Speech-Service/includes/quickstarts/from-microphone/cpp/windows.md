## Prerequisites

Before you get started:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment and create an empty project](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=windows)
> * Make sure that you have access to a microphone for audio capture

## Add sample code

1. Open the source file **helloworld.cpp**.

1. Replace all the code with the following snippet:

   [!code-cpp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/cpp/windows/from-microphone/helloworld/helloworld.cpp#code)]

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the **Region identifier** from [region](https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK will default to recognizing using en-us for the language, see [Specify source language for speech to text](../../../../how-to-specify-source-language.md) for information on choosing the source language.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or press **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Speak an English phrase or sentence. The application transmits your speech to the Speech service, which transcribes to text and sends it back to the application for display.
