title: "Quickstart: Recognize speech from a microphone, C# (Xamarin) - Speech service"
titleSuffix: Azure Cognitive Services
description: In this article, you create a cross-platform C# Xamarin application for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), Android, and iOS by using the Cognitive Services Speech SDK. You transcribe speech to text in real time from your device's or simulator's microphone. The application is built with the Speech SDK NuGet Package and Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment and create an empty project](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=xamarin&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
> * Make sure that you have access to a microphone for audio capture

If you've already done this, great. Let's keep going.

## Add sample code for the common helloworld project

The common helloworld project contains platform-independent implementations for your cross-platform application. Now add the XAML code that defines the user interface of the application, and add the C# code behind the implementation.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, under the common helloworld project, open `MainPage.xaml`.

1. In the designer's XAML view, insert the following XAML snippet into the **Grid** tag between `<StackLayout>` and `</StackLayout>`:

   [!code-xml[UI elements](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld/MainPage.xaml)]

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open the code-behind source file `MainPage.xaml.cs`. It's grouped under `MainPage.xaml`.

1. Replace all the code in it with the following snippet:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld/MainPage.xaml.cs)]

1. In the source file's `OnRecognitionButtonClicked` handler, find the string `YourSubscriptionKey`, and replace it with your subscription key.


1. In the `OnRecognitionButtonClicked` handler, find the string `YourServiceregion`, and replace it with the **Region identifier** from [region](https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion) associated with your subscription. (For example, use `westus` for the free trial subscription.)

1. Next, you need to create a [Xamarin Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/app-fundamentals/services/creating-a-service/), which is used to query microphone permissions from different platform projects, such as UWP, Android, and iOS. To do that, add a new folder named *Services* under the helloworld project, and create a new C# source file under it. You can right-click the *Services* folder, and select **Add** > **New Item** > **Code File**. Rename the file `IMicrophoneService.cs`, and place all code from the following snippet in that file:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld/Services/IMicrophoneService.cs)]

#### [Android](#tab/x-android)
## Add sample code for the `helloworld.Android` project

Now add the C# code that defines the Android-specific part of the application.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, under the helloworld.Android project, open `MainActivity.cs`.

1. Replace all the code in it with the following snippet:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld.Android/MainActivity.cs)]

1. Next, add Android-specific implementation for `MicrophoneService` by creating the new folder *Services* under the helloworld.Android project. After that, create a new C# source file under it. Rename the file `MicrophoneService.cs`. Copy and paste the following code snippet into that file:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld.Android/Services/MicrophoneService.cs)]

1. After that, open `AndroidManifest.xml` under the *Properties* folder. Add the following uses-permission setting for the microphone between `<manifest>` and `</manifest>`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
   ```
   
#### [iOS](#tab/ios)
## Add sample code for the `helloworld.iOS` project

Now add the C# code that defines the iOS-specific part of the application. Also create Apple device-specific configurations to the helloworld.iOS project.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, under the helloworld.iOS project, open `AppDelegate.cs`.

1. Replace all the code in it with the following snippet:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld.iOS/AppDelegate.cs)]

1. Next, add iOS-specific implementation for `MicrophoneService` by creating the new folder *Services* under the helloworld.iO project. After that, create a new C# source file under it. Rename the file `MicrophoneService.cs`. Copy and paste the following code snippet into that file:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld.iOS/Services/MicrophoneService.cs)]

1. Open `Info.plist` under the helloworld.iOS project in the text editor. Add the following key value pair under the dict section:

   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This sample app requires microphone access</string>

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're building for an iPhone device, ensure that `Bundle Identifier` matches your device's provisioning profile app ID. Otherwise, the build will fail. With iPhoneSimulator, you can leave it as is.

1. If you're building on a Windows PC, establish a connection to the Mac device for building via **Tools** > **iOS** > **Pair to Mac**. Follow the instruction wizard provided by Visual Studio to enable the connection to the Mac device.

#### [UWP](#tab/helloworlduwp)
## Add sample code for the `helloworld.UWP` project

## Add sample code for the helloworld.UWP project

Now add the C# code that defines the UWP-specific part of the application.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, under the helloworld.UWP project, open `MainPage.xaml.cs`.

1. Replace all the code in it with the following snippet:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld.UWP/MainPage.xaml.cs)]

1. Next, add a UWP-specific implementation for `MicrophoneService` by creating the new folder *Services* under the helloworld.UWP project. After that, create a new C# source file under it. Rename the file `MicrophoneService.cs`. Copy and paste the following code snippet into that file:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp/xamarin/helloworld/helloworld.UWP/Services/MicrophoneService.cs)]

1. Next, double-click the `Package.appxmanifest` file under the helloworld.UWP project inside Visual Studio. Under **Capabilities**, make sure that **Microphone** is selected, and save the file.

1. Next double click `Package.appxmanifest` file under the `helloworld.UWP` project inside Visual Studio and under **Capabilities** > **Microphone** is checked and save the file.
   > Note: In case you see warning : Certificate file does not exist: helloworld.UWP_TemporaryKey.pfx, please check [speech to text](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/quickstarts/speech-to-text-from-microphone.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=uwp) sample for more information.

1. From the menu bar, select **File** > **Save All** to save your changes.

## Build and run the UWP application

1. Set helloworld.UWP as a startup project. Right-click the helloworld.UWP project, and select **Build** to build the application.

1. Select **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or select **F5**) to start the application. The **helloworld** window appears.

1. Select **Enable Microphone**. When the access permission request appears, select **Yes**.

   ![Microphone access permission request](../../../../media/sdk/qs-csharp-xamarin-uwp-access-prompt.png)

1. Select **Start Speech recognition**, and speak an English phrase or sentence into your device's microphone. Your speech is transmitted to the Speech service and transcribed to text, which appears in the window.

## Build and run the Android and iOS applications

Building and running Android and iOS applications in the device or simulator happen in a similar way to the UWP. Make sure all SDKs are installed correctly as required in the "Prerequisites" section of this article.
