In this quickstart, you use the Speech CLI from the command line to interactively recognize speech from a microphone input, and get the text transcription from captured audio. It's easy to use the Speech CLI to perform common recognition tasks, such as transcribing conversations. After a one-time configuration, the Speech CLI lets you transcribe audio into text interactively with a microphone or from files using a batch script.
