## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=dotnet)
> * [Create an empty sample project](../../../../quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=dotnet)

## Open your project in Visual Studio

The first step is to make sure that you have your project open in Visual Studio.

1. Launch Visual Studio 2019.
2. Load your project and open `Program.cs`.

## Start with some boilerplate code

Let's add some code that works as a skeleton for our project. Make note that you've created an async method called `SynthesisToAudioFileAsync()`.

````C#

using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;

namespace helloworld
{
    class Program
    {
        public static async Task SynthesisToAudioFileAsync()
        {
        }

        static void Main()
        {
            SynthesisToAudioFileAsync().Wait();
        }
    }
}

````

## Create a Speech configuration

Before you can initialize a `SpeechSynthesizer` object, you need to create a configuration that uses your subscription key and subscription region. Insert this code in the `SynthesisToAudioFileAsync()` method.

````C#
var config = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");
````

## Create an Audio configuration

Now, you need to create an ````AudioConfig```` object that points to your audio file. This object is created inside of a using statement to ensure the proper release of unmanaged resources. Insert this code in the `SynthesisToAudioFileAsync()` method, right below your Speech configuration.

````C#
var fileName = "helloworld.wav";
using (var fileOutput = AudioConfig.FromWavFileOutput(fileName))
{
}
````

## Initialize a SpeechSynthesizer

Now, let's create the `SpeechSynthesizer` object using the `SpeechConfig` and `AudioConfig` objects created earlier. This object is also created inside of a using statement to ensure the proper release of unmanaged resources. Insert this code in the `SynthesisToAudioFileAsync()` method, inside the using statement that wraps your ````AudioConfig```` object.

````C#
using (var synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(config, fileOutput))
{
}
````

## Synthesize text using SpeakTextAsync

From the `SpeechSynthesizer` object, you're going to call the `SpeakTextAsync()` method. This method sends your text to the Speech Service which converts it to audio. The `SpeechSynthesizer` will use the default voice if `config.VoiceName` isn't explicitly specified.

Inside the using statement, add this code:
````C#
var text = "Hello world!";
var result = await synthesizer.SpeakTextAsync(text);
````

## Check for errors

When the synthesis result is returned by the Speech service, you should check to make sure your text was successfully synthesized.

Inside the using statement, below `SpeakTextAsync()`, add this code:
````C#
if (result.Reason == ResultReason.SynthesizingAudioCompleted)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Speech synthesized to [{fileName}] for text [{text}]");
}
else if (result.Reason == ResultReason.Canceled)
{
    var cancellation = SpeechSynthesisCancellationDetails.FromResult(result);
    Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");

    if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails=[{cancellation.ErrorDetails}]");
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
    }
}
````

## Check your code

At this point, your code should look like this:

namespace helloworld
{
    class Program
    {
        public static async Task SynthesisToAudioFileAsync()
        {
            var config = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");

            var fileName = "helloworld.wav";
            using (var fileOutput = AudioConfig.FromWavFileOutput(fileName))
            {
                using (var synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(config, fileOutput))
                {
                    var text = "Hello world!";
                    var result = await synthesizer.SpeakTextAsync(text);

                    if (result.Reason == ResultReason.SynthesizingAudioCompleted)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"Speech synthesized to [{fileName}] for text [{text}]");
                    }
                    else if (result.Reason == ResultReason.Canceled)
                    {
                        var cancellation = SpeechSynthesisCancellationDetails.FromResult(result);
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");

                        if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
                            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails=[{cancellation.ErrorDetails}]");
                            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        static void Main()
        {
            SynthesisToAudioFileAsync().Wait();
        }
    }
}
````

## Build and run your app

Now you're ready to build your app and test our speech synthesis using the Speech service.

1. **Compile the code** - From the menu bar of Visual Stuio, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**.
2. **Start your app** - From the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** or press **F5**.
3. **Start synthesis** - Your text is converted to speech, and saved in the audio data specified.

   ```text
   Speech synthesized to [helloworld.wav] for text [Hello world!]
   ```
