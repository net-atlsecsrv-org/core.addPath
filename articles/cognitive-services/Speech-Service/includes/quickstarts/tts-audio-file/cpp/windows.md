## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=windows)
> * [Create an empty sample project](../../../../quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=windows)

## Add sample code

1. Open the source file **helloworld.cpp**.

1. Replace all the code with the following snippet:

   ```C++

    // Creates an instance of a speech config with specified subscription key and service region.
    // Replace with your own subscription key and service region (e.g., "westus").
    auto config = SpeechConfig::FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");

    // Creates a speech synthesizer using file as audio output.
    // Replace with your own audio file name.
    auto fileName = "helloworld.wav";
    auto fileOutput = AudioConfig::FromWavFileOutput(fileName);
    auto synthesizer = SpeechSynthesizer::FromConfig(config, fileOutput);

    // Converts the specified text to speech, saving the audio data in the file specified above.
    // Replace with your own text.
    auto text = "Hello world!";
    auto result = synthesizer->SpeakTextAsync(text).get();

    // Checks result for successful completion or errors.
    if (result->Reason == ResultReason::SynthesizingAudioCompleted)
    {
        cout << "Speech synthesized to [" << fileName << "] for text [" << text << "]" << std::endl;
    }
    else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::Canceled)
    {
        auto cancellation = SpeechSynthesisCancellationDetails::FromResult(result);
        cout << "CANCELED: Reason=" << (int)cancellation->Reason << std::endl;

        if (cancellation->Reason == CancellationReason::Error)
        {
            cout << "CANCELED: ErrorCode=" << (int)cancellation->ErrorCode << std::endl;
            cout << "CANCELED: ErrorDetails=[" << cancellation->ErrorDetails << "]" << std::endl;
            cout << "CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?" << std::endl;
        }
    }

   ```

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Replace the string `helloworld.wav` with your own filename.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or press **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Your text is converted to speech, and saved in the audio data specified.

   ```text
   Speech synthesized to [helloworld.wav] for text [Hello world!]
   ```
