This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for .NET Framework (Windows).

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Create a Visual Studio project and install the Speech SDK

You'll need to install the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) so you can reference it in your code. To do that, you may first need to create a **helloworld** project. If you already have a project with the **.NET desktop development** workload available, you can use that project and skip to [Use NuGet Package Manager to install the Speech SDK](#use-nuget-package-manager-to-install-the-speech-sdk).

### Create helloworld project

1. Open Visual Studio 2019.

1. In the Start window, select **Create a new project**. 

1. In the **Create a new project** window, choose **Console App (.NET Framework)**, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Configure your new project** window, enter *helloworld* in **Project name**, choose or create the directory path in **Location**, and then select **Create**.

1. From the Visual Studio menu bar, select **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features**, which opens Visual Studio Installer and displays the **Modifying** dialog box.

1. Check whether the **.NET desktop development** workload is available. If the workload hasn't been installed, select the check box next to it, and then select **Modify** to start the installation. It may take a few minutes to download and install.

   If the check box next to **.NET desktop development** is already selected, select **Close** to exit the dialog box.

1. Close Visual Studio Installer.

### Use NuGet Package Manager to install the Speech SDK

1. In the Solution Explorer, right-click the **helloworld** project, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages** to show the NuGet Package Manager.

1. In the upper-right corner, find the **Package Source** drop-down box, and make sure that **`nuget.org`** is selected.

1. In the upper-left corner, select **Browse**.

1. In the search box, type *Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech* and select **Enter**.

1. From the search results, select the **Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech** package, and then select **Install** to install the latest stable version.

   ![Install Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech NuGet package](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-03-nuget-install-1.0.0.png)

1. Accept all agreements and licenses to start the installation.

   After the package is installed, a confirmation appears in the **Package Manager Console** window.

You can now move on to [Next steps](#next-steps) below.
