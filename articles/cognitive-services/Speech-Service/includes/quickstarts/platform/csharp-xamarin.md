This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for [Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/get-started/what-is-xamarin), an open-source platform for building modern and performant applications for iOS, Android, and Windows with .NET. If you just want the package name to get started on your own, run `Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` in the NuGet console.
