## Supported operating systems

- The Java Speech SDK package is available for these operating systems:
  - Windows: 64-bit only
  - Mac: macOS X version 10.13 or later
  - Linux: 64-bit only on Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, or Debian 9

## Prerequisites

- [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) or [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

- [Eclipse Java IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (requires Java already installed)
- Supported Linux platforms will require certain libraries installed (`libssl` for secure sockets layer support and `libasound2` for sound support). Refer to your distribution below for the commands needed to install the correct versions of these libraries.

  - On Ubuntu, run the following commands to install the required packages:

        ```sh
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.0 libasound2
        ```

  - On Debian 9, run the following commands to install the required packages:

        ```sh
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.2 libasound2
        ```

- On Windows, you need the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) for your platform. Note that installing this for the first time may require you to restart Windows before continuing with this guide.
