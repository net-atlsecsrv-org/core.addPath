This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for 64-bit Java 8 JRE. If you just want the package name to get started on your own, the Java SDK is not available in the Maven central repository. Whether you're using Gradle or a `pom.xml` dependency file, you need to add a custom repository pointing to `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` (see below for package name).

> [!NOTE]
> For the Speech Devices SDK and the Roobo device, see [Speech Devices SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-devices-sdk.md).

## Supported operating systems

- The Java Speech SDK package is available for these operating systems:
  - Windows: 64-bit only
  - Mac: macOS X version 10.13 or later
  - Linux; see the list of [supported Linux distributions and target architectures](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) or [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

- [Eclipse Java IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (requires Java already installed)
- Supported Linux platforms will require certain libraries installed (`libssl` for secure sockets layer support and `libasound2` for sound support). Refer to your distribution below for the commands needed to install the correct versions of these libraries.

  - On Ubuntu/Debian, run the following commands to install the required packages:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.0 libasound2
    ```

    If libssl1.0.0 is not available, install libssl1.0.x (where x is greater than 0) or libssl1.1 instead.

  - On RHEL/CentOS, run the following commands to install the required packages:

    ```sh
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install alsa-lib java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel openssl
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> - On RHEL/CentOS 7, follow the instructions on [how to configure RHEL/CentOS 7 for Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-rhel-centos-7.md).
> - On RHEL/CentOS 8, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).

- On Windows, you need the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) for your platform. Note that installing this for the first time may require you to restart Windows before continuing with this guide.
