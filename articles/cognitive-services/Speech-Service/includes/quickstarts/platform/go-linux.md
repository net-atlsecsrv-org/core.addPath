This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for Linux

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

## System requirements

Linux; see the list of [supported Linux distributions and target architectures](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you'll need:

* gcc
* [Go binary (1.13 or later)](https://golang.org/dl/)

* Supported Linux platforms will require certain libraries installed (`libssl` for secure sockets layer support and `libasound2` for sound support). Refer to your distribution below for the commands needed to install the correct versions of these libraries.

   * On Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.0 libasound2 wget
     ```

     If libssl1.0.0 is not available, install libssl1.0.x (where x is greater than 0) or libssl1.1 instead.

   * On RHEL/CentOS:

     ```sh
     sudo yum update
     sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"
     sudo yum install alsa-lib openssl wget
     ```

> [!NOTE]
> - On RHEL/CentOS 7, follow the instructions on [how to configure RHEL/CentOS 7 for Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-rhel-centos-7.md).
> - On RHEL/CentOS 8, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-sdk](linux-install-sdk.md)]


## Configure Go environment

Perform the following steps to set up your Go environment to find the Speech SDK. In both steps, replace `<architecture>` with the processor architecture of your CPU. This will be `x86`, `x64`, `arm32`, or `arm64`.

1. Since the bindings rely on `cgo`, you need to set the environment variables so Go can find the SDK:

   ```sh
   export CGO_CFLAGS="-I$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api"
   export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/<architecture> -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core"
   ```

1. To run applications including the SDK, we need to tell the OS
where to find the libs:

   ```sh
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/<architecture>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
   ```
