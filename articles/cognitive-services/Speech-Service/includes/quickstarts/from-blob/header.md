In this quickstart, you will use a REST API to recognize speech from files in a batch process. A batch process executes the speech transcription without any user interactions. It gives you a simple programming model, without the need to manage concurrency, custom speech models, or other details. It entails advanced control options, while making efficient use of Azure speech service resources.

The [batch transcription overview](../../../batch-transcription.md) describes the details to use this feature. The detailed API is available as a [Swagger document](https://westus.cris.ai/swagger/ui/index#/Custom%20Speech%20transcriptions%3A), under the heading `Custom Speech transcriptins`. 

The following quickstart will walk you through a usage sample.
