In this quickstart you will use the [Batch Transcription REST API](../../../batch-transcription.md) to recognize speech stored in a [SAS blob](https://aka.ms/ignite2019/speech/placeholder). After satisfying a few prerequisites, recognizing speech using a REST API only takes a few steps:

> * Download the transcription results when done.
