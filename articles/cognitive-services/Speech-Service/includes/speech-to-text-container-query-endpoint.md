The container provides websocket-based query endpoint APIs, that are accessed through the [Speech SDK](../index.yml). By default, the Speech SDK uses online speech services. To use the container, you need to change the initialization method.

> [!TIP]
> When using the Speech SDK with containers, you do not need to provide the Azure Speech resource [subscription key or an authentication bearer token](../rest-speech-to-text.md#authentication).

See the examples below.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

Change from using this Azure-cloud initialization call:

```csharp
var config = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");
```

to this call using the container [host](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.fromhost?view=azure-dotnet):

```csharp
var config = SpeechConfig.FromHost(
    new Uri("ws://localhost:5000"));
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

Change from using this Azure-cloud initialization call:

```python
speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(
    subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)
```
