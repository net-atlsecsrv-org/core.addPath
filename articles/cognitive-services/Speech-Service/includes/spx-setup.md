## Download and install

#### [Windows Install](#tab/windowsinstall)

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI on Windows:

1. On Windows, you need the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) for your platform. Installing this for the first time may require a restart.
2. Download the Speech CLI [zip archive](https://aka.ms/speech/spx-zips.zip), then extract it.
3. Go to the directory where you extracted `spx-zips`. This folder contains program files for the Speech CLI on a variety of platforms. 
4. Extract the files for your platform (`spx-net471` for .NET Framework 4.7, or `spx-netcore-win-x64` for .NET Core 3.0 on an x64 CPU). Keep in mind that you'll run `spx` from this directory.

### Run the Speech CLI

1. Open the command prompt or PowerShell, then navigate to the directory where you extracted the Speech CLI.  
2. Type `spx` to see help commands for the Speech CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> Powershell does not check the local directory when looking for a command. In Powershell, change directory to the location of `spx` and call the tool by entering `.\spx`.
> If you add this directory to your path, Powershell and the Windows command prompt will find `spx` from any directory without including the `.\` prefix.

### Font limitations

On Windows, the Speech CLI can only show fonts available to the command prompt on the local computer.
[Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) supports all fonts produced interactively by the Speech CLI.

If you output to a file, a text editor like Notepad or a web browser like Microsoft Edge can also show all fonts.

#### [Linux Install](#tab/linuxinstall)

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI on Linux on an x64 CPU:

1. Install [.NET Core 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).
2. Download the Speech CLI [zip archive](https://aka.ms/speech/spx-zips.zip), then extract it.
3. Go to the root directory `spx-zips` that you extracted from the download, and extract `spx-netcore-30-linux-x64` to a new `~/spx` directory.
4. In a terminal, type these commands:
   1. `cd ~/spx`
   2. `sudo chmod +r+x spx`
   3. `PATH=~/spx:$PATH`

Type `spx` to see help for the Speech CLI.

#### [Docker Install (Windows, Linux, macOS)](#tab/dockerinstall)

Follow these steps to install the Speech CLI in a Docker container:

1. <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank">Install Docker Desktop<span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> for your platform if it isn't already installed.
2. In a new command prompt or terminal, type this command:
   ```shell   
   docker pull msftspeech/spx
   ```
3. Type this command. You should see help information for Speech CLI:
   ```shell 
   docker run -it --rm msftspeech/spx help
   ```

### Mount a directory in the container

The Speech CLI tool saves configuration settings as files, and loads these files when performing any command (except help commands).
When using Speech CLI within a Docker container, you must mount a local directory from the container, so the tool can store or find the configuration settings,
and also so the tool can read or write any files required by the command, such as audio files of speech.

On Windows, type this command to create a local directory Speech CLI can use from within the container:

`mkdir c:\spx-data`

Or on Linux or macOS, type this command in a terminal to create a directory and see its absolute path:

```bash
mkdir ~/spx-data
cd ~/spx-data
pwd
```

You will use the absolute path when you call Speech CLI.

### Run Speech CLI in the container

This documentation shows the Speech CLI `spx` command used in non-Docker installations.
When calling the `spx` command in a Docker container,
you must mount a directory in the container to your filesystem where the Speech CLI can store and find configuration values and read and write files.

On Windows, your commands will start like this:

```shell
docker run -it -v c:\spx-data:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
```

On Linux or macOS, your commands will look like the sample below. Replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH` with the absolute path for your mounted directory. This path was returned by the `pwd` command in the previous section. 

If you run this command before setting your key and region, you will get an error telling you to set your key and region:
```shell   
sudo docker run -it -v ABSOLUTE_PATH:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
```

To use the `spx` command installed in a container, always enter the full command shown above, followed by the parameters of your request.
For example, on Windows, this command sets your key:

```shell
docker run -it -v c:\spx-data:/data --rm msftspeech/spx config @key --set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY
```

For more extended interaction with the command line tool, you can start a container with an interactive bash shell by adding an entrypoint parameter.
On Windows, enter this command to start a container that exposes an interactive command line interface where you can enter multiple `spx` commands:
```shell
docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash -v c:\spx-data:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
```

> [!WARNING]
> You cannot use your computer's microphone when you run Speech CLI within a Docker container. However, you can read from and save audio files in your local mounted directory. 

<!-- Need to troubleshoot issues with docker pull image

### Optional: Create a command line shortcut

If you're running the the Speech CLI from a Docker container on Linux or macOS you can create a shortcut. 

Follow these instructions to create a shortcut:
1. Open `.bash_profile` with your favorite text editor. For example:
   ```shell
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```
2. Next, add this function to your `.bash_profile`. Make sure you update this function with the correct path to your mounted directory:
   ```shell   
   spx(){
       sudo docker run -it -v ABSOLUTE_PATH:/data --rm msftspeech/spx
   }
   ```
3. Source your profile:
   ```shell
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```
4. Now instead of running `sudo docker run -it -v ABSOLUTE_PATH:/data --rm msftspeech/spx`, you can just type `spx` followed by arguments. For example: 
   ```shell
   // Get some help
   spx help recognize

   // Recognize speech from an audio file 
   spx recognize --file /mounted/directory/file.wav
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> If you change the mounted directory that Docker is referencing, you need to update the function in `.bash_profile`.

## Create subscription config

To start using the Speech CLI, you need to enter your Speech subscription key and region identifier. 
Get these credentials by following steps in [Try the Speech service for free](../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).
Once you have your subscription key and region identifier (ex. `eastus`, `westus`), run the following commands.

```shell
spx config @key --set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY
spx config @region --set REGION
```

Your subscription authentication is now stored for future SPX requests. If you need to remove either of these stored values, run `spx config @region --clear` or `spx config @key --clear`.
