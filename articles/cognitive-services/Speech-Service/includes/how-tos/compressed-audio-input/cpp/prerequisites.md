Handling compressed audio is implemented using [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org). For licensing reasons GStreamer binaries are not compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. Developers need to install several dependencies and plugins.

# [Ubuntu, 16.04, 18.04 or Debian 9](#tab/debian)

```sh
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-0 \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
```

# [REHL / CentOS](#tab/centos)

```sh
sudo yum install gstreamer1 \
gstreamer1-plugins-base \
gstreamer1-plugins-good \
gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free \
gstreamer1-plugins-ugly-free
```

> [!NOTE]
> On RHEL / CentOS, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](../../../../how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).
