# Quickstart: Synthesize speech with the Speech SDK for .NET Framework (Windows)

Quickstarts are also available for [speech recognition](quickstart-csharp-dotnet-windows.md) and [speech translation](quickstart-translate-speech-dotnetframework-windows.md).

Use this guide to create a text-to-speech console application using the .NET framework for Windows and the Speech SDK. When finished, you can synthesize speech from text, and hear the speech on your speaker in real time.

For a quick demonstration (without building the Visual Studio project yourself, as described in this article), get the latest [Cognitive Services Speech SDK Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk) from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you'll need:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
* A subscription key for the Speech Service. [Get one for free](get-started.md).
* A speaker (or headset) available.

## Create a Visual Studio project

[!INCLUDE [Create project](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-create-speech-project-vs-csharp.md)]

## Add sample code

1. Open **Program.cs** and replace the automatically generated code with this sample:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/text-to-speech/csharp-dotnet-windows/helloworld/Program.cs#code)]

1. Find the string `YourSubscriptionKey`, and replace it with your Speech Services subscription key.

1. Find the string `YourServiceRegion`, and replace it with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription. For example, if you're using the free trial subscription, the region is `westus`.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or select **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Enter an English phrase or sentence. The application transmits your text to the Speech Services, which sends synthesized speech to the application to play on your speaker.
