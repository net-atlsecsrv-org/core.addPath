# Speech Service supported regions

The Speech service allows your application to convert audio to text, perform speech translation, and covert text to speech. The service is available in multiple regions with unique endpoints for the Speech SDK and REST APIs.

Make sure that you use the endpoint that matches the region for your subscription.

## Speech SDK

In the [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md), regions are specified as a string
(for example, as a parameter to `SpeechConfig.FromSubscription` in the Speech SDK for C#).

### Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and translation

The Speech SDK is available in these regions for **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and **translation**:

| Region           | Speech SDK Parameter | Speech Customization Portal    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| West US          | `westus`             | https://westus.cris.ai         |
| West US 2        | `westus2`            | https://westus2.cris.ai        |
| East US          | `eastus`             | https://eastus.cris.ai         |

This is a subset of the publishing regions supported by the [Language Understanding service (LUIS)](/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions).

### Voice assistants

The [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) supports **voice assistant** capabilities in these regions:

| Region         | Speech SDK Parameter |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| West US        | `westus`             |
| West US 2      | `westus2`            |
