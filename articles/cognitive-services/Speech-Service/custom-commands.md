# Custom Commands (Preview)

[Voice assistants](voice-assistants.md) listen to users and take an action in response, often speaking back. They use [speech-to-text](speech-to-text.md) to transcribe the user's speech, then take action on the natural language understanding of the text. This action frequently includes spoken output from the assistant generated with [text-to-speech](text-to-speech.md). Devices connect to assistants with the Speech SDKâ€™s `DialogServiceConnector` object.

**Custom Commands (Preview)** is a streamlined solution for creating a voice assistant. It provides a unified authoring experience, an automatic hosting model, and relatively lower complexity versus other assistant creation options like [Direct Line Speech](direct-line-speech.md). This simplification, however, comes with a reduction in flexibility. So, Custom Commands (Preview) is best suited for task completion or command-and-control scenarios. It's particularly well-matched for Internet of Things (IoT) and headless devices.

For complex conversational interaction and integration with other solutions like the [Virtual Assistant Solution and Enterprise Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-enterprise-template-overview) you're encouraged to use Direct Line Speech.

Good candidates for Custom Commands (Preview) have a fixed vocabulary with well-defined sets of variables. For example, home automation tasks, like controlling a thermostat, are ideal.

## Getting started with Custom Commands (Preview)

The first step for using Custom Commands (Preview) to make a voice assistant is to [get a speech subscription key](get-started.md) and access the Custom Commands (Preview) Builder on the [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com). From there, you can author a new Custom Commands (Preview) Application and publish it, after which an on-device application can communicate with it using the Speech SDK.

## Customization

Voice assistants built using the Speech service can use the full range of customization options available for [speech-to-text](speech-to-text.md), [text-to-speech](text-to-speech.md), and [custom keyword selection](speech-devices-sdk-create-kws.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Customization options vary by language/locale (see [Supported languages](supported-languages.md)).
