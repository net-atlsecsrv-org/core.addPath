# Quickstart: Synthesize speech in C++ on Windows by using the Speech SDK

Quickstarts are also available for [speech-recognition](quickstart-cpp-windows.md) and [speech-translation](quickstart-translate-speech-cpp-windows.md).

In this article, you create a C++ console application for Windows. You use the Cognitive Services [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) to synthesize speech from text in real time and play the speech on your PC's speaker. The application is built with the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later (any edition).

The feature described within this article is available from [Speech SDK 1.5.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech/1.5.0).

For a complete list of languages/voices available for speech synthesis, see [language support](language-support.md#text-to-speech).

## Prerequisites

You need a Speech Services subscription key to complete this Quickstart. You can get one for free. See [Try the Speech Services for free](get-started.md) for details.

## Create a Visual Studio project

[!INCLUDE [Quickstart C++ project](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-cpp-create-proj.md)]

## Add sample code

1. Open the source file *helloworld.cpp*. Replace all the code below the initial include statement (`#include "stdafx.h"` or `#include "pch.h"`) with the following:

   [!code-cpp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/text-to-speech/cpp-windows/helloworld/helloworld.cpp#code)]

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save changes to the project.

## Build and run the app

1. Build the application. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**. The code should compile without errors.

1. Start the application. From the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

1. A console window appears, prompting you to type some text. Type a few words or a sentence. The text that you typed is transmitted to the Speech Services and synthesized to speech, which plays on your speaker.

Additional samples, such as how to save speech to an audio file, are available on GitHub.
