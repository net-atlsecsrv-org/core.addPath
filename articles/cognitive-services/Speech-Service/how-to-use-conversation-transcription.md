# Get started with real-time Conversation Transcription

The Speech SDK's **ConversationTranscriber** API allows you to transcribe meetings and other conversations with the ability to add, remove, and identify multiple participants by streaming audio to the Speech service using `PullStream` or `PushStream`. You first create voice signatures for each participant using the REST API, and then use the voice signatures with the SDK to transcribe conversations. See the Conversation Transcription [overview](conversation-transcription.md) for more information.

## Limitations

* Only available in the following subscription regions: `centralus`, `eastasia`, `eastus`, `westeurope`
* Requires a 7-mic circular multi-microphone array with a playback reference stream. The microphone array should meet [our specification](./speech-devices-sdk-microphone.md).
* The [Speech Devices SDK](speech-devices-sdk.md) provides suitable devices and a sample app demonstrating Conversation Transcription.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and subscription, [try the Speech service for free](overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).
