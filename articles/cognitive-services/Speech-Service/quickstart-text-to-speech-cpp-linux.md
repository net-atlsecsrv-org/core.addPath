# Quickstart: Synthesize speech in C++ on Linux by using the Speech SDK

Quickstarts are also available for [speech-recognition](quickstart-cpp-linux.md).

In this article, you create a C++ console application for Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9). You use the Cognitive Services [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) to synthesize speech from text in real time and play the speech on your PC's speaker. The application is built with the [Speech SDK for Linux](https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary) and your Linux distribution's C++ compiler (for example, `g++`).

## Prerequisites

You need a Speech Services subscription key to complete this Quickstart. You can get one for free. See [Try the Speech Services for free](get-started.md) for details.

## Install Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

The current version of the Cognitive Services Speech SDK is `1.6.0`.

The Speech SDK for Linux can be used to build both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. The required libraries and header files can be downloaded as a tar file from https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary.

Download and install the SDK as follows:

1. Make sure the SDK's dependencies are installed.

   * On Ubuntu:

     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.0 libasound2 wget
     ```

   * On Debian 9:

     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.2 libasound2 wget
     ```

1. Choose a directory to which the Speech SDK files should be extracted, and set the `SPEECHSDK_ROOT` environment variable to point to that directory. This variable makes it easy to refer to the directory in future commands. For example, if you want to use the directory `speechsdk` in your home directory, use a command like the following:

   ```sh
   export SPEECHSDK_ROOT="$HOME/speechsdk"
   ```

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Download and extract the `.tar.gz` archive containing the Speech SDK binaries:

   ```sh
   wget -O SpeechSDK-Linux.tar.gz https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary
   tar --strip 1 -xzf SpeechSDK-Linux.tar.gz -C "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Validate the contents of the top-level directory of the extracted package:

   ```sh
   ls -l "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

   The directory listing should contain the third-party notice and license files, as well as an `include` directory containing header (`.h`) files and a `lib` directory containing libraries.

   [!INCLUDE [Linux Binary Archive Content](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-linuxbinary-content.md)]

## Add sample code

1. Create a C++ source file named `helloworld.cpp`, and paste the following code into it.

   [!code-cpp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/text-to-speech/cpp-linux/helloworld.cpp#code)]

1. In this new file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech Services subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

## Build the app

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to enter the commands below as a _single command line_. The easiest way to do that is to copy the command by using the **Copy** button next to each command, and then paste it at your shell prompt.

* On an **x64**  (64-bit) system, run the following command to build the application.

  ```sh
  g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/cxx_api" -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api" --std=c++14 -lpthread -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core -L "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x64" -l:libasound.so.2
  ```

* On an **x86** (32-bit) system, run the following command to build the application.

  ```sh
  g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/cxx_api" -I "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api" --std=c++14 -lpthread -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core -L "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x86" -l:libasound.so.2
  ```

## Run the app

1. Configure the loader's library path to point to the Speech SDK library.

   * On an **x64** (64-bit) system, enter the following command.

     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x64"
     ```

   * On an **x86** (32-bit) system, enter this command.

     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x86"
     ```

1. Run the application.

   ```sh
   ./helloworld
   ```

1. In the console window, a prompt appears, prompting you to type some text. Type a few words or a sentence. The text that you typed is transmitted to the Speech Services and synthesized to speech, which plays on your speaker.

   ```text
   Type some text that you want to speak...
   > hello
   Speech synthesized to speaker for text [hello]
   Press enter to exit...
   ```
