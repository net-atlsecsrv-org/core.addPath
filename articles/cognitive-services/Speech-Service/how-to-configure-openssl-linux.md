# Configure OpenSSL for Linux

When using any Speech SDK version before 1.9.0, [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) is dynamically configured to the host-system version. In later versions of the Speech SDK, OpenSSL (version [1.1.1b](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2019-February/000147.html)) is statically linked to the core library of the Speech SDK.

To ensure connectivity, verify that OpenSSL certificates have been installed in your system. Run a command:
```bash
openssl version -d
```

The output on Ubuntu/Debian based systems should be:
```
OPENSSLDIR: "/usr/lib/ssl"
```

Check whether there is `certs` subdirectory under OPENSSLDIR. In the example above, it would be `/usr/lib/ssl/certs`.

* If there is `/usr/lib/ssl/certs` and it contains many individual certificate files (with `.crt` or `.pem` extension), there is no need for further actions.

* If OPENSSLDIR is something else than `/usr/lib/ssl` and/or there is a single certificate bundle file instead of multiple individual files, you need to set an appropriate SSL environment variable to indicate where the certificates can be found.

## Examples

- OPENSSLDIR is `/opt/ssl`. There is `certs` subdirectory with many `.crt` or `.pem` files.
Set environment variable `SSL_CERT_DIR` to point at `/opt/ssl/certs` before running a program that uses the Speech SDK. For example:
```bash
export SSL_CERT_DIR=/opt/ssl/certs
```

- OPENSSLDIR is `/etc/pki/tls` (like on RHEL/CentOS based systems). There is `certs` subdirectory with a certificate bundle file, for example `ca-bundle.crt`.
Set environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` to point at that file before running a program that uses the Speech SDK. For example:
```bash
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```
