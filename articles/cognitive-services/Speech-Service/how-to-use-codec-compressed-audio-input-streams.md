# Use codec compressed audio input with the Speech SDK

The Speech service SDK can accept compressed audio formats. It decoompresses the audio before it sends it over the wire to the Speech service as raw PCM.

Platform | Languages | Supported GStreamer version
| :--- | ---: | :---:
Windows (excluding UWP)  | C++, C#, Java, Python | [1.18.3](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.18.3/)
Linux  | C++, C#, Java, Python | [supported Linux distributions and target architectures](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md)
Android  | Java | [1.18.3](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/android/1.18.3/)

## Speech SDK version required for compressed audio input
* Speech SDK version 1.10.0 or later is required for RHEL 8 and CentOS 8
* Speech SDK version 1.11.0 or later is required for for Windows.
* Speech SDK version 1.16.0 or later for latest gstreamer on Windows and Android.
