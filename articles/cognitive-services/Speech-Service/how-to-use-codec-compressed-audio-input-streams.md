# Use codec compressed audio input with the Speech SDK

The Speech service SDK **Compressed Audio Input Stream** API provides a way to stream compressed audio to the Speech service using either a `PullStream` or `PushStream`.

Streaming compressed input audio is currently supported for C#, C++, Java on Windows (UWP applications aren't supported) and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, RHEL 8, CentOS 8). It is also supported for Java in Android and Objective-C in iOS platform.
* Speech SDK version 1.10.0 or later is required for RHEL 8 and CentOS 8
* Speech SDK version 1.11.0 or later is required for for Windows.
