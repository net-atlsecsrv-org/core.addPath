# Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)

The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an XML-based markup language that provides a way to control the pronunciation and *prosody* of text-to-speech. Prosody refers to the rhythm and pitch of speechâ€”its music, if you will. You can specify words phonetically, provide hints for interpreting numbers, insert pauses, control pitch, volume, and rate, and more. For more information, see [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-speech-synthesis-20090303/). 

For a complete list of supported languages, locales, and voices (neural and standard), see [language support](language-support.md#text-to-speech).

The following sections provide samples for common speech synthesis tasks.

## Adjust speaking style for neural voices

You can use SSML to adjust the speaking style when using one of the neural voices.

By default, the text-to-speech service synthesizes text in a neutral style. The neural voices extend SSML with an `<mstts:express-as>` element that converts text to synthesized speech in different speaking styles. Currently, the style tags are only supported with these voices:

* `en-US-JessaNeural` 
* `zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural`.

Speaking style changes can be applied at the sentence level. The styles vary by voice. If a style type is not supported, the service will return the synthesized speech as the default neutral style.

| Voice | Style | Description | 
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| `en-US-JessaNeural` | type=`cheerful` | Expresses an emotion that is positive and happy |
| | type=`empathy` | Expresses a sense of caring and understanding |
| `zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural` | type=`newscast` | Expresses a formal tone, similar to news broadcasts |
| | type=`sentiment ` | Conveys a touching message or a story |

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="https://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xml:lang="en-US">
<voice name='en-US-JessaNeural'>
<mstts:express-as type="cheerful"> 
    That'd be just amazing! 
</mstts:express-as></voice></speak>
```

## Add a break
```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='en-US-Jessa24kRUS'>
    Welcome to Microsoft Cognitive Services <break time="100ms" /> Text-to-Speech API.
</voice> </speak>
```

## Change speaking rate

Speaking rate can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level. Whereas speaking rate can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='en-US-Guy24kRUS'>
<prosody rate="+30.00%">
    Welcome to Microsoft Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech API.
</prosody></voice> </speak>
```

## Pronunciation
```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='en-US-Jessa24kRUS'>
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="t&#x259;mei&#x325;&#x27E;ou&#x325;"> tomato </phoneme>
</voice> </speak>
```

## Change volume

Volume changes can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level. Whereas volume changes can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='en-US-Jessa24kRUS'>
<prosody volume="+20.00%">
    Welcome to Microsoft Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech API.
</prosody></voice> </speak>
```

## Change pitch

Pitch changes can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level. Whereas pitch changes can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
    <voice  name='en-US-Guy24kRUS'>
    Welcome to <prosody pitch="high">Microsoft Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech API.</prosody>
</voice> </speak>
```

## Change pitch contour

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pitch contour changes aren't supported with neural voices.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='en-US-Jessa24kRUS'>
<prosody contour="(80%,+20%) (90%,+30%)" >
    Good morning.
</prosody></voice> </speak>
```

## Use multiple voices
```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='en-US-Jessa24kRUS'>
    Good morning!
</voice>
<voice  name='en-US-Guy24kRUS'>
    Good morning to you too Jessa!
</voice> </speak>
```
