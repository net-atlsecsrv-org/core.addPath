# Enable logging in the Speech SDK

Logging to file is an optional feature for the Speech SDK. During development logging provides additional information and diagnostics from the Speech SDK's core components. It can be enabled by setting the property `Speech_LogFilename` on a speech configuration object to the location and name of the log file. Logging will be activated globally once a recognizer is created from that configuration and can't be disabled afterwards. You can't change the name of a log file during a running logging session.

> [!NOTE]
> Logging is available since Speech SDK version 1.4.0 in all supported Speech SDK programming languages, with the exception of JavaScript.

## Sample

The log file name is specified on a configuration object. Taking the `SpeechConfig` as an example and assuming that you have created an instance called `config`:

```csharp
config.SetProperty(PropertyId.Speech_LogFilename, "LogfilePathAndName");
```

```java
config.setProperty(PropertyId.Speech_LogFilename, "LogfilePathAndName");
```

```C++
config->SetProperty(PropertyId::Speech_LogFilename, "LogfilePathAndName");
```

```Python
config.set_property(speechsdk.PropertyId.Speech_LogFilename, "LogfilePathAndName")
```

```objc
[config setPropertyTo:@"LogfilePathAndName" byId:SPXSpeechLogFilename];
```

You can create a recognizer from the config object. This will enable logging for all recognizers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a `SpeechSynthesizer` from the config object, it will not enable logging. If logging is enabled though, you will also receive diagnostics from the `SpeechSynthesizer`.

## Create a log file on different platforms

For Windows or Linux, the log file can be in any path the user has write permission for. Write permissions to file system locations in other operating systems may be limited or restricted by default.

### Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

UWP applications need to be places log files in one of the application data locations (local, roaming, or temporary). A log file can be created in the local application folder:

```csharp
StorageFolder storageFolder = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;
StorageFile logFile = await storageFolder.CreateFileAsync("logfile.txt", CreationCollisionOption.ReplaceExisting);
config.SetProperty(PropertyId.Speech_LogFilename, logFile.Path);
```

More about file access permission for UWP applications is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/files/file-access-permissions).

### Android

You can save a log file to either internal storage, external storage, or the cache directory. Files created in the internal storage or the cache directory are private to the application. It is preferable to create a log file in external storage.

```java
File dir = context.getExternalFilesDir(null);
File logFile = new File(dir, "logfile.txt");
config.setProperty(PropertyId.Speech_LogFilename, logFile.getAbsolutePath());
```

The code above will save a log file to the external storage in the root of an application-specific directory. A user can access the file with the file manager (usually in `Android/data/ApplicationName/logfile.txt`). The file will be deleted when the application is uninstalled.

You also need to request `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission in the manifest file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="...">
  ...
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  ...
</manifest>
```

More about data and file storage for Android applications is available [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html).

#### iOS

Only directories inside the application sandbox are accessible. Files can be created in the documents, library, and temp directories. Files in the documents directory can be made available to a user. The following code snippet shows creation of a log file in the application document directory:

```objc
NSString *filePath = [
  [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) firstObject]
    stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"logfile.txt"];
[speechConfig setPropertyTo:filePath byId:SPXSpeechLogFilename];
```

To access a created file, add the below properties to the `Info.plist` property list of the application:

```xml
<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
<true/>
<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
<true/>
```
