# Quickstart: Create a project

In this quickstart, you'll create an empty project for your preferred programming language that you'll use to complete a quickstart or create an application.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
**Choose your target environment**
#### [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)
[!INCLUDE [vs](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-create-speech-project-vs-csharp.md)]
#### [Unity](#tab/unity)
#### [UWP](#tab/uwp)

::: zone pivot="programming-language-cpp"
**Choose your target environment**
#### [Linux](#tab/linux)
For this sample, we'll be compiling with g++, so all you need for an empty project is to create a helloworld.cpp with your favorite text editor.
#### [macOS](#tab/macos)
For this sample, we'll be compiling with g++, so all you need for an empty project is to create a helloworld.cpp with your favorite text editor.
#### [Windows](#tab/windows)
[!INCLUDE [C++ quickstart](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-cpp-create-proj.md)]

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
**Choose your target environment**
#### [Java Runtime](#tab/jre)
[!INCLUDE [jre](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-java-create-proj.md)]
#### [Android](#tab/android)
[!INCLUDE [android](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-java-android-create-proj.md)]

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

For the Python-based quickstarts, all you'll need to do is create a file named `helloworld.py` with your favorite text editor or IDE.
