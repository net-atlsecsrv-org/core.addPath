# Quickstart: Asynchronous synthesis for long-form audio in Python (Preview)

In this quickstart, you'll use the Long Audio API to asynchronously convert text to speech, and retrieve the audio output from a URI provided by the service. This REST API is ideal for content providers that need to synthesize audio from text greater than 5,000 character (or more than 10 minutes in length). For more information, see [Long Audio API](../../long-audio-api.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Asynchronous synthesis for long-form audio can only be used with [Custom Neural Voices](../../how-to-custom-voice.md#custom-neural-voices).

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

* Python 2.7.x or 3.x.
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or your favorite text editor.
* An Azure subscription and a Speech service subscription key. [Create an Azure account](../../get-started.md#new-resource) and [create a speech resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started#new-resource) to get the key. When creating the Speech resource, make sure that your pricing tier is set to **S0**, and location is set to a [supported region](../../regions.md#standard-and-neural-voices).

## Create a project and import required modules

Create a new Python project using your favorite IDE or editor. Then copy this code snippet into a file named `voice_synthesis_client.py`.

```python
import argparse
import json
import ntpath
import urllib3
import requests
import time
from json import dumps, loads, JSONEncoder, JSONDecoder
import pickle

urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used these modules, you'll need to install them before running your program. To install these packages, run: `pip install requests urllib3`.

These modules are used to parse arguments, construct the HTTP request, and call the text-to-speech long audio REST API.

## Get a list of supported voices

This code gets a list of available voices that you can use to convert text-to-speech. Add the code to `voice_synthesis_client.py`:

```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Cris client tool to submit voice synthesis requests.')
parser.add_argument('--voices', action="store_true", default=False, help='print voice list')
parser.add_argument('-key', action="store", dest="key", required=True, help='the cris subscription key, like ff1eb62d06d34767bda0207acb1da7d7 ')
parser.add_argument('-region', action="store", dest="region", required=True, help='the region information, could be centralindia, canadacentral or uksouth')
args = parser.parse_args()
baseAddress = 'https://%s.cris.ai/api/texttospeech/v3.0-beta1/' % args.region

def getVoices():
	response=requests.get(baseAddress+"voicesynthesis/voices", headers={"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key":args.key}, verify=False)
	voices = json.loads(response.text)
	return voices

if args.voices:
	voices = getVoices()
	print("There are %d voices available:" % len(voices))
	for voice in voices:
		print ("Name: %s, Description: %s, Id: %s, Locale: %s, Gender: %s, PublicVoice: %s, Created: %s" % (voice['name'], voice['description'], voice['id'], voice['locale'], voice['gender'], voice['isPublicVoice'], voice['created']))
```

### Test your code

Let's test what you've done so far. You'll need to update a few things in the request below:

* Replace `<your_key>` with your Speech service subscription key. This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
* Replace `<region>` with the region where your Speech resource was created (for example: `eastus` or `westus`). This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).

Run this command:

```console
python voice_synthesis_client.py --voices -key <your_key> -region <Region>
```

You'll see an output that looks like this:

```console
There are xx voices available:

Name: Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, xxx), Description: xxx , Id: xxx, Locale: en-US, Gender: Male, PublicVoice: xxx, Created: 2019-07-22T09:38:14Z
Name: Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (zh-CN, xxx), Description: xxx , Id: xxx, Locale: zh-CN, Gender: Female, PublicVoice: xxx, Created: 2019-08-26T04:55:39Z
```

## Prepare input files

Prepare an input text file. It can be either plain text or SSML text. For the input file requirements, see how to [prepare content for synthesis](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/long-audio-api#prepare-content-for-synthesis).

## Convert text to speech

After preparing the input text file, add this code for speech synthesis to `voice_synthesis_client.py`:

> [!NOTE]
> 'concatenateResult' is an optional parameter. If this parameter isn't set, the audio outputs will be generated per paragraph. You can also concatenate the audios into 1 output by setting the parameter. 
> By default, the audio output is set to riff-16khz-16bit-mono-pcm. For more information about supported audio outputs, see [Audio output formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/long-audio-api#audio-output-formats).

```python
parser.add_argument('--submit', action="store_true", default=False, help='submit a synthesis request')
parser.add_argument('--concatenateResult', action="store_true", default=False, help='If concatenate result in a single wave file')
parser.add_argument('-file', action="store", dest="file", help='the input text script file path')
parser.add_argument('-voiceId', action="store", nargs='+', dest="voiceId", help='the id of the voice which used to synthesis')
parser.add_argument('-locale', action="store", dest="locale", help='the locale information like zh-CN/en-US')
parser.add_argument('-format', action="store", dest="format", default='riff-16khz-16bit-mono-pcm', help='the output audio format')

def submitSynthesis():
    modelList = args.voiceId
    data={'name': 'simple test', 'description': 'desc...', 'models': json.dumps(modelList), 'locale': args.locale, 'outputformat': args.format}
    if args.concatenateResult:
        properties={'ConcatenateResult': 'true'}
        data['properties'] = json.dumps(properties)
    if args.file is not None:
	    scriptfilename=ntpath.basename(args.file)
	    files = {'script': (scriptfilename, open(args.file, 'rb'), 'text/plain')}
    response = requests.post(baseAddress+"voicesynthesis", data, headers={"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key":args.key}, files=files, verify=False)
    if response.status_code == 202:
        location = response.headers['Location']
        id = location.split("/")[-1]
        print("Submit synthesis request successful")
        return id
    else:
        print("Submit synthesis request failed")
        print("response.status_code: %d" % response.status_code)
        print("response.text: %s" % response.text)
        return 0

def getSubmittedSynthesis(id):
    response=requests.get(baseAddress+"voicesynthesis/"+id, headers={"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key":args.key}, verify=False)
    synthesis = json.loads(response.text)
    return synthesis

if args.submit:
    id = submitSynthesis()
    if (id == 0):
        exit(1)

    while(1):
        print("\r\nChecking status")
        synthesis=getSubmittedSynthesis(id)
        if synthesis['status'] == "Succeeded":
            r = requests.get(synthesis['resultsUrl'])
            filename=id + ".zip"
            with open(filename, 'wb') as f:  
                f.write(r.content)
                print("Succeeded... Result file downloaded : " + filename)
            break
        elif synthesis['status'] == "Failed":
            print("Failed...")
            break
        elif synthesis['status'] == "Running":
            print("Running...")
        elif synthesis['status'] == "NotStarted":
            print("NotStarted...")
        time.sleep(10)
```

### Test your code

Let's make a request to synthesize text using your input file as the source. You'll need to update a few things in the request below:

* Replace `<your_key>` with your Speech service subscription key. This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
* Replace `<region>` with the region where your Speech resource was created (for example: `eastus` or `westus`). This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
* Replace `<input>` with the path to the text file you've prepared for text-to-speech.
* Replace `<locale>` with the desired output locale. For more information, see [language support](../../language-support.md#neural-voices).
* Replace `<voice_guid>` with the desired output voice. Use one of the voices returned by [Get a list of supported voices](#get-a-list-of-supported-voices).

Convert text to speech with this command:

```console
python voice_synthesis_client.py --submit -key <your_key> -region <Region> -file <input> -locale <locale> -voiceId <voice_guid>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have more than 1 input files, you will need to submit multiple requests. There are some limitations that needs to be aware. 
> * The client is allowed to submit up to **5** requests to server per second for each Azure subscription account. If it exceeds the limitation, client will get a 429 error code(too many requests). Please reduce the request amount per second
> * The server is allowed to run and queue up to **120** requests for each Azure subscription account. If it exceeds the limitation, server will return a 429 error code(too many requests). Please wait and avoid submitting new request until some requests are completed

You'll see an output that looks like this:

```console
Submit synthesis request successful

Checking status
NotStarted...

Checking status
Running...

Checking status
Running...

Checking status
Succeeded... Result file downloaded : xxxx.zip
```

The result contains the input text and the audio output files that are generated by the service. You can download these files in a zip.

## Remove previous requests

The server will keep up to **20,000** requests for each Azure subscription account. If your request amount exceeds this limitation, please remove previous requests before making new ones. If you don't remove existing requests, you'll receive an error notification.

Add the code to `voice_synthesis_client.py`:

```python
parser.add_argument('--syntheses', action="store_true", default=False, help='print synthesis list')
parser.add_argument('--delete', action="store_true", default=False, help='delete a synthesis request')
parser.add_argument('-synthesisId', action="store", nargs='+', dest="synthesisId", help='the id of the voice synthesis which need to be deleted')

def getSubmittedSyntheses():
    response=requests.get(baseAddress+"voicesynthesis", headers={"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key":args.key}, verify=False)
    syntheses = json.loads(response.text)
    return syntheses

def deleteSynthesis(ids):
    for id in ids:
        print("delete voice synthesis %s " % id)
        response = requests.delete(baseAddress+"voicesynthesis/"+id, headers={"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key":args.key}, verify=False)
        if (response.status_code == 204):
            print("delete successful")
        else:
            print("delete failed, response.status_code: %d, response.text: %s " % (response.status_code, response.text))

if args.syntheses:
    synthese = getSubmittedSyntheses()
    print("There are %d synthesis requests submitted:" % len(synthese))
    for synthesis in synthese:
        print ("ID : %s , Name : %s, Status : %s " % (synthesis['id'], synthesis['name'], synthesis['status']))

if args.delete:
	deleteSynthesis(args.synthesisId)
```

### Test your code

Now, let's check to see what requests you've previously submitted. Before you continue, you'll need to update a few things in this request:

* Replace `<your_key>` with your Speech service subscription key. This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
* Replace `<region>` with the region where your Speech resource was created (for example: `eastus` or `westus`). This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).

Run this command:

```console
python voice_synthesis_client.py --syntheses -key <your_key> -region <Region>
```

This will return a list of synthesis requests that you've made. You'll see an output like this:

```console
There are <number> synthesis requests submitted:
ID : xxx , Name : xxx, Status : Succeeded
ID : xxx , Name : xxx, Status : Running
ID : xxx , Name : xxx : Succeeded
```

Now, let's remove a previously submitted request. You'll need to update a few things in the code below:

* Replace `<your_key>` with your Speech service subscription key. This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
* Replace `<region>` with the region where your Speech resource was created (for example: `eastus` or `westus`). This information is available in the **Overview** tab for your resource in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
* Replace `<synthesis_id>` with the value returned in the previous request.

> [!NOTE]
> Requests with a status of ‘Running’/'Waiting' cannot be removed or deleted.

Run this command:

```console
python voice_synthesis_client.py --delete -key <your_key> -region <Region> -synthesisId <synthesis_id>
```

You'll see an output like this:

```console
delete voice synthesis xxx
delete successful
```
