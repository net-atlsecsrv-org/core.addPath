# Quickstart: Synthesize speech in Objective-C on iOS using the Speech SDK

In this article, you learn how to create an iOS app in Objective-C using the Cognitive Services Speech SDK to synthesize speech from text.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, here's a list of prerequisites:

* A [subscription key](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/get-started.md) for the Speech service
* A macOS machine with [Xcode 9.4.1](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or later
* The target set to iOS version 9.3 or later

## Get the Speech SDK for iOS

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

Note that this tutorial will not work with version of the SDK earlier than 1.7.0.

The Cognitive Services Speech SDK for iOS is currently distributed as a Cocoa Framework.
It can be used in Xcode projects as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/), or downloaded from https://aka.ms/csspeech/iosbinary and linked manually. This guide uses a CocoaPod.

## Create an Xcode Project

Start Xcode, and start a new project by clicking **File** > **New** > **Project**.
In the template selection dialog, choose the "iOS Single View App" template.

In the dialogs that follow, make the following selections:

1. Project Options Dialog
    1. Enter a name for the quickstart app, for example `helloworld`.
    1. Enter an appropriate organization name and organization identifier, if you already have an Apple developer account. For testing purposes, you can just pick any name like `testorg`. To sign the app, you need a proper provisioning profile. Refer to the [Apple developer site](https://developer.apple.com/) for details.
    1. Make sure Objective-C is chosen as the language for the project.
    1. Disable all checkboxes for tests and core data.
    ![Project Settings](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/media/sdk/qs-objectivec-project-settings.png)
1. Select project directory
    1. Choose your home directory to put the project in. This creates a `helloworld` directory in your home directory that contains all the files for the Xcode project.
    1. Disable the creation of a Git repo for this example project.

## Install the SDK as a CocoaPod

1. Install the CocoaPod dependency manager as described in its [installation instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
1. Navigate to the directory of your sample app (`helloworld`). Place a text file with the name `Podfile` and the following content in that directory:  
   [!code-ruby[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/objectivec/ios/text-to-speech/helloworld/Podfile)]
1. Navigate to the `helloworld` directory in a terminal and run the command `pod install`. This will generate a `helloworld.xcworkspace` Xcode workspace containing both the sample app and the Speech SDK as a dependency. This workspace will be used in the following.

## Add the sample code

1. Open the `helloworld.xcworkspace` workspace in Xcode.
1. Replace the contents of the autogenerated `AppDelegate.m` file by:  
   [!code-objectivec[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/objectivec/ios/text-to-speech/helloworld/helloworld/AppDelegate.m#code)]
1. Replace the contents of the autogenerated `ViewController.m` file by:  
   [!code-objectivec[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/objectivec/ios/text-to-speech/helloworld/helloworld/ViewController.m#code)]
1. Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

## Build and run the sample

1. Make the debug output visible (**View** > **Debug Area** > **Activate Console**).
1. Choose either the iOS simulator or an iOS device connected to your development machine as the destination for the app from the list in the **Product** > **Destination** menu.
1. Build and run the example code in the iOS simulator by selecting **Product** > **Run** from the menu or clicking the **Play** button.

   ![Simulated iOS App](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/media/sdk/qs-objectivec-simulated-app-tts.png)

1. After you input some text and click the button in the app, you should hear the synthesized audio played.
