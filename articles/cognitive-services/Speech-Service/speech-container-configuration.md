# Configure Speech Service containers

Speech containers enable customers to build one speech application architecture that is optimized to take advantage of both robust cloud capabilities and edge locality. The two speech containers we support now are **speech-to-text** and **text-to-speech**. 

The **Speech** container runtime environment is configured using the `docker run` command arguments. This container has several required settings, along with a few optional settings. Several [examples](#example-docker-run-commands) of the command are available. The container-specific settings are the billing settings. 

# Configuration settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration settings table](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-table.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [`ApiKey`](#apikey-configuration-setting), [`Billing`](#billing-configuration-setting), and [`Eula`](#eula-setting) settings are used together, and you must provide valid values for all three of them; otherwise your container won't start. For more information about using these configuration settings to instantiate a container, see [Billing](speech-container-howto.md#billing).

## ApiKey configuration setting

The `ApiKey` setting specifies the Azure resource key used to track billing information for the container. You must specify a value for the ApiKey and the value must be a valid key for the _Speech_ resource specified for the [`Billing`](#billing-configuration-setting) configuration setting.

This setting can be found in the following place:

* Azure portal: **Speech's** Resource Management, under **Keys**

## ApplicationInsights setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration ApplicationInsights settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-application-insights.md)]

## Billing configuration setting

The `Billing` setting specifies the endpoint URI of the _Speech_ resource on Azure used to meter billing information for the container. You must specify a value for this configuration setting, and the value must be a valid endpoint URI for a _Speech_ resource on Azure. The container reports usage about every 10 to 15 minutes.

This setting can be found in the following place:

* Azure portal: **Speech's** Overview, labeled `Endpoint`

|Required| Name | Data type | Description |
|--|------|-----------|-------------|
|Yes| `Billing` | String | Billing endpoint URI<br><br>Example:<br>`Billing=https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0` |

## Eula setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration eula settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-eula.md)]

## Fluentd settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-fluentd.md)]

## Http proxy credentials settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-http-proxy.md)]

## Logging settings
 
[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration logging settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-logging.md)]

## Mount settings

Use bind mounts to read and write data to and from the container. You can specify an input mount or output mount by specifying the `--mount` option in the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command.

The Speech containers don't use input or output mounts to store training or service data. 

The exact syntax of the host mount location varies depending on the host operating system. Additionally, the [host computer](speech-container-howto.md#the-host-computer)'s mount location may not be accessible due to a conflict between permissions used by the docker service account and the host mount location permissions. 

|Optional| Name | Data type | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
|Not allowed| `Input` | String | Speech containers do not use this.|
|Optional| `Output` | String | The target of the output mount. The default value is `/output`. This is the location of the logs. This includes container logs. <br><br>Example:<br>`--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output`|

## Example docker run commands 

The following examples use the configuration settings to illustrate how to write and use `docker run` commands.  Once running, the container continues to run until you [stop](speech-container-howto.md#stop-the-container) it.

* **Line-continuation character**: The Docker commands in the following sections use the back slash, `\`, as a line continuation character. Replace or remove this based on your host operating system's requirements. 
* **Argument order**: Do not change the order of the arguments unless you are very familiar with Docker containers.

Replace {_argument_name_} with your own values:

| Placeholder | Value | Format or example |
|-------------|-------|---|
|{BILLING_KEY} | The endpoint key of the Speech resource. |xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|
|{BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} | The billing endpoint value including region.|`https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0`|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](#billing-configuration-setting).
> The ApiKey value is the **Key** from the Azure Speech Resource keys page. 

## Speech container Docker examples

The following Docker examples are for the Speech container. 

### Basic example for speech to text

```Docker
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 2 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-to-text \
Eula=accept \
Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={BILLING_KEY}   
```

### Basic example for text to speech

```Docker
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 2 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-text-to-speech \
Eula=accept \
Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={BILLING_KEY}  
```

### Logging example for speech to text

```Docker
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 2 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-to-text \
Eula=accept \
Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={BILLING_KEY}   
  Logging:Console:LogLevel:Default=Information
```

### Logging example for text to speech

```Docker
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 2 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-text-to-speech \
Eula=accept \
Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={BILLING_KEY}  
  Logging:Console:LogLevel:Default=Information
```
