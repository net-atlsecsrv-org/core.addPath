# Get facial pose events

> [!NOTE]
> Viseme only works for `en-US-AriaNeural` voice for now.

A viseme is the visual description of a phoneme in spoken language.
It defines the position of the face and mouth when speaking a word.
Each viseme depicts the key facial poses for a specific set of phonemes.
There is no one-to-one correspondence between visemes and phonemes.
Often several phonemes correspond to a single viseme, as several phonemes look the same on the face when produced, such as `s` and `z`.
See the [mapping table between visemes and phonemes](#map-phonemes-to-visemes).

Using visemes, you can create more natural and intelligent news broadcast assistant, more interactive gaming and cartoon characters, and more intuitive language teaching videos. People with hearing impairment can also pick up sounds visually and "lip-read" speech content that shows visemes on an animated face.

## Get viseme events with the Speech SDK

To make viseme events, we convert input text into a set of phoneme sequences and their corresponding viseme sequences. We estimate the start time of each viseme in the speech audio. Viseme events contain a sequence of viseme IDs, each with an offset into the audio where that viseme appears. These events can drive mouth animations that simulate a person speaking the input text.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Viseme ID | Integer number that specifies a viseme. In English (United States), we offer 22 different visemes to depict the mouth shapes for a specific set of phonemes. See the [mapping table between Viseme ID and phonemes](#map-phonemes-to-visemes).  |
| Audio offset | The start time of each viseme, in ticks (100 nanoseconds). |

To get viseme events, subscribe to the `VisemeReceived` event in Speech SDK.
The following snippets show how to subscribe the viseme event.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
using (var synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, audioConfig))
{
    // Subscribes to viseme received event
    synthesizer.VisemeReceived += (s, e) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Viseme event received. Audio offset: " +
            $"{e.AudioOffset / 10000}ms, viseme id: {e.VisemeId}.");
    };

    var result = await synthesizer.SpeakSsmlAsync(ssml));
}

```

::: zone pivot="programming-language-cpp"

```cpp
auto synthesizer = SpeechSynthesizer::FromConfig(speechConfig, audioConfig);

// Subscribes to viseme received event
synthesizer->VisemeReceived += [](const SpeechSynthesisVisemeEventArgs& e)
{
    cout << "viseme event received. "
        // The unit of e.AudioOffset is tick (1 tick = 100 nanoseconds), divide by 10,000 to convert to milliseconds.
        << "Audio offset: " << e.AudioOffset / 10000 << "ms, "
        << "viseme id: " << e.VisemeId << "." << endl;
};

auto result = synthesizer->SpeakSsmlAsync(ssml).get();
```

synthesizer.VisemeReceived.addEventListener((o, e) -> {
    // The unit of e.AudioOffset is tick (1 tick = 100 nanoseconds), divide by 10,000 to convert to milliseconds.
    System.out.print("Viseme event received. Audio offset: " + e.getAudioOffset() / 10000 + "ms, ");
    System.out.println("viseme id: " + e.getVisemeId() + ".");
});

SpeechSynthesisResult result = synthesizer.SpeakSsmlAsync(ssml).get();
```

    "Viseme event received: audio offset: {}ms, viseme id: {}.".format(evt.audio_offset / 10000, evt.viseme_id)))

## Map phonemes to visemes

Visemes vary by language. Each language has a set of visemes that correspond to its specific phonemes. The following table shows the correspondence between International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) phonemes and viseme IDs for English (United States).
