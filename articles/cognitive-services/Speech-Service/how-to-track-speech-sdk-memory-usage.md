# How to track Speech SDK memory usage

The Speech SDK is based on a native code base that's projected into multiple programming languages through a series of interoperability layers. Each language-specific projection has idiomatically correct features to manage the object lifecycle. Additionally, the Speech SDK includes memory management tooling to track resource usage with object logging and object limits. 

## How to read object logs

If [Speech SDK logging is enabled](how-to-use-logging.md), tracking tags are emitted to enable historical object observation. These tags include: 

* `TrackHandle` or `StopTracking` 
* The object type
* The current number of objects that are tracked the type of the object, and the current number being tracked.

Here's a sample log: 

```terminal
(284): 8604ms SPX_DBG_TRACE_VERBOSE:  handle_table.h:90 TrackHandle type=Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Impl::ISpxRecognitionResult handle=0x0x7f688401e1a0, ptr=0x0x7f688401e1a0, total=19
```

## Set a warning threshold

You have the option to create a warning threshold, and if that threshold is exceeded (assuming logging is enabled), a warning message is logged. The warning message contains a dump of all objects in existence along with their count. This information can be used to better understand issues. 

To enable a warning threshold, it must be specified on a `SpeechConfig` object. This object is checked when a new recognizer is created. In the following examples, let's assume that you've created an instance of `SpeechConfig` called `config`:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
config.SetProperty("SPEECH-ObjectCountWarnThreshold", "10000");
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-cpp"

```C++
config->SetProperty("SPEECH-ObjectCountWarnThreshold", "10000");
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

```java
config.setProperty("SPEECH-ObjectCountWarnThreshold", "10000");
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

```Python
speech_config.set_property_by_name("SPEECH-ObjectCountWarnThreshold", "10000")?
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-more"

```ObjectiveC
[config setPropertyTo:@"10000" byName:"SPEECH-ObjectCountWarnThreshold"];
```

::: zone-end

> [!TIP]
> The default value for this property is 10,000.

## Set an error threshold 

Using the Speech SDK, you can set the maximum number of objects allowed at a given time. If this setting is enabled, when the maximum number is hit, attempts to create new recognizer objects will fail. Existing objects will continue to work.

Here's a sample error:

```terminal
Runtime error: The maximum object count of 500 has been exceeded.
The threshold can be adjusted by setting the SPEECH-ObjectCountErrorThreshold property on the SpeechConfig object.
See http://https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-object-tracking-speech-sdk for more detailed information.
Handle table dump by ojbect type:
class Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Impl::ISpxRecognitionResult 0
class Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Impl::ISpxRecognizer 0
class Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Impl::ISpxAudioConfig 0
class Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Impl::ISpxSpeechConfig 0
```

To enable an error threshold, it must be specified on a `SpeechConfig` object. This object is checked when a new recognizer is created. In the following examples, let's assume that you've created an instance of `SpeechConfig` called `config`:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
config.SetProperty("SPEECH-ObjectCountErrorThreshold", "10000");
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-cpp"

```C++
config->SetProperty("SPEECH-ObjectCountErrorThreshold", "10000");
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

```java
config.setProperty("SPEECH-ObjectCountErrorThreshold", "10000");
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

```Python
speech_config.set_property_by_name("SPEECH-ObjectCountErrorThreshold", "10000")?
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-more"

```objc
[config setPropertyTo:@"10000" byName:"SPEECH-ObjectCountErrorThreshold"];
```

::: zone-end

> [!TIP]
> The default value for this property is the platform-specific maximum value for a `size_t` data type. A typical recognition will consume between 7 and 10 internal objects.
