# Azure security baseline for Cognitive Services

The Azure Security Baseline for Cognitive Services contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Cognitive Services provides a layered security model. This model enables you to secure your Cognitive Services accounts to a specific subset of networks. When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data over the specified set of networks can access the account. You can limit access to your resources with request filtering, allowing only requests that originate from specified IP addresses, IP ranges, or from a list of subnets in Azure Virtual Networks.

Virtual network and service endpoint support for Cognitive Services is limited to a specific set of regions.

* [Overview of Azure Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: When Virtual Machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cognitive Services container, you can use network security groups (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

* [How to Enable NSG Flow Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal)

* [How to Enable and use Traffic Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: If you are using Cognitive Services within a container, you may augment your container deployment with a front-facing web-application firewall solution that filters malicious traffic and supports end-to-end TLS encryption, keeping the container endpoint private and secure.

Bear in mind that Cognitive Services containers are required to submit metering information for billing purposes. The only exception, is Offline containers as they follow a different billing methodology. Failure to allow list various network channels that the Cognitive Services containers rely on will prevent the container from working. The host should allow list port 443 and the following domains:
- *.cognitive.microsoft.com
- *.cognitiveservices.azure.com

Also note that you must disable deep packet inspection for your firewall solution on the secure channels that the Cognitive Services containers create to Microsoft servers. Failure to do so will prevent the container from functioning correctly.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: When virtual machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cognitive Services container, define and implement standard security configurations for related network resources with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.CognitiveServices" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Cache for Redis instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions such as:
- DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: If using Cognitive Services within a container, you may augment your container deployment with a front-facing web-application firewall solution that filters malicious traffic and supports end-to-end TLS encryption, keeping the container endpoint private and secure. You can select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with the ability to disable payload inspection.

Bear in mind that Cognitive Services containers are required to submit metering information for billing purposes. The only exception is Offline containers as they follow a different billing methodology. Failure to allow list various network channels that the Cognitive Services containers rely on will prevent the container from working. The host should allow list port 443 and the following domains:
- *.cognitive.microsoft.com
- *.cognitiveservices.azure.com

Also note that you must disable deep packet inspection for your firewall solution on the secure channels that the Cognitive Services containers create to Microsoft servers. Failure to do so will prevent the container from functioning correctly.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

You may also use application security groups (ASG) to help simplify complex security configuration. ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.
