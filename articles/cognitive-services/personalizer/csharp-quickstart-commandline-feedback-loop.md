# Quickstart: Personalizer client library for .NET

Display personalized content in this C# quickstart with the Personalizer service.

Get started with the Personalizer client library for .NET. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

 * Rank a list of actions for personalization.
 * Report reward score indicating success of top ranked action.

[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Personalizer?view=azure-dotnet-preview) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/Personalizer) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Personalizer/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-personalizer-samples)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).

## Using this quickstart

There are several steps to use this quickstart:

* In the Azure portal, create a Personalizer resource
* In the Azure portal, for the Personalizer resource, on the **Configuration** page, change the model update frequency
* In a code editor, create a code file and edit the code file
* In the command line or terminal, install the SDK from the command line
* In the command line or terminal, run the code file

## Create a Personalizer Azure resource

Create a resource for Personalizer using the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up, it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, create two [environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication):

* `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_KEY` for the resource key.
* `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT` for the resource endpoint.

In the Azure portal, both the key and endpoint values are available from the **quickstart** page.

## Change the model update frequency

In the Azure portal, in the Personalizer resource on the **Configuration** page, change the **Model update frequency** to 10 seconds. This short duration will train the service rapidly, allowing you to see how the top action changes for each iteration.

![Change model update frequency](./media/settings/configure-model-update-frequency-settings.png)

When a Personalizer loop is first instantiated, there is no model since there has been no Reward API calls to train from. Rank calls will return equal probabilities for each item. Your application should still always rank content using the output of RewardActionId.

## Create a new C# application

Create a new .NET Core application in your preferred editor or IDE. 

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the dotnet `new` command to create a new console app with the name `personalizer-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: `Program.cs`. 

```console
dotnet new console -n personalizer-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

## Install the SDK

Within the application directory, install the Personalizer client library for .NET with the following command:

```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Personalizer --version 0.8.0-preview
```

If you're using the Visual Studio IDE, the client library is available as a downloadable NuGet package.

## Object model

The Personalizer client is a [PersonalizerClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.personalizerclient?view=azure-dotnet) object that authenticates to Azure using Microsoft.Rest.ServiceClientCredentials, which contains your key.

To ask for a rank of the content, create a [RankRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.models.rankrequest?view=azure-dotnet-preview), then pass it to [client.Rank](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.personalizerclientextensions.rank?view=azure-dotnet-preview) method. The Rank method returns a RankResponse, containing the ranked content. 

To send a reward to Personalizer, create a [RewardRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.models.rewardrequest?view=azure-dotnet-preview), then pass it to the [client.Reward](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.personalizerclientextensions.reward?view=azure-dotnet-preview) method. 

Determining the reward, in this quickstart is trivial. In a production system, the determination of what impacts the [reward score](concept-rewards.md) and by how much can be a complex process, that you may decide to change over time. This design decision should be one of the primary decisions in your Personalizer architecture. 

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Personalizer client library for .NET:

* [Create a Personalizer client](#create-a-personalizer-client)
* [Request a rank](#request-a-rank)
* [Send a reward](#send-a-reward)

## Add the dependencies

From the project directory, open the **Program.cs** file in your preferred editor or IDE. Replace the existing `using` code with the following `using` directives:

[!code-csharp[Using statements](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=Dependencies)]

## Add Personalizer resource information

In the **Program** class, create variables for your resource's Azure key and endpoint pulled from the environment variables, named `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_KEY` and `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT`. If you created the environment variables after the application is launched, the editor, IDE, or shell running it will need to be closed and reloaded to access the variable. The methods will be created later in this quickstart.

[!code-csharp[Create variables to hold the Personalizer resource key and endpoint values found in the Azure portal.](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=classVariables)]

## Create a Personalizer client

Next, create a method to return a Personalizer client. The parameter to the method is the `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT` and the ApiKey is the `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_KEY`.

[!code-csharp[Create the Personalizer client](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=authorization)]

## Get food items as rankable actions

Actions represent the content choices you want Personalizer to rank. Add the following methods to the Program class to represent the set of actions to rank.

[!code-csharp[Food items as actions](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=createAction)]

## Get user preferences for context

Add the following methods to the Program class to get a user's input from the command line for the time of day and current food preference. These will be uses as context when ranking the actions.

[!code-csharp[Present time out day preference to the user](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=createUserFeatureTimeOfDay)]

[!code-csharp[Present food taste preference to the user](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=createUserFeatureTastePreference)]

Both methods use the `GetKey` method to read the user's selection from the command line. 

[!code-csharp[Read user's choice from the command line](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=readCommandLine)]

## Create the learning loop

The Personalizer learning loop is a cycle of rank and reward calls. In this quickstart, each rank call, to personalize the content, is followed by a reward call to tell Personalizer how well the service ranked the content. 

The following code in the `main` method of the program loops through a cycle of asking the user their preferences at the command line, sending that information to Personalizer to rank, presenting the ranked selection to the customer to choose from among the list, then sending a reward to Personalizer signaling how well the service did in ranking the selection.

[!code-csharp[Learning loop](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=mainLoop)]

Add the following methods, which [get the content choices](#get-food-items-as-rankable-actions), before running the code file:

* `GetActions`
* `GetUsersTimeOfDay`
* `GetUsersTastePreference`
* `GetKey`

## Request a rank

To complete the rank request, the program asks the user's preferences to create a `currentContent` of the content choices. The process can create content to exclude from the rank, shown as `excludeActions`. The rank request needs the actions, currentContext, excludeActions, and a unique rank event ID (as a GUID), to receive the ranked response. 

This quickstart has simple context features of time of day and user food preference. In production systems, determining and [evaluating](concept-feature-evaluation.md) [actions and features](concepts-features.md) can be a non-trivial matter.  

[!code-csharp[The Personalizer learning loop ranks the request.](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=rank)]

## Send a reward

To complete the reward request, the program gets the user's selection from the command line, assigns a numeric value to each selection, then sends the unique rank event ID and the numeric value to the reward method.

This quickstart assigns a simple number as a reward, either a zero or a 1. In production systems, determining when and what to send to the [reward](concept-rewards.md) call can be a non-trivial matter, depending on your specific needs. 

[!code-csharp[The Personalizer learning loop ranks the request.](~/samples-personalizer/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs?name=reward)]

## Run the program

Run the application with the dotnet `run` command from your application directory.

```console
dotnet run
```

![The quickstart program asks a couple of questions to gather user preferences, known as features, then provides the top action.](media/csharp-quickstart-commandline-feedback-loop/quickstart-program-feedback-loop-example.png)

The [source code for this quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-personalizer-samples/blob/master/quickstarts/csharp/PersonalizerExample/Program.cs) is available in the Personalizer samples GitHub repository.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
