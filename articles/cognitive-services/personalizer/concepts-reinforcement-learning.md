# What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is an approach to machine learning that learns behaviors by getting feedback from its use.
 
Reinforcement Learning works by:

* Providing an opportunity or degree of freedom to enact a behavior - such as making decisions or choices.
* Providing contextual information about the environment and choices.
* Providing feedback about how well the behavior achieves a certain goal.

While there are many subtypes and styles of reinforcement learning, this is how the concept works in Personalizer:

* Your application provides the opportunity to show one piece of content from a list of alternatives.
* Your application provides information about each alternative and the context of the user.
* Your application computes a _reward score_.

Unlike some approaches to reinforcement learning, Personalizer does not require a simulation to work in. Its learning algorithms are designed to react to an outside world (versus control it) and learn from each data point with an understanding that it is a unique opportunity that cost time and money to create, and that there is a non-zero regret (loss of possible reward) if suboptimal performance happens.

## What type of reinforcement learning algorithms does Personalizer use?

The current version of Personalizer uses **contextual bandits**, an approach to reinforcement learning that is framed around making decisions or choices between discrete actions, in a given context.

The _decision memory_, the model that has been trained to capture the best possible decision, given a context, uses a set of linear models. These have repeatedly shown business results and are a proven approach, partially because they can learn from the real world very rapidly without needing multi-pass training, and partially because they can complement supervised learning models and deep neural network models.

The explore/exploit traffic allocation is made randomly following the percentage set for exploration, and the default algorithm for exploration is epsilon-greedy.

### History of Contextual Bandits

John Langford coined the name Contextual Bandits (Langford and Zhang [2007]) to describe a tractable subset of reinforcement learning and has worked on a half-dozen papers improving our understanding of how to learn in this paradigm:

* Beygelzimer et al. [2011]
* Dud√≠k et al. [2011a,b]
* Agarwal et al. [2014, 2012]
* Beygelzimer and Langford [2009]
* Li et al. [2010]

John has also given several tutorials previously on topics such as Joint Prediction (ICML 2015), Contextual Bandit Theory (NIPS 2013), Active Learning (ICML 2009), and Sample Complexity Bounds (ICML 2003)

## What machine learning frameworks does Personalizer use?

Personalizer currently uses [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) as the foundation for the machine learning. This framework allows for maximum throughput and lowest latency when making personalization ranks and training the model with all events.
