## Create a Personalizer Azure resource

Create a resource for Personalizer using the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli) on your local machine. 

After you get a key from your resource, create two [environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication):

* `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_KEY` for the resource key.
* `PERSONALIZER_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT` for the resource endpoint.

In the Azure portal, both the key and endpoint values are available from the **quickstart** page.
