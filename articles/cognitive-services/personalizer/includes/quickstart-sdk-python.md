[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer/azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer?view=azure-python) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer) | [Package (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/tree/master/python/Personalizer)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesPersonalizer"  title="Create a Personalizer resource"  target="_blank">create a Personalizer resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Personalizer API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting Up

[!INCLUDE [Change model frequency](change-model-frequency.md)]

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer
```

### Create a new python application

Create a new Python file and create variables for your resource's endpoint and subscription key.

[!INCLUDE [Personalizer find resource info](find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer import PersonalizerClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.models import RankableAction, RewardRequest, RankRequest
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

import datetime, json, os, time, uuid

key = "<paste-your-personalizer-key-here>"
endpoint = "<paste-your-personalizer-endpoint-here>"
```

## Object model

The Personalizer client is a [PersonalizerClient](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer/azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.personalizer_client.personalizerclient?view=azure-python) object that authenticates to Azure using Microsoft.Rest.ServiceClientCredentials, which contains your key.

To ask for the single best item of the content, create a [RankRequest](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer/azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.models.rankrequest?view=azure-python), then pass it to client.Rank method. The Rank method returns a RankResponse.

To send a reward score to Personalizer, set the event ID and the reward score (value) to send to the [Reward](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer/azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.operations.events_operations.eventsoperations?view=azure-python#reward-event-id--value--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-) method on the EventOperations class.

Determining the reward, in this quickstart is trivial. In a production system, the determination of what impacts the [reward score](../concept-rewards.md) and by how much can be a complex process, that you may decide to change over time. This should be one of the primary design decisions in your Personalizer architecture.

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following with the Personalizer client library for Python:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Rank API](#request-the-best-action)
* [Reward API](#send-a-reward)

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate the `PersonalizerClient` with your `key` and `endpoint` which you created earlier.

```python
# Instantiate a Personalizer client
client = PersonalizerClient(endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(key))
```

## Get content choices represented as actions

Actions represent the content choices from which you want Personalizer to select the best content item. Add the following methods to the Program class to represent the set of actions and their features.

```python
def get_actions():
    action1 = RankableAction(id='pasta', features=[{"taste":"salty", "spice_level":"medium"},{"nutrition_level":5,"cuisine":"italian"}])
    action2 = RankableAction(id='ice cream', features=[{"taste":"sweet", "spice_level":"none"}, { "nutritional_level": 2 }])
    action3 = RankableAction(id='juice', features=[{"taste":"sweet", 'spice_level':'none'}, {'nutritional_level': 5}, {'drink':True}])
    action4 = RankableAction(id='salad', features=[{'taste':'salty', 'spice_level':'none'},{'nutritional_level': 2}])
    return [action1, action2, action3, action4]
```

```python
def get_user_timeofday():
    res={}
    time_features = ["morning", "afternoon", "evening", "night"]
    time = input("What time of day is it (enter number)? 1. morning 2. afternoon 3. evening 4. night\n")
    try:
        ptime = int(time)
        if(ptime<=0 or ptime>len(time_features)):
            raise IndexError
        res['time_of_day'] = time_features[ptime-1]
    except (ValueError, IndexError):
        print("Entered value is invalid. Setting feature value to", time_features[0] + ".")
        res['time_of_day'] = time_features[0]
    return res
```

```python
def get_user_preference():
    res = {}
    taste_features = ['salty','sweet']
    pref = input("What type of food would you prefer? Enter number 1.salty 2.sweet\n")
    
    try:
        ppref = int(pref)
        if(ppref<=0 or ppref>len(taste_features)):
            raise IndexError
        res['taste_preference'] = taste_features[ppref-1]
    except (ValueError, IndexError):
        print("Entered value is invalid. Setting feature value to", taste_features[0]+ ".")
        res['taste_preference'] = taste_features[0]
    return res
```

## Create the learning loop

The Personalizer learning loop is a cycle of [Rank](#request-the-best-action) and [Reward](#send-a-reward) calls. In this quickstart, each rank call, to personalize the content, is followed by a reward call to tell Personalizer how well the service performed.

The following code loops through a cycle of asking the user their preferences at the command line, sending that information to Personalizer to select the best action, presenting the selection to the customer to choose from among the list, then sending a reward to Personalizer signaling how well the service did in its selection.

```python
keep_going = True
while keep_going:

    eventid = str(uuid.uuid4())

    context = [get_user_preference(), get_user_timeofday()]
    actions = get_actions()

    rank_request = RankRequest( actions=actions, context_features=context, excluded_actions=['juice'], event_id=eventid)
    response = client.rank(rank_request=rank_request)
    
    print("Personalizer service ranked the actions with the probabilities listed below:")
    
    rankedList = response.ranking
    for ranked in rankedList:
        print(ranked.id, ':',ranked.probability)

    print("Personalizer thinks you would like to have", response.reward_action_id+".")
    answer = input("Is this correct?(y/n)\n")[0]

    reward_val = "0.0"
    if(answer.lower()=='y'):
        reward_val = "1.0"
    elif(answer.lower()=='n'):
        reward_val = "0.0"
    else:
        print("Entered choice is invalid. Service assumes that you didn't like the recommended food choice.")

    client.events.reward(event_id=eventid, value=reward_val)

    br = input("Press Q to exit, any other key to continue: ")
    if(br.lower()=='q'):
        keep_going = False
```

Add the following methods, which [get the content choices](#get-content-choices-represented-as-actions), before running the code file:

* `get_user_preference`
* `get_user_timeofday`
* `get_actions`

## Request the best action

To complete the Rank request, the program asks the user's preferences to create a `currentContent` of the content choices. The process can create content to exclude from the actions, shown as `excludeActions`. The Rank request needs the actions and their features, currentContext features, excludeActions, and a unique event ID, to receive the response.

This quickstart has simple context features of time of day and user food preference. In production systems, determining and [evaluating](../concept-feature-evaluation.md) [actions and features](../concepts-features.md) can be a non-trivial matter.

```python
rank_request = RankRequest( actions=actions, context_features=context, excluded_actions=['juice'], event_id=eventid)
response = client.rank(rank_request=rank_request)
```

## Send a reward

To get the reward score to send in the Reward request, the program gets the user's selection from the command line, assigns a numeric value to the selection, then sends the unique event ID and the reward score as the numeric value to the Reward API.

This quickstart assigns a simple number as a reward score, either a zero or a 1. In production systems, determining when and what to send to the [Reward](../concept-rewards.md) call can be a non-trivial matter, depending on your specific needs.

```python
reward_val = "0.0"
if(answer.lower()=='y'):
    reward_val = "1.0"
elif(answer.lower()=='n'):
    reward_val = "0.0"
else:
    print("Entered choice is invalid. Service assumes that you didn't like the recommended food choice.")

client.events.reward(event_id=eventid, value=reward_val)
```

## Run the program

Run the application with the python from your application directory.

```console
python sample.py
```

![The quickstart program asks a couple of questions to gather user preferences, known as features, then provides the top action.](../media/csharp-quickstart-commandline-feedback-loop/quickstart-program-feedback-loop-example.png)
