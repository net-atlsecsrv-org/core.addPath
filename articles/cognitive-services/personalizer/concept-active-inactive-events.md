# Active and inactive events

An **active** event is any call to Rank where you know you are going to show the result to the customer and determine the reward score. This is the default behavior.

An **inactive** event is a call to Rank where you are not sure if the user will ever see the recommended action, due to business logic. This allows you to discard the event so Personalizer isn't trained with the default reward. Inactive events should not call the Reward API.

It is important the that the learning loop know the actual type of event. An inactive event will not have a Reward call. An active event should have a Reward call but if the API call is never made, the default reward score is applied. Change the status of an event from inactive to active as soon as you know it will influence the user experience.

## Typical active events scenario

When your application calls the Rank API, you receive the action, which the application should show in the **rewardActionId** field.  From that moment, Personalizer expects a Reward call with a reward score that has the same eventId. The reward score is used to train the model for future Rank calls. If no Reward call is received for the eventId, a default reward is applied. [Default rewards](how-to-settings.md#configure-rewards-for-the-feedback-loop) are set on your Personalizer resource in the Azure portal.

## Other event type scenarios

In some scenarios, the application might need to call Rank before it even knows if the result will be used or displayed to the user. This might happen in situations where, for example, the page rendering of promoted content is overwritten by a marketing campaign. If the result of the Rank call was never used and the user never saw it, don't send a corresponding Reward call.

Typically, these scenarios happen when:

* You're prerendering UI that the user might or might not get to see.
* Your application is doing predictive personalization in which Rank calls are made with little real-time context and the application might or might not use the output.

In these cases, use Personalizer to call Rank, requesting the event to be _inactive_. Personalizer won't expect a reward for this event, and it won't apply a default reward.

Later in your business logic, if the application uses the information from the Rank call, just _activate_ the event. As soon as the event is active, Personalizer expects an event reward. If no explicit call is made to the Reward API, Personalizer applies a default reward.

## Inactive events

To disable training for an event, call Rank by using `learningEnabled = False`.

For an inactive event, learning is implicitly activated if you send a reward for the eventId or call the `activate` API for that eventId.
