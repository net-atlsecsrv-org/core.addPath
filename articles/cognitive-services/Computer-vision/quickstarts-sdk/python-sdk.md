# Quickstart: Computer Vision client library for Python

The Computer Vision service provides developers with access to advanced algorithms for processing images and returning information. Computer Vision algorithms analyze the content of an image in different ways, depending on the visual features you're interested in.

Use the Computer Vision client library for Python to:

* Analyze an image for tags, text description, faces, adult content, and more.
* Recognize printed and handwritten text with the Batch Read API.

> [!NOTE]
> The scenarios in this quickstart use remote image URLs. For sample code that does the same operations on local images, see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py).

[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/) | [Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/?service=cognitive-services&term=vision&sort=0)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

## Setting up

### Create a Computer Vision Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Computer Vision using the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for seven days for free. After you sign up, it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key and endpoint URL, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`, respectively.
 
### Create a new Python application

Create a new Python script&mdash;*quickstart-file.py*, for example. Then open it in your preferred editor or IDE and import the following libraries.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_imports)]

Then, create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_vars)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you created the environment variable after you launched the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell running it to access the variable.

### Install the client library

You can install the client library with:

```console
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Computer Vision Python SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin?view=azure-python)| This class directly handles all of the image operations, such as image analysis, text detection, and thumbnail generation.|
| [ComputerVisionClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient?view=azure-python) | This class is needed for all Computer Vision functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to produce instances of other classes. It implements **ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin**.|
|[VisualFeatureTypes](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models.visualfeaturetypes?view=azure-python)| This enum defines the different types of image analysis that can be done in a standard Analyze operation. You specify a set of **VisualFeatureTypes** values depending on your needs. |

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Computer Vision client library for Python:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Analyze an image](#analyze-an-image)
* [Read printed and handwritten text](#read-printed-and-handwritten-text)

## Authenticate the client

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart assumes you've [created an environment variable](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for your Computer Vision key, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

Instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. Create a [CognitiveServicesCredentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/msrest/msrest.authentication.cognitiveservicescredentials?view=azure-python) object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create a [ComputerVisionClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient?view=azure-python) object.

### Get the image type

The following code prints information about the type of image&mdash;whether it is clip art or line drawing.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_type)]

## Read printed and handwritten text

Computer Vision can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. You do this in two parts.

### Call the Read API

First, use the following code to call the **batch_read_file** method for the given image. This returns an operation ID and starts an asynchronous process to read the content of the image.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_read_call)]

### Get Read results

Next, get the operation ID returned from the **batch_read_file** call, and use it to query the service for operation results. The following code checks the operation at one-second intervals until the results are returned. It then prints the extracted text data to the console.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_read_response)]

## Run the application

Run the application with the `python` command on your quickstart file.

```console
python quickstart-file.py
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli#clean-up-resources)
