# Quickstart: Use the Computer Vision client library

Get started with the Computer Vision client library. The Computer Vision service provides you with AI algorithms for processing images and returning information on their visual features. Follow these steps to install a package to your application and try out the sample code for basic tasks.

Use the Computer Vision client library to:

* Analyze an image for tags, text description, faces, adult content, and more.
* Read printed and handwritten text with the Read API.
