# Spatial analysis operations

Spatial analysis enables the analysis of real-time streaming video from camera devices. For each camera device you configure, the operations for spatial analysis will generate an output stream of JSON messages sent to your instance of Azure IoT Hub. 

The spatial analysis container implements the following operations:

| Operation Identifier| Description|
|---------|---------|
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount | Counts people in a designated zone in the camera's field of view. <br> Emits an initial _personCountEvent_ event and then _personCountEvent_ events when the count changes.  |
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingline | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br>Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the line and provides directional info. 
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingpolygon | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br> Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the zone and provides directional info. |
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-persondistance | Tracks when people violate a distance rule. <br> Emits a _personDistanceEvent_ periodically with the location of each distance violation. |

All above the operations are also available in the `.debug` version, which have the capability to visualize the video frames as they are being processed. You will need to run `xhost +` on the host computer to enable the visualization of video frames and events.

| Operation Identifier| Description|
|---------|---------|
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount.debug | Counts people in a designated zone in the camera's field of view. <br> Emits an initial _personCountEvent_ event and then _personCountEvent_ events when the count changes.  |
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingline.debug | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br>Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the line and provides directional info. 
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingpolygon.debug | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br> Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the zone and provides directional info. |
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-persondistance.debug | Tracks when people violate a distance rule. <br> Emits a _personDistanceEvent_ periodically with the location of each distance violation. |

Spatial analysis can also be run with [Live Video Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/live-video-analytics/) as their Video AI module. 

<!--more details on the setup can be found in the [LVA Setup page](LVA-Setup.md). Below is the list of the operations supported with Live Video Analytics. -->

| Operation Identifier| Description|
|---------|---------|
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount.livevideoanalytics | Counts people in a designated zone in the camera's field of view. <br> Emits an initial _personCountEvent_ event and then _personCountEvent_ events when the count changes.  |
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingline.livevideoanalytics | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br>Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the line and provides directional info. 
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcrossingpolygon.livevideoanalytics | Tracks when a person crosses a designated line in the camera's field of view. <br> Emits a _personLineEvent_ event when the person crosses the zone and provides directional info. |
| cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-persondistance.livevideoanalytics | Tracks when people violate a distance rule. <br> Emits a _personDistanceEvent_ periodically with the location of each distance violation. |

Live Video Analytics operations are also available in the `.debug` version (e.g. cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount.livevideoanalytics.debug) which has the capability to visualize the video frames as being processed. You will need to run `xhost +` on the host computer to enable the visualization of the video frames and events

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The computer vision AI models detect and locate human presence in video footage and output by using a bounding box around a human body. The AI models do not attempt to detect faces or discover the identities or demographics of individuals.

These are the parameters required by each of these spatial analysis operations.

| Operation parameters| Description|
|---------|---------|
| Operation ID | The Operation Identifier from table above.|

| VIDEO_SOURCE_ID | A friendly name for the camera device or video stream. This will be returned with the event JSON output.|
| VIDEO_IS_LIVE| True for camera devices; false for recorded videos.|
| VIDEO_DECODE_GPU_INDEX| Which GPU to decode the video frame. By default it is 0. Should be the same as the `gpu_index` in other node config like `VICA_NODE_CONFIG`, `DETECTOR_NODE_CONFIG`.|
| DETECTOR_NODE_CONFIG | JSON indicating which GPU to run the detector node on. Should be in the following format: `"{ \"gpu_index\": 0 }",`|
| SPACEANALYTICS_CONFIG | JSON configuration for zone and line as outlined below.|

> The AI model detects a person irrespective of whether the person is facing towards or away from the camera. The AI model doesn't run face detection or recognition and doesn't emit any biometric information.

## Use the output generated by the container

You may want to integrate spatial analysis detection or events into your application. Here are a few approaches to consider: 

* Use the Azure Event Hub SDK for your chosen programming language to connect to the Azure IoT Hub endpoint and receive the events. See [Read device-to-cloud messages from the built-in endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin) for more information. 
* Set up **Message Routing** on your Azure IoT Hub to send the events to other endpoints or save the events to your data storage. See [IoT Hub Message Routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c) for more information. 
* Setup an Azure Stream Analytics job to process the events in real-time as they arrive and create visualizations. 

## Deploying spatial analysis operations at scale (multiple cameras)

In order to get the best performance and utilization of the GPUs, you can deploy any spatial analysis operations on multiple cameras using graph instances. Below is a sample for running the `cognitiveservices.vision.spatialanalysis-personcount` operation on five cameras.
