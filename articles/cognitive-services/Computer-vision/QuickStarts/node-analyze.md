# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image using the Computer Vision REST API with Node.js

In this quickstart, you analyze a remotely stored image to extract visual features by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4.x or later installed.
- You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key. Then, [create environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key and service endpoint string, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`, respectively.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Install the npm [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) package.
   1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
   1. Run the following command:

      ```console
      npm install request
      ```

   1. After the package is successfully installed, close the command prompt window.

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
1. Optionally, replace the value of the `language` request parameter with a different language.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.js` extension. For example, `analyze-image.js`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `node` command to run the file. For example, `node analyze-image.js`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const request = require('request');

let subscriptionKey = process.env['COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY'];
let endpoint = process.env['COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT']
if (!subscriptionKey) { throw new Error('Set your environment variables for your subscription key and endpoint.'); }

var uriBase = endpoint + 'vision/v2.0/analyze';

const imageUrl =
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg';

// Request parameters.
const params = {
    'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Color',
    'details': '',
    'language': 'en'
};

const options = {
    uri: uriBase,
    qs: params,
    body: '{"url": ' + '"' + imageUrl + '"}',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' : subscriptionKey
    }
};

request.post(options, (error, response, body) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error: ', error);
    return;
  }
  let jsonResponse = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(body), null, '  ');
  console.log('JSON Response\n');
  console.log(jsonResponse);
});
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_water",
      "score": 0.9921875,
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []
      }
    }
  ],
  "description": {
    "tags": [
      "nature",
      "water",
      "waterfall",
      "outdoor",
      "rock",
      "mountain",
      "rocky",
      "grass",
      "hill",
      "covered",
      "hillside",
      "standing",
      "side",
      "group",
      "walking",
      "white",
      "man",
      "large",
      "snow",
      "grazing",
      "forest",
      "slope",
      "herd",
      "river",
      "giraffe",
      "field"
    ],
    "captions": [
      {
        "text": "a large waterfall over a rocky cliff",
        "confidence": 0.916458423253597
      }
    ]
  },
  "color": {
    "dominantColorForeground": "Grey",
    "dominantColorBackground": "Green",
    "dominantColors": [
      "Grey",
      "Green"
    ],
    "accentColor": "4D5E2F",
    "isBwImg": false
  },
  "requestId": "81b4e400-e3c1-41f1-9020-e6871ad9f0ed",
  "metadata": {
    "height": 959,
    "width": 1280,
    "format": "Jpeg"
  }
}
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the file, and then uninstall the npm `request` package. To uninstall the package, do the following steps:

1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
2. Run the following command:

   ```console
   npm uninstall request
   ```

3. After the package is successfully uninstalled, close the command prompt window.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision APIs used to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
