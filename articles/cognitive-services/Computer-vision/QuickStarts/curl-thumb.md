# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail using the Computer Vision REST API and cURL

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image using the Computer Vision REST API. You specify the desired height and width, which can differ in aspect ration from the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the area of interest and generate cropping coordinates around that region.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows).
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Get Thumbnail request

With the [Get Thumbnail method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb), you can generate a thumbnail of an image.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Replace `<File>` with the path and filename to save the thumbnail.
1. Change the Request URL (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.1`) to use the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Open a command window on a computer with cURL installed.
1. Paste the code in the window and run the command.

>[!NOTE]
>You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys. For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".

## Create and run the sample command

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `<thumbnailFile>` with the path and name of the file in which to save the thumbnail.
    1. Replace the first part of the request URL (`westcentralus`) with the text in your own endpoint URL.
        [!INCLUDE [Custom subdomains notice](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains-note.md)]
    1. Optionally, change the image URL in the request body (`https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg/1280px-Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg\`) to the URL of a different image from which to generate a thumbnail.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscriptionKey>" -o <thumbnailFile> -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.1/generateThumbnail?width=100&height=100&smartCropping=true" -d "{\"url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg/1280px-Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg\"}"
    ```

## Examine the response

A successful response writes the thumbnail image to the file specified in `<thumbnailFile>`. If the request fails, the response contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong. If the request seems to succeed but the created thumbnail is not a valid image file, it might be that your subscription key is not valid.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision API to how to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
