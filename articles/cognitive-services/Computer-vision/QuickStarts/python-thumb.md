# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail using the Computer Vision REST API and Python

In this quickstart, you will generate a thumbnail from an image using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Get Thumbnail](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb) method, you can specify the desired height and width, and Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the area of interest and generate cropping coordinates based on that region.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key. Then, [create environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key and service endpoint string, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`, respectively.
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, copy the following code into the code editor. 

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Add your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint to your environment variables.
if 'COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY' in os.environ:
    subscription_key = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY']
else:
    print("\nSet the COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY environment variable.\n**Restart your shell or IDE for changes to take effect.**")
    sys.exit()

if 'COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT' in os.environ:
    endpoint = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT']

thumbnail_url = endpoint + "vision/v2.1/generateThumbnail"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Bloodhound_Puppy.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params = {'width': '50', 'height': '50', 'smartCropping': 'true'}
data = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(thumbnail_url, headers=headers,
                         params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

thumbnail = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

# Display the thumbnail.
plt.imshow(thumbnail)
plt.axis("off")

# Verify the thumbnail size.
print("Thumbnail is {0}-by-{1}".format(*thumbnail.size))
```

Next, do the following:
1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image for which you want to generate a thumbnail.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `get-thumbnail.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python get-thumbnail.py`.

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned as binary data which represents the image data for the thumbnail. The sample should display this image. If the request fails, the response is displayed in the command prompt window and should contain an error code.

## Run in Jupyter (optional)

You can optionally run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

## Next steps

Next, learn more detailed information about the thumbnail generation feature.
