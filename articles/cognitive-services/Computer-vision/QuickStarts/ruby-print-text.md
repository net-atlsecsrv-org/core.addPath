# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the Computer Vision REST API and Ruby

In this quickstart, you extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) 2.4.x or later installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace `https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr` with the endpoint URL for the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract printed text.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.rb` extension. For example, `get-printed-text.rb`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `ruby` command to run the sample. For example, `ruby get-printed-text.rb`.

```ruby
require 'net/http'

# You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from westus,
# replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
uri = URI('https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr')
uri.query = URI.encode_www_form({
    # Request parameters
    'language' => 'unk',
    'detectOrientation' => 'true'
})

request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri)

# Request headers
# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = '<Subscription Key>'
request['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'

request.body =
    "{\"url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" +
    "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\"}"

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end

puts response.body
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "textAngle": -2.0000000000000338,
  "orientation": "Up",
  "regions": [

            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "565,471,289,74",
          "words": [
            {

              "text": "A"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "626,471,150,73",
              "text": "PLAN"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "801,472,53,73",
              "text": "IS"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "519,563,375,74",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": "519,563,149,74",
              "text": "JUST"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "683,564,41,72",
              "text": "A"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "741,564,153,73",
              "text": "WISH"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
