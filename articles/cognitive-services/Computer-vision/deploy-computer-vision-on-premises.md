# Use Computer Vision container with Kubernetes and Helm

One option to manage your Computer Vision containers on-premises is to use Kubernetes and Helm. Using Kubernetes and Helm to define a Computer Vision container image, we'll create a Kubernetes package. This package will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on-premises. Finally, we'll explore how to test the deployed services. For more information about running Docker containers without Kubernetes orchestration, see [install and run Computer Vision containers](computer-vision-how-to-install-containers.md).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites before using Computer Vision containers on-premises:

| Required | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Azure Account | If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][free-azure-account] before you begin. |
| Kubernetes CLI | The [Kubernetes CLI][kubernetes-cli] is required for managing the shared credentials from the container registry. Kubernetes is also needed before Helm, which is the Kubernetes package manager. |
| Helm CLI | Install the [Helm CLI][helm-install], which is used to to install a helm chart (container package definition). |
| Computer Vision resource |In order to use the container, you must have:<br><br>An Azure **Computer Vision** resource and the associated API key the endpoint URI. Both values are available on the Overview and Keys pages for the resource and are required to start the container.<br><br>**{API_KEY}**: One of the two available resource keys on the **Keys** page<br><br>**{ENDPOINT_URI}**: The endpoint as provided on the **Overview** page|

### The host computer

[!INCLUDE [Host Computer requirements](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-host-computer.md)]

### Container requirements and recommendations

[!INCLUDE [Container requirements and recommendations](includes/container-requirements-and-recommendations.md)]

## Connect to the Kubernetes cluster

The host computer is expected to have an available Kubernetes cluster. See this tutorial on [deploying a Kubernetes cluster](../../aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster.md) for a conceptual understanding of how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster to a host computer. You can find more information on deployments in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

## Configure Helm chart values for deployment

Begin by creating a folder named *read*. Then, paste the following YAML content in a new file named `chart.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: read
version: 1.0.0
description: A Helm chart to deploy the Read OCR container to a Kubernetes cluster
dependencies:
- name: rabbitmq
  condition: read.image.args.rabbitmq.enabled
  version: ^6.12.0
  repository: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
- name: redis
  condition: read.image.args.redis.enabled
  version: ^6.0.0
  repository: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
```

To configure the Helm chart default values, copy and paste the following YAML into a file named `values.yaml`. Replace the `# {ENDPOINT_URI}` and `# {API_KEY}` comments with your own values. Configure resultExpirationPeriod, Redis, and RabbitMQ if needed.

```yaml
# These settings are deployment specific and users can provide customizations
read:
  enabled: true
  image:
    name: cognitive-services-read
    registry:  mcr.microsoft.com/
    repository: azure-cognitive-services/vision/read
    tag: 3.1-preview
    args:
      eula: accept
      billing: # {ENDPOINT_URI}
      apikey: # {API_KEY}
      
      # Result expiration period setting. Specify when the system should clean up recognition results.
      # For example, resultExpirationPeriod=1, the system will clear the recognition result 1hr after the process.
      # resultExpirationPeriod=0, the system will clear the recognition result after result retrieval.
      resultExpirationPeriod: 1
      
      # Redis storage, if configured, will be used by read container to store result records.
      # A cache is required if multiple read containers are placed behind load balancer.
      redis:
        enabled: false # {true/false}
        password: password

      # RabbitMQ is used for dispatching tasks. This can be useful when multiple read containers are
      # placed behind load balancer.
      rabbitmq:
        enabled: false # {true/false}
        rabbitmq:
          username: user
          password: password
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If the `billing` and `apikey` values aren't provided, the services expire after 15 minutes. Likewise, verification fails because the services aren't available.
> 
> - If you deploy multiple Read containers behind a load balancer, for example, under Docker Compose or Kubernetes, you must have an external cache. Because the processing container and the GET request container might not be the same, an external cache stores the results and shares them across containers. For details about cache settings, see [Configure Computer Vision Docker containers](./computer-vision-resource-container-config.md).

Create a *templates* folder under the *read* directory. Copy and paste the following YAML into a file named `deployment.yaml`. The `deployment.yaml` file will serve as a Helm template.

> Templates generate manifest files, which are YAML-formatted resource descriptions that Kubernetes can understand. [- Helm Chart Template Guide][chart-template-guide]

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: read
  labels:
    app: read-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: read-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: read-app       
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: {{.Values.read.image.name}}
        image: {{.Values.read.image.registry}}{{.Values.read.image.repository}}
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        env:
        - name: EULA
          value: {{.Values.read.image.args.eula}}
        - name: billing
          value: {{.Values.read.image.args.billing}}
        - name: apikey
          value: {{.Values.read.image.args.apikey}}
        args:        
        - ReadEngineConfig:ResultExpirationPeriod={{ .Values.read.image.args.resultExpirationPeriod }}
        {{- if .Values.read.image.args.rabbitmq.enabled }}
        - Queue:RabbitMQ:HostName={{ include "rabbitmq.hostname" . }}
        - Queue:RabbitMQ:Username={{ .Values.read.image.args.rabbitmq.rabbitmq.username }}
        - Queue:RabbitMQ:Password={{ .Values.read.image.args.rabbitmq.rabbitmq.password }}
        {{- end }}      
        {{- if .Values.read.image.args.redis.enabled }}
        - Cache:Redis:Configuration={{ include "redis.connStr" . }}
        {{- end }}
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: {{.Values.read.image.pullSecret}}      
--- 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: read-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 5000
  selector:
    app: read-app
```

In the same *templates* folder, copy and paste the following helper functions into `helpers.tpl`. `helpers.tpl` defines useful functions to help generate Helm template.

```yaml
{{- define "rabbitmq.hostname" -}}
{{- printf "%s-rabbitmq" .Release.Name -}}
{{- end -}}

{{- define "redis.connStr" -}}
{{- $hostMaster := printf "%s-redis-master:6379" .Release.Name }}
{{- $hostSlave := printf "%s-redis-slave:6379" .Release.Name -}}
{{- $passWord := printf "password=%s" .Values.read.image.args.redis.password -}}
{{- $connTail := "ssl=False,abortConnect=False" -}}
{{- printf "%s,%s,%s,%s" $hostMaster $hostSlave $passWord $connTail -}}
{{- end -}}
```
The template specifies a load balancer service and the deployment of your container/image for Read.

### The Kubernetes package (Helm chart)

The *Helm chart* contains the configuration of which docker image(s) to pull from the `mcr.microsoft.com` container registry.

> A [Helm chart][helm-charts] is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.

The provided *Helm charts* pull the docker images of the Computer Vision Service, and the corresponding service from the `mcr.microsoft.com` container 
registry.

## Install the Helm chart on the Kubernetes cluster

To install the *helm chart*, we'll need to execute the [`helm install`][helm-install-cmd] command. Ensure to execute the install command from the directory above the `read` folder.

```console
helm install read ./read
```

Here is an example output you might expect to see from a successful install execution:

```console
NAME: read
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Sep 04 13:24:06 2019
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: DEPLOYED

RESOURCES:
==> v1/Pod(related)
NAME                    READY  STATUS             RESTARTS  AGE
read-57cb76bcf7-45sdh   0/1    ContainerCreating  0         0s

==> v1/Service
NAME     TYPE          CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP  PORT(S)         AGE
read     LoadBalancer  10.110.44.86  localhost    5000:31301/TCP  0s

==> v1beta1/Deployment
NAME    READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  AGE
read    0/1    1           0          0s
```

The Kubernetes deployment can take over several minutes to complete. To confirm that both pods and services are properly deployed and available, execute the following command:

```console
kubectl get all
```

You should expect to see something similar to the following output:

```console
kubectl get all
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/read-57cb76bcf7-45sdh   1/1     Running   0          17s

NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
service/kubernetes     ClusterIP      10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP          45h
service/read           LoadBalancer   10.110.44.86   localhost     5000:31301/TCP   17s

NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/read   1/1     1            1           17s

NAME                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/read-57cb76bcf7   1         1         1       17s
```

## Deploy multiple v3 containers on the Kubernetes cluster

Starting in v3 of the container, you can use the containers in parallel on both a task and page level.

By design, each v3 container has a dispatcher and a recognition worker. The dispatcher is responsible for splitting a multi-page task into multiple single page sub-tasks. The recognition worker is optimized for recognizing a single page document. To achieve page level parallelism, deploy multiple v3 containers behind a load balancer and let the containers share a universal storage and queue. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Currently only Azure Storage and Azure Queue are supported. 

The container receiving the request can split the task into single page sub-tasks, and add them to the universal queue. Any recognition worker from a less busy container can consume single page sub-tasks from the queue, perform recognition, and upload the result to the storage. The throughput can be improved up to `n` times, depending on the number of containers that are deployed.

Copy and paste the following YAML into a file named `deployment.yaml`. Replace the `# {ENDPOINT_URI}` and `# {API_KEY}` comments with your own values. Replace the `# {AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}` comment with your Azure Storage Connection String. Configure `replicas` to the number you want, which is set to `3` in the following example.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: read
  labels:
    app: read-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: read-app
  replicas: # {NUMBER_OF_READ_CONTAINERS}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: read-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cognitive-services-read
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/vision/read
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        env:
        - name: EULA
          value: accept
        - name: billing
          value: # {ENDPOINT_URI}
        - name: apikey
          value: # {API_KEY}
        - name: Storage__ObjectStore__AzureBlob__ConnectionString
          value: # {AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}
        - name: Queue__Azure__ConnectionString
          value: # {AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}
--- 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-cognitive-service-read
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 5000
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: read-app
```

Run the following command. 

```console
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Below is an example output you might see from a successful deployment execution:

```console
deployment.apps/read created
service/azure-cognitive-service-read created
```

The Kubernetes deployment can take several minutes to complete. To confirm that both pods and services are properly deployed and available, then execute the following command:

```console
kubectl get all
```

You should see console output similar to the following:

```console
kubectl get all
