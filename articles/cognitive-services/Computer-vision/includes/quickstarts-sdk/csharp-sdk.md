Use the OCR client library to read printed and handwritten text from an image.

[Reference documentation](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/cognitiveservices/client/computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/Vision.ComputerVision) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision/) | [Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/?service=cognitive-services&term=vision&sort=0)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Create a new C# application

#### [Visual Studio IDE](#tab/visual-studio)

Using Visual Studio, create a new .NET Core application. 

### Install the client library 

Once you've created a new project, install the client library by right-clicking on the project solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse**, check **Include prerelease**, and search for `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision`. Select version `7.0.0`, and then **Install**. 

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `computer-vision-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *Program.cs*.

```console
dotnet new console -n computer-vision-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Install the client library

Within the application directory, install the Computer Vision client library for .NET with the following command:

```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision --version 7.0.0
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

From the project directory, open the *Program.cs* file in your preferred editor or IDE.

### Find the subscription key and endpoint

Go to the Azure portal. If the Computer Vision resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your subscription key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 

In the application's **Program** class, create variables for your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint. Paste your subscription key and endpoint into the following code where indicated. Your Computer Vision endpoint has the form `https://<your_computer_vision_resource_name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_using_and_vars)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the subscription key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

In the application's `Main` method, add calls for the methods used in this quickstart. You will create these later.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_client)]

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the OCR .NET SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| [ComputerVisionClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) | This class is needed for all Computer Vision functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to do most image operations.|
|[ComputerVisionClientExtensions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclientextensions)| This class contains additional methods for the **ComputerVisionClient**.|

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the OCR client library for .NET:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Read printed and handwritten text](#read-printed-and-handwritten-text)

## Authenticate the client

In a new method in the **Program** class, instantiate a client with your endpoint and subscription key. Create a **[ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.apikeyserviceclientcredentials)** object with your subscription key, and use it with your endpoint to create a **[ComputerVisionClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient)** object.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_auth)]

> [I authenticated the client](?success=authenticate-client#read-printed-and-handwritten-text) [I ran into an issue](https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Cl5zkG3CnDjq6O?PLanguage=Csharp&Section=authenticate-client)

## Read printed and handwritten text

The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. For more information on text recognition, see the [Optical character recognition (OCR)](../../overview-ocr.md) overview. The code in this section uses the latest [Computer Vision SDK release for Read 3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision/) and defines a method, `BatchReadFileUrl`, which uses the client object to detect and extract text in the image.

> [!TIP]
> You can also extract text from a local image. See the [ComputerVisionClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) methods, such as **ReadInStreamAsync**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs) for scenarios involving local images.

### Set up test image

In your **Program** class, save a reference to the URL of the image you want to extract text from. This snippet includes sample images for both printed and handwritten text.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_readtext_url)]

### Call the Read API

Define the new method for reading text. Add the code below, which calls the **ReadAsync** method for the given image. This returns an operation ID and starts an asynchronous process to read the content of the image.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_readfileurl_1)]

### Get Read results

Next, get the operation ID returned from the **ReadAsync** call, and use it to query the service for operation results. The following code checks the operation until the results are returned. It then prints the extracted text data to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_readfileurl_2)]

### Display Read results

Add the following code to parse and display the retrieved text data, and finish the method definition.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_readfileurl_3)]

## Run the application

#### [Visual Studio IDE](#tab/visual-studio)

Run the application by clicking the **Debug** button at the top of the IDE window.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```dotnet
dotnet run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
