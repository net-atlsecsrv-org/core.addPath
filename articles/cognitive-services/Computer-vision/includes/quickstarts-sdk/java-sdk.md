Use the Optical character recognition client library to read printed and handwritten text in images.

[Reference documentation](/java/api/overview/azure/cognitiveservices/client/computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/ms-azure-cs-computervision) |[Artifact (Maven)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-computervision) | [Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/?service=cognitive-services&term=vision&sort=0)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The current version of the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* The [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/install/), or another dependency manager.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Create a new Gradle project

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts*, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

### Install the client library

This quickstart uses the Gradle dependency manager. You can find the client library and information for other dependency managers on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-computervision).

Locate *build.gradle.kts* and open it with your preferred IDE or text editor. Then copy in the following build configuration. This configuration defines the project as a Java application whose entry point is the class **ComputerVisionQuickstarts**. It imports the Computer Vision library.

```kotlin
plugins {
    java
    application
}
application { 
    mainClassName = "ComputerVisionQuickstarts"
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    compile(group = "com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices", name = "azure-cognitiveservices-computervision", version = "1.0.4-beta")
}
```

### Create a Java file

From your working directory, run the following command to create a project source folder:

```console
mkdir -p src/main/java
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

Navigate to the new folder and create a file called *ComputerVisionQuickstarts.java*. Open it in your preferred editor or IDE.

### Find the subscription key and endpoint

Go to the Azure portal. If the Computer Vision resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your subscription key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 

Define the class **ComputerVisionQuickstarts**. Create variables for your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint. Paste your subscription key and endpoint into the following code where indicated. Your Computer Vision endpoint has the form `https://<your_computer_vision_resource_name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_imports_and_vars)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the subscription key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

In the application's **main** method, add calls for the methods used in this quickstart. You'll define these later.

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the OCR Java SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| [ComputerVisionClient](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) | This class is needed for all Computer Vision functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to produce instances of other classes.|

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the OCR client library for Java:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Read printed and handwritten text](#read-printed-and-handwritten-text)

## Authenticate the client

In a new method, instantiate a [ComputerVisionClient](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) object with your endpoint and key.

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_auth)]

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [I authenticated the client](?success=authenticate-client#read-printed-and-handwritten-text) [I ran into an issue](https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Cl5zkG3CnDjq6O?PLanguage=Java&Section=authenticate-client)



## Read printed and handwritten text

The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. This section defines a method, `ReadFromFile`, that takes a local file path and prints the image's text to the console.

> [!TIP]
> You can also read text in a remote image referenced by URL. See the [ComputerVision](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervision) methods, such as **read**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java) for scenarios involving remote images.

### Set up test image

Create a **resources/** folder in the **src/main/** folder of your project, and add an image you'd like to read text from. You can download a [sample image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/master/articles/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/Images/readsample.jpg) to use here.

Then add the following method definition to your **ComputerVisionQuickstarts** class. Change the value of the `localFilePath` to match your image file. 

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_read_setup)]

### Call the Read API

Then, add the following code to call the **readInStreamWithServiceResponseAsync** method for the given image.

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_read_call)]

The following block of code extracts the operation ID from the response of the Read call. It uses this ID with a helper method to print the text read results to the console. 

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_read_response)]

Close out the try/catch block and the method definition.

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_read_catch)]

### Get Read results

Then, add a definition for the helper method. This method uses the operation ID from the previous step to query the read operation and get OCR results when they're available.

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_read_result_helper_call)]

The rest of the method parses the OCR results and prints them to the console.

[!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java?name=snippet_read_result_helper_print)]

Finally, add the other helper method used above, which extracts the operation ID from the initial response.

## Run the application

You can build the app with:

```console
gradle build
```

Run the application with the `gradle run` command:

```console
gradle run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
