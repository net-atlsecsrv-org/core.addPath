Use the Image Analysis client library to analyze an image for tags, text description, faces, adult content, and more.

[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/) | [Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/?service=cognitive-services&term=vision&sort=0)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource</a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.

    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Install the client library

You can install the client library with:

```console
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```

Also install the Pillow library.

```console
pip install pillow
```

### Create a new Python application

Create a new Python file&mdash;*quickstart-file.py*, for example. Then open it in your preferred editor or IDE and import the following libraries.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_imports)]

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

Then, create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_vars)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the Computer Vision resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Image Analysis Python SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin)| This class directly handles all of the image operations, such as image analysis, text detection, and thumbnail generation.|
| [ComputerVisionClient](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) | This class is needed for all Computer Vision functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to produce instances of other classes. It implements **ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin**.|
|[VisualFeatureTypes](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models.visualfeaturetypes)| This enum defines the different types of image analysis that can be done in a standard Analyze operation. You specify a set of **VisualFeatureTypes** values depending on your needs. |

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Image Analysis client library for Python:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Analyze an image](#analyze-an-image)

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. Create a [CognitiveServicesCredentials](/python/api/msrest/msrest.authentication.cognitiveservicescredentials) object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create a [ComputerVisionClient](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) object.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_client)]

## Analyze an image

Use your client object to analyze the visual features of a remote image. First save a reference to the URL of an image you want to analyze.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_remoteimage)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze a local image. See the [ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin) methods, such as **analyze_image_in_stream**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py) for scenarios involving local images.
