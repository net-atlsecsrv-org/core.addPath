Use the Optical character recognition client library to read printed and handwritten text with the Read API.

[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/) | [Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/?service=cognitive-services&term=vision&sort=0)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource</a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.

    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Install the client library

You can install the client library with:

```console
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```

Also install the Pillow library.

```console
pip install pillow
```

### Create a new Python application

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

Create a new Python file&mdash;*quickstart-file.py*, for example. Then open it in your preferred editor or IDE.

### Find the subscription key and endpoint

Go to the Azure portal. If the Computer Vision resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your subscription key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 

Create variables for your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint. Paste your subscription key and endpoint into the following code where indicated. Your Computer Vision endpoint has the form `https://<your_computer_vision_resource_name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_imports_and_vars)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the subscription key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the OCR Python SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin)| This class directly handles all of the image operations, such as image analysis, text detection, and thumbnail generation.|
| [ComputerVisionClient](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) | This class is needed for all Computer Vision functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to produce instances of other classes. It implements **ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin**.|
|[VisualFeatureTypes](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models.visualfeaturetypes)| This enum defines the different types of image analysis that can be done in a standard Analyze operation. You specify a set of **VisualFeatureTypes** values depending on your needs. |

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the OCR client library for Python:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Read printed and handwritten text](#read-printed-and-handwritten-text)

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. Create a [CognitiveServicesCredentials](/python/api/msrest/msrest.authentication.cognitiveservicescredentials) object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create a [ComputerVisionClient](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervisionclient) object.

## Read printed and handwritten text

The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. You do this in two parts.

### Call the Read API

First, use the following code to call the **read** method for the given image. This returns an operation ID and starts an asynchronous process to read the content of the image.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_read_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also read text from a local image. See the [ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin) methods, such as **read_in_stream**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py) for scenarios involving local images.

### Get Read results

Next, get the operation ID returned from the **read** call, and use it to query the service for operation results. The following code checks the operation at one-second intervals until the results are returned. It then prints the extracted text data to the console.

[!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py?name=snippet_read_response)]

## Run the application

Run the application with the `python` command on your quickstart file.

```console
python quickstart-file.py
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)
