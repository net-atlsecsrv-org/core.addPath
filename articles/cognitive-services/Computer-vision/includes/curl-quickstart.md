Use the Optical character recognition REST API to read printed and handwritten text.

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart uses cURL commands to call the REST API. You can also call the REST API using a programming language. See the GitHub samples for examples in [C#](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/tree/master/dotnet/ComputerVision/REST), [Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/tree/master/python/ComputerVision/REST), [Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/tree/master/java/ComputerVision/REST), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/tree/master/javascript/ComputerVision/REST), and [Go](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/tree/master/go/ComputerVision/REST).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) 
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
  * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
  * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed



## Read printed and handwritten text

The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. For more information on text recognition, see the [Optical character recognition (OCR) overview](../overview-ocr.md).

### Call the Read API

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the first part of the request URL (`westcentralus`) with the text in your own endpoint URL.
        [!INCLUDE [Custom subdomains notice](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains-note.md)]
    1. Optionally, change the image URL in the request body (`https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\`) to the URL of a different image to be analyzed.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

```bash
curl -v -X POST "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.2/read/analyze" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>" --data-ascii "{\"url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\"}"
```

The response will include an `Operation-Location` header, whose value is a unique URL. You use this URL to query the results of the Read operation. The URL expires in 48 hours.

### Get Read results

1. Copy the following command into your text editor.
1. Replace the URL with the `Operation-Location` value you copied in the previous step.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

```bash
curl -v -X GET "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.2/read/analyzeResults/{operationId}" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: {subscription key}" --data-ascii "{body}" 
```

### Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample application parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json

  "status": "succeeded",
  "createdDateTime": "2021-04-08T21:56:17.6819115+00:00",

                "boundingBox": [

                  15,

                ],
                "text": "NOTHING",
                "confidence": 0.994
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
