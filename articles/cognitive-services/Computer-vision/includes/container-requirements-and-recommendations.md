> [!NOTE]
> The requirements and recommendations are based on benchmarks with a single request per second, using an 8-MB image of a scanned business letter that contains 29 lines and a total of 803 characters.

The following table describes the minimum and recommended allocation of resources for each Read container.

| Container | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Read 2.0-preview | 1 core, 8-GB memory |	8 cores, 16-GB memory |
| Read 3.1-preview | 8 cores, 16-GB memory | 8 cores, 24-GB memory |

* Each core must be at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.

Core and memory correspond to the `--cpus` and `--memory` settings, which are used as part of the `docker run` command.
