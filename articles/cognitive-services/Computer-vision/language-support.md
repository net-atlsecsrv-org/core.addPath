# Language support for Computer Vision

Some features of Computer Vision support multiple languages; any features not mentioned here only support English.

## Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Computer Vision's OCR APIs support several languages. They do not require you to specify a language code. See [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](concept-recognizing-text.md) for more information.

|Language| Language code | OCR API | Read v3.1 | Read v3.1-preview.2 |
|:-----|:----:|:-----:|:---:|:---:|
|Arabic | `ar`|✔ | | |
|Chinese (Simplified) | `zh-Hans`|✔ | |✔ |

## Image analysis

Some actions of the [Analyze - Image](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) API can return results in other languages, specified with the `language` query parameter. Other actions return results in English regardless of what language is specified, and others throw an exception for unsupported languages. Actions are specified with the `visualFeatures` and `details` query parameters; see the [Overview](overview.md) for a list of all the actions you can do with image analysis.
