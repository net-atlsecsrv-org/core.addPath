# Deploy the Computer Vision container to Azure Container Instances

Learn how to deploy the Cognitive Services [Computer Vision](computer-vision-how-to-install-containers.md) container to Azure [Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/). This procedure demonstrates the creation of the Computer Vision resource. Then we discuss pulling the associated container image. Finally, we highlight the ability to exercise the orchestration of the two from a browser. Using containers can shift the developers' attention away from managing infrastructure to instead focusing on application development.
