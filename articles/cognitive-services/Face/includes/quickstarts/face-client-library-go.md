Get started with the Face client library for Go. Follow these steps to install the library and try out our examples for basic tasks. The Face service provides you with access to advanced algorithms for detecting and recognizing human faces in images.

Use the Face service client library for Go to:

* [Detect faces in an image](#detect-faces-in-an-image)
* [Find similar faces](#find-similar-faces)
* [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group)
* [Identify a face](#identify-a-face)
* [Take a snapshot for data migration](#take-a-snapshot-for-data-migration)

[Reference documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face) | [SDK download](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Set up

### Create a Face Azure resource 

Begin using the Face service by creating an Azure resource. Choose the resource type that's right for you:

* A [trial resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) (no Azure subscription needed): 
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/). 
    * This is a great option if you want to try Face service, but donâ€™t have an Azure subscription.
* A [ Face service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
    * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* A [Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
    * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.

### Create an environment variable

>[!NOTE]
> The endpoints for non-trial resources created after July 1, 2019 use the custom subdomain format shown below. For more information and a complete list of regional endpoints, see [Custom subdomain names for Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains). 

Using your key and endpoint from the resource you created, create two environment variables for authentication:
* `FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` - The resource key for authenticating your requests.
* `FACE_ENDPOINT` - The resource endpoint for sending API requests. It will look like this: 
  * `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com` 

Use the instructions for your operating system.
<!-- replace the below endpoint and key examples -->
#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY <replace-with-your-product-name-key>
setx FACE_ENDPOINT <replace-with-your-product-name-endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variable, restart the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<replace-with-your-product-name-key>
export FACE_ENDPOINT=<replace-with-your-product-name-endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variable, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/unix)

Edit your `.bash_profile`, and add the environment variable:

```bash
export FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<replace-with-your-product-name-key>
export FACE_ENDPOINT=<replace-with-your-product-name-endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variable, run `source .bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.
***

### Create a Go project directory

In a console window (cmd, PowerShell, Terminal, Bash), create a new workspace for your Go project, named `my-app`, and navigate to it.

```
mkdir -p my-app/{src, bin, pkg}  
cd my-app
```

Your workspace will contain three folders:

* **src** - This directory will contain source code and packages. Any packages installed with the `go get` command will be in this folder.
* **pkg** - This directory will contain the compiled Go package objects. These files all have a `.a` extension.
* **bin** - This directory will contain the binary executable files that are created when you run `go install`.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about the structure of a Go workspace, see the [Go language documentation](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). This guide includes information for setting `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT`.

### Install the client library for Go

Next, install the client library for Go:

```bash
go get -u https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face
```

or if you use dep, within your repo run:

```bash
dep ensure -add https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face
```

### Create a Go application

Next, create a file in the **src** directory named `sample-app.go`:

```bash
cd src
touch sample-app.go
```

Open `sample-app.go` in your preferred IDE or text editor. Then add the package name and import the following libraries:

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_imports)]

Next, you'll begin adding code to carry out different Face service operations.

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Face service Go client library.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[BaseClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#BaseClient) | This class represents your authorization to use the Face service, and you need it for all Face functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to produce instances of other classes. |
|[Client](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client)|This class handles the basic detection and recognition tasks that you can do with human faces. |
|[DetectedFace](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#DetectedFace)|This class represents all of the data that was detected from a single face in an image. You can use it to retrieve detailed information about the face.|
|[ListClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#ListClient)|This class manages the cloud-stored **FaceList** constructs, which store an assorted set of faces. |
|[PersonGroupPersonClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupPersonClient)| This class manages the cloud-stored **Person** constructs, which store a set of faces that belong to a single person.|
|[PersonGroupClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupClient)| This class manages the cloud-stored **PersonGroup** constructs, which store a set of assorted **Person** objects. |
|[SnapshotClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#SnapshotClient)|This class manages the Snapshot functionality. You can use it to temporarily save all of your cloud-based Face data and migrate that data to a new Azure subscription. |

## Code examples

These code samples show you how to complete basic tasks using the Face service client library for Go:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Detect faces in an image](#detect-faces-in-an-image)
* [Find similar faces](#find-similar-faces)
* [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group)
* [Identify a face](#identify-a-face)
* [Take a snapshot for data migration](#take-a-snapshot-for-data-migration)

## Authenticate the client

> [!NOTE] 
> This quickstart assumes you've [created environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for your Face key and endpoint, named `FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `FACE_ENDPOINT` respectively.

Create a **main** function and add the following code to it to instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. You create a **[CognitiveServicesAuthorizer](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest#CognitiveServicesAuthorizer)** object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create a **[Client](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client)** object. This code also instantiates a context object, which is needed for the creation of client objects. It also defines a remote location where some of the sample images in this quickstart are found.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_main_client)]


## Detect faces in an image

Add the following code in your **main** method. This code defines a remote sample image and specifies which face features to extract from the image. It also specifies which AI model to use to extract data from the detected face(s). See [Specify a recognition model](../../Face-API-How-to-Topics/specify-recognition-model.md) for information on these options. Finally, the **[DetectWithURL](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client.DetectWithURL)** method does the face detection operation on the image and saves the results in program memory.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_detect)]

### Display detected face data

The next block of code takes the first element in the array of **[DetectedFace](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#DetectedFace)** objects and prints its attributes to the console. If you used an image with multiple faces, you should iterate through the array instead.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_detect_display)]

## Find similar faces

The following code takes a single detected face (source) and searches a set of other faces (target) to find matches. When it finds a match, it prints the ID of the matched face to the console.

### Detect faces for comparison

First, save a reference to the face you detected in the [Detect faces in an image](#detect-faces-in-an-image) section. This face will be the source.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_similar_single_ref)]

Then enter the following code to detect a set of faces in a different image. These faces will be the target.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_similar_multiple_ref)]

### Find matches

The following code uses the **[FindSimilar](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client.FindSimilar)** method to find all of the target faces that match the source face.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_similar)]

### Print matches

The following code prints the match details to the console.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_similar_print)]


## Create and train a person group

To step through this scenario, you need to save the following images to the root directory of your project: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/tree/master/Face/images.

This group of images contains three sets of single-face images that correspond to three different people. The code will define three **PersonGroup Person** objects and associate them with image files that start with `woman`, `man`, and `child`.

### Create PersonGroup

Once you've downloaded your images, add the following code to the bottom of your **main** method. This code authenticates a **[PersonGroupClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupClient)** object and then uses it to define a new **PersonGroup**.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_pg_setup)]

### Create PersonGroup Persons

The next block of code authenticates a **[PersonGroupPersonClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupPersonClient)** and uses it to define three new **PersonGroup Person** objects. These objects each represent a single person in the set of images.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_pgp_setup)]

### Assign faces to Persons

The following code sorts the images by their prefix, detects faces, and assigns the faces to each respective **PersonGroup Person** object, based on the image file name.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_pgp_assign)]

### Train PersonGroup

Once you've assigned faces, you train the **PersonGroup** so it can identify the visual features associated with each of its **Person** objects. The following code calls the asynchronous **train** method and polls the result, printing the status to the console.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_pg_train)]

## Identify a face

The following code takes an image with multiple faces and looks to find the identity of each person in the image. It compares each detected face to a **PersonGroup**, a database of different **Person** objects whose facial features are known.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to run this example, you must first run the code in [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group).

### Get a test image

The following code looks in the root of your project for an image _test-image-person-group.jpg_ and loads it into program memory. You can find this image in the same repo as the images used in [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group): https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/tree/master/Face/images.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_id_source_get)]

### Detect source faces in test image

The next code block does ordinary face detection on the test image to retrieve all of the faces and save them to an array.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_id_source_detect)]

### Identify faces

The **[Identify](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client.Identify)** method takes the array of detected faces and compares them to the given **PersonGroup** (defined and trained in the earlier section). If it can match a detected face to a **Person** in the group, it saves the result.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_id)]

This code then prints detailed match results to the console.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_id_print)]


## Verify faces

The Verify operation takes a face ID and either another face ID or a **Person** object and determines whether they belong to the same person.

The following code detects faces in two source images and then verifies each of them against a face detected from a target image.

### Get test images

The following code blocks declare variables that will point to the target and source images for the verification operation.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_ver_images)]

### Detect faces for verification

The following code detects faces in the source and target images and saves them to variables.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_ver_detect_source)]

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_ver_detect_target)]

### Get verification results

The following code compares each of the source images to the target image and prints a message indicating whether they belong to the same person.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_ver)]


## Take a snapshot for data migration

The Snapshots feature lets you move your saved face data, such as a trained **PersonGroup**, to a different Azure Cognitive Services Face subscription. You might use this feature if, for example, you've created a **PersonGroup** object using a free trial subscription and now want to migrate it to a paid subscription. See the [Migrate your face data](../../Face-API-How-to-Topics/how-to-migrate-face-data.md) for a broad overview of the Snapshots feature.

In this example, you'll migrate the **PersonGroup** you created in [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group). You can either complete that section first, or use your own Face data construct(s).

### Set up target subscription

First, you must have a second Azure subscription with a Face resource; you can do this by repeating the steps in the [Set up](#set-up) section. 

Then, create the following variables near the top of your **main** method. You'll also need to create new environment variables for the subscription ID of your Azure account, as well as the key, endpoint, and subscription ID of your new (target) account.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_target_client)]

Then, put your subscription ID value into an array for the next steps.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_snap_target_id)]

### Authenticate target client

Later in your script, save your original client object as the source client, and then authenticate a new client object for your target subscription. 

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_snap_target_auth)]

### Take a snapshot

The next step is to take the snapshot with **[Take](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#SnapshotClient.Take)**, which saves your original subscription's face data to a temporary cloud location. This method returns an ID that you use to query the status of the operation.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_snap_take)]

Next, query the ID until the operation has completed.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_snap_query)]

### Apply the snapshot

Use the **[Apply](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#SnapshotClient.Apply)** operation to write your newly uploaded face data to your target subscription. This method also returns an ID.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_snap_apply)]

Again, query the ID until the operation has completed.

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_snap_apply_query)]

Once you've completed these steps, you can access your face data constructs from your new (target) subscription.

## Run the application

Run your Go application with the `go run [arguments]` command from your application directory.

```bash
go run sample-app.go
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

If you created a **PersonGroup** in this quickstart and you want to delete it, call the **[Delete](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupClient.Delete)** method. If you migrated data using the Snapshot feature in this quickstart, you'll also need to delete the **PersonGroup** saved to the target subscription.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to use the Face library for Go to do basis tasks. Next, explore the reference documentation to learn more about the library.
