# What is the Azure Face service?

> [!WARNING]
> On June 11, 2020, Microsoft announced that it will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until strong regulation, grounded in human rights, has been enacted. As such, customers may not use facial recognition features or functionality included in Azure Services, such as Face or Video Indexer, if a customer is, or is allowing use of such services by or for, a police department in the United States.

[!INCLUDE [TLS 1.2 enforcement](../../../includes/cognitive-services-tls-announcement.md)]

The Azure Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images. Facial recognition software is important in many different scenarios, such as  security, natural user interface, image content analysis and management, mobile apps, and robotics.

The Face service provides several different facial analysis functions which are each outlined in the following sections.

## Face detection

The Face service detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. Optionally, face detection can extract a series of face-related attributes, such as head pose, gender, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses.

> [!NOTE]
> The face detection feature is also available through the [Computer Vision service](../computer-vision/overview.md). However, if you want to do further operations with face data, you should use this service instead.

For more information on face detection, see the [Face detection](concepts/face-detection.md) concepts article. Also see the [Detect API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236) reference documentation.

## Face verification

The Verify API does an authentication against two detected faces or from one detected face to one person object. Practically, it evaluates whether two faces belong to the same person. This capability is potentially useful in security scenarios. For more information, see the [Facial recognition](concepts/face-recognition.md) concepts guide or the [Verify API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523a) reference documentation.

## Find similar faces

The Find Similar API does face matching between target face and a set of candidate faces, finding a smaller set of faces that look similar to the target face. This is useful for doing a face search by image. 

Two working modes, **matchPerson** and **matchFace**, are supported. The **matchPerson** mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the [Verify API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523a). The **matchFace** mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.

The following example shows the target face:

![A woman smiling](./Images/FaceFindSimilar.QueryFace.jpg)

And these images are the candidate faces:

![Five images of people smiling. Images a and b show the same person.](./Images/FaceFindSimilar.Candidates.jpg)

To find four similar faces, the **matchPerson** mode returns a and b, which show the same person as the target face. The **matchFace** mode returns a, b, c, and d&mdash;exactly four candidates, even if some aren't the same person as the target or have low similarity. For more information, seeÂ the [Facial recognition](concepts/face-recognition.md) concepts guide or the [Find Similar API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237) reference documentation.

## Face grouping

The Group API divides a set of unknown faces into several groups based on similarity. Each group is a disjoint proper subset of the original set of faces. All of the faces in a group are likely to belong to the same person. There can be several different groups for a single person. The groups are differentiated by another factor, such as expression, for example. For more information, see the [Facial recognition](concepts/face-recognition.md) concepts guide or the [Group API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395238) reference documentation.

## Person identification

The Identify API is used to identify a detected face against a database of people (facial recognition search). This feature might be useful for automatic image tagging in photo management software. You create the database in advance, and you can edit it over time.

The following image shows an example of a database named `"myfriends"`. Each group can contain up to 1 million different person objects. Each person object can have up to 248 faces registered.

![A grid with three columns for different people, each with three rows of face images](./Images/person.group.clare.jpg)

After you create and train a database, you can do identification against the group with a new detected face. If the face is identified as a person in the group, the person object is returned.

For more information about person identification, see the [Facial recognition](concepts/face-recognition.md) concepts guide or the [Identify API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239) reference documentation.

## Containers

[Use the Face container](face-how-to-install-containers.md) to detect, recognize, and identify faces by installing a standardized Docker container closer to your data.

## Sample apps

The following sample applications show a few ways to use the Face service:

- [Face API: Windows Client Library and sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Windows) is a WPF app that demonstrates several scenarios of Face detection, analysis, and identification.
- [FamilyNotes UWP app](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes) is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app that uses face identification along with speech, Cortana, ink, and camera in a family note-sharing scenario.

## Data privacy and security

As with all of the Cognitive Services resources, developers who use the Face service must be aware of Microsoft's policies on customer data. For more information, see the [Cognitive Services page](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/cognitiveservices) on the Microsoft Trust Center.
