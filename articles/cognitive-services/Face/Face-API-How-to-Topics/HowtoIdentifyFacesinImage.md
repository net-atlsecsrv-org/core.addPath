# Example: Identify faces in images

This guide demonstrates how to identify unknown faces by using PersonGroup objects, which are created from known people in advance. The samples are written in C# by using the Azure Cognitive Services Face API client library.

## Preparation

This sample demonstrates:

- How to create a PersonGroup. This PersonGroup contains a list of known people.
- How to assign faces to each person. These faces are used as a baseline to identify people. We recommend that you use clear frontal views of faces. An example is a photo ID. A good set of photos includes faces of the same person in different poses, clothing colors, or hairstyles.

To carry out the demonstration of this sample, prepare:

- A few photos with the person's face. [Download sample photos](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Windows/tree/master/Data) for Anna, Bill, and Clare.
- A series of test photos. The photos might or might not contain the faces of Anna, Bill, or Clare. They're used to test identification. Also select some sample images from the preceding link.

## Step 1: Authorize the API call

Every call to the Face API requires a subscription key. This key can be either passed through a query string parameter or specified in the request header. To pass the subscription key through a query string, see the request URL for the [Face - Detect](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236) as an example:
```
https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0/detect[?returnFaceId][&returnFaceLandmarks][&returnFaceAttributes]
&subscription-key=<Subscription key>
```

As an alternative, specify the subscription key in the HTTP request header **ocp-apim-subscription-key: &lt;Subscription Key&gt;**.
When you use a client library, the subscription key is passed in through the constructor of the FaceClient class. For example:
 
```csharp 
private readonly IFaceClient faceClient = new FaceClient(
            new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials("<subscription key>"),
            new System.Net.Http.DelegatingHandler[] { });
```
 
To get the subscription key, go to the Azure Marketplace from the Azure portal. For more information, see [Subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/).

## Step 2: Create the PersonGroup

In this step, a PersonGroup named "MyFriends" contains Anna, Bill, and Clare. Each person has several faces registered. The faces must be detected from the images. After all of these steps, you have a PersonGroup like the following image:

![MyFriends](../Images/group.image.1.jpg)

### Step 2.1: Define people for the PersonGroup
A person is a basic unit of identify. A person can have one or more known faces registered. A PersonGroup is a collection of people. Each person is defined within a particular PersonGroup. Identification is done against a PersonGroup. The task is to create a PersonGroup, and then create the people in it, such as Anna, Bill, and Clare.

First, create a new PersonGroup by using the [PersonGroup - Create](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395244) API. The corresponding client library API is the CreatePersonGroupAsync method for the FaceClient class. The group ID that's specified to create the group is unique for each subscription. You also can get, update, or delete PersonGroups by using other PersonGroup APIs. 

After a group is defined, you can define people within it by using the [PersonGroup Person - Create](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523c) API. The client library method is CreatePersonAsync. You can add a face to each person after they're created.

```csharp 
// Create an empty PersonGroup
string personGroupId = "myfriends";
await faceClient.PersonGroup.CreateAsync(personGroupId, "My Friends");
 
// Define Anna
CreatePersonResult friend1 = await faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.CreateAsync(
    // Id of the PersonGroup that the person belonged to
    personGroupId,    
    // Name of the person
    "Anna"            
);
 
// Define Bill and Clare in the same way
```
### <a name="step2-2"></a> Step 2.2: Detect faces and register them to the correct person
Detection is done by sending a "POST" web request to the [Face - Detect](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236) API with the image file in the HTTP request body. When you use the client library, face detection is done through one of the Detect..Async methods of the FaceClient class.

For each face that's detected, call [PersonGroup Person – Add Face](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523b) to add it to the correct person.

The following code demonstrates the process of how to detect a face from an image and add it to a person:

```csharp 
// Directory contains image files of Anna
const string friend1ImageDir = @"D:\Pictures\MyFriends\Anna\";
 
foreach (string imagePath in Directory.GetFiles(friend1ImageDir, "*.jpg"))
{
    using (Stream s = File.OpenRead(imagePath))
    {
        // Detect faces in the image and add to Anna
        await faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.AddFaceFromStreamAsync(
            personGroupId, friend1.PersonId, s);
    }
}
// Do the same for Bill and Clare
``` 
If the image contains more than one face, only the largest face is added. You can add other faces to the person. Pass a string in the format of "targetFace = left, top, width, height" to [PersonGroup Person - Add Face](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523b) API's targetFace query parameter. You also can use the targetFace optional parameter for the AddPersonFaceAsync method to add other faces. Each face added to the person is given a unique persisted face ID. You can use this ID in [PersonGroup Person – Delete Face](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523e) and [Face – Identify](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

## Step 3: Train the PersonGroup

The PersonGroup must be trained before an identification can be performed by using it. The PersonGroup must be retrained after you add or remove any person or if you edit a person's registered face. The training is done by the [PersonGroup – Train](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395249) API. When you use the client library, it's a call to the TrainPersonGroupAsync method:
 
```csharp 
await faceClient.PersonGroup.TrainAsync(personGroupId);
```
 
Training is an asynchronous process. It might not be finished even after the TrainPersonGroupAsync method returns. You might need to query the training status. Use the [PersonGroup - Get Training Status](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395247) API or GetPersonGroupTrainingStatusAsync method of the client library. The following code demonstrates a simple logic of waiting for PersonGroup training to finish:
 
```csharp 
TrainingStatus trainingStatus = null;
while(true)
{
    trainingStatus = await faceClient.PersonGroup.GetTrainingStatusAsync(personGroupId);
 
    if (trainingStatus.Status != TrainingStatusType.Running)
    {
        break;
    }
 
    await Task.Delay(1000);
} 
``` 

## Step 4: Identify a face against a defined PersonGroup

When the Face API performs identifications, it computes the similarity of a test face among all the faces within a group. It returns the most comparable persons for the testing face. This process is done through the [Face - Identify](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239) API or the IdentifyAsync method of the client library.

The testing face must be detected by using the previous steps. Then the face ID is passed to the identification API as a second argument. Multiple face IDs can be identified at once. The result contains all the identified results. By default, the identification process returns only one person that matches the test face best. If you prefer, specify the optional parameter maxNumOfCandidatesReturned to let the identification process return more candidates.

The following code demonstrates the identification process:

```csharp 
string testImageFile = @"D:\Pictures\test_img1.jpg";

using (Stream s = File.OpenRead(testImageFile))
{
    var faces = await faceClient.Face.DetectWithStreamAsync(s);
    var faceIds = faces.Select(face => face.FaceId.Value).ToArray();
 
    var results = await faceClient.Face.IdentifyAsync(faceIds, personGroupId);
    foreach (var identifyResult in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Result of face: {0}", identifyResult.FaceId);
        if (identifyResult.Candidates.Length == 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("No one identified");
        }
        else
        {
            // Get top 1 among all candidates returned
            var candidateId = identifyResult.Candidates[0].PersonId;
            var person = await faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.GetAsync(personGroupId, candidateId);
            Console.WriteLine("Identified as {0}", person.Name);
        }
    }
}
``` 

After you finish the steps, try to identify different faces. See if the faces of Anna, Bill, or Clare can be correctly identified according to the images uploaded for face detection. See the following examples:

![Identify different faces](../Images/identificationResult.1.jpg )

## Step 5: Request for large scale

A PersonGroup can hold up to 10,000 persons based on the previous design limitation.
For more information about up to million-scale scenarios, see [How to use the large-scale feature](how-to-use-large-scale.md).
