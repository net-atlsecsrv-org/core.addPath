# Quickstart: Recognize digital ink with the Ink Recognizer REST API and Java

Use this quickstart to begin using the Ink Recognizer API on digital ink strokes. This Java application sends an API request containing JSON-formatted ink stroke data, and gets the response.

While this application is written in Java, the API is a RESTful web service compatible with most programming languages.

Typically you would call the API from a digital inking app. This quickstart sends ink stroke data for the following handwritten sample from a JSON file.

The source code for this quickstart can be found on [GitHub](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2089904).

## Prerequisites

- The [Java&trade; Development Kit(JDK) 7](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or later.

- Import these libraries from the Maven Repository
    - [JSON in Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) package
    - [Apache HttpClient](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient) package

- The example ink stroke data for this quickstart can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/example-ink-strokes.json).

### Create an Ink Recognizer resource

[!INCLUDE [creating an ink recognizer resource](../includes/setup-instructions.md)]

## Create a new application

1. Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE or editor, and import the following libraries.
    
    [!code-java[import statements](~/cognitive-services-rest-samples/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/RecognizeInk.java?name=imports)]

2. Create variables for your subscription key, endpoint and JSON file. The endpoint will later be appended to the Ink recognizer URI.

    [!code-java[initial vars](~/cognitive-services-rest-samples/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/RecognizeInk.java?name=vars)]

## Create a function to send requests

1. Create a new function called `sendRequest()` that takes the variables created above. Then perform the following steps.

2. Create a `CloseableHttpClient` object that can send requests to the API. Send the request to an `HttpPut` request object by combining your endpoint, and the Ink Recognizer URL.

3. Use the request's `setHeader()` function to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`, and add your subscription key to the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

4. Use the request's `setEntity()` function to the data to be sent.   

5. Use the client's `execute()` function to send the request, and save it to a `CloseableHttpResponse` object. 

6. Create an `HttpEntity` object to store the response content. Get the content with `getEntity()`. If the response isn't empty, return it.
    
    [!code-java[send a request](~/cognitive-services-rest-samples/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/RecognizeInk.java?name=sendRequest)]

## Send an ink recognition request

Create a method called `recognizeInk()` to recognize your ink stroke data. Call the `sendRequest()` method created above with your endpoint, url, subscription key, and json data. Get the result, and print it to the console.

[!code-java[recognizeInk](~/cognitive-services-rest-samples/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/RecognizeInk.java?name=recognizeInk)]

## Load your digital ink data and send the request

1. In the main method of your application, read in the JSON file containing the data that will be added to the requests.

2. Call the ink recognition function created above.
    
    [!code-java[main method](~/cognitive-services-rest-samples/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/RecognizeInk.java?name=main)]


## Run the application and view the response

Run the application. A successful response is returned in JSON format. You can also find the JSON response on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/java/InkRecognition/quickstart/example-response.json).
