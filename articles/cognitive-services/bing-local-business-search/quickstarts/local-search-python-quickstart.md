# Quickstart: Send a query to the Bing Local Business Search API in Python

Use this quickstart to begin sending requests to the Bing Local Business Search API, which is an Azure Cognitive Service. While this simple application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with any programming language capable of making HTTP requests and parsing JSON.

This example application gets local response data from the API for the search query `hotel in Bellevue`.

## Prerequisites

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.x or 3.x
 
You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with Bing APIs. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) is sufficient for this quickstart. Use the access key provided by the free trial.  See also [Cognitive Services Pricing - Bing Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/search-api/).

## Run the complete application

The following code gets localized results. It is implemented in the following steps:
1. Declare variables to specify the endpoint by host and path.
2. Specify the query parameter. 
3. Define the Search function that creates the request and adds the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header.
4. Set the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header. 
5. Make the connection and send the request.
6. Print the JSON results.

The complete code for this demo follows:

```python
import http.client, urllib.parse
import json

# Replace the subscriptionKey string value with your valid subscription key.
subscriptionKey = 'YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY'

host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
path = '/bing/v7.0/localbusinesses/search'

query = 'restaurant in Bellevue'

params = '?q=' + urllib.parse.quote (query) + '&mkt=en-us'

def get_local():
    headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey}
    conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection (host)
    conn.request ("GET", path + params, None, headers)
    response = conn.getresponse ()
    return response.read ()

result = get_local()
print (json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=4))

```
