# Supported entity categories in the Text Analytics API v3

Use this article to find the entity categories that can be returned by [Named Entity Recognition](how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-entity-linking.md) (NER). NER runs a predictive model to identify and categorize named entities from an input document.

A preview of NER v3.1 is also available, which includes the ability to detect personal (`PII`) and health (`PHI`) information. Additionally, click on the **Health** tab to see a list of supported categories in Text Analytics for health. 

You can find a list of types returned by version 2.1 in the [migration guide](migration-guide.md?tabs=named-entity-recognition)

## Entity categories

#### [General](#tab/general)

[!INCLUDE [supported entity types - general](./includes/entity-types/general-entities.md)]

#### [PII](#tab/personal)

[!INCLUDE [supported entity types - personally identifying information](./includes/entity-types/personal-information-entities.md)]

#### [Health](#tab/health)

[!INCLUDE [biomedical entity types](./includes/entity-types/health-entities.md)]
