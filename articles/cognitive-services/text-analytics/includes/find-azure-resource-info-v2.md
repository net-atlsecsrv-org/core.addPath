> [!IMPORTANT]
> To find your key and endpoint on the Azure portal:
> 1. Navigate to your azure resource at https://portal.azure.com/.
> 2. Click on **Quick start**, located under **Resource Management**.
>
> Remember to remove your credentials from your code when you're done, and never post them publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview).
