To use the latest version of the Text Analytics v3 client library, you will need to download the latest software package in the `Azure.AI.TextAnalytics` namespace. The **Setting up** section in the [quickstart article](../quickstarts/text-analytics-sdk.md) lists the commands you can use for your preferred language, with example code.

Looking for example code that uses v2.1 of the API? There are several samples available on GitHub for the following v2.1 SDKs: [C#](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples/tree/master/samples/TextAnalytics), [Go](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples/blob/master/cognitiveservices/textanalytics.go), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/blob/master/Samples/textAnalytics.js), [Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/blob/master/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py), and [Ruby](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-ruby-sdk-samples/blob/master/samples/text_analytics.rb).
