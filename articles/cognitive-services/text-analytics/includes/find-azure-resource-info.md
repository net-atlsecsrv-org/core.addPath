> [!TIP]
> To find your key and endpoint on the Azure portal:
> 1. Navigate to your azure resource at https://portal.azure.com/.
> 2. Click on **Quick start**, located under **Resource Management**.
>
> Be sure to remove the `/text/analytics/<version>` suffix from your endpoint, if it contains one. This suffix isn't needed for use with the client libraries.
