## Text Analytics for health categories, entities and attributes

[Text Analytics for health](../../how-tos/text-analytics-for-health.md) detects medical concepts in the following categories.  (Please note that only English text is supported in this container preview and only a single model-version is provided in each container image.)


| Category  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| ANATOMY | concepts that capture information about body and anatomic systems, sites, locations or regions. |
 | DEMOGRAPHICS | concepts that capture information about gender and age. |
 | EXAMINATION | concepts that capture information about diagnostic procedures and tests. |
 | GENOMICS | concepts that capture information about genes and variants. |
 | HEALTHCARE | concepts that capture information about administrative events, care environments and healthcare professions. |
 | MEDICAL CONDITION | concepts that capture information about diagnoses, symptoms or signs. |
 | MEDICATION | concepts that capture information about medication including medication names, classes, dosage and route of administration. |
 | SOCIAL | concepts that capture information about medically relevant social aspects such as family relation. |
 | TREATMENT | concepts that capture information about therapeutic procedures. |
  
Each category may include two concept groups:

* **Entities** - terms that capture medical concepts such as diagnosis, medication name, or treatment name.  For example, *bronchitis* is a diagnosis and *aspirin* is a medication name.  Mentions in this group may be linked to a UMLS concept ID.
* **Attributes** - phrases that provide more information about the detected entity, for example, *severe* is a condition qualifier for *bronchitis* or *81 mg* is a dosage for *aspirin*.  Mentions in this category will NOT be linked to a UMLS concept ID.

Additionally, the service recognizes relations between the different concepts including relations between attributes and entities for example, *direction* to *body structure* or *dosage* to *medication name* and relations between entities for example in abbreviation detection.
