Version 3 of the Text Analytics API lets you choose the model version that is most current for your data. Use the optional `model-version` parameter to select the version of the model that is desired for your requests. If this parameter isn't specified the API will default to `latest`, the latest stable version. Even though you can use the newest model-version in any request, only some features are updated in each version. The table below describes which features have been updated in each model version:

| Model version           | Features updated         | Latest version for:           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `2020-02-01`            | Entity recognition                      | Entity recognition                      |
| `2019-10-01`            | Entity recognition, Sentiment analysis  | Language detection, Key phrase extraction, Sentiment analysis|


Each response from the v3 endpoints includes a `model-version` field specifying the model version that was used.

```json
{
    "documents": [â€¦]
    "errors": []
    "model-version": "2019-10-01"
}
```
See [What's new](../whats-new.md) for details on the updates for these model versions.
