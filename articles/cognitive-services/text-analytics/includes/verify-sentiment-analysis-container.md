### Verify the Sentiment Analysis container instance

1. Select the **Overview** tab, and copy the IP address.
1. Open a new browser tab, and enter the IP address. For example, enter `http://<IP-address>:5000 (http://55.55.55.55:5000`). The container's home page is displayed, which lets you know the container is running.

1. Select the **Service API Description** link to go to the container's Swagger page.

1. Choose any of the **POST** APIs, and select **Try it out**. The parameters are displayed, which includes this example input:

    ```json
    {
      "documents": [
        {
          "language": "en",
          "id": "1",
          "text": "Hello world. This is some input text that I love."
        },
        {
          "language": "fr",
          "id": "2",
          "text": "Bonjour tout le monde"
        },
        {
          "language": "es",
          "id": "3",
          "text": "La carretera estaba atascada. Había mucho tráfico el día de ayer."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Replace the input with the following JSON content:

    ```json
    {
      "documents": [
        {
          "language": "en",
          "id": "7",
          "text": "I was fortunate to attend the KubeCon Conference in Barcelona, it is one of the best conferences I have ever attended. Great people, great sessions and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Set **showStats** to `true`.

1. Select **Execute** to determine the sentiment of the text.

    The model that's packaged in the container generates a score that ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is negative sentiment and 1 is positive sentiment.

    The JSON response that's returned includes sentiment for the updated text input:

    ```json
    {
      "documents": [
      {
        "id": "7",
        "score": 0.9826303720474243,
        "statistics": {
          "charactersCount": 176,
            "transactionsCount": 1
          }
        }
      ],
      "errors": [],
      "statistics": {
        "documentsCount": 1,
        "validDocumentsCount": 1,
        "erroneousDocumentsCount": 0,
        "transactionsCount": 1
      }
    }
    ```

We can now correlate the document `id` of the response payload's JSON data to the original request payload document `id`. The score of more than `0.98` indicates a very positive sentiment.
