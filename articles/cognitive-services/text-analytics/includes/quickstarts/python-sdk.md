## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Text Analytics resource"  target="_blank">create a Text Analytics resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Text Analytics API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

#### [Version 3.0](#tab/version-3)

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/TextAnalytics/python-v3-client-library.py), which contains the code examples in this quickstart. 

#### [Version 2.1](#tab/version-2)

```console
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/blob/master/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py), which contains the code examples in this quickstart. 

---

### Create a new python application

Create a new Python file and create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and subscription key.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```python
key = "<paste-your-text-analytics-key-here>"
endpoint = "<paste-your-text-analytics-endpoint-here>"
```


## Object model

#### [Version 3.0](#tab/version-3)

The Text Analytics client is a `TextAnalyticsClient` object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text as a batch. 

When batch processing text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

#### [Version 2.1](#tab/version-2)

The Text Analytics client is a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python) object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch. 

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value.

## Authenticate the client

#### [Version 3.0](#tab/version-3)

Create a function to instantiate the `TextAnalyticsClient` object with your `key` AND `endpoint` created above. Then create a new client. 

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=endpoint, credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()
```

[!code-python[version 2 authentication](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=authentication)]

--- 

## Sentiment analysis

#### [Version 3.0](#tab/version-3)

Create a new function called `sentiment_analysis_example()` that takes the client as an argument, then calls the `analyze_sentiment()` function. The returned response object will contain the sentiment label and score of the entire input document, as well as a sentiment analysis for each sentence.


```python
def sentiment_analysis_example(client):

    documents = ["I had the best day of my life. I wish you were there with me."]
    response = client.analyze_sentiment(documents = documents)[0]
    print("Document Sentiment: {}".format(response.sentiment))
    print("Overall scores: positive={0:.2f}; neutral={1:.2f}; negative={2:.2f} \n".format(
        response.confidence_scores.positive,
        response.confidence_scores.neutral,
        response.confidence_scores.negative,
    ))
    for idx, sentence in enumerate(response.sentences):
        print("Sentence: {}".format(sentence.text))
        print("Sentence {} sentiment: {}".format(idx+1, sentence.sentiment))
        print("Sentence score:\nPositive={0:.2f}\nNeutral={1:.2f}\nNegative={2:.2f}\n".format(
            sentence.confidence_scores.positive,
            sentence.confidence_scores.neutral,
            sentence.confidence_scores.negative,
        ))
          
sentiment_analysis_example(client)
```

### Output

```console
Document Sentiment: positive
Overall scores: positive=1.00; neutral=0.00; negative=0.00 

Sentence: I had the best day of my life.
Sentence 1 sentiment: positive
Sentence score:
Positive=1.00
Neutral=0.00
Negative=0.00

Sentence: I wish you were there with me.
Sentence 2 sentiment: neutral
Sentence score:
Positive=0.21
Neutral=0.77
Negative=0.02
```

#### [Version 2.1](#tab/version-2)

Authenticate a client object, and call the [sentiment()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python#sentiment-show-stats-none--documents-none--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-) function. Iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and sentiment score. A score closer to 0 indicates a negative sentiment, while a score closer to 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

[!code-python[sentiment analysis](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=sentimentAnalysis)]

### Output

```console
Document ID: 1 , Sentiment Score: 0.87
Document ID: 2 , Sentiment Score: 0.11
Document ID: 3 , Sentiment Score: 0.44
Document ID: 4 , Sentiment Score: 1.00
```

---

## Language detection

#### [Version 3.0](#tab/version-3)

Create a new function called `language_detection_example()` that takes the client as an argument, then calls the `detect_language()` function. The returned response object will contain the detected language in `primary_language` if successful, and an `error` if not.

> [!Tip]
> In some cases it may be hard to disambiguate languages based on the input. You can use the `country_hint` parameter to specify a 2-letter country code. By default the API is using the "US" as the default countryHint, to remove this behavior you can reset this parameter by setting this value to empty string `country_hint : ""`. 

```python
def language_detection_example(client):
    try:
        documents = ["Ce document est rédigé en Français."]
        response = client.detect_language(documents = documents, country_hint = 'us')[0]
        print("Language: ", response.primary_language.name)

    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
language_detection_example(client)
```


### Output

```console
Language:  French
```

#### [Version 2.1](#tab/version-2)

Using the client created earlier, call [detect_language()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python#detect-language-show-stats-none--documents-none--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-) and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the first returned language.

[!code-python[language detection](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=languageDetection)]


### Output

```console
Document ID: 1 , Language: English
Document ID: 2 , Language: Spanish
Document ID: 3 , Language: Chinese_Simplified
```

## Named Entity recognition (NER)

#### [Version 3.0](#tab/version-3)

> [!NOTE]
> In version `3.0`: 
> * Entity linking is a separate request than NER.

Create a new function called `entity_recognition_example` that takes the client as an argument, then calls the `recognize_entities()` function and iterates through the results. The returned response object will contain the list of detected entities in `entity` if successful, and an `error` if not. For each detected entity, print its Category and Sub-Category if exists.

```python
def entity_recognition_example(client):

    try:
        documents = ["I had a wonderful trip to Seattle last week."]
        result = client.recognize_entities(documents = documents)[0]

        print("Named Entities:\n")
        for entity in result.entities:
            print("\tText: \t", entity.text, "\tCategory: \t", entity.category, "\tSubCategory: \t", entity.subcategory,
                    "\n\tConfidence Score: \t", round(entity.confidence_score, 2), "\n")

    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
entity_recognition_example(client)
```

### Output

```console
Named Entities:

        Text:    trip   Category:        Event  SubCategory:     None
        Confidence Score:        0.61

        Text:    Seattle        Category:        Location       SubCategory:     GPE
        Confidence Score:        0.82

        Text:    last week      Category:        DateTime       SubCategory:     DateRange
        Confidence Score:        0.8
```

## Entity Linking

Create a new function called `entity_linking_example()` that takes the client as an argument, then calls the `recognize_linked_entities()` function and iterates through the results. The returned response object will contain the list of detected entities in `entities` if successful, and an `error` if not. Since linked entities are uniquely identified, occurrences of the same entity are grouped under a `entity` object as a list of `match` objects.

```python
def entity_linking_example(client):

    try:
        documents = ["""Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, 
        to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. 
        During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman,
        chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, 
        while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."""]
        result = client.recognize_linked_entities(documents = documents)[0]

        print("Linked Entities:\n")
        for entity in result.entities:
            print("\tName: ", entity.name, "\tId: ", entity.data_source_entity_id, "\tUrl: ", entity.url,
            "\n\tData Source: ", entity.data_source)
            print("\tMatches:")
            for match in entity.matches:
                print("\t\tText:", match.text)
                print("\t\tConfidence Score: {0:.2f}".format(match.confidence_score))
            
    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
entity_linking_example(client)
```

### Output

```console

```

#### [Version 2.1](#tab/version-2)

> [!NOTE]
> In version 2.1, entity linking is included in the NER response.

Using the client created earlier, call the [entities()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python#entities-show-stats-none--documents-none--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-) function and get the result.
