[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/tree/master/lib/services/cognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) | [Package (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting up

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-resource-creation](resource-creation.md)]

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

Create a file named `index.js` and add the following libraries:

[!code-javascript[Const statements](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=constStatements)]

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and subscription key. Obtain these values from the environment variables `TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT`. If you created these environment variables after you began editing the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell you are using to access the variables.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../find-azure-resource-info.md)]

[!code-javascript[Key and endpoint vars](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=keyVars)]

### Install the client library

Install the `@azure/ms-rest-js` and `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` NPM packages:

```console
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics @azure/ms-rest-js
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Object model

The Text Analytics client is a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient) object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch.

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

## Code examples

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)
* [Language detection](#language-detection)
* [Entity recognition](#entity-recognition)
* [Key phrase extraction](#key-phrase-extraction)


## Authenticate the client

Create a new [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient) object with `credentials` and `endpoint` as a parameter.

[!code-javascript[Authentication and client creation](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=authentication)]


## Sentiment analysis

Create a list of dictionary objects, containing the documents you want to analyze. Call the client's [sentiment()](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient#sentiment-models-textanalyticsclientsentimentoptionalparams-) method and get the returned [SentimentBatchResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/sentimentbatchresult). Iterate through the list of results, and print each document's ID and sentiment score. A score closer to 0 indicates a negative sentiment, while a score closer to 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

[!code-javascript[Sentiment analysis](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=sentimentAnalysis)]

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[ { id: '1', score: 0.87 } ]
[ { id: '2', score: 0.11 } ]
[ { id: '3', score: 0.44 } ]
[ { id: '4', score: 1.00 } ]
```

## Language detection

Create a list of dictionary objects containing your documents. Call the client's [detectLanguage()](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient#detectlanguage-models-textanalyticsclientdetectlanguageoptionalparams-) method and get the returned [LanguageBatchResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/languagebatchresult). Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and language.

[!code-javascript[Language detection](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=languageDetection)]

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
Document ID: 1 , Language: English
Document ID: 2 , Language: Spanish
Document ID: 3 , Language: Chinese_Simplified
```

## Entity recognition

Create a list of objects, containing your documents. Call the client's [entities()](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient#entities-models-textanalyticscliententitiesoptionalparams-) method and get the [EntitiesBatchResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/entitiesbatchresult) object. Iterate through the list of results, and print each document's ID. For each detected entity, print its wikipedia name, the type and sub-types (if exists) as well as the locations in the original text.

[!code-javascript[Entity recognition](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=entityRecognition)]

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console

## Key phrase extraction

Create a list of objects, containing your documents. Call the client's [keyPhrases()](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient#keyphrases-models-textanalyticsclientkeyphrasesoptionalparams-) method and get the returned     [KeyPhraseBatchResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/keyphrasebatchresult) object. Iterate through the results and print each document's ID, and any detected key phrases.

[!code-javascript[Key phrase extraction](~/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/Samples/textAnalytics.js?name=keyPhraseExtraction)]

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[
    { id: '1', keyPhrases: [ '幸せ' ] }
    { id: '2', keyPhrases: [ 'Stuttgart', "hotel", "Fahrt", "Fu" ] }
    { id: '3', keyPhrases: [ 'cat', 'veterinarian' ] }
    { id: '3', keyPhrases: [ 'fútbol' ] }
]
```

## Run the application

Run the application with the `node` command on your quickstart file.

```console
node index.js
```
