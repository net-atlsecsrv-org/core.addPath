Get a key and endpoint to authenticate your applications. Create a resource for Text Analytics using the [Azure portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key and endpoint from your trial subscription or resource, create two [environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication). One named `TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` for your key, and one named `TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT` for your endpoint.
