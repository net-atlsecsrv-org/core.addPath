# Quickstart: Text analytics client library for Node.js
<a name="HOLTop"></a>

Get started with the Text Analytics client library for .Node.js. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks. 

Use the Text Analytics client library for Node.js to perform:

* Sentiment analysis
* Language detection
* Entity recognition
* Key phrase extraction

[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/tree/master/lib/services/cognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) | [Package (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting up

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Text analytics using the [Azure portal](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key, named `TEXTANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

Create a file named `index.js` and import the following libraries:

```javascript
const CognitiveServicesCredentials = require("@azure/ms-rest-js");
const TextAnalyticsAPIClient = require("@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics");
```

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and subscription key. Obtain these values from the environment variables TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY and TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT. If you created these environment variables after you began editing the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell you are using to access the variables.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
const key_var = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY';
if (!process.env[key_var]) {
    throw new Error('please set/export the following environment variable: ' + key_var);
}
const subscription_key = process.env[key_var];

const endpoint_var = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT';
if (!process.env[endpoint_var]) {
    throw new Error('please set/export the following environment variable: ' + endpoint_var);
}
const endpoint = process.env[endpoint_var];
```

### Install the client library

Install the `@azure/ms-rest-js` and `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` NPM packages:

```console
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics @azure/ms-rest-js
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Object model

The Text Analytics client is a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient?view=azure-node-latest) object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch.

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

## Code examples

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)
* [Language detection](#language-detection)
* [Entity recognition](#entity-recognition)
* [Key phrase extraction](#key-phrase-extraction)


## Authenticate the client

Create a new [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient?view=azure-node-latest) object with `credentials` and `endpoint` as a parameter.

```javascript
const creds = new CognitiveServicesCredentials.ApiKeyCredentials({ inHeader: { 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key } });
const client = new TextAnalyticsAPIClient.TextAnalyticsClient(creds, endpoint);
```

## Sentiment analysis

Create a list of objects, containing the documents you want to analyze.

```javascript
const inputDocuments = {documents:[
    {language:"en", id:"1", text:"I had the best day of my life."}
]}
```

Call `client.sentiment` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and sentiment score. A score closer to 0 indicates a negative sentiment, while a score closer to 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

```javascript
const operation = client.sentiment({multiLanguageBatchInput: inputDocuments})
operation
.then(result => {
    console.log(result.documents);
})
.catch(err => {
    throw err;
});
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[ { id: '1', score: 0.8723785877227783 } ]
```

## Language detection

Create a list of objects containing your documents.

```javascript
// The documents to be submitted for language detection. The ID can be any value.
const inputDocuments = {
    documents: [
        { id: "1", text: "This is a document written in English." }
    ]
    };
```

Call `client.detectLanguage()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the first returned language.

```javascript
const operation = client.detectLanguage({
    languageBatchInput: inputDocuments
});
operation
    .then(result => {
    result.documents.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.detectedLanguages.forEach(language =>
        console.log(`\tLanguage: ${language.name}`)
        );
    });
    })
    .catch(err => {
    throw err;
    });
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
===== LANGUAGE EXTRACTION ======
ID: 1 Language English
```

## Entity recognition

Create a list of objects, containing your documents.

```javascript
const inputDocuments = {
    documents: [
        { language: "en", id: "1", text: "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800" }
    ]
}
```

Call `client.entities()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID. For each detected entity, print its wikipedia name, the type and sub-types (if exists) as well as the locations in the original text.

```javascript
const operation = client.entities({
    multiLanguageBatchInput: inputDocuments
});
operation
    .then(result => {
    result.documents.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`Document ID: ${document.id}`)
        document.entities.forEach(e =>{
        console.log(`\tName: ${e.name} Type: ${e.type} Sub Type: ${e.type}`)
        e.matches.forEach(match => (
            console.log(`\t\tOffset: ${match.offset} Length: ${match.length} Score: ${match.entityTypeScore}`)
        ))
        })
    });
    })
    .catch(err => {
    throw err;
    });
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
Document ID: 1
    Name: Microsoft Type: Organization Sub Type: Organization
            Offset: 0 Length: 9 Score: 1
    Name: Bill Gates Type: Person Sub Type: Person
            Offset: 25 Length: 10 Score: 0.999786376953125
    Name: Paul Allen Type: Person Sub Type: Person
            Offset: 40 Length: 10 Score: 0.9988105297088623
    Name: April 4 Type: Other Sub Type: Other
            Offset: 54 Length: 7 Score: 0.8
    Name: April 4, 1975 Type: DateTime Sub Type: DateTime
            Offset: 54 Length: 13 Score: 0.8
    Name: BASIC Type: Other Sub Type: Other
            Offset: 89 Length: 5 Score: 0.8
    Name: Altair 8800 Type: Other Sub Type: Other
            Offset: 116 Length: 11 Score: 0.8
```

## Key phrase extraction

Create a list of objects, containing your documents.

```javascript
    let inputLanguage = {
    documents: [
        {language:"en", id:"1", text:"My cat might need to see a veterinarian."}
    ]
    };
```

Call `client.keyPhrases()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results and print each document's ID, and any detected key phrases.

```javascript
    let operation = client.keyPhrases({
    multiLanguageBatchInput: inputLanguage
    });
    operation
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result.documents);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        throw err;
    });
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[
    { id: '1', keyPhrases: [ 'cat', 'veterinarian' ] }
]
```

## Run the application

Run the application with the `node` command on your quickstart file.

```console
node index.js
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
