# Quickstart: Use the Text Analytics client library

Use this article to get started with the Text Analytics client library. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for mining text.

Use the Text Analytics client library to perform:

* Sentiment analysis
* Language detection
* Entity recognition
* Key phrase extraction
* Opinion mining

> * The latest stable version of the Text Analytics API is `3.0`.
>    * Be sure to only follow the instructions for the version you are using.
> * The code in this article uses synchronous methods and un-secured credentials storage for simplicity reasons. For production scenarios, we recommend using the batched asynchronous methods for performance and scalability. See the reference documentation below.
