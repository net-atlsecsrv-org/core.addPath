# Quickstart: Use the Text Analytics client library and REST API

Use this article to get started with the Text Analytics client library and REST API. Follow these steps to try out examples code for mining text:

* Sentiment analysis
* Opinion mining
* Language detection
* Entity recognition
* Personal Identifying Information recognition
* Key phrase extraction

> * The latest stable version of the Text Analytics API is `3.0`.
>    * Be sure to only follow the instructions for the version you are using.
> * The code in this article uses synchronous methods and un-secured credentials storage for simplicity reasons. For production scenarios, we recommend using the batched asynchronous methods for performance and scalability. See the reference documentation below.
> * If you want to use Text Analytics for health or Asynchronous operations, see the examples on Github for [C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics), [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/) or [Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics)

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
