#### [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](#tab/named-entity-recognition)

> [!NOTE]
> * NER v3 currently only supports English and Spanish languages. If you call NER v3 with a different language, the API will return v2.1 results, provided the language is supported in version 2.1.
> * v2.1 only returns the full set of available entities for the English, Chinese-Simplified, French, German, and Spanish languages.  The "Person", "Location" and "Organization" entities are returned for the other supported languages.

#### [Language Detection](#tab/language-detection)

The Text Analytics API can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages, and return detected languages with their name and code. Text Analytics Language Detection language code parameters conform to [BCP-47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) standard with most of them conforming to [ISO-639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) identifiers. 

If you have content expressed in a less frequently used language, you can try Language Detection to see if it returns a code. The response for languages that cannot be detected is `unknown`.
