# Example: Detect sentiment with Text Analytics

The [Azure Sentiment Analysis API](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics-v2-1/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c9) evaluates text input and returns a sentiment score for each document. Scores range from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive).

This capability is useful for detecting positive and negative sentiment in social media, customer reviews, and discussion forums. Content is provided by you. Models and training data are provided by the service.

Currently, the Sentiment Analysis API supports English, German, Spanish, and French. Other languages are in preview. For more information, see [Supported languages](../text-analytics-supported-languages.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Azure Text Analytics API also provides a Linux-based Docker container image for sentiment analysis, so you can [install and run the Text Analytics container](text-analytics-how-to-install-containers.md) close to your data.

## Concepts

Text Analytics uses a machine learning classification algorithm to generate a sentiment score between 0 and 1. Scores closer to 1 indicate positive sentiment, while scores closer to 0 indicate negative sentiment. The model is pretrained with an extensive body of text with sentiment associations. Currently, it isn't possible to provide your own training data. The model uses a combination of techniques during text analysis. Techniques include text processing, part-of-speech analysis, word placement, and word associations. For more information about the algorithm, see [Introducing Text Analytics](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/04/08/introducing-text-analytics-in-the-azure-ml-marketplace/).

Sentiment analysis is performed on the entire document, as opposed to extracting sentiment for a particular entity in the text. In practice, there's a tendency for scoring accuracy to improve when documents contain one or two sentences rather than a large block of text. During an objectivity assessment phase, the model determines whether a document as a whole is objective or contains sentiment. A document that's mostly objective doesn't progress to the sentiment detection phase, which results in a 0.50 score, with no further processing. For documents that continue in the pipeline, the next phase generates a score above or below 0.50. The score depends on the degree of sentiment detected in the document.

## Sentiment Analysis v3 public preview

The next version of Sentiment Analysis is now available for public preview. It provides significant improvements in the accuracy and detail of the API's text categorization and scoring. Try it using the [API test console](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics-v3-0-Preview-1/operations/Sentiment).

> [!NOTE]
> * The Sentiment Analysis v3 request format and [data limits](../overview.md#data-limits) are the same as the previous version.
> * At this time, Sentiment Analysis v3:
>    * Currently supports the English (`en`), Japanese (`ja`), Chinese Simplified (`zh-Hans`),  Chinese Traditional (`zh-Hant`), French (`fr`), Italian (`it`), Spanish (`es`), Dutch (`nl`), Portuguese (`pt`), and German (`de`) languages.
>    * Is available in the following regions: `Australia East`, `Central Canada`, `Central US`, `East Asia`, `East US`, `East US 2`, `North Europe`, `Southeast Asia`, `South Central US`, `UK South`, `West Europe`, and `West US 2`.

|Feature |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Improved accuracy     | Significant improvement in detecting positive, neutral, negative, and mixed sentiment in text documents over previous versions.           |
|Document and sentence-level sentiment score     | Detect the sentiment of both a document and its individual sentences. If the document includes multiple sentences, each sentence is also assigned a sentiment score.         |
|Sentiment labeling and scoring     | The API now returns sentiment categories for text, in addition to a sentiment score. The categories are `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`, and `mixed`.       |
| Improved output | Sentiment analysis now returns information for both an entire text document and its individual sentences. |
| model-version parameter | An optional parameter for choosing which version of the Text Analytics model is used on your data. |

### Sentiment labeling

Sentiment Analysis v3 can return scores and labels at a sentence and document level. The scores and labels are `positive`, `negative`, and `neutral`. At the document level, the `mixed` sentiment label (not the score) also can be returned. The sentiment of the document is determined by aggregating the scores of the sentences.

| Sentence sentiment                                                        | Returned document label |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| At least one positive sentence and the rest of the sentences are neutral. | `positive`     |
| At least one negative sentence and the rest of the sentences are neutral.  | `negative`     |
| At least one negative sentence and at least one positive sentence.         | `mixed`        |
| All sentences are neutral.                                                 | `neutral`      |

### Model versioning

```

### Example C# code

You can find an example C# application that calls this version of Sentiment Analysis on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/tree/master/dotnet/Language/SentimentV3.cs).

## Preparation

Sentiment analysis produces a higher-quality result when you give it smaller chunks of text to work on. This is opposite from key phrase extraction, which performs better on larger blocks of text. To get the best results from both operations, consider restructuring the inputs accordingly.

You must have JSON documents in this format: ID, text, and language.

Document size must be under 5,120 characters per document. You can have up to 1,000 items (IDs) per collection. The collection is submitted in the body of the request. The following sample is an example of content you might submit for sentiment analysis:

```json
    {
        "documents": [
            {
                "language": "en",
                "id": "1",
                "text": "We love this trail and make the trip every year. The views are breathtaking and well worth the hike!"
            },
            {
                "language": "en",
                "id": "2",
                "text": "Poorly marked trails! I thought we were goners. Worst hike ever."
            },
            {
                "language": "en",
                "id": "3",
                "text": "Everyone in my family liked the trail but thought it was too challenging for the less athletic among us. Not necessarily recommended for small children."
            },
            {
                "language": "en",
                "id": "4",
                "text": "It was foggy so we missed the spectacular views, but the trail was ok. Worth checking out if you are in the area."
            },
            {
                "language": "en",
                "id": "5",
                "text": "This is my favorite trail. It has beautiful views and many places to stop and rest"
            }
        ]
    }
```

## Step 1: Structure the request

For more information on request definition, see [Call the Text Analytics API](text-analytics-how-to-call-api.md). The following points are restated for convenience:

+ Create a POST request. To review the API documentation for this request, see the [Sentiment Analysis API](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics-v2-1/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c9).

+ Set the HTTP endpoint for sentiment analysis by using either a Text Analytics resource on Azure or an instantiated [Text Analytics container](text-analytics-how-to-install-containers.md). You must include `/text/analytics/v2.1/sentiment` in the URL. For example: `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/text/analytics/v2.1/sentiment`.

+ Set a request header to include the [access key](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#get-the-keys-for-your-resource) for Text Analytics operations.

+ In the request body, provide the JSON documents collection you prepared for this analysis.

> [!Tip]
> Use [Postman](text-analytics-how-to-call-api.md) or open the **API testing console** in the [documentation](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics-v2-1/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c9) to structure the request and post it to the service.

## Step 2: Post the request

Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. For information on the size and number of requests you can send per minute and second, see the [data limits](../overview.md#data-limits) section in the overview.

Recall that the service is stateless. No data is stored in your account. Results are returned immediately in the response.


## Step 3: View the results

The sentiment analyzer classifies text as predominantly positive or negative. It assigns a score in the range of 0 to 1. Values close to 0.5 are neutral or indeterminate. A score of 0.5 indicates neutrality. When a string can't be analyzed for sentiment or has no sentiment, the score is always 0.5 exactly. For example, if you pass in a Spanish string with an English language code, the score is 0.5.

Output is returned immediately. You can stream the results to an application that accepts JSON or save the output to a file on the local system. Then, import the output into an application that you can use to sort, search, and manipulate the data.

The following example shows the response for the document collection in this article:

```json
    {
        "documents": [
            {
                "score": 0.9999237060546875,
                "id": "1"
            },
            {
                "score": 0.0000540316104888916,
                "id": "2"
            },
            {
                "score": 0.99990355968475342,
                "id": "3"
            },
            {
                "score": 0.980544924736023,
                "id": "4"
            },
            {
                "score": 0.99996328353881836,
                "id": "5"
            }
        ],
        "errors": []
    }
```
