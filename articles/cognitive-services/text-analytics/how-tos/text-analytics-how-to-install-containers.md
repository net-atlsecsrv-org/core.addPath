# Install and run Text Analytics containers

The Text Analytics containers provide advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes three main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and language detection. Entity linking is not currently supported in a container. 

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

In order to run any of the Text Analytics containers, you must have the host computer and container environments.

## Preparation

You must meet the following prerequisites before using Text Analytics containers:

|Required|Purpose|
|--|--|
|Docker Engine| You need the Docker Engine installed on a [host computer](#the-host-computer). Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms). For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).<br><br> Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure. <br><br> **On Windows**, Docker must also be configured to support Linux containers.<br><br>|
|Familiarity with Docker | You should have a basic understanding of Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker` commands.| 
|`Cognitive Services` resource |In order to use the container, you must have:<br><br>A [_Cognitive Services_](text-analytics-how-to-access-key.md) Azure resource to get the associated billing key and billing endpoint URI. Both values are available on the Azure portal's Cognitive Services Overview and Keys pages and are required to start the container. You need to add the `text/analytics/v2.0` routing to the endpoint URI as shown in the following BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI example.<br><br>**{BILLING_KEY}**: resource key<br><br>**{BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI}**: endpoint URI example is: `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.1`|

### The host computer

[!INCLUDE [Host Computer requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-host-computer.md)]

### Container requirements and recommendations

The following table describes the minimum and recommended CPU cores, at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster, and memory, in gigabytes (GB), to allocate for each Text Analytics container.

| Container | Minimum | Recommended | TPS<br>(Minimum, Maximum)|
|-----------|---------|-------------|--|
|Key Phrase Extraction | 1 core, 2 GB memory | 1 core, 4 GB memory |15, 30|
|Language Detection | 1 core, 2 GB memory | 1 core, 4 GB memory |15, 30|
|Sentiment Analysis | 1 core, 2 GB memory | 1 core, 4 GB memory |15, 30|

* Each core must be at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.
* TPS - transactions per second

Core and memory correspond to the `--cpus` and `--memory` settings, which are used as part of the `docker run` command.

## Get the container image with `docker pull`

Container images for Text Analytics are available from Microsoft Container Registry. 

| Container | Repository |
|-----------|------------|
|Key Phrase Extraction | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/keyphrase` |
|Language Detection | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/language` |
|Sentiment Analysis | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/sentiment` |

Use the [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command to download a container image from Microsoft Container Registry.

For a full description of available tags for the Text Analytics containers, see the following containers on the Docker Hub:

* [Key Phrase Extraction](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018757)
* [Language Detection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018759)
* [Sentiment Analysis](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018654)

Use the [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command to download a container image.


### Docker pull for the Key phrase extraction container

```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/keyphrase:latest
```

### Docker pull for the language detection container

```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/language:latest
```

### Docker pull for the sentiment container

```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/sentiment:latest
```

## How to use the container

Once the container is on the [host computer](#the-host-computer), use the following process to work with the container.

1. [Run the container](#run-the-container-with-docker-run), with the required billing settings. More [examples](../text-analytics-resource-container-config.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available. 
1. [Query the container's prediction endpoint](#query-the-containers-prediction-endpoint). 

## Run the container with `docker run`

Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command to run any of the three containers. The command uses the following parameters:

| Placeholder | Value |
|-------------|-------|
|{BILLING_KEY} | This key is used to start the container, and is available on the Azure portal's `Cognitive Services` Keys page.  |
|{BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} | The billing endpoint URI value is available on the Azure `Cognitive Services` Overview page. <br><br>Example:<br>`Billing=https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0`|

You need to add the `text/analytics/v2.0` routing to the endpoint URI as shown in the preceding BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI example.

Replace these parameters with your own values in the following example `docker run` command.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/keyphrase \
Eula=accept \
Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={BILLING_KEY}
```

This command:

* Runs a key phrase container from the container image
* Allocates one CPU core and 4 gigabytes (GB) of memory
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container
* Automatically removes the container after it exits. The container image is still available on the host computer. 

More [examples](../text-analytics-resource-container-config.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](#billing).

[!INCLUDE [Running multiple containers on the same host](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-run-multiple-same-host.md)]

## Query the container's prediction endpoint

The container provides REST-based query prediction endpoint APIs. 

Use the host, `https://localhost:5000`, for container APIs.

<!--  ## Validate container is running -->

[!INCLUDE [Container's API documentation](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-api-documentation.md)]

## Stop the container

[!INCLUDE [How to stop the container](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-stop.md)]

## Troubleshooting

If you run the container with an output [mount](../text-analytics-resource-container-config.md#mount-settings) and logging enabled, the container generates log files that are helpful to troubleshoot issues that happen while starting or running the container. 

## Billing

The Text Analytics containers send billing information to Azure, using a _Cognitive Services_ resource on your Azure account. 

[!INCLUDE [Container's Billing Settings](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-how-to-billing-info.md)]

For more information about these options, see [Configure containers](../text-analytics-resource-container-config.md).

## Summary

In this article, you learned concepts and workflow for downloading, installing, and running Text Analytics containers. In summary:

* Text Analytics provides three Linux containers for Docker, encapsulating key phrase extraction, language detection, and sentiment analysis.
* Container images are downloaded from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) in Azure.
* Container images run in Docker.
* You can use either the REST API or SDK to call operations in Text Analytics containers by specifying the host URI of the container.
* You must specify billing information when instantiating a container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data (e.g., the image or text that is being analyzed) to Microsoft.

## Next steps
