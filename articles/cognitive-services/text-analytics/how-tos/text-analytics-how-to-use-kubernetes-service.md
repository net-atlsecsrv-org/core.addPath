# Deploy a Text Analytics container to Azure Kubernetes Service

Learn how to deploy the Azure Cognitive Services [Text Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-install-containers) container image to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This procedure shows how to create a Text Analytics resource, how to create an associated sentiment analysis image, and how to exercise this orchestration of the two from a browser. Using containers can shift your attention away from managing infrastructure to instead focusing on application development.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires several tools that must be installed and run locally. Don't use Azure Cloud Shell. You need the following:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services) before you begin.
* A text editor, for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* The [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed.
* The [Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed.
* An Azure resource with the correct pricing tier. Not all pricing tiers work with this container:
    * **Azure Text Analytics** resource with F0 or standard pricing tiers only.
    * **Azure Cognitive Services** resource with the S0 pricing tier.
