# Deploy a Sentiment Analysis container to Azure Container Instances (ACI)

Learn how to deploy the Cognitive Services [Text Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-install-containers) container with the Sentiment Analysis image to Azure [Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/) (ACI). This procedure exemplifies the creation of a Text Analytics resource, the creation of an associated Sentiment Analysis image and the ability to exercise this orchestration of the two from a browser. Using containers can shift the developers' attention away from managing infrastructure to instead focusing on application development.

## Prerequisites
