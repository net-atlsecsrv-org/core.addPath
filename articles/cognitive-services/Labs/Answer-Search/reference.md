# Project Answer Search v7 reference

Bing Answer SearchAPI takes a query parameter and returns a `searchResponse` with `answerType`: `facts` or `entities`. 

Applications that use the Answer Search API send requests to the endpoint with a URL to preview in a query parameter.  The request must include the `q=searchTerm` parameter and *Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key* header.   

The JSON response can be parsed for facts and entities that contain details about the object of search.

## Endpoint
To request Answer Search results, send a request to the following endpoint. Use the headers and URL parameters to define further specifications.

Endpoint GET: 
```
https://api.labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/answerSearch/v7.0/search?q=<searchTerm>&subscription-key=0123456789ABCDEF&mkt=en-us

```

The request must use the HTTPS protocol and include following query parameter:
-  `q=<URL>` - The query that identifies the object of search

For examples that show how to make requests, see [C# quickstart](c-sharp-quickstart.md) or [Java quickstart](java-quickstart.md). 

The following sections provide technical details about the response objects, query parameters, and headers that affect the search results. 
  
For information about headers that requests should include, see [Headers](#headers).  
  
For information about query parameters that requests should include, see [Query parameters](#query-parameters).  
  
For information about the JSON objects that the response includes, see [Response objects](#response-objects).

The maximum query URL length is 2,048 characters. To ensure that your URL length does not exceed the limit, the maximum length of your query parameters should be less than 1,500 characters. If the URL exceeds 2,048 characters, the server returns 404 Not found.  

For information about permitted use and display of results, see [Use and display requirements](use-display-requirements.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Some request headers that are meaningful for other search APIs don’t affect URL Preview
> - Pragma – the caller does not have control over whether URL Preview uses cache
> - Cache-Control – the caller does not have control over whether URL Preview uses cache
> - User-Agent
> 
> Also, some parameters are not currently meaningful for URL Preview API, but may be used in the future for improved globalization. 
 
## Headers  
The following are the headers that a request and response may include.  
  
|Header|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Accept|Optional request header.<br /><br /> The default media type is application/json. To specify that the response use [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), set the Accept header to application/ld+json.|  
|<a name="acceptlanguage" />Accept-Language|Optional request header.<br /><br /> A comma-delimited list of languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For more information, including expected format, see [RFC2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).<br /><br /> This header and the [setLang](#setlang) query parameter are mutually exclusive&mdash;do not specify both.<br /><br /> If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the `cc` parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header.<br /><br /> Use this header and the `cc` query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the [mkt](#mkt) and [setLang](#setlang) query parameters.<br /><br /> A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.|  
|<a name="market" />BingAPIs-Market|Response header.<br /><br /> The market used by the request. The form is \<languageCode\>-\<countryCode\>. For example, en-US.|  
|<a name="traceid" />BingAPIs-TraceId|Response header.<br /><br /> The ID of the log entry that contains the details of the request. When an error occurs, capture this ID. If you are not able to determine and resolve the issue, include this ID along with the other information that you provide the Support team.|  
|<a name="subscriptionkey" />Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key|Required request header.<br /><br /> The subscription key that you received when you signed up for this service in [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/).|  
|<a name="pragma" />Pragma|Optional request header<br /><br /> By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header to no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).
|<a name="useragent" />User-Agent|Optional request header.<br /><br /> The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header.<br /><br /> The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).<br /><br /> The following are examples of user-agent strings.<br /><ul><li>Windows Phone&mdash;Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA; Lumia 822)<br /><br /></li><li>Android&mdash;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en-us; SCH-I500 Build/GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1<br /><br /></li><li>iPhone&mdash;Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile/10B142 iPhone4;1 BingWeb/3.03.1428.20120423<br /><br /></li><li>PC&mdash;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Touch; rv:11.0) like Gecko<br /><br /></li><li>iPad&mdash;Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 7_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/537.51.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0 Mobile/11A465 Safari/9537.53</li></ul>|
|<a name="clientid" />X-MSEdge-ClientID|Optional request and response header.<br /><br /> Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.<br /><br /> Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer.<br /><br /> **IMPORTANT:** Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs.<br /><br /> The following are the basic usage rules that apply to this header.<br /><ul><li>Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID.<br /><br/>If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that device.<br /><br/></li><li>Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device.<br /><br/></li><li>**ATTENTION:** You must ensure that this Client ID is not linkable to any authenticatable user account information.</li><br/><li>Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID.<br /><br/>The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted.</li></ul><br /> **NOTE:** Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.|  
|<a name="clientip" />X-MSEdge-ClientIP|Optional request header.<br /><br /> The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header.<br /><br /> Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.|  
|<a name="location" />X-Search-Location|Optional request header.<br /><br /> A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as \<key\>:\<value\>. The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.<br /><br /><ul><li>lat&mdash;The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes.<br /><br /></li><li>long&mdash;The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern longitudes.<br /><br /></li><li>re&mdash; The radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.<br /><br /></li><li>ts&mdash; The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.)<br /><br /></li><li>head&mdash;Optional. The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the `sp` key is nonzero.<br /><br /></li><li>sp&mdash; The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.<br /><br /></li><li>alt&mdash; The altitude of the client device, in meters.<br /><br /></li><li>are&mdash;Optional. The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Radius defaults to 50 Kilometers. Specify this key only if you specify the `alt` key.<br /><br /></li></ul> **NOTE:** Although these keys are optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.|

> [!NOTE] 
> Remember that the Terms of Use require compliance with all applicable laws, including regarding use of these headers. For example, in certain jurisdictions, such as Europe, there are requirements to obtain user consent before placing certain tracking devices on user devices.
  

## Query parameters  
The request may include the following query parameters. See the Required column for required parameters. You must URL encode the query parameters.  
  
  
|Name|Value|Type|Required|  
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|  
|<a name="mkt" />mkt|The market where the results come from. <br /><br />For a list of possible market values, see Market Codes.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** The URL Preview API currently only supports en-us market and language.<br /><br />|String|Yes|  
|<a name="query" />q|The URL to preview|String|Yes|  
|<a name="responseformat" />responseFormat|The media type to use for the response. The following are the possible case-insensitive values.<br /><ul><li>JSON</li><li>JSONLD</li></ul><br /> The default is JSON. For information about the JSON objects that the response contains, see [Response Objects](#response-objects).<br /><br />  If you specify JsonLd, the response body includes JSON-LD objects that contain the search results. For information about the JSON-LD, see [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/).|String|No|  
|<a name="safesearch" />safeSearch|A filter used to filter adult content. The following are the possible case-insensitive filter values.<br /><ul><li>Off&mdash;Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos.<br /><br/></li><li>Moderate&mdash;Return webpages with adult text, but not adult images or videos.<br /><br/></li><li>Strict&mdash;Do not return webpages with adult text, images, or videos.</li></ul><br /> The default is Moderate.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that `safeSearch` is set to Strict, Bing ignores the `safeSearch` value and uses Strict.<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If you use the `site:` query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what the `safeSearch` query parameter is set to. Use `site:` only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. |String|No|  
|<a name="setlang" />setLang|The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).<br /><br /> Although optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set `setLang` to the same language specified by `mkt` unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.<br /><br /> This parameter and the [Accept-Language](#acceptlanguage) header are mutually exclusive&mdash;do not specify both.<br /><br /> A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.|String|No|

## Error codes

The following are the possible HTTP status codes that a request returns.  
  
|Status Code|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|200|Success.|  
|400|One of the query parameters is missing or not valid.|  
|401|The subscription key is missing or is not valid.|  
|403|The user is authenticated (for example, they used a valid subscription key) but they don’t have permission to the requested resource.<br /><br /> Bing may also return this status if the caller exceeded their queries per month quota.|  
|410|The request used HTTP instead of the HTTPS protocol. HTTPS is the only supported protocol.|  
|429|The caller exceeded their queries per second quota.|  
|500|Unexpected server error.|

If the request fails, the response contains an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse) object, which contains a list of [Error](#error) objects that describe what caused of error. If the error is related to a parameter, the `parameter` field identifies the parameter that is the issue. And if the error is related to a parameter value, the `value` field identifies the value that is not valid.

```json
{
  "_type": "ErrorResponse", 
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "InvalidRequest", 
      "subCode": "ParameterMissing", 
      "message": "Required parameter is missing.", 
      "parameter": "q" 
    }
  ]
}

{
  "_type": "ErrorResponse", 
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "InvalidAuthorization", 
      "subCode": "AuthorizationMissing", 
      "message": "Authorization is required.", 
      "moreDetails": "Subscription key is not recognized."
    }
  ]
}
```

The following are the possible error code and sub-error code values.

|Code|SubCode|Description
|-|-|-
|ServerError|UnexpectedError<br/>ResourceError<br/>NotImplemented|HTTP status code is 500.
|InvalidRequest|ParameterMissing<br/>ParameterInvalidValue<br/>HttpNotAllowed<br/>Blocked|Bing returns InvalidRequest whenever any part of the request is not valid. For example, a required parameter is missing or a parameter value is not valid.<br/><br/>If the error is ParameterMissing or ParameterInvalidValue, the HTTP status code is 400.<br/><br/>If you use the HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS, Bing returns HttpNotAllowed, and the HTTP status code is 410.
|RateLimitExceeded|No sub-codes|Bing returns RateLimitExceeded whenever you exceed your queries per second (QPS) or queries per month (QPM) quota.<br/><br/>If you exceed QPS, Bing returns HTTP status code 429, and if you exceed QPM, Bing returns 403.
|InvalidAuthorization|AuthorizationMissing<br/>AuthorizationRedundancy|Bing returns InvalidAuthorization when Bing cannot authenticate the caller. For example, the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header is missing or the subscription key is not valid.<br/><br/>Redundancy occurs if you specify more than one authentication method.<br/><br/>If the error is InvalidAuthorization, the HTTP status code is 401.
|InsufficientAuthorization|AuthorizationDisabled<br/>AuthorizationExpired|Bing returns InsufficientAuthorization when the caller does not have permissions to access the resource. This can occur if the subscription key has been disabled or has expired. <br/><br/>If the error is InsufficientAuthorization, the HTTP status code is 403.
