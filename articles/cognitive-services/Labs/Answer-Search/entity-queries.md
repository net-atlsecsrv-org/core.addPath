# Quickstart: Query for Entities

If the query requests information about a person, place or thing, the response can contain an `entities` answer.  Queries always return webpages, [facts](fact-queries.md) and/or [entities](entity-queries.md) are query dependent.

Entities support three query scenarios: 
-	DominantEntity—There is only one entity that matches the user's query and intent. For example, the query, Space Needle, is a DominantEntity scenario. 
-	Disambiguation—There is more than one entity that matches the user's query and intent and it is up to the user to select the correct entity. For example, the query Game of Thrones is a Disambiguation scenario that returns the television show and the book series. 
-	List—There are multiple entities that match the user's query and intent. For example, the query "List of endangered species" is a list scenario that returns tabular values formatted for display in rows and cells. 
 
To determine the query scenario, use the `queryScenario` field of the `entities` object. 
The data that the entity includes depends on the entity's type. Although entities include the same basic information, some entities such as tourist attractions or books include additional properties. Entities that include additional properties include the `_type` field that contains a hint used by the serializer. The following entities include additional properties: 
-	Book 
-	MusicRecording 
-	Person 
-	Attraction 
 
To determine the type of entity that the response contains, use the `entityTypeHints` field as shown in the query for Bill Gates.
