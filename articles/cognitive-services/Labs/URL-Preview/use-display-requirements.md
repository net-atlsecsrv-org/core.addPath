# Project URL Preview use and display requirements

Only use the data from Project URL Preview to display preview snippets and thumbnail images hyperlinked to their source sites, in end user-initiated URL sharing on social media, chat bot, or similar offerings. You must not copy, store, or cache any data you receive from Project URL Preview. You must honor any requests to disable previews that you may receive from website or content owners.
