# How to use cards (part 1 of 2)

This tutorial shows how to add and use a simple card in your bot.

> [!NOTE]
> Conversation Learner currently expects your card definition files to be located in a directory called "cards" which is present in the directory where the Bot is started.

## Video

[![Cards Tutorial Preview](https://aka.ms/cl_Tutorial_v3_Cards_Preview)](https://aka.ms/cl_Tutorial_v3_Cards)

## Requirements
This tutorial requires that the general tutorial bot is running

	npm run tutorial-general

## Details

Cards are UI elements that allow the user to select an option in the conversation. 

### Open the demo

In the web UI, click on "Import Tutorials" and select the model named "Tutorial-15-Cards".

### The Card

The card definition is at the following location: C:\<installedpath\>\src\cards\prompt.json.

The system expects to find your card definitions in this "cards" directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Notice the body type "TextBlock" and the "{{question}}" placeholder in the text field.
> There are two submit buttons and the text that gets submitted for each.

### Actions

We have created three Actions. As you see below, the first Action is a card.

Let's see how the card Action type was created:

> [!NOTE]
> The card contains three different parameters - question input, button 1 and button 2. These elements are template references in the card where you enter the question and the respective answers. You can also reference and use Entities or a mixture of text and Entities.

The eye icon shows you what the card looks like.
