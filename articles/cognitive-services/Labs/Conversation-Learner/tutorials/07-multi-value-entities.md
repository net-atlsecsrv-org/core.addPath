# How to use multi-value entities with a Conversation Learner model
This tutorial shows the Multi-value property of Entities.

## Video

[![Multi-value Entities Tutorial Preview](https://aka.ms/cl_Tutorial_v3_MultiValued_Preview)](https://aka.ms/cl_Tutorial_v3_MultiValued)

## Requirements
This tutorial requires that the general tutorial Bot is running

	npm run tutorial-general

## Details
Multi-value Entities accumulate values in a list, rather than storing a single value.  These Entities are useful when users can specify more than one value. Toppings on a pizza for example.

Entities marked as Multi-value will have each recognized instance of the Entity appended to a list in the Bot's memory. Subsequent recognition appends to the Entity's value, rather than overwriting.

## Steps

Start on the home page in the Web UI.

### Create the Model

1. Select **New Model**.
2. Enter **MultiValueEntities** for **Name**.
3. Select **Create**.

### Entity Creation

1. Select **Entities** in the left panel, then **New Entity**.
2. Select **Custom Trained** for **Entity Type**.
3. Enter **toppings** for **Entity Name**.
4. Check **Multi-valued** to enable the Entity accumulate one or more values.
5. Check **Negatable**.
6. Select **Create**.
