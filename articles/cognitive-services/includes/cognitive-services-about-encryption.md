## About Cognitive Services encryption

Data is encrypted and decrypted using [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2) compliant [256-bit AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption. Encryption and decryption are transparent, meaning encryption and access are managed for you. Your data is secure by default and you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of encryption.

## About encryption key management

By default, your subscription uses Microsoft-managed encryption keys. There is also the option to manage your subscription with your own keys called customer-managed keys (CMK). CMK offer greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. You can also audit the encryption keys used to protect your data. If CMK is configured for your subscription, double encryption is provided, which offers a second layer of protection, while allowing you to control the encryption key through your Azure Key Vault.
