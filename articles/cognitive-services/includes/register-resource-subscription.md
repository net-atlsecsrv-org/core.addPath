> [!Tip]
> If your subscription doesn't allow you to create a Cognitive Service resource, you may need to enable that ability of the [Azure resource provider](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-portal) with the [Azure portal](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-powershell), [PowerShell command](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-powershell) or an [Azure CLI command](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-cli). If you are not the subscription owner, ask the _Subscription Owner_ or someone with a role of _admin_ to complete the registration for you or ask for the /register/action privileges granted to your account.
