[Reference documentation](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/cognitiveservices/management?view=azure-dotnet) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices/tests)

## C# prerequisites

* A valid Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* The current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).

[!INCLUDE [Create a service principal](./create-service-principal.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group](./create-resource-group.md)]

## Create a new C# application

Create a new .NET Core application. In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `azure-management-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *program.cs*. 

```console
dotnet new console -n azure-management-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Install the client library

Within the application directory, install the Azure Management client library for .NET with the following command:

```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.Fluent
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager.Fluent
```

If you're using the Visual Studio IDE, the client library is available as a downloadable NuGet package.

### Import libraries

Open *program.cs* and add the following `using` statements to the top of the file:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_using)]

## Authenticate the client

Add the following fields to the root of *program.cs* and populate their values, using the service principal you created and your Azure account information.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_constants)]

Then, in your **Main** method, use these values to construct a **CognitiveServicesManagementClient** object. This object is needed for all of your Azure management operations.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_assigns)]

## Call management methods

Add the following code to your **Main** method to list available resources, create a sample resource, list your owned resources, and then delete the sample resource. You'll define these methods in the next steps.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_calls)]

## Create a Cognitive Services resource

To create and subscribe to a new Cognitive Services resource, use the **Create** method. This method adds a new billable resource to the resource group you pass in. When creating your new resource, you'll need to know the "kind" of service you want to use, along with its pricing tier (or SKU) and an Azure location. The following method takes all of these as arguments and creates a resource.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_create)]

### Choose a service and pricing tier

When you create a new resource, you'll need to know the "kind" of service you want to use, along with the [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/) (or SKU) you want. You'll use this and other information as parameters when creating the resource. You can find a list of available Cognitive Service "kinds" by calling the following method in your script:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_list_avail)]

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-subscription-types](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-subscription-types.md)]

[!INCLUDE [SKUs and pricing](./sku-pricing.md)]

## View your resources

To view all of the resources under your Azure account (across all resource groups), use the following method:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_list)]

## Delete a resource

The following method deletes the specified resource from the given resource group.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/azure_management_service/create_delete_resource.cs?name=snippet_delete)]

## Run the application

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```dotnet
dotnet run
```
