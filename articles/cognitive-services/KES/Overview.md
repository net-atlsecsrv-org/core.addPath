# Knowledge Exploration Service

Welcome to the Microsoft Knowledge Exploration Service.  Knowledge Exploration Service (KES) offers a fast and effective way to add interactive search and refinement to applications.  With KES, you can build a compressed index from structured data, author a grammar that interprets natural language queries, and provide interactive query formulation with auto-completion suggestions.

See [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) for a sample walkthrough of how to use KES to create an interactive search interface for an academic publications domain.

KES has moved from Cognitive Services Preview to Cognitive Services Labs. The new homepage for the project is [https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/project-knowledge-exploration](https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/project-knowledge-exploration).
