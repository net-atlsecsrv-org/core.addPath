# Quickstart: Create a Cognitive Services resource using an ARM template

This quickstart describes how to use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to create Cognitive Services.

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-base services with REST APIs, and client library SDKs available to help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct artificial intelligence (AI) or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enables developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications with cognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.

Create a resource using an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template). This multi-service resource lets you:

* Access multiple Azure Cognitive Services with a single key and endpoint.
* Consolidate billing from the services you use.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button. The template will open in the Azure portal.

[![Deploy your cognitive service to Azure](../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg "Deploy your cognitive service to Azure")](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-cognitive-services-universalkey%2Fazuredeploy.json)

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).

## Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-cognitive-services-universalkey/).

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/101-cognitive-services-universalkey/azuredeploy.json":::

One Azure resource is defined in the template:
* [Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts](/azure/templates/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts): creates a Cognitive Services resource.

## Deploy the template

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button.

    [![Deploy to Azure](../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-cognitive-services-universalkey%2Fazuredeploy.json)

2. Enter the following values.

    |Value  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Subscription** | Select an Azure subscription. |
    | **Resource group** | Select **Create new**, enter a unique name for the resource group, and then click **OK**. |
    | **Region** | Select a region.  For example, **East US** |
    | **Cognitive Service Name** | Replace with a unique name for your resource. You will need the name in the next section when you validate the deployment. |
    | **Location** | Replace with the region used above. |
    | **Sku** | The [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/) for your resource. |

    :::image type="content" source="media/arm-template/universal-key-portal-template.png" alt-text="Resource creation screen.":::

3. Select **Review + Create**, then **Create**. After the resource has successfully finished deploying, the **Go to resource** button will be highlighted.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/CLI)

> [!NOTE]
> `az deployment group` create requires Azure CLI version 2.6 or later. To display the version type `az --version`. For more information, see the [documentation](/cli/azure/deployment/group).

Run the following script using the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) [On your local machine](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), or in a browser with the **Try it** button. Enter a name and location (for example `centralus`) for a new resource group, and the ARM template will be used to deploy a Cognitive Services resource within it. Remember the name you use. You will use it later to validate the deployment.


```azurecli-interactive
read -p "Enter a name for your new resource group:" resourceGroupName &&
read -p "Enter the location (i.e. centralus):" location &&
templateUri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-cognitive-services-universalkey/azuredeploy.json" &&
az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri  $templateUri &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..." &&
read
```

## Review deployed resources

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

When your deployment finishes, you will be able to click the **Go to resource** button to see your new resource. You can also find the resource group by:

1. Selecting **Resource groups** from the left navigation menu.
2. Selecting the resource group name.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/CLI)

Using the Azure CLI, run the following script, and enter the name of the resource group you created earlier.

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the resource group where the Cognitive Services resource exists:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
az cognitiveservices account list -g $resourceGroupName
```

---


## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the Azure portal, expand the menu on the left side to open the menu of services, and choose **Resource Groups** to display the list of your resource groups.
2. Locate the resource group containing the resource to be deleted
3. Right-click on the resource group listing. Select **Delete resource group**, and confirm.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/CLI)

Using the Azure CLI, run the following script, and enter the name of the resource group you created earlier.

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the resource group name, for deletion:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```
