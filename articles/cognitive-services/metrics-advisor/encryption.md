# Metrics Advisor service encryption of data at rest

The Metrics Advisor service automatically encrypts your data when persisted it to the cloud. The Metrics Advisor service encryption protects your data and to help you to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed keys are only available on the E0 pricing tier. To request the ability to use customer-managed keys, fill out and submit the [Metrics Advisor Service Customer-Managed Key Request Form](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk). It will take approximately 3-5 business days to hear back on the status of your request. Depending on demand, you may be placed in a queue and approved as space becomes available. Once approved for using CMK with the Metrics Advisor service, you will need to create a new Metrics Advisor resource and select E0 as the Pricing Tier. Once your Metrics Advisor resource with the E0 pricing tier is created, you can use Azure Key Vault to set up your managed identity.
