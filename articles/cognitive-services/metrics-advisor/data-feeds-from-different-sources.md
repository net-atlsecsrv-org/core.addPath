# Add data feeds from different data sources to Metrics Advisor

Use this article to find the settings and requirements for connecting different types of data sources to Metrics Advisor. Make sure to read how to [Onboard your data](how-tos/onboard-your-data.md) to learn about the key concepts for using your data with Metrics Advisor. 

## Supported authentication types

| Authentication types | Description |
| ---------------------|-------------|
|**Basic** | You will need to be able to provide basic parameters for accessing data sources. For example a connection string or key. Data feed admins are able to view these credentials. |
| **AzureManagedIdentity** | [Managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for Azure resources is a feature of Azure Active Directory. It provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication.|
| **AzureSQLConnectionString**| Store your AzureSQL connection string as a **credential entity** in Metrics Advisor, and use it directly each time when onboarding metrics data. Only admins of the Credential entity are able to view these credentials, but enables authorized viewers to create data feeds without needing to know details for the credentials. |
| **DataLakeGen2SharedKey**| Store your data lake account key as a **credential entity** in Metrics Advisor and use it directly each time when onboarding metrics data. Only admins of the Credential entity are able to view these credentials, but enables authorized viewers to create data feed without needing to know the credential details.|
| **Service principal**| Store your service principal as a **credential entity** in Metrics Advisor and use it directly each time when onboarding metrics data. Only admins of Credential entity are able to view the credentials, but enables authorized viewers to create data feed without needing to know the credential details.|
| **Service principal from key vault**|Store your service principal in a key vault as a **credential entity** in Metrics Advisor and use it directly each time when onboarding metrics data. Only admins of a **credential entity** are able to view the credentials, but also leave viewers able to create data feed without needing to know detailed credentials. |

Create an **Credential entity** and use it for authenticating to your data sources. The following sections specify the parameters required by for *Basic* authentication. 

## <span id="appinsights">Azure Application Insights</span>

* **Application ID**: This is used to identify this application when using the Application Insights API. To get the Application ID, do the following:

    1. From your Application Insights resource, click API Access.

    2. Copy the Application ID generated into **Application ID** field in Metrics Advisor. 
    
    See the [Azure Bot Service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys#application-id) for more information.

* **API Key**: API keys are used by applications outside the browser to access this resource. To get the API key, do the following:

    1. From the Application Insights resource, click API Access.

    2. Click Create API Key.

    3. Enter a short description, check the Read telemetry option, and click the Generate key button.

    4. Copy the API key to the **API key** field in Metrics Advisor.

* **Query**: Azure Application Insights logs are built on Azure Data Explorer, and Azure Monitor log queries use a version of the same Kusto query language. The [Kusto query language documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) has all of the details for the language and should be your primary resource for writing a query against Application Insights. 


## <span id="blob">Azure Blob Storage (JSON)</span>

* **Connection String**: See the Azure Blob Storage [connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string#view-and-copy-a-connection-string) article for information on retrieving this string.

* **Container**: Metrics Advisor expects time series data stored as Blob files (one Blob per timestamp) under a single container. This is the container name field.

* **Blob Template**: This is the template of the Blob file names. For example: `/%Y/%m/X_%Y-%m-%d-%h-%M.json`. The following parameters are supported:
  * `%Y` is the year formatted as `yyyy`
  * `%m` is the month formatted as `MM`
  * `%d` is the day formatted as `dd`
  * `%h` is the hour formatted as `HH`
  * `%M` is the minute formatted as `mm`

* **JSON format version**: Defines the data schema in the JSON files. Currently Metrics Advisor supports two versions:
  
  * v1 (Default value)

      Only the metrics *Name* and *Value* are accepted. For example:
    
      ``` JSON
      {"count":11, "revenue":1.23}
      ```

  * v2

      The metrics *Dimensions* and *timestamp* are also accepted. For example:
      
      ``` JSON
      [
        {"date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "market":"en-us", "count":11, "revenue":1.23},
        {"date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "market":"zh-cn", "count":22, "revenue":4.56}
      ]
      ```

Only one timestamp is allowed per JSON file. 

## <span id="cosmosdb">Azure Cosmos DB (SQL)</span>

* **Connection String**: The connection string to access your Azure Cosmos DB. This can be found in the Cosmos DB resource, in **Keys**. 
* **Database**: The database to query against. This can be found in the **Browse** page under **Containers** section.
* **Collection ID**: The collection ID to query against. This can be found in the **Browse** page under **Containers** section.

    Sample query:
    
    ``` mssql
    select StartDate, JobStatusId, COUNT(*) AS JobNumber from IngestionJobs WHERE and StartDate = @StartTime
    ```
    
    Sample query for a data slice from 2019/12/12:
    
    ``` mssql
    select StartDate, JobStatusId, COUNT(*) AS JobNumber from IngestionJobs WHERE and StartDate = '2019-12-12 00:00:00'
    ```

## <span id="kusto">Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)</span>

* **Connection String**: See [View and copy a connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto) for information on how to retrieve the connection string from Azure Data Explorer (Kusto).

* **Query**: See [Kusto Query Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query) to get and formulate data into multi-dimensional time series data. You can use the `@StartTime` and `@EndTime` variables in your query. They should be formatted: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`.

## <span id="adl">Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2</span>

* **Account Name**: The account name of your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. This can be found in your Azure Storage Account (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2) resource in **Access keys**.

* **Account Key**: Please specify the account name to access your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. This could be found in Azure Storage Account (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2) resource in **Access keys** setting.

* **File System Name (Container)**: Metrics Advisor will expect your time series data stored as Blob files (one Blob per timestamp) under a single container. This is the container name field. This can be found in your Azure storage account (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2)  instance, and click 'Containers' in 'Blob Service' section.

* **Directory Template**:
This is the directory template of the Blob file. For example: */%Y/%m/%d*. The following parameters are supported:
  * `%Y` is the year formatted as `yyyy`
  * `%m` is the month formatted as `MM`
  * `%d` is the day formatted as `dd`
  * `%h` is the hour formatted as `HH`
  * `%M` is the minute formatted as `mm`

* **File Template**:
This is the file template of the Blob file. For example: *X_%Y-%m-%d-%h-%M.json*. The following parameters are supported:
  * `%Y` is the year formatted as `yyyy`
  * `%m` is the month formatted as `MM`
  * `%d` is the day formatted as `dd`
  * `%h` is the hour formatted as `HH`
  * `%M` is the minute formatted as `mm`

Currently Metrics Advisor supports the data schema in the JSON files as follow. For example:

``` JSON
[
  {"date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "market":"en-us", "count":11, "revenue":1.23},
  {"date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "market":"zh-cn", "count":22, "revenue":4.56}
]
```
<!--
## <span id="eventhubs">Azure Event Hubs</span>

* **Connection String**: This can be found in 'Shared access policies' in your Event Hubs instance. Also for the 'EntityPath', it could be found by clicking into your Event Hubs instance and clicking at 'Event Hubs' in 'Entities' blade. Items that listed can be input as EntityPath. 

* **Consumer Group**: A [consumer group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#consumer-groups) is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub.
Event Hubs use the latest offset of a consumer group to consume (subscribe from) the data from data source. Therefore a dedicated consumer group should be created for one data feed in your Metrics Advisor instance.

* **Timestamp**: Metrics Advisor uses the Event Hubs timestamp as the event timestamp if the user data source does not contain a timestamp field.
The timestamp field must match one of these two formats:

    * "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" format;

    * Number of seconds or milliseconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

    No matter which timestamp field it left aligns to granularity.For example, if timestamp is "2019-01-01T00:03:00Z", granularity is 5 minutes, then Metrics Advisor aligns the timestamp to "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z". If the event timestamp is "2019-01-01T00:10:00Z",  Metrics Advisor uses the timestamp directly without any alignment.
-->
## <span id="sql">Azure SQL Database | SQL Server</span>

* **Connection String**: Metrics Advisor accepts an [ADO.NET Style Connection String](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-string-syntax) for sql server data source.

    Sample connection string:

    ```
    Data Source=db-server.database.windows.net:[port];initial catalog=[database];User ID=[username];Password=[password];Connection Timeout=10ms;
    ```

* **Query**: A SQL query to get and formulate data into multi-dimensional time series data. You can use a `@StartTime` variable in your query to help with getting expected metrics value.

  * `@StartTime`: a datetime in the format of `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`

    Sample query:
    
    ``` mssql
    select StartDate, JobStatusId, COUNT(*) AS JobNumber from IngestionJobs WHERE and StartDate = @StartTime
    ```
    
    Actual query executed for data slice of 2019/12/12:
    
    ``` mssql
    select StartDate, JobStatusId, COUNT(*) AS JobNumber from IngestionJobs WHERE and StartDate = '2019-12-12 00:00:00'
    ```

## <span id="table">Azure Table Storage</span>

* **Connection String**: Please refer to [View and copy a connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Ftables%2Ftoc.json&tabs=azure-portal#view-account-access-keys) for information on how to retrieve the connection string from Azure Table Storage.

* **Table Name**: Specify a table to query against. This can be found in your Azure Storage Account instance. Click **Tables** in the **Table Service** section.

* **Query**
You can use the `@StartTime` in your query. `@StartTime` is replaced with a yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss format string in script.

    ``` mssql
    let StartDateTime = datetime(@StartTime); let EndDateTime = StartDateTime + 1d; 
    SampleTable | where Timestamp >= StartDateTime and Timestamp < EndDateTime | project Timestamp, Market, RPM
    ```

## <span id="es">Elasticsearch</span>

* **Host**:Specify the master host of Elasticsearch Cluster.
* **Port**:Specify the master port of Elasticsearch Cluster.
* **Authorization Header**:Specify the authorization header value of Elasticsearch Cluster.
* **Query**:Specify the query to get data. Placeholder @StartTime is supported.(e.g. when data of 2020-06-21T00:00:00Z is ingested, @StartTime = 2020-06-21T00:00:00)

## <span id="http">HTTP request</span>

* **Request URL**: A HTTP url which can return a JSON. The placeholders %Y,%m,%d,%h,%M are supported: %Y=year in format yyyy, %m=month in format MM, %d=day in format dd, %h=hour in format HH, %M=minute in format mm. For example: `http://microsoft.com/ProjectA/%Y/%m/X_%Y-%m-%d-%h-%M`.
* **Request HTTP method**: Use GET or POST.
* **Request header**: Could add basic authentication. 
* **Request payload**: Only JSON payload is supported. Placeholder @StartTime is supported in the payload. The response should be in the following JSON format: [{"timestamp": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "market":"en-us", "count":11, "revenue":1.23}, {"timestamp": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "market":"zh-cn", "count":22, "revenue":4.56}].(e.g. when data of 2020-06-21T00:00:00Z is ingested, @StartTime = 2020-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00)
