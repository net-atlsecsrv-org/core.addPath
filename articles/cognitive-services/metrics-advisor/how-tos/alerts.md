# How-to: Configure alerts and get notifications using a hook

After an anomaly is detected by Metrics Advisor, an alert notification will be triggered based on alert settings, using a hook. An alert setting can be used with multiple detection configurations, various parameters are available to customize your alert rule.

## Create a hook

Metrics Advisor supports three different types of hooks: email hook, web hook and Azure DevOps. You can choose the one that works for your specific scenario.       

### Email hook

> [!Note]
> Metrics Advisor resource administrators need to configure the Email settings, and input SMTP related information into Metrics Advisor before anomaly alerts can be sent. The resource group admin or subscription admin needs to assign at least one *Cognitive Services Metrics Advisor Administrator* role in the Access control tab of the Metrics Advisor resource. 

To create an email hook, the following parameters are available: 

An email hook is the channel for anomaly alerts to be sent to email addresses specified in the **Email to** section. Two types of alert emails will be sent: *Data feed not available* alerts, and *Incident reports* which contain one or multiple anomalies. 

|Parameter |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| Name | Name of the email hook |
| Email to| Email addresses that would send alert to|
| External link | Optional field which enables a customized redirect, such as for troubleshooting notes. |
| Customized anomaly alert title | Title template supports `${severity}`, `${alertSettingName}`, `${datafeedName}`, `${metricName}`, `${detectConfigName}`, `${timestamp}`, `${topDimension}`, `${incidentCount}`, `${anomalyCount}`

After you click **OK**, an email hook will be created. You can use it in any alert settings to receive anomaly alerts. 

### Web hook

> [!Note]
> * Use the **POST** request method.
> * The request body wil be similar to:  
    `{"timestamp":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","alertSettingGuid":"49635104-1234-4c1c-b94a-744fc920a9eb"}`
> * When a web hook is created or modified, the API will be called as a test with an empty request body. Your API needs to return a 200 HTTP code.

A web hook is the entry point for all the information available from the Metrics Advisor service, and calls a user-provided api when an alert is triggered. All alerts can be sent through a web hook.

To create a web hook, you will need to add the following information:

|Parameter |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Endpoint     | The API address to be called when an alert is triggered.        |
|Username / Password | For authenticating to the API address. Leave this black if authentication isn't needed.         |
|Header     | Custom headers in the API call.        |

When a notification is pushed through a web hook, you can use the following APIs to get details of the alert. Set the *timestamp* and *alertSettingGuid* in your API service, which is being pushed to, then use the following queries: 
- `query_alert_result_anomalies`
- `query_alert_result_incidents`

### Azure DevOps

Metrics Advisor also supports automatically creating a work item in Azure DevOps to track issues/bugs when any anomaly detected. All alerts can be sent through Azure DevOps hooks.

To create an Azure DevOps hook, you will need to add the following information

|Parameter |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| Name | A name for the hook |
| Organization | The organization that your DevOps belongs to |
| Project | The specific project in DevOps. |
| Access Token |  A token for authenticating to DevOps. | 

> [!Note]
> You need to grant write permissions if you want Metrics Advisor to create work items based on anomaly alerts. 
> After creating hooks, you can use them in any of your alert settings. Manage your hooks in the **hook settings** page.

## Add or edit alert settings

Go to metrics detail page to find the **Alert settings** section, in the bottom left corner of metrics detail page. It lists all alert settings that apply to the selected detection configuration. When a new detection configuration is created, there's no alert setting, and no alerts will be sent.  
You can use the **add**, **edit** and **delete** icons to modify alert settings.

:::image type="content" source="../media/alerts/alert-setting.png" alt-text="Alert settings menu item.":::

Click the **add** or **edit** buttons to get a window to add or edit your alert settings.

:::image type="content" source="../media/alerts/edit-alert.png" alt-text="Add or edit alert settings":::

**Alert setting name**: The name of this alert setting. It will be displayed in the alert email title.

**Hooks**: The list of hooks to send alerts to.

The section marked in the screenshot above are the settings for one detecting configuration. You can set different alert settings for different detection configurations. Choose the target configuration using the third drop-down list in this window. 

### Filter settings 

The following are filter settings for one detection configuration.

**Alert For** has 4 options for filtering anomalies:

* **Anomalies in all series**: All anomalies will be included in the alert.         
* **Anomalies in the series group**: Filter series by dimension values. Set specific values for some dimensions. Anomalies will only be included in the alert when the series matches the specified value.       
* **Anomalies in favorite series**: Only the series marked as favorite will be included in the alert.        |
* **Anomalies in top N of all series**: This filter is for the case that you only care about the series whose value is in the top N. We will look back some timestamps, and check if value of the series at these timestamp are in top N. If the "in top n" count is larger than the specified number, the anomaly will be included in an alert.        |

**Filter anomaly options** is an additional filter with the following options:

- **severity** : The anomaly will only be included when the anomaly severity is within the specified range.
- **Snooze** : Stop alerts temporarily for anomalies in the next N points (period), when triggered in an alert.
    - **snooze type** : When set to **Series**, a triggered anomaly will only snooze its series. For **Metric**, one triggered anomaly will snooze all the series in this metric.
    - **snooze number** : the number of points (period) to snooze.
    - **reset for non-successive** : When selected, a triggered anomaly will only snooze the next n successive anomalies. If one of the following data points isn't an anomaly, the snooze will be reset from that point; When unselected, one triggered anomaly will snooze next n points (period), even if successive data points aren't anomalies.
- **value** (optional) : Filter by value. Only point values that meet the condition, anomaly will be included. If you use the corresponding value of another metric, the dimension names of the two metrics should be consistent.

Anomalies not filtered out will be sent in an alert.

### Add cross-metric settings

Click **+ Add cross-metric settings** in the alert settings page to add another section.

The **Operator** selector is the logical relationship of each section, to determine if they send an alert.


|Operator  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|AND     | Only send an alert if a series matches each alert section, and all data points are anomalies. If the metrics have different dimension names, an alert will never be triggered.         |
|OR     | Send the alert if at least one section contains anomalies.         |
