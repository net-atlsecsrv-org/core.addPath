Metrics Advisor is a service for time series anomaly detection, diagnostics and analysis. As an AI powered service, it uses your data to train the model used. The service accepts tables of aggregated data with the following columns:

* **Measure** (required): one or more columns containing numeric values.
* **Timestamp** (optional): zero or one column with type of `DateTime` or `String`. When this column is not set, the timestamp is set as the start time of each ingestion period. Format the timestamp into: `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`. 
  * **Your timestamp should match the granularity of the metric. For example, a daily metric should ensure the hour, minute and second on the timestamp labeled as `00:00:00`**.
* **Dimension** (optional): Columns can be of any data type. Be cautious when working with large volumes of columns and values, to prevent excessive numbers of dimensions from being processed.

> [!Note]
> For each metric, there should only be one timestamp per measure, corresponding to one dimension combination. Aggregate your data ahead of onboarding or use the query to specify the data to be ingested.
