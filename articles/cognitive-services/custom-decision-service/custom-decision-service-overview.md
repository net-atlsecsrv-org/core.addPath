# What is Custom Decision Service?

In a typical web or mobile application, a front page links to several articles or other types of content. As the front page loads, it could request the Custom Decision Service to rank articles included on that front page. So, when a user chooses an article by clicking on it, a second request could be sent to the Custom Decision Service, which will log the outcome of that user decision.

Custom Decision Service is easy to use, as it requires only an RSS feed for your content and a few lines of JavaScript to be added into your application.

Custom Decision Service converts your content into features for machine learning. The system uses these features to understand your content in terms of its text, images, videos, and overall sentiment. It uses several other [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services), like
[Entity Linking](../entitylinking/home.md),
[Text Analytics](../text-analytics/overview.md),
[Emotion](../emotion/home.md), and
[Computer Vision](../computer-vision/home.md).

Some common-use cases for Custom Decision Service include:

* Personalizing articles on a news website
* Personalizing video content on a media portal
* Optimizing ad placements or web pages that the ad directs to
* Ranking recommended items on a shopping website.

Custom Decision Service is currently in *free public preview*. It can personalize a list of articles on a website or an app. The feature extraction works best for English language content. [Limited functionality](../text-analytics/overview.md) is offered for other languages, like Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Japanese. This documentation will be revised as new functionality becomes available.

Custom Decision Service can be used in applications that are not in the content personalization domain. These applications might be a good fit for a custom preview. [Contact us](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/) to learn more.

## API usage modes

Custom Decision Service can be applied to both webpages and mobile apps. The APIs can be called from either a browser or an app. The API usage is similar on both, but some of the details are different.

## Glossary of terms

Several terms frequently occur in this documentation:

* **Action set**: The set of content items for Custom Decision Service to rank. This set can be specified as an *RSS* or *Atom* endpoint.
* **Ranking**: Each request to Custom Decision Service specifies one or more action sets. The system responds by picking all the content options from these sets and returns them in ranked order.
* **Callback function**: This function, which you specify, renders the content in your UI. The content is ordered by the rank ordering returned by Custom Decision Service.
* **Reward**: A measure of how the user responded to the rendered content. Custom Decision Service measures user response by using clicks. The clicks are reported to the system by using custom code inserted in your application.

## Next steps
