# Call API from a browser

This article helps you make calls to the Azure Custom Decision Service APIs directly from a browser.

Be sure to [Register your application](custom-decision-service-get-started-register.md), first.

Let's get started. Your application is modeled as having a front page, which links to several article pages. The front page uses Custom Decision Service to specify the ordering of its article pages. Insert the following code into the HTML head of the front page:

```html
// Define the "callback function" to render UI
<script> function callback(data) { â€¦ } </script>

// call Ranking API, after callback() is defined
<script src="https://ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/<appId>/rank/<actionSetId>" async></script>
```

The `data` argument contains the ranking of URLs to be rendered. For more information, see the reference [API](custom-decision-service-api-reference.md).

To handle a user click on the top article, call the following code on the front page:

```javascript
// call Reward API to report a click
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: '//ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/<appId>/reward/' + data.eventId,
    contentType: "application/json" })
```

Here, `data` is the argument to the `callback()` function. An implementation example can be found in this [tutorial](custom-decision-service-tutorial-news.md#use-the-apis).

Finally, you need to provide the Action Set API, which returns the list of articles (actions) to be considered by Custom Decision Service. Implement this API as an RSS feed, as shown here:

```xml
<rss version="2.0">
<channel>
   <item>
      <title><![CDATA[title (possibly with url) ]]></title>
      <link>url</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2017 16:30:52 GMT</pubDate>
    </item>
   <item>
       ....
   </item>
</channel>
</rss>
```

Here, each top-level `<item>` element describes an article. The `<link>` is mandatory and is used as an action ID by Custom Decision Service. Specify `<date>` (in a standard RSS format) if you have more than 15 articles. The 15 most recent articles are used. The `<title>` is optional and is used to create text-related features for the article.
