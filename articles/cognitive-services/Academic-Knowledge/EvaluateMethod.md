# Evaluate Method

The **evaluate** REST API is used to return a set of academic entities based on a query expression.
<br>

**REST endpoint:**  
```
https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/academic/v1.0/evaluate? 
```   
<br>

## Request Parameters  

Name     | Value | Required?  | Description
-----------|-----------|---------|--------
**expr**       | Text string | Yes | A query expression that specifies which entities should be returned.
**model**      | Text string | No  | Name of the model that you wish to query.  Currently, the value defaults to *latest*.        
**attributes** | Text string | No<br>default: Id | A comma-delimited list that specifies the attribute values that are included in the response. Attribute names are case-sensitive.
**count**	     | Number | No<br>Default: 10 | Number of results to return.
**offset**     | Number |	No<br>Default: 0	| Index of the first result to return.
**orderby** |	Text string | No<br>Default: by decreasing prob	| Name of an attribute that is used for sorting the entities. Optionally, ascending/descending can be specified. The format is: *name:asc* or *name:desc*.
  
 <br>

## Response (JSON)

Name | Description
-------|-----   
**expr** |	The *expr* parameter from the request.
**entities** |	An array of 0 or more entities that matched the query expression. Each entity contains a natural log probability value and the values of other requested attributes.
**aborted** | True if the request timed out.

<br>

#### Example:
```
https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/academic/v1.0/evaluate?expr=
Composite(AA.AuN=='jaime teevan')&count=2&attributes=Ti,Y,CC,AA.AuN,AA.AuId
```
<br>Typically, an expression will be obtained from a response to the **interpret** method.  But you can also compose query expressions yourself (see [Query Expression Syntax](QueryExpressionSyntax.md)).  
  
Using the *count* and *offset* parameters, a large number of results may be obtained without sending a single request that results in a huge (and potentially slow) response.  In this example, the request used the expression for the first interpretation from the **interpret** API response as the *expr* value. The *count=2* parameter specifies that 2 entity results are being requested. And the *attributes=Ti,Y,CC,AA.AuN,AA.AuId* parameter indicates that the title, year, citation count, author name, and author ID are requested for each result.  See [Entity Attributes](EntityAttributes.md) for a list of attributes.
