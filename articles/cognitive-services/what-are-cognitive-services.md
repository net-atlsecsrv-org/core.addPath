# What are Azure Cognitive Services?

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based services with REST APIs, and client library SDKs available to help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct artificial intelligence (AI) or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enables developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications with cognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.

The catalog of AI services, which provide cognitive understanding are categorized into five main pillars:

* Vision
* Speech
* Language
* Web Search
* Decision

The current list of new documentation is available at [What's new in Cognitive Services docs](whats-new-docs.md).
