# What is the Web Language Model API? (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Web Language Model preview was decommissioned on August 9, 2018. We recommend using [Azure Machine Learning text analytics modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/text-analytics) for text processing and analysis.

The Microsoft Web Language Model API is a REST-based cloud service providing state-of-the-art tools for natural language processing. Using this API, your application can leverage the power of big data through language models trained on web-scale corpora collected by Bing in the en-US market.

These smoothed backoff N-gram language models, supporting up to fifth-order Markov chains, are trained on the following corpora:

- Web page body text
- Web page title text
- Web page anchor text
- Web search query text

The Web Language Model API supports four lookup operations:

1. Joint (log10) probability of a sequence of words.
2. Conditional (log10) probability of one word given a sequence of preceding words.
3. List of words (completions) most likely to follow a given sequence of words.
4. Word breaking of strings that contain no spaces.

## Getting Started

1. Subscribe to the service.
2. Download the [SDK](https://www.github.com/microsoft/cognitive-weblm-windows).
3. Run the SDK sample code.
4. Refer to the [API Reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20170503191852/westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/55de9ca4e597ed1fd4e2f104/operations/55de9ca4e597ed19b0de8a51) for full details of the endpoints, including code snippets in a variety of languages.

## Underlying Technology

The following paper provides details on the development of these language models, and should be cited in research publications that use this service:
