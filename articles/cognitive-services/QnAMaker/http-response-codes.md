# QnA Maker API HTTP response codes
The [management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092179) and prediction APIs return HTTP response codes. While response messages include information specific to a request, the HTTP response status code is general. 

### Management

|401|Invalid key|
|403|Forbidden - you do not have correct permissions|
