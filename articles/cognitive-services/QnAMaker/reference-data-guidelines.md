# Import and export data reference

Review this import and export reference to get the best results for your knowledge base backup, storage, and replacement.

## Import and export knowledge base

**TSV and XLS files**, from exported knowledge bases, can only be used by importing the files from the **Settings** page in the QnA Maker portal. They can't be used as data sources during knowledge base creation or from the **+ Add file** or **+ Add URL** feature on the **Settings** page. 

When you import the Knowledge base through these **TSV and XLS files**, the QnA pairs get added to the editorial source and not the sources from which the QnAs were extracted in the exported Knowledge Base.
