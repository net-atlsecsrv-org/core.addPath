[!INCLUDE [Custom subdomains notice](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Ruby 2.x](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [QnA Maker resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesQnAMaker) in the Azure portal to get your authoring key and endpoint. After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the QnA Maker API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Install the client libraries

After installing Ruby, you can install the client libraries with:

```console
gem install azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker
gem install azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime
```

### Create a new Ruby application

Create a new file named `quickstart.rb` and import the following libraries.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="Dependencies":::

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal and find the key and endpoint for the QnA Maker resource you created in the prerequisites. They will be located on the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**.
> You need the entire key to create your knowledgebase. You need only the resource name from the endpoint. The format is `https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.cognitiveservices.azure.com`.
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md) provides secure key storage.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="Resourcevariables":::

## Object models

QnA Maker uses two different object models:
* **[QnAMakerClient](#qnamakerclient-object-model)** is the object to create, manage, publish, and download the knowledgebase.
* **[QnAMakerRuntime](#qnamakerruntimeclient-object-model)** is the object to query the knowledge base with the GenerateAnswer API and send new suggested questions using the Train API (as part of [active learning](../concepts/active-learning-suggestions.md)).

[!INCLUDE [Get KBinformation](./quickstart-sdk-cognitive-model.md)]

### QnAMakerClient object model

The authoring QnA Maker client is a [QnAMakerClient](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/qnamaker_client.rb) object that authenticates to Azure using MsRest::ServiceClientCredentials, which contains your key.

Once the client is created, use the methods of the client's [knowledgebase](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/knowledgebase.rb) property to create, manage, and publish your knowledge base.

For immediate operations, a method usually returns the result, if any. For long-running operations, the response is an [operation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/operation.rb) object. Call the [operations.get_details](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/operations.rb#L33) method with the `operation.operation_id` value to determine the [status of the request](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/operation_state_type.rb).

### QnAMakerRuntimeClient object model

The runtime QnA Maker client is a [QnAMakerRuntimeClient](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime/qnamaker_runtime_client.rb) object.

After you publish your knowledge base using the authoring client, use the runtime client's [runtime.generate_answer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime/runtime.rb#L34) method to get an answer from the knowledge base.

When you call `generate_answer`, pass a hash for the `custom_headers` optional parameter. This hash should include a key `Authorization` and a value `EndpointKey YOUR_ENDPOINT_KEY`. For the value of YOUR_ENDPOINT_KEY, use the authoring client to call [endpoint_keys.get_keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/endpoint_keys.rb#L32).

## Authenticate the client for authoring the knowledge base

Instantiate a client with your authoring endpoint and subscription key.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="AuthorizationAuthor":::

## Create a knowledge base

A knowledge base stores question and answer pairs for the [CreateKbDTO](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/create_kb_dto.rb) object from three sources:

* For **editorial content**, use the [QnADTO](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/qn_adto.rb) object.
    * To use metadata and follow-up prompts, use the editorial context, because this data is added at the individual QnA pair level.
* For **files**, use the [FileDTO](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/file_dto.rb) object. The FileDTO includes the filename as well as the public URL to reach the file.
* For **URLs**, use a list of strings to represent publicly available URLs.

Call the [create](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/knowledgebase.rb#L554) method then pass the `operation_id` property of the returned operation to the [operations.get_details](#get-status-of-an-operation) method to poll for status.

The final line of the following code returns the knowledge base ID.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="CreateKBMethod":::

## Update a knowledge base

You can update a knowledge base by calling [knowledgebase.update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/knowledgebase.rb#L455) and passing in the knowledge base ID and an [UpdateKbOperationDTO](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/update_kb_operation_dto.rb) object. That object in turn can contain:
- [add](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/update_kb_operation_dtoadd.rb)
- [update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/update_kb_operation_dtoupdate.rb)
- [delete](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/update_kb_operation_dtodelete.rb)

Pass the `operation_id` property of the returned operation to the [operations.get_details](#get-status-of-an-operation) method to poll for status.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="UpdateKBMethod":::

## Download a knowledge base

Use the [knowledgebase.download](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/knowledgebase.rb#L651) method to download the database as a list of [QnADocumentsDTO](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/qn_adocuments_dto.rb). This is _not_ equivalent to the QnA Maker portal's export from the **Settings** page because the result of this method is not a TSV file.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="DownloadKB":::

## Publish a knowledge base

Publish the knowledge base using the [knowledgebase.publish](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/knowledgebase.rb#L283) method. This takes the current saved and trained model, referenced by the knowledge base ID, and publishes that at an endpoint.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="PublishKB":::

## Get query runtime key

Once a knowledgebase is published, you need the runtime endpoint key to query the knowledge. This is not the same as the subscription key used to create the authoring client.

Use the [endpoint_keys.get_keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/endpoint_keys.rb#L32) method to get an [EndpointKeysDTO](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/endpoint_keys_dto.rb) object.

Use either of the key properties returned in the object to query the knowledgebase.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="GetQueryEndpointKey":::

## Authenticate the runtime for generating an answer

Create a [QnAMakerRuntimeClient](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamakerruntime/qnamaker_runtime_client.rb) to query the knowledge base to generate an answer or train from active learning.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="AuthorizationQuery":::

Use the QnAMakerRuntimeClient to get an answer from the knowledge or to send new suggested questions to the knowledge base for [active learning](../concepts/active-learning-suggestions.md).

## Generate an answer from the knowledge base

Generate an answer from a published knowledge base using the RuntimeClient.runtime.generateAnswer method. This method accepts the knowledge base ID and the QueryDTO. Access additional properties of the QueryDTO, such a Top and Context to use in your chat bot.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="GenerateAnswer":::

This is a simple example of querying a knowledge base. To understand advanced querying scenarios, review [other query examples](../quickstarts/get-answer-from-knowledge-base-using-url-tool.md?pivots=url-test-tool-curl#use-curl-to-query-for-a-chit-chat-answer).

## Delete a knowledge base

Delete the knowledge base using the [knowledgebase.delete](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/20b8b81287d272587ace808434c14b039d014e12/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/knowledgebase.rb#L205) method with a parameter of the knowledge base ID.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="DeleteKB":::

## Get status of an operation

Some methods, such as create and update, can take enough time that instead of waiting for the process to finish, an [operation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/data/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/lib/4.0/generated/azure_cognitiveservices_qnamaker/models/operation.rb) is returned. Use the operation ID from the operation to poll (with retry logic) to determine the status of the original method.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="MonitorOperation":::

## Run the application

Here is the main method for the application.

:::code language="ruby" source="~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/ruby/qnamaker/sdk/quickstart.rb" id="Main":::

Run the application with the ruby command on your quickstart file.

```console
ruby quickstart.rb
```
