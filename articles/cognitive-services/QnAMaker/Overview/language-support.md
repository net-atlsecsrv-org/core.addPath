# Language support for a QnA Maker resource and knowledge bases

Language for the service is selected when you create the first knowledge base in the resource. All additional knowledge bases in the resource must be in the same language. 

The language determines the relevance of the results QnA Maker provides in response to user queries.

Learn more about the [impact of language selection](../how-to/language-knowledge-base.md).
