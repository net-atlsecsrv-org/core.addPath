# Get analytics on your knowledge base

# [QnA Maker GA (stable release)](#tab/v1)

QnA Maker stores all chat logs and other telemetry, if you have enabled Application Insights during the [creation of your QnA Maker service](./set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md). Run the sample queries to get your chat logs from Application Insights.

1. Go to your Application Insights resource.

    ![Select your application insights resource](../media/qnamaker-how-to-analytics-kb/resources-created.png)

2. Select **Log (Analytics)**. A new window opens where you can query QnA Maker telemetry.

3. Paste in the following query and run it.

    ```kusto
    requests
    | where url endswith "generateAnswer"
    | project timestamp, id, url, resultCode, duration, performanceBucket
    | parse kind = regex url with *"(?i)knowledgebases/"KbId"/generateAnswer"
    | join kind= inner (
    traces | extend id = operation_ParentId
    ) on id
    | extend question = tostring(customDimensions['Question'])
    | extend answer = tostring(customDimensions['Answer'])
    | extend score = tostring(customDimensions['Score'])
    | project timestamp, resultCode, duration, id, question, answer, score, performanceBucket,KbId
    ```

    Select **Run** to run the query.

# [QnA Maker managed (preview release)](#tab/v2)

QnA Maker managed (Preview) uses Azure diagnostic logging to store the telemetry data and chat logs. Follow the below steps to run sample queries to get analytics on the usage of your QnA Maker knowledge base.

1. [Enable diagnostics logging](../../diagnostic-logging.md) for your QnA Maker managed (Preview) service.

2. In the previous step, select **Trace** in addition to **Audit, RequestResponse and AllMetrics** for logging

### Total 90-day traffic

```kusto
//Total Traffic
requests
| where url endswith "generateAnswer" and name startswith "POST"
| parse kind = regex url with *"(?i)knowledgebases/"KbId"/generateAnswer"
| summarize ChatCount=count() by bin(timestamp, 1d), KbId
```

### Total question traffic in a given time period

```kusto
//Total Question Traffic in a given time period
let startDate = todatetime('2019-01-01');
let endDate = todatetime('2020-12-31');
requests
| where timestamp <= endDate and timestamp >=startDate
| where url endswith "generateAnswer" and name startswith "POST"
| parse kind = regex url with *"(?i)knowledgebases/"KbId"/generateAnswer"
| summarize ChatCount=count() by KbId
```

### User traffic

```kusto
//User Traffic
requests
| where url endswith "generateAnswer"
| project timestamp, id, url, resultCode, duration
| parse kind = regex url with *"(?i)knowledgebases/"KbId"/generateAnswer"
| join kind= inner (
traces | extend id = operation_ParentId
) on id
| extend UserId = tostring(customDimensions['UserId'])
| summarize ChatCount=count() by bin(timestamp, 1d), UserId, KbId
```

### Latency distribution of questions

```kusto
//Latency distribution of questions
requests
| where url endswith "generateAnswer" and name startswith "POST"
| parse kind = regex url with *"(?i)knowledgebases/"KbId"/generateAnswer"
| project timestamp, id, name, resultCode, performanceBucket, KbId
| summarize count() by performanceBucket, KbId
```

### Unanswered questions

```kusto
// Unanswered questions
requests
| where url endswith "generateAnswer"
| project timestamp, id, url
| parse kind = regex url with *"(?i)knowledgebases/"KbId"/generateAnswer"
| join kind= inner (
traces | extend id = operation_ParentId
) on id
| extend question = tostring(customDimensions['Question'])
| extend answer = tostring(customDimensions['Answer'])
| extend score = tostring(customDimensions['Score'])
| where  score  == "0" and message == "QnAMaker GenerateAnswer"
| project timestamp, KbId, question, answer, score
| order  by timestamp  desc
```

# [QnA Maker managed (preview release)](#tab/v2)

### All QnA chat log

```kusto
// All QnA Traffic
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
| where OperationName=="QnAMaker GenerateAnswer"
| extend answer_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).answer)
| extend question_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).question)
| extend score_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).score)
| extend kbId_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).kbId)
| project question_, answer_, score_, kbId_
```

### Traffic count per knowledge base and user in a time period

```kusto
// Traffic count per KB and user in a time period
let startDate = todatetime('2019-01-01');
let endDate = todatetime('2020-12-31');
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
| where OperationName=="QnAMaker GenerateAnswer"
| where TimeGenerated <= endDate and TimeGenerated >=startDate
| extend kbId_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).kbId)
| extend userId_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).userId)
| summarize ChatCount=count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), kbId_, userId_
```

### Latency of GenerateAnswer API

```kusto
// Latency of GenerateAnswer
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
| where OperationName=="Generate Answer"
| project TimeGenerated, DurationMs
| render timechart
```

### Average latency of all operations

```kusto
// Average Latency of all operations
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
| project DurationMs, OperationName
| summarize count(), avg(DurationMs) by OperationName
| render barchart
```

### Unanswered questions

```kusto
// All unanswered questions
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.COGNITIVESERVICES"
| where OperationName=="QnAMaker GenerateAnswer"
| extend answer_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).answer)
| extend question_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).question)
| extend score_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).score)
| extend kbId_ = tostring(parse_json(properties_s).kbId)
| where score_ == 0
| project question_, answer_, score_, kbId_
```
