## Manage large knowledge bases

* **Data source groups**: The QnAs are grouped by the data source from which they were extracted. You can expand or collapse the data source.

    ![Use the QnA Maker data source bar to collapse and expand data source questions and answers](../media/qnamaker-how-to-edit-kb/data-source-grouping.png)

* **Search knowledge base**: You can search the knowledge base by typing in the text box at the top of the Knowledge Base table. Click enter to search on the question, answer, or metadata content. Click on the X icon to remove the search filter.

    ![Use the QnA Maker search box above the questions and answers to reduce the view to only filter-matching items](../media/qnamaker-how-to-edit-kb/search-paginate-group.png)

* **Pagination**: Quickly move through data sources to manage large knowledge bases

## Delete knowledge bases

Deleting a knowledge base (KB) is a permanent operation. It can't be undone. Before deleting a knowledge base, you should export the knowledge base from the **Settings** page of the QnA Maker portal. 

If you share your KB with [collaborators](collaborate-knowledge-base.md) then delete it, everyone loses access to the KB. 

## Delete Azure resources 

If you delete any of the Azure resources used for your QnA Maker knowledge bases, the knowledge bases will no longer function. Before deleting any resources, make sure you export your knowledge bases from the **Settings** page.
