# Use follow-up prompts to create multiple turns of a conversation

Use follow-up prompts and context to manage the multiple turns, known as _multi-turn_, for your bot from one question to another.

Watch the following demonstration video to see how it is done.

[![](../media/conversational-context/youtube-video.png)](https://aka.ms/multiturnexample).

## What is a multi-turn conversation?

Some questions can't be answered in a single turn. When you design your client application (chat bot) conversations, a user may ask a question that needs to be filtered or refined in order to determine the correct answer. This flow through the questions is possible by presenting the user with **follow-up prompts**.

When the user asks the question, QnA Maker returns the answer _and_ any follow-up prompts. This allows you to present the follow-up questions as choices. 

## Example multi-turn conversation with chat bot

A chat bot manages the conversation with the user, question by question, to determine the final answer.

![Within the conversational flow, manage conversation state in a multi-turn dialog system by providing prompts within the answers presented as options to continue the conversation.](../media/conversational-context/conversation-in-bot.png)

In the preceding image, the user entered `My account`. The knowledge base has 3 linked QnA pairs. The user needs to select from one of the three choices to refine the answer. In the knowledge base, the question (#1), has three follow-up prompts, presented in the chat bot as three choices (#2). 

When the user selects a choice (#3), then the next list of refining choices (#4) is presented. This can continue (#5) until the correct and final answer (#6) is determined.

The preceding image has **Enable multi-turn** selected in order to displayed prompts. 

### Using multi-turn in a bot

You need to change your client application to manage the contextual conversation. You will need to add [code to your bot](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/qnamaker-prompting) to see the prompts.  

## Create a multi-turn conversation from a document's structure

When you create a knowledge base, you will see an optional check-box to enable multi-turn extraction. 

![When you create a knowledge base, you will see an optional check-box to enable multi-turn extraction.](../media/conversational-context/enable-multi-turn.png)

If you select this option, when you import a document, the multi-turn conversation can be implied from the structure. If that structure exists, QnA Maker creates the follow-up prompt QnA pairs for you. 

Multi-turn structure can only be inferred from URLs, PDF, or DOCX files. 

The following image of a Microsoft Surface [PDF file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/data-source-formats/product-manual.pdf) is meant to be used as a manual. Due to the size of this PDF file, the Azure QnA Maker resource requires the Search pricing tier of B (15 indexes) or greater. 

![![If you import a document, contextual conversation can be implied from the structure. If that structure exists, QnA Maker creates the follow-up prompt QnA pairs for you, as part of the document import.](../media/conversational-context/import-file-with-conversational-structure.png)](../media/conversational-context/import-file-with-conversational-structure.png#lightbox)

When importing the PDF document, QnA Maker determines follow-up prompts from the structure to create conversational flow. 

1. In **Step 1**, select **Create a knowledge base** from the top navigation.
1. In **Step 2**, create or use an existing QnA service. Make sure to use a QnA service with a Search service of B (15 indexes) or higher because the Surface Manual PDF file is too large for a smaller tier.
1. In **Step 3**, enter a name for your knowledge base, such as `Surface manual`.
1. In **Step 4**, select **Enable multi-turn extraction from URLs, .pdf or .docx files.** Select the URL for the Surface Manual

    ```text
    https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/raw/master/qna-maker/data-source-formats/product-manual.pdf
    ```

1. Select the **Create your KB** button. 

    Once the knowledge is created, a view of the question and answer pairs displays.

## Show questions and answers with context

Reduce the question and answer pairs displayed to just those with contextual conversations. 

1. Select **View options**, then select **Show context (PREVIEW)**. The list shows question and answer pairs containing follow-up prompts. 

    ![Filter question and answer pairs by contextual conversations](../media/conversational-context/filter-question-and-answers-by-context.png)

2. The multi-turn context displays in the first column.

    ![![When importing the PDF document, QnA Maker determines follow-up prompts from the structure to create conversational flow. ](../media/conversational-context/surface-manual-pdf-follow-up-prompt.png)](../media/conversational-context/surface-manual-pdf-follow-up-prompt.png#lightbox)

    In the preceding image, #1 indicates bold text in the column, which signifies the current question. The parent question is the top item in the row. Any questions below are the linked question and answer pairs. These items are selectable so you can immediately go to the other context items. 

## Add existing QnA pair as follow-up prompt

The original question of `My account` has follow-up prompts such as `Accounts and signing in`. 

![The original question of `My account` correctly returns the `Accounts and signing in` answer and already has the follow-up prompts linked.](../media/conversational-context/detected-and-linked-follow-up-prompts.png)

Add a follow-up prompt to an existing QnA pair that isn't currently linked. Because the question isn't linked to any QnA pair, the current view setting needs to change.

1. To link an existing QnA pair as a follow-up prompt, select the row for the question and answer pair. For the Surface manual, search for `Sign out` to reduce the list.
1. In the row for `Signout`, select **Add follow-up prompt**  from the **Answer** column.
1. In the **Follow-up prompt (PREVIEW)** pop-up window, enter the following:

    |Field|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Display text|`Turn off the device`. This is custom text you choose to display in the follow-up prompt.|
    |Context-only|Selected. This answer will only be returned if the question specifies context.|
    |Link to Answer|Enter `Use the sign-in screen` to find the existing QnA pair.|


1.  One match is returned. Select this answer as the follow-up, then select **Save**. 

    ![Search the Follow-up prompt's Link to Answer dialog for an existing answer, using the text of the answer.](../media/conversational-context/search-follow-up-prompt-for-existing-answer.png)

1. Once you have added the follow-up prompt, remember to select **Save and train** in the top navigation.
  
### Edit the display text 

When a follow-up prompt is created, and an existing QnA pair is selected as the **Link to Answer**, you can enter new **Display text**. This text does not replace the existing question, and it does not add a new alternate question. It is separate from those values. 

1. To edit the display text, search for and select the question in the **Context** field.
1. On that question's row, select the follow-up prompt in the answer column. 
1. Select the display text you want to edit, then select **Edit**.

    ![Select the display text you want to edit, then select Edit.](../media/conversational-context/edit-existing-display-text.png)

1. The **Follow-up prompt** pop-up allows you to change the existing display text. 
1. When you are done editing the display text, select **Save**. 
1. Remember to select **Save and train** in the top navigation.


<!--

## To find best prompt answer, add metadata to follow-up prompts 

If you have several follow-up prompts for a given QnA pair, but you know as the knowledge base manager, that not all prompts should be returned, use metadata to categorize the prompts in the knowledge base, then send the metadata from the client application as part of the GenerateAnswer request.

In the knowledge base, when a question-and-answer pair is linked to follow-up prompts, the metadata filters are applied first, then the follow-ups are returned.

1. For the two follow-up QnA pairs, add metadata to each one:

    |Question|Add metadata|
    |--|--|
    |`Feedback on an QnA Maker service`|"Feature":"all"|
    |`Feedback on an existing feature`|"Feature":"one"|
    
    ![Add metadata to follow-up prompt so it can be filtered in conversation response from service](../media/conversational-context/add-metadata-feature-to-follow-up-prompt.png) 

1. Save and train. 

    When you send the question `Give feedback` with the metadata filter `Feature` with a value of `all`, only the QnA pair with that metadata will be returned. Both QnA pairs are not returned because they both do not match the filter. 

-->

## Add new QnA pair as follow-up prompt

Add a new QnA pair to the knowledge base. The QnA pair should be linked to an existing question as a follow-up prompt.

1. From the knowledge base's toolbar, search for and select the existing QnA pair for `Accounts and Signing In`. 

1. In the **Answer** column for this question, select **Add follow-up prompt**. 
1. The **Follow-up prompt (PREVIEW)**, create a new follow-up prompt by entering the following values: 

    |Text field|Value|
    |--|--|
    |**Display Text**|`Create a Windows Account`. This is custom text you choose to display in the follow-up prompt.|
    |**Context-only**|Selected. This answer will only be returned if the question specifies context.|
    |**Link to answer**|Enter the following text as the answer:<br>`[Create](https://account.microsoft.com/) a Windows account with a new or existing email account.`<br>When you save and train the database, this text will be converted into |
    |||

    ![Create new prompt QnA](../media/conversational-context/create-child-prompt-from-parent.png)


1. Select **Create new** then select **Save**. 

    This created a new question-and-answer pair and linked the selected question as a follow-up prompt. The **Context** column, for both questions, indicates a follow-up prompt relationship. 

1. Change the **View options** to [show context](#show-questions-and-answers-with-context).

    The new question shows how it is linked.

    ![Create a new follow-up prompt ](../media/conversational-context/new-qna-follow-up-prompt.png)

    The parent question shows the new question as one of its choices.

    ![![The Context column, for both questions, indicates a follow-up prompt relationship.](../media/conversational-context/child-prompt-created.png)](../media/conversational-context/child-prompt-created.png#lightbox)

1. Once you have added the follow-up prompt, remember to select **Save and train** in the top navigation.

## Enable multi-turn when testing follow-up prompts

When testing the question with follow-up prompts in the **Test** pane, select **Enable multi-turn**, and enter your question. The response includes the follow-up prompts.

![When testing the question in the Test pane, the response includes the follow-up prompts.](../media/conversational-context/test-pane-with-question-having-follow-up-prompts.png)

If you don't enable multi-turn, the answer will be returned but follow-up prompts are not returned.

## Query the knowledge base with the QnA ID

In the initial question's response, any follow-up prompts and its associated `qnaId` is returned. Now that you have the ID, you can pass this in the follow-up prompt's request body. If the request body contains the `qnaId`, and the context object (which contains the previous QnA properties), then GenerateAnswer will return the exact question by ID, instead of using the ranking algorithm to find the answer by the question text. 

## Displaying prompts and sending context in the client application 

You have added prompts in your knowledge base and tested the flow in the test pane. Now you need to use these prompts in the client application. For Bot Framework, the prompts will not automatically start showing up in the client applications. You can show the prompts as suggested actions or buttons as part of the answer to the user’s query in client applications by including this [Bot Framework sample](https://aka.ms/qnamakermultiturnsample) in your code. The client application shall store the current QnA ID and the user query, and pass them in the [context object of the GenerateAnswer API](#json-request-to-return-non-initial-answer-and-follow-up-prompts) for the next user query. 

## Display order supported in API

The [display text and display order](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/qnamaker/knowledgebase/update#promptdto), returned in the JSON response, is supported for editing by the [Update API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/qnamaker/knowledgebase/update). 

<!--

FIX - Need to go to parent, then answer column, then edit answer.
