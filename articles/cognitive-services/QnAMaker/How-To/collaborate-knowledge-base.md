# Collaborate on your knowledge base

QnA Maker allows multiple people to collaborate on a knowledge base. This feature is provided with the Azure [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure). 

Perform the following steps to share your QnA Maker service with someone:

1. Log in to the Azure portal, and go to your QnA Maker resource.

2. Go to the **Access Control (IAM)** tab.

3. Select **Add**.

4. Select the **Owner** or the **Contributor** role. You cannot grant read-only access through Role-Based Access Control. Owner and Contributor role has read-write access right to QnA Maker service.

5. Enter the email you want to share with, and press save.

Now when the person you shared your QnA Maker service with, logs into the [QnA Maker portal](https://qnamaker.ai) they can see all the knowledge bases in that service.

Remember, you cannot share a particular knowledge base in a QnA Maker service. If you want more granular access control, consider distributing your knowledge bases across different QnA Maker services.
