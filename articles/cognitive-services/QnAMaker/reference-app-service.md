# Service configuration

QnA Maker uses several Azure resources (services) including Cognitive Search, App Service, App Service Plan, and Application Insights.

All customizations to these settings supported by QnA Maker are listed below.

## App Service

QnA Maker uses the App Service to provide the query runtime used by the [generateAnswer API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/qnamakerruntime/runtime/generateanswer).


These settings are available in the Azure portal, for the App Service. The settings are available by selecting **Settings**, then **Configuration**.

You can set an individual setting either through the Application Settings list, or modify several settings by selecting **Advanced edit**.

|Resource|Setting|
|--|--|
|AzureSearchAdminKey|Cognitive Search - used for QnA set storage and Ranker #1|
|AzureSearchName|Cognitive Search - used for QnA set storage and Ranker #1|
|DefaultAnswer|Text of answer when no match is found|
|UserAppInsightsAppId|Chat log and telemetry|
|UserAppInsightsKey|Chat log and telemetry|
|UserAppInsightsName|Chat log and telemetry|
