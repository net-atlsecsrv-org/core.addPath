## Manage the knowledge base

# [QnA Maker GA (stable release)](#tab/v1)

<details>
<summary><b>I accidentally deleted a part of my QnA Maker, what should I do?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Do not delete any of the Azure services created along with the QnA Maker resource such as Search or Web App. These are necessary for QnA Maker to work, if you delete one, QnA Maker will stop working correctly.

All deletes are permanent, including question and answer pairs, files, URLs, custom questions and answers, knowledge bases, or Azure resources. Make sure you export your knowledge base from the **Settings** page before deleting any part of your knowledge base.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is my URL(s)/file(s) not extracting question-answer pairs?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
It's possible that QnA Maker can't auto-extract some question-and-answer (QnA) content from valid FAQ URLs. In such cases, you can paste the QnA content in a .txt file and see if the tool can ingest it. Alternately, you can editorially add content to your knowledge base through the [QnA Maker portal](https://qnamaker.ai).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How large a knowledge base can I create?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
The size of the knowledge base depends on the SKU of Azure search you choose when creating the QnA Maker service. Read [here](./Tutorials/choosing-capacity-qnamaker-deployment.md) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why can't I see anything in the drop-down when I try to create a new knowledge base?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
You haven't created any QnA Maker services in Azure yet. Read [here](./How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md) to learn how to do that.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I share a knowledge base with others?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Sharing works at the level of a QnA Maker service, that is, all knowledge bases in the service will be shared. Read [here](./How-To/collaborate-knowledge-base.md) how to collaborate on a knowledge base.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can you share a knowledge base with a contributor that is not in the same AAD tenant, to modify a knowledge base?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Sharing is based on Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). If you can share _any_ resource in Azure with another user, you can also share QnA Maker.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>If you have an App Service Plan with 5 QnAMaker knowledge bases. Can you assign read/write rights to 5 different users so each of them can access only 1 QnAMaker knowledge base?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
You can share an entire QnAMaker service, not individual knowledge bases.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How can I change the default message when no good match is found?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
The default message is part of the settings in your App service.
- Go to your App service resource in the Azure portal

![qnamaker appservice](./media/qnamaker-faq/qnamaker-resource-list-appservice.png)
- Click on the **Settings** option

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The updates that I made to my knowledge base are not reflected on publish. Why not?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Every edit operation, whether in a table update, test, or setting, needs to be saved before it can be published. Be sure to click the **Save and train** button after every edit operation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does the knowledge base support rich data or multimedia?</b></summary>

**Answer**:

#### Multimedia auto-extraction for files and URLs

## Manage service

# [QnA Maker GA (stable release)](#tab/v1)

<details>
<summary><b>When should I restart my app service?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Refresh your app service when the caution icon is next to the version value for the knowledge base in the **Endpoint keys** table on the **User Settings** [page](https://www.qnamaker.ai/UserSettings).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I deleted my existing Search service. How can I fix this?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
If you delete an Azure Cognitive Search index, the operation is final and the index cannot be recovered.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I deleted my `testkb` index in my Search service. How can I fix this?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Your old data can't be recovered. Create a new QnA Maker resource and create your knowledge base again.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>When should I refresh my endpoint keys?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
Refresh your endpoint keys if you suspect that they have been compromised.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use the same Azure Cognitive Search resource for knowledge bases using multiple languages?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
To use multiple language and multiple knowledge bases, the user has to create an QnA Maker resource for each language. This will create a separate Azure search service per language. Mixing different language knowledge bases in a single Azure search service will result in degraded relevance of results.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How can I change the name of the Azure Cognitive Search resource used by QnA Maker?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
The name of the Azure Cognitive Search resource is the QnA Maker resource name with some random letters appended at the end. This makes it hard to distinguish between multiple Search resources for QnA Maker. Create a separate search service (naming it the way you would like to) and connect it to your QnA Service. The steps are similar to the steps you need to do to [upgrade an Azure search](How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md#upgrade-the-azure-cognitive-search-service).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>When QnA Maker returns `Runtime core is not initialized,` how do I fix it?</b></summary>

**Answer**:
The disk space for your app service might be full. Steps to fix your disk space:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your QnA Maker's App service, then stop the service.
1. While still on the App service, select **Development Tools**, then **Advanced Tools**, then **Go**. This opens a new browser window.
1. Select **Debug console**, then **CMD** to open a command line tool.
1. Navigate to the _site/wwwroot/Data/QnAMaker/_ directory.
1. Remove all the folders whose name begins with `rd`.

    **Do not delete** the following:

    * KbIdToRankerMappings.txt file
    * EndpointSettings.json file
    * EndpointKeys folder

1. Start the App service.
1. Access your knowledge base to verify it works now.
