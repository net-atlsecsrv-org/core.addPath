# Create, train, and publish your QnA Maker knowledge base

You can create a QnA Maker knowledge base (KB) from your own content, such as FAQs or product manuals. The QnA Maker knowledge base in this example is created from a simple FAQ webpage to answer questions on BitLocker key recovery.

## Prerequisite

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a QnA Maker knowledge base

1. Sign in to [QnAMaker.ai](https://QnAMaker.ai) portal with your Azure credentials.

1. On the QnA Maker portal, select **Create a knowledge base**.

   ![Create new knowledge base](../media/qna-maker-create-kb.png)

1. On the **Create** page, in step 1, select **Create a QnA service**. You are directed to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesQnAMaker) to set up a QnA Maker service in your subscription. If the Azure portal times out, select **Try again** on the site. After you connect, your Azure dashboard appears.

1. After you successfully create a new QnA Maker service in Azure, return to qnamaker.ai/create. Select your QnA service from the drop-down lists in step 2. If you created a new QnA service, be sure to refresh the page.

   ![Select a QnA service knowledge base](../media/qnamaker-quickstart-kb/qnaservice-selection.png)

1. In step 3, name your knowledge base **My Sample QnA KB**.

1. To add content to your knowledge base, select three types of data sources. In step 4, under **Populate your KB**, add the 
   [BitLocker Recovery FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview-and-requirements-faq) URL in the **URL** box.

   ![Select a QnA service knowledge base](../media/qnamaker-quickstart-kb/add-datasources.png)

1. In step 5, select **Create your KB**.

1. While the knowledge base is being created, a pop-up window appears. The extraction process takes a few minutes to read the HTML page and identify questions and answers.

1. After the knowledge base is successfully created, the **Knowledge base** page opens. You can edit the contents of the knowledge base on this page.

## Edit the knowledge base

1. In the QnA Maker portal, on the **Edit** section, **Add QnA pair** to add a new row to the knowledge base. Under **Question**, enter **Hi.** Under **Answer**, enter **Hello. Ask me BitLocker questions.**

    ![Add a QnA pair](../media/qnamaker-quickstart-kb/add-qna-pair.png)

1. In the upper right, select **Save and train** to save your edits and train the QnA Maker model. Edits aren't kept unless they're saved.

## Test the knowledge base

1. In the QnA Maker portal, in the upper right, select **Test** to test that the changes you made took effect. Enter `hi there` in the box, and select Enter. You should see the answer you created as a response.

1. Select **Inspect** to examine the response in more detail. The test window is used to test your changes to the knowledge base before they're published.

    ![Test Panel](../media/qnamaker-quickstart-kb/inspect.png)

1. Select **Test** again to close the **Test** pop-up.

## Publish the knowledge base

When you publish a knowledge base, the question and answer contents of your knowledge base moves from the test index to a production index in Azure search.

![Publish prod test index](../media/qnamaker-how-to-publish-kb/publish-prod-test.png)

1. In the QnA Maker portal, in the menu next to **Edit**, select **Publish**. Then to confirm, select **Publish** on the page.

1. The QnA Maker service is now successfully published. You can use the endpoint in your application or bot code.

    ![Publish](../media/qnamaker-quickstart-kb/publish-sucess.png)

## Create a bot

Creating a bot is always available after publishing, from the **Publish** page. 

* You can create several bots quickly, all pointing to the same knowledge base for different regions or pricing plans for the individual bots. 
* If you want only one bot for the knowledge base, use the **View all your bots on the Azure portal** link to view a list of your current bots. 
* When you make changes to the knowledge base and republish, you do not need to take further action with the bot. It is already configured to work with the knowledge base and will work with all future changes to the knowledge base. Every time you publish a knowledge base - all the bots connected to it are automatically updated

1. In the QnA Maker portal, on the **Publish** page, select **Create bot**. This button appears only after the knowledge base is published.

    ![In the QnA Maker portal, go to the Publish page, and publish your knowledge base. Select Create Bot.](../media/qnamaker-create-publish-knowledge-base/create-bot-from-published-knowledge-base-page.png)

1. A new browser tab opens for the Azure portal, with the Azure Bot Service's creation page. Configure the Azure bot service. For more information on these configuration settings, see [Create a QnA Bot with Azure Bot Service v4](../tutorials/create-qna-bot.md) tutorial.
    
    * Do not change the following settings in the Azure portal when creating the bot. They are pre-populated for your existing knowledge base: 
        * QnA Auth Key
        * App service plan/Location
        * Azure Storage
    * The bot and QnA Maker can share the web app service _plan_ but can't share the web app. This means the **app name** must be different from the app name you used when you created the QnA Maker service.
