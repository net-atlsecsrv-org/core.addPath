# What is a QnA Maker Knowledge base?

A QnA Maker knowledge base consists of a set of question/answer (QnA) pairs and optional metadata associated with each QnA pair.

## Key knowledge base concepts

* **Questions** - A question contains text that best represents a user query. 
* **Answers** - An answer is the response that is returned when a user query is matched with the associated question.  
* **Metadata** - Metadata are tags associated with a QnA pair and are represented as key-value pairs. Metadata tags are used to filter QnA pairs and limit the set over which query matching is performed.

A single QnA, represented by a numeric QnA ID, has multiple variants of a question (alternate questions) that all map to a single answer. Additionally, each such pair can have multiple metadata fields associated with it: one key, and one value.

## Knowledge base content format

When you ingest rich content into a knowledge base, QnA Maker attempts to convert the content to markdown. Read [this](https://aka.ms/qnamaker-docs-markdown-support) blog to understand the markdown formats understandable by most chat clients.

Metadata fields consist of key-value pairs separated by a colon **(Product:Shredder)**. Both key and value must be text-only. The metadata key must not contain any spaces. Metadata supports only one value per key.
