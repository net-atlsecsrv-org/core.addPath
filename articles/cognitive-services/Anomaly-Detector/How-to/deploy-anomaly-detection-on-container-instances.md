# Deploy an Anomaly Detector container to Azure Container Instances

Learn how to deploy the Cognitive Services [Anomaly Detector](../anomaly-detector-container-howto.md) container to Azure [Container Instances](../../../container-instances/index.yml). This procedure demonstrates the creation of an Anomaly Detector resource. Then we discuss pulling the associated container image. Finally, we highlight the ability to exercise the orchestration of the two from a browser. Using containers can shift the developers' attention away from managing infrastructure to instead focusing on application development.
