# Quickstart: Get sentence lengths with the Translator Text REST API (Ruby)

In this quickstart, you find the lengths of sentences in text using the Translator Text API.

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Ruby 2.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or later to run this code.

To use the Translator Text API, you also need a subscription key; see [How to sign up for the Translator Text API](translator-text-how-to-signup.md).

## BreakSentence request

The following code breaks the source text into sentences using the [BreakSentence](./reference/v3-0-break-sentence.md) method.

1. Create a new Ruby project in your favorite code editor.
2. Add the code provided below.
3. Replace the `key` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. Run the program.

```ruby
require 'net/https'
require 'uri'
require 'cgi'
require 'json'
require 'securerandom'

# **********************************************
# *** Update or verify the following values. ***
# **********************************************

# Replace the key string value with your valid subscription key.
key = 'ENTER KEY HERE'

host = 'https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com'
path = '/breaksentence?api-version=3.0'

uri = URI (host + path)

text = 'How are you? I am fine. What did you do today?'

content = '[{"Text" : "' + text + '"}]'

request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
request['Content-type'] = 'application/json'
request['Content-length'] = content.length
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = key
request['X-ClientTraceId'] = SecureRandom.uuid
request.body = content

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request (request)
end

result = response.body.force_encoding("utf-8")

json = JSON.pretty_generate(JSON.parse(result))
puts json
```

## BreakSentence response

A successful response is returned in JSON as shown in the following example:

```json
[
  {
    "detectedLanguage": {
      "language": "en",
      "score": 1.0
    },
    "sentLen": [
      13,
      11,
      22
    ]
  }
]
```
