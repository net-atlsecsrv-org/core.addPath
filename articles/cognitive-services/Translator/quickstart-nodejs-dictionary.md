# Quickstart: Look up words with bilingual dictionary using Node.js

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to find alternate translations and usage examples for a specified text using Node.js and the Translator Text REST API.

This quickstart requires an [Azure Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with a Translator Text resource. If you don't have an account, you can use the [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) to get a subscription key.

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

* [Node 8.12.x or later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* An Azure subscription key for Translator Text

## Create a project and import required modules

Create a new project using your favorite IDE or editor, or create a new folder on your desktop. Copy this code snippet into your project/folder into a file named `alt-translations.js`.

```javascript
const request = require('request');
const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4');
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used these modules you'll need to install them before running your program. To install these packages, run: `npm install request uuidv4`.

These modules are required to construct the HTTP request, and create a unique identifier for the `'X-ClientTraceId'` header.

## Set the subscription key

This code will try to read your Translator Text subscription key from the environment variable `TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY`. If you're not familiar with environment variables, you can set `subscriptionKey` as a string and comment out the conditional statement.

Copy this code into your project:

```javascript
/* Checks to see if the subscription key is available
as an environment variable. If you are setting your subscription key as a
string, then comment these lines out.

If you want to set your subscription key as a string, replace the value for
the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header as a string. */
const subscriptionKey = process.env.TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY;
if (!subscriptionKey) {
  throw new Error('Environment variable for your subscription key is not set.')
};
```

## Configure the request

The `request()` method, made available through the request module, allows us to pass the HTTP method, URL, request params, headers, and the JSON body as an `options` object. In this code snippet, we'll configure the request:

>[!NOTE]
> For more information about endpoints, routes, and request parameters, see [Translator Text API 3.0: Dictionary Lookup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-dictionary-lookup).

```javascript
let options = {
    method: 'POST',
    baseUrl: 'https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/',
    url: 'dictionary/lookup',
    qs: {
      'api-version': '3.0',
      'from': 'en',
      'to': 'es'
    },
    headers: {
      'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey,
      'Content-type': 'application/json',
      'X-ClientTraceId': uuidv4().toString()
    },
    body: [{
          'text': 'Elephants'
    }],
    json: true,
};
```

The easiest way to authenticate a request is to pass in your subscription key as an
`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header, which is what we use in this sample. As an alternative, you can exchange your subscription key for an access token, and pass the access token along as an `Authorization` header to validate your request. 

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request headers. 

For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Make the request and print the response

Next, we'll create the request using the `request()` method. It takes the `options` object that we created in the previous section as the first argument, then prints the prettified JSON response.

```javascript
request(options, function(err, res, body){
    console.log(JSON.stringify(body, null, 4));
});
```

>[!NOTE]
> In this sample, we're defining the HTTP request in the `options` object. However, the request module also supports convenience methods, like `.post` and `.get`. For more information, see [convenience methods](https://github.com/request/request#convenience-methods).

## Put it all together

That's it, you've put together a simple program that will call the Translator Text API and return a JSON response. Now it's time to run your program:

```console
node alt-translations.js
```

If you'd like to compare your code against ours, the complete sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/Text-Translation-API-V3-NodeJS).

## Sample response

```json
[
    {
        "displaySource": "elephants",
        "normalizedSource": "elephants",
        "translations": [
            {
                "backTranslations": [
                    {
                        "displayText": "elephants",
                        "frequencyCount": 1207,
                        "normalizedText": "elephants",
                        "numExamples": 5
                    }
                ],
                "confidence": 1.0,
                "displayTarget": "elefantes",
                "normalizedTarget": "elefantes",
                "posTag": "NOUN",
                "prefixWord": ""
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## Clean up resources

If you've hardcoded your subscription key into your program, make sure to remove the subscription key when you're finished with this quickstart.
