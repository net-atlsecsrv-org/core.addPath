# Translator Text API v3.0

## What's new?

Version 3 of the Translator Text API provides a modern JSON-based Web API. It improves usability and performance by consolidating existing features into fewer operations and it provides new features.

 * Transliteration to convert text in one language from one script to another script.
 * Translation to multiple languages in one request.
 * Language detection, translation, and transliteration in one request.
 * Dictionary to look up alternative translations of a term, to find back-translations and examples showing terms used in context.
 * More informative language detection results.

## Base URLs

Microsoft Translator is served out of multiple datacenter locations. Currently they are located in 10 [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions):

* **Americas:** East US, South Central US, West Central US, and West US 2 
* **Asia Pacific:** Korea South, Japan East, Southeast Asia, and Australia East
* **Europe:** North Europe and West Europe

Requests to the Microsoft Translator Text API are in most cases handled by the datacenter that is closest to where the request originated. In case of a datacenter failure, the request may be routed outside of the Azure geography.

To force the request to be handled by a specific Azure geography, change the Global endpoint in the API request to the desired regional endpoint:

|Description|Azure geography|Base URL|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Azure|Global (non-regional)|	api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com|
|Azure|United States|	api-nam.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com|
|Azure|Europe|	api-eur.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com|
|Azure|Asia Pacific|	api-apc.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com|

## Authentication

Subscribe to Translator Text API or [Cognitive Services multi-service](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/) in Azure Cognitive Services, and use your subscription key (available in the Azure portal) to authenticate. 

There are three headers that you can use to authenticate your subscription. This table describes how each is used:

|Headers|Description|
|:----|:----|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key|*Use with Cognitive Services subscription if you are passing your secret key*.<br/>The value is the Azure secret key for your subscription to Translator Text API.|
|Authorization|*Use with Cognitive Services subscription if you are passing an authentication token.*<br/>The value is the Bearer token: `Bearer <token>`.|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region|*Use with Cognitive Services multi-service subscription if you are passing a multi-service secret key.*<br/>The value is the region of the multi-service subscription. This value is optional when not using a multi-service subscription.|

###  Secret key
The first option is to authenticate using the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header. Add the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>` header to your request.

### Authorization token
Alternatively, you can exchange your secret key for an access token. This token is included with each request as the `Authorization` header. To obtain an authorization token, make a `POST` request to the following URL:

| Environment     | Authentication service URL                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure           | `https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken` |

Here are example requests to obtain a token given a secret key:

```curl
// Pass secret key using header
curl --header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>' --data "" 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken'

// Pass secret key using query string parameter
curl --data "" 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken?Subscription-Key=<your-key>'
```

A successful request returns the encoded access token as plain text in the response body. The valid token is passed to the Translator service as a bearer token in the Authorization.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <Base64-access_token>
```

An authentication token is valid for 10 minutes. The token should be reused when making multiple calls to the Translator APIs. However, if your program makes requests to the Translator API over an extended period of time, then your program must request a new access token at regular intervals (for example, every 8 minutes).

### Multi-service subscription

The last authentication option is to use a Cognitive Serviceâ€™s multi-service subscription. This allows you to use a single secret key to authenticate requests for multiple services. 

When you use a multi-service secret key, you must include two authentication headers with your request. The first passes the secret key, the second specifies the region associated with your subscription. 
* `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`
* `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region`

Region is required for the multi-service Text API subscription. The region you select is the only region that you can use for text translation when using the multi-service subscription key, and must be the same region you selected when you signed up for your multi-service subscription through the Azure portal.

Available regions are `australiaeast`, `brazilsouth`, `canadacentral`, `centralindia`, `centralus`, `centraluseuap`, `eastasia`, `eastus`, `eastus2`, `francecentral`, `japaneast`, `japanwest`, `koreacentral`, `northcentralus`, `northeurope`, `southcentralus`, `southeastasia`, `uksouth`, `westcentralus`, `westeurope`, `westus`, `westus2`, and `southafricanorth`.

If you pass the secret key in the query string with the parameter `Subscription-Key`, then you must specify the region with query parameter `Subscription-Region`.

If you use a bearer token, you must obtain the token from the region endpoint: `https://<your-region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken`.


## Errors

A standard error response is a JSON object with name/value pair named `error`. The value is also a JSON object with properties:

  * `code`: A server-defined error code.
  * `message`: A string giving a human-readable representation of the error.

For example, a customer with a free trial subscription would receive the following error once the free quota is exhausted:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code":403001,
    "message":"The operation is not allowed because the subscription has exceeded its free quota."
    }
}
```
The error code is a 6-digit number combining the 3-digit HTTP status code followed by a 3-digit number to further categorize the error. Common error codes are:

| Code | Description |
