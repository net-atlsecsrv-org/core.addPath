# Create a Translator resource

In this article, you'll learn how to create a Translator resource in the Azure portal. [Azure Translator](translator-info-overview.md) is a cloud-based machine translation service that is part of the [Azure Cognitive Services](../what-are-cognitive-services.md) family of REST APIs. Azure resources are instances of services that you create. All API requests to Azure services require an **endpoint** URL and a read-only **subscription key** for authenticating access.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need an active [**Azure account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).  If you don't have one, you can [**create a free 12-month subscription**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Translator resource types

The Translator service can be accessed through two different resource types:

* **Single-service** resource types enable access to a single service API key and endpoint.  

* **Multi-service** resource types enable access to multiple Cognitive Services using a single API key and endpoint. The Cognitive Services resource is currently available for the following services:
  * Language ([Translator](../translator/translator-info-overview.md), [Language Understanding (LUIS)](../luis/what-is-luis.md), [Text Analytics](../text-analytics/overview.md))  
  * Vision ([Computer Vision](../computer-vision/overview.md)), ([Face](../face/overview.md))  
  * Decision ([Content Moderator](../content-moderator/overview.md))  

## Create your resource

* Navigate directly to the [**Create Translator**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextTranslation) page in the Azure portal to complete your project details.

* Navigate directly to the [**Create Cognitive Services**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne) page in the Azure portal to complete your project details.

>[!TIP]
>If you prefer, you can start on the Azure Portal home page to begin the **Create** process as follows:
>
> 1. Navigate to the [**Azure Portal**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home) home page.
> 1. Select ➕**Create a resource**  from the Azure services menu.
>1. In the **Search the Marketplace** search box, enter and select **Translator** (single-service resource) or **Cognitive Services** (multi-service resource).  *See* [Choose your resource type](#create-your-resource), above.
> 1. Select **Create** and you will be taken to the project details page.
><br/><br/>

## Complete your project and instance details

1. **Subscription**. Select one of your available Azure subscriptions.

1. **Resource Group**. The Azure resource group that you choose serve as a virtual container for your new resource. You can create a new resource group or add your resource to a pre-existing resource group that shares the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies.

1. **Resource Region**. Choose **Global** unless your business or application requires a specific region. Translator is a non-regional service—there is no dependency on a specific Azure region. *See* [Regions and Availability Zones in Azure](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md).

1. **Name**. Enter the name you have chosen for your resource. The name you choose must be unique within Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a Translator feature that requires a custom domain endpoint, the value that you enter in the Name field will be the custom domain name parameter for the endpoint.

5. **Pricing tier**. Select a [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/translator) that meets your needs:

   * Each subscription has a free tier.
   * The free tier has the same features and functionalities as paid plans and doesn't expire.
   * Only have one free subscription per account is allowed.</li></ul>

1. If you have created a multi-service resource, you will need to confirm additional usage details via the check boxes.

1. Select **Review + Create**.

1. Review the service terms and select **Create** to deploy your resource.

1. After your resource has successfully deployed, select **Go to resource**.

### Authentication keys and endpoint URL

All Cognitive Services API requests require an endpoint URL and a read-only key for authentication.

* **Authentication keys**. Your key is a unique string that is passed on every request to the Translation service. You can pass your key through a query-string parameter or by specifying it in the HTTP request header.

* **Endpoint URL**. Use the Global endpoint in your API request unless you need a specific Azure region. *See* [Base URLs](reference/v3-0-reference.md#base-urls). The Global endpoint URL is `api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`.

## Get your authentication keys and endpoint

1. After your new resource deploys, select **Go to resource** or navigate directly to your resource page.
1. In the left rail, under *Resource Management*, select **Keys and Endpoint**.
1. Copy and paste your subscription keys and endpoint URL in a convenient location, such as *Microsoft Notepad*.

## How to delete a  resource or resource group

> [!Warning]
> Deleting a resource group also deletes all resources contained in the group.

To remove a Cognitive Services or Translator resource, you can **delete the resource** or **delete the resource group**.

To delete the resource:

1. Navigate to your Resource Group in the Azure portal.
1. Select the resources to be deleted by selecting the adjacent check box.
1. Select **Delete** from the top menu near the right edge.
1. Type *yes* in the **Deleted Resources** dialog box.
1. Select **Delete**.

To delete the resource group:

1. Navigate to your Resource Group in the Azure portal.
1. Select the **Delete resource group** from the top menu bar near the left edge.
1. Confirm the deletion request by entering the resource group name and selecting **Delete**.
