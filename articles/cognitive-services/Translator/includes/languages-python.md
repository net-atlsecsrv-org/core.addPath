[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](prerequisites-python.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Set up and use environment variables](setup-env-variables.md)]

## Create a project and import required modules

Create a new Python project using your favorite IDE or editor. Then copy this code snippet into your project in a file named `get-languages.py`.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os, requests, uuid, json
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used these modules you'll need to install them before running your program. To install these packages, run: `pip install requests uuid`.

The first comment tells your Python interpreter to use UTF-8 encoding. Then required modules are imported to read your subscription key from an environment variable, construct the http request, create a unique identifier, and handle the JSON response returned by the Translator.

## Set the endpoint and path

This sample will try to read your Translator endpoint from an environment variable: `TRANSLATOR_TEXT_ENDPOINT`. If you're not familiar with environment variables, you can set `endpoint` as a string and comment out the conditional statement.

```python
endpoint_var_name = 'TRANSLATOR_TEXT_ENDPOINT'
if not endpoint_var_name in os.environ:
    raise Exception('Please set/export the environment variable: {}'.format(endpoint_var_name))
endpoint = os.environ[endpoint_var_name]
```

The Translator global endpoint is set as the `endpoint`. `path` sets the `languages` route and identifies that we want to hit version 3 of the API.

>[!NOTE]
> For more information about endpoints, routes, and request parameters, see [Translator 3.0: Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-languages).

```python
path = '/languages?api-version=3.0'
constructed_url = endpoint + path
```

## Add headers

The request to get supported languages doesn't require authentication. Set the `Content-type` as `application/json` and add `X-ClientTraceId` to uniquely identify your request.

Copy this code snippet into your project:

```python
headers = {
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'X-ClientTraceId': str(uuid.uuid4())
}
```

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Create a request to get a list of supported languages

Let's create a GET request using the `requests` module. It takes two arguments: the concatenated URL, and the request headers:

```python
request = requests.get(constructed_url, headers=headers)
response = request.json()
```

## Print the response

The last step is to print the results. This code snippet prettifies the results by sorting the keys, setting indentation, and declaring item and key separators.

```python
print(json.dumps(response, sort_keys=True, indent=4,
                 ensure_ascii=False, separators=(',', ': ')))
```

## Put it all together

That's it, you've put together a simple program that will call the Translator and return a JSON response. Now it's time to run your program:

```console
python get-languages.py
```

If you'd like to compare your code against ours, the complete sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/Text-Translation-API-V3-Python).

## Sample response

Find the country/region abbreviation in this [list of languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/language-support).

## Clean up resources

If you've hardcoded your subscription key into your program, make sure to remove the subscription key when you're finished with this quickstart.

## Next steps

Take a look at the API reference to understand everything you can do with the Translator.
