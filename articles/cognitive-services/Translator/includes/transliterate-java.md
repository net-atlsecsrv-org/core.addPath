## Initialize a project with Gradle

Let's start by creating a working directory for this project. From the command line (or terminal), run this command:

```console
mkdir transliterate-sample
cd transliterate-sample
```

Next, you're going to initialize a Gradle project. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, most importantly, the `build.gradle.kts`, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application. Run this command from your working directory:

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

## Configure the build file

Locate `build.gradle.kts` and open it with your favorite IDE or text editor. Then copy in this build configuration:

```
plugins {
    java
    application
}
application {
    mainClassName = "Transliterate"
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    compile("com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.5.0")
    compile("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5")
}
```

Take note that this sample has dependencies on OkHttp for HTTP requests, and Gson to handle and parse JSON. If you'd like to learn more about build configurations, see [Creating New Gradle Builds](https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/).

## Create a Java file

Let's create a folder for your sample app. From your working directory, run:

```console
mkdir -p src\main\java
```

Next, in this folder, create a file named `Transliterate.java`.

## Import required libraries

Open `Transliterate.java` and add these import statements:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;
import com.google.gson.*;
import com.squareup.okhttp.*;
```


## Define variables

First, you'll need to create a public class for your project:

```java
public class Transliterate {
  // All project code goes here...
}
```

Add these lines to the `Transliterate` class. First, the subscription key and endpoint are being read from environment variables. Then, you'll notice that along with the `api-version`, two additional parameters have been appended to the `url`. These parameters are used to set the input language, and the scripts for transliteration. In this sample, it's set to Japanese (`jpan`) and Latin (`latn`). 

```java
private static String subscriptionKey = System.getenv("TRANSLATOR_TEXT_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY");
private static String endpoint = System.getenv("TRANSLATOR_TEXT_ENDPOINT");
String url = endpoint + "/transliterate?api-version=3.0&language=ja&fromScript=jpan&toScript=latn";
```
If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Create a client and build a request

Add this line to the `Transliterate` class to instantiate the `OkHttpClient`:

```java
// Instantiates the OkHttpClient.
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
```

Next, let's build the POST request. Feel free to change the text for transliteration.

```java
// This function performs a POST request.
public String Post() throws IOException {
    MediaType mediaType = MediaType.parse("application/json");
    RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(mediaType,
            "[{\n\t\"Text\": \"こんにちは\"\n}]");
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
            .url(url).post(body)
            .addHeader("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey)
            .addHeader("Content-type", "application/json").build();
    Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
    return response.body().string();
}
```

## Create a function to parse the response

This simple function parses and prettifies the JSON response from the Translator service.

```java
// This function prettifies the json response.
public static String prettify(String json_text) {
    JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
    JsonElement json = parser.parse(json_text);
    Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
    return gson.toJson(json);
}
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to make a request and get a response. Add these lines to your project:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        Transliterate transliterateRequest = new Transliterate();
        String response = transliterateRequest.Post();
        System.out.println(prettify(response));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

## Run the sample app

That's it, you're ready to run your sample app. From the command line (or terminal session), navigate to the root of your working directory and run:

```console
gradle build
```

When the build completes, run:

```console
gradle run
```

## Sample response

```json
[
  {
    "text": "konnichiwa",
    "script": "latn"
  }
]
```

## Next steps

Take a look at the API reference to understand everything you can do with the Translator.
