[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](prerequisites-csharp.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Setup and use environment variables](setup-env-variables.md)]

## Create a .NET Core project

Open a new command prompt (or terminal session) and run these commands:

```console
dotnet new console -o alternate-sample
cd alternate-sample
```

The first command does two things. It creates a new .NET console application, and creates a directory named `alternate-sample`. The second command changes to the directory for your project.

Next, you'll need to install Json.Net. From your project's directory, run:

```console
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 11.0.2
```

## Add required namespaces to your project

The `dotnet new console` command that you ran earlier created a project, including `Program.cs`. This file is where you'll put your application code. Open `Program.cs`, and replace the existing using statements. These statements ensure that you have access to all the types required to build and run the sample app.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
```

## Get subscription information from environment variables

Add the following lines to the `Program` class. These lines read your subscription key and endpoint from environment variables, and throws an error if you run into any issues.

```csharp
private const string key_var = "TRANSLATOR_TEXT_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY";
private static readonly string subscriptionKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(key_var);

private const string endpoint_var = "TRANSLATOR_TEXT_ENDPOINT";
private static readonly string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(endpoint_var);

static Program()
{
    if (null == subscriptionKey)
    {
        throw new Exception("Please set/export the environment variable: " + key_var);
    }
    if (null == endpoint)
    {
        throw new Exception("Please set/export the environment variable: " + endpoint_var);
    }
}
// The code in the next section goes here.
```

## Create a function to get alternate translations

Within the `Program` class, create a function called `AltTranslation`. This class encapsulates the code used to call the Dictionary resource and prints the result to console.

```csharp
static void AltTranslation()
{
  /*
   * The code for your call to the translation service will be added to this
   * function in the next few sections.
   */
}
```

## Construct the URI

Add these lines to the `AltTranslation` function. You'll notice that along with the `api-version`, two additional parameters have been declared. These parameters are used to set the translation input and output. In this sample, these are English (`en`) and Spanish (`es`).

```csharp
string route = "/dictionary/lookup?api-version=3.0";
static string params_ = "from=en&to=es";
static string uri = endpoint + path + params_;
```

Next, we need to create and serialize the JSON object that includes the text you want to translate. Keep in mind, you can pass more than one object in the `body` array.

```csharp
System.Object[] body = new System.Object[] { new { Text = @"Elephants" } };
var requestBody = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body);
```

## Instantiate the client and make a request

These lines instantiate the `HttpClient` and the `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
using (var client = new HttpClient())
using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage())
{
  // In the next few sections you'll add code to construct the request.
}
```

## Construct the request and print the response

Inside the `HttpRequestMessage` you'll:

* Declare the HTTP method
* Construct the request URI
* Insert the request body (serialized JSON object)
* Add required headers
* Make an asynchronous request
* Print the response

Add this code to the `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
// Set the method to POST
request.Method = HttpMethod.Post;

// Construct the full URI
request.RequestUri = new Uri(uri);

// Add the serialized JSON object to your request
request.Content = new StringContent(requestBody, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

// Add the authorization header
request.Headers.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey);

// Send request, get response
var response = client.SendAsync(request).Result;
var jsonResponse = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;

// Print the response
Console.WriteLine(PrettyPrint(jsonResponse));
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue.");
```

Add `PrettyPrint` to add formatting to your JSON response:
```csharp
static string PrettyPrint(string s)
{
    return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(s), Formatting.Indented);
}
```

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Put it all together

The last step is to call `AltTranslation()` in the `Main` function. Locate `static void Main(string[] args)` and add these lines:

```csharp
AltTranslation();
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue.");
Console.ReadKey();
```

## Run the sample app

That's it, you're ready to run your sample app. From the command line (or terminal session), navigate to your project directory and run:

```console
dotnet run
```

## Sample response

```json
[
    {
        "displaySource": "elephants",
        "normalizedSource": "elephants",
        "translations": [
            {
                "backTranslations": [
                    {
                        "displayText": "elephants",
                        "frequencyCount": 1207,
                        "normalizedText": "elephants",
                        "numExamples": 5
                    }
                ],
                "confidence": 1.0,
                "displayTarget": "elefantes",
                "normalizedTarget": "elefantes",
                "posTag": "NOUN",
                "prefixWord": ""
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## Clean up resources

Make sure to remove any confidential information from your sample app's source code, like subscription keys.

## Next steps

Take a look at the API reference to understand everything you can do with the Translator Text API.
