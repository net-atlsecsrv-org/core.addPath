# How to prevent translation of content with the Translator Text API

The Translator Text API allows you to tag content so that it isn't translated. For example, you may want to tag code, a brand name, or a word/phrase that doesn't make sense when localized.

## Methods for preventing translation
1. Escape to a Twitter tag @somethingtopassthrough or #somethingtopassthrough. Un-escape after translation.

2. Tag your content with `notranslate`.

   Example:

   ```html
   <div class="notranslate">This will not be translated.</div>
   <div>This will be translated. </div>
   ```

3. Use the [dynamic dictionary](dynamic-dictionary.md) to prescribe a specific translation.

4. Don't pass the string to the Translator Text API for translation.

5. Custom Translator: Use a [dictionary in Custom Translator](custom-translator/what-is-dictionary.md) to prescribe the translation of a phrase with 100% probability.
