# Upload a document

In [Custom Translator](https://portal.customtranslator.azure.ai), you can upload parallel documents to train your translation models. [Parallel documents](what-are-parallel-documents.md) are pairs of documents where one is a translation of the other. One document in the pair contains sentences in the source language and the other document contains these sentences translated into the target language.

Before uploading your documents, review the [document formats and naming convention guidance](document-formats-naming-convention.md) to make sure your file format is supported in Custom Translator.

## How to upload document?

From [Custom Translator](https://portal.customtranslator.azure.ai) portal, click on “Documents” tab to go to documents page.
