# How to translate behind IP firewalls with the Translator Text API

Translator Text API can translate behind firewalls using either domain-name or IP filtering. Domain-name filtering is the preferred method. We **do not recommend** running Microsoft Translator from behind an IP filtered firewall. The setup is likely to break in the future without notice.

## Translator IP Addresses
The IP addresses for api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com - Microsoft Translator Text API as of November 20, 2018:
