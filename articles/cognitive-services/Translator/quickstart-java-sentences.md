# Quickstart: Use the Translator Text API to determine sentence length using Java

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to determine sentence lengths using Java and the Translator Text API.

This quickstart requires an [Azure Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with a Translator Text resource. If you don't have an account, you can use the [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) to get a subscription key.

## Prerequisites

* [JDK 7 or later](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
* An Azure subscription key for Translator Text

## Initialize a project with Gradle

Let's start by creating a working directory for this project. From the command line (or terminal), run this command:

```console
mkdir length-sentence-sample
cd length-sentence-sample
```

Next, you're going to initialize a Gradle project. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, most importantly, the `build.gradle.kts`, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application. Run this command from your working directory:

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

## Configure the build file

Locate `build.gradle.kts` and open it with your favorite IDE or text editor. Then copy in this build configuration:

```
plugins {
    java
    application
}
application {
    mainClassName = "LengthSentence"
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    compile("com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.5.0")
    compile("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5")
}
```

Take note that this sample has dependencies on OkHttp for HTTP requests, and Gson to handle and parse JSON. If you'd like to learn more about build configurations, see [Creating New Gradle Builds](https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/).

## Create a Java file

Let's create a folder for your sample app. From your working directory, run:

```console
mkdir -p src/main/java
```

Next, in this folder, create a file named `LengthSentence.java`.

## Import required libraries

Open `LengthSentence.java` and add these import statements:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;
import com.google.gson.*;
import com.squareup.okhttp.*;
```


## Define variables

First, you'll need to create a public class for your project:

```java
public class LengthSentence {
  // All project code goes here...
}
```

Add these lines to the `LengthSentence` class. You'll notice that along with the `api-version`, you can define the input language. In this sample it's English.

```java
String subscriptionKey = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY";
String url = "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/breaksentence?api-version=3.0&language=en";
```
If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication). 

## Create a client and build a request

Add this line to the `LengthSentence` class to instantiate the `OkHttpClient`:

```java
// Instantiates the OkHttpClient.
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
```

Next, let's build the POST request. Feel free to change the text. The text must be escaped.

```java
// This function performs a POST request.
public String Post() throws IOException {
    MediaType mediaType = MediaType.parse("application/json");
    RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(mediaType,
            "[{\n\t\"Text\": \"How are you? I am fine. What did you do today?\"\n}]");
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
            .url(url).post(body)
            .addHeader("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey)
            .addHeader("Content-type", "application/json").build();
    Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
    return response.body().string();
}
```

## Create a function to parse the response

This simple function parses and prettifies the JSON response from the Translator Text service.

```java
// This function prettifies the json response.
public static String prettify(String json_text) {
    JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
    JsonElement json = parser.parse(json_text);
    Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
    return gson.toJson(json);
}
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to make a request and get a response. Add these lines to your project:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        LengthSentence lengthSentenceRequest = new LengthSentence();
        String response = lengthSentenceRequest.Post();
        System.out.println(prettify(response));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

## Run the sample app

That's it, you're ready to run your sample app. From the command line (or terminal session), navigate to the root of your working directory and run:

```console
gradle build
```

When the build completes, run:

```console
gradle run
```

## Sample response

A successful response is returned in JSON as shown in the following example:

```json
[
  {
    "detectedLanguage": {
      "language": "en",
      "score": 1.0
    },
    "sentLen": [
      13,
      11,
      22
    ]
  }
]
```
