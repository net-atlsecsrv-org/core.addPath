# Quickstart: Use the Translator Text API to get a list of supported languages using Python

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to make a GET request that returns a list of supported languages using Python and the Translator Text REST API.

>[!TIP]
> If you'd like to see all the code at once, the source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/Text-Translation-API-V3-Python).

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

* Python 2.7.x or 3.x

## Create a project and import required modules

Create a new Python project using your favorite IDE or editor. Then copy this code snippet into your project in a file named `get-languages.py`.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os
import requests
import uuid
import json
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used these modules you'll need to install them before running your program. To install these packages, run: `pip install requests uuid`.

The first comment tells your Python interpreter to use UTF-8 encoding. Then required modules are imported to read your subscription key from an environment variable, construct the http request, create a unique identifier, and handle the JSON response returned by the Translator Text API.

## Set the base url, and path

The Translator Text global endpoint is set as the `base_url`. `path` sets the `languages` route and identifies that we want to hit version 3 of the API.

>[!NOTE]
> For more information about endpoints, routes, and request parameters, see [Translator Text API 3.0: Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-languages).

```python
base_url = 'https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com'
path = '/languages?api-version=3.0'
constructed_url = base_url + path
```

## Add headers

The request to get supported languages doesn't require authentication. Set the `Content-type` as `application/json` and add `X-ClientTraceId` to uniquely identify your request.

Copy this code snippet into your project:

```python
headers = {
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'X-ClientTraceId': str(uuid.uuid4())
}
```

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Create a request to get a list of supported languages

Let's create a GET request using the `requests` module. It takes two arguments: the concatenated URL, and the request headers:

```python
request = requests.get(constructed_url, headers=headers)
response = request.json()
```

## Print the response

The last step is to print the results. This code snippet prettifies the results by sorting the keys, setting indentation, and declaring item and key separators.

```python
print(json.dumps(response, sort_keys=True, indent=4,
                 ensure_ascii=False, separators=(',', ': ')))
```

## Put it all together

That's it, you've put together a simple program that will call the Translator Text API and return a JSON response. Now it's time to run your program:

```console
python get-languages.py
```

If you'd like to compare your code against ours, the complete sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/Text-Translation-API-V3-Python).

## Sample response

Find the country/region abbreviation in this [list of languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/language-support).
