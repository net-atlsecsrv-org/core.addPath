# Quickstart: Use the Translator Text API to detect text language using C#

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to detect the language of provided text using .NET Core, C# 7.1 or later, and the Translator Text REST API.

This quickstart requires an [Azure Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with a Translator Text resource. If you don't have an account, you can use the [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) to get a subscription key.

## Prerequisites

* C# 7.1 or later
* [.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial)
* [Json.NET NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/)
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or your favorite text editor
* An Azure subscription key for Translator Text

## Create a .NET Core project

Open a new command prompt (or terminal session) and run these commands:

```console
dotnet new console -o detect-sample
cd detect-sample
```

The first command does two things. It creates a new .NET console application, and creates a directory named `detect-sample`. The second command changes to the directory for your project.

Next, you'll need to install Json.Net. From your project's directory, run:

```console
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 11.0.2
```

## Select the C# language version

This quickstart requires C# 7.1 or later. There are a few ways to change the C# version for your project. In this guide, we'll show you how to adjust the `detect-sample.csproj` file. For all available options, such as changing the language in Visual Studio, see [Select the C# language version](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version).

Open your project, then open `detect-sample.csproj`. Make sure that `LangVersion` is set to 7.1 or later. If there isn't a property group for the language version, add these lines:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
   <LangVersion>7.1</LangVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Add required namespaces to your project

The `dotnet new console` command that you ran earlier created a project, including `Program.cs`. This file is where you'll put your application code. Open `Program.cs`, and replace the existing using statements. These statements ensure that you have access to all the types required to build and run the sample app.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
// Install Newtonsoft.Json with NuGet
using Newtonsoft.Json;
```

## Create classes for the JSON response

Next, we're going to create a class that's used when deserializing the JSON response returned by the Translator Text API.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The C# classes that represents the JSON returned by the Translator Text API.
/// </summary>
public class DetectResult
{
    public string Language { get; set; }
    public float Score { get; set; }
    public bool IsTranslationSupported { get; set; }
    public bool IsTransliterationSupported { get; set; }
    public AltTranslations[] Alternatives { get; set; }
}
public class AltTranslations
{
    public string Language { get; set; }
    public float Score { get; set; }
    public bool IsTranslationSupported { get; set; }
    public bool IsTransliterationSupported { get; set; }
}
```

## Create a function to detect the source text's language

Within the `Program` class, create a function called `DetectTextRequest()`. This class encapsulates the code used to call the Detect resource and prints the result to console.

```csharp
static public async Task DetectTextRequest(string subscriptionKey, string host, string route, string inputText)
{
  /*
   * The code for your call to the translation service will be added to this
   * function in the next few sections.
   */
}
```

## Serialize the detect request

Next, we need to create and serialize the JSON object that includes the text that will undergo language detection.

```csharp
System.Object[] body = new System.Object[] { new { Text = inputText } };
var requestBody = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body);
```

## Instantiate the client and make a request

These lines instantiate the `HttpClient` and the `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
using (var client = new HttpClient())
using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage())
{
  // In the next few sections you'll add code to construct the request.
}
```

## Construct the request and print the response

Inside the `HttpRequestMessage` you'll:

* Declare the HTTP method
* Construct the request URI
* Insert the request body (serialized JSON object)
* Add required headers
* Make an asynchronous request
* Print the response

Add this code to the `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
// Build the request.
request.Method = HttpMethod.Post;
// Construct the URI and add headers.
request.RequestUri = new Uri(host + route);
request.Content = new StringContent(requestBody, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
request.Headers.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey);

// Send the request and get response.
HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(request).ConfigureAwait(false);
// Read response as a string.
string result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
// Deserialize the response using the classes created earlier.
DetectResult[] deserializedOutput = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<DetectResult[]>(result);
// Iterate over the deserialized response.
foreach (DetectResult o in deserializedOutput)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The detected language is '{0}'. Confidence is: {1}.\nTranslation supported: {2}.\nTransliteration supported: {3}.\n",
        o.Language, o.Score, o.IsTranslationSupported, o.IsTransliterationSupported);
    // Create a counter
    int counter = 0;
    // Iterate over alternate translations.
    foreach (AltTranslations a in o.Alternatives)
    {
        counter++;
        Console.WriteLine("Alternative {0}", counter);
        Console.WriteLine("The detected language is '{0}'. Confidence is: {1}.\nTranslation supported: {2}.\nTransliteration supported: {3}.\n",
            a.Language, a.Score, a.IsTranslationSupported, a.IsTransliterationSupported);
    }
}
```

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication). 

## Put it all together

The last step is to call `DetectTextRequest()` in the `Main` function. Locate `static void Main(string[] args)` and replace it with this code:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    // This is our main function.
    // Output languages are defined in the route.
    // For a complete list of options, see API reference.
    string subscriptionKey = "YOUR_TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY_GOES_HERE";
    string host = "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com";
    string route = "/detect?api-version=3.0";
    string breakSentenceText = @"How are you doing today? The weather is pretty pleasant. Have you been to the movies lately?";
    await DetectTextRequest(subscriptionKey, host, route, breakSentenceText);
}
```
## Run the sample app

That's it, you're ready to run your sample app. From the command line (or terminal session), navigate to your project directory and run:

```console
dotnet run
```

## Sample response

After you run the sample, you should see the following printed to terminal:

> [!NOTE]
> Find the country/region abbreviation in this [list of languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/language-support).

```bash
The detected language is 'en'. Confidence is: 1.
Translation supported: True.
Transliteration supported: False.

Alternative 1
The detected language is 'fil'. Confidence is: 0.82.
Translation supported: True.
Transliteration supported: False.

Alternative 2
The detected language is 'ro'. Confidence is: 1.
Translation supported: True.
Transliteration supported: False.
```

This message is built from the raw JSON, which will look like this:

```json
[  
    {  
        "language":"en",
        "score":1.0,
        "isTranslationSupported":true,
        "isTransliterationSupported":false,
        "alternatives":[  
            {  
                "language":"fil",
                "score":0.82,
                "isTranslationSupported":true,
                "isTransliterationSupported":false
            },
            {  
                "language":"ro",
                "score":1.0,
                "isTranslationSupported":true,
                "isTransliterationSupported":false
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## Clean up resources

Make sure to remove any confidential information from your sample app's source code, like subscription keys.
