# Quickstart: Create your first Bing Custom Search instance

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).

To use Bing Custom Search, you need to create a custom search instance that defines your view or slice of the web. This instance contains the public domains, websites, and webpages that you want to search, along with any ranking adjustments you may want. 

To create the instance, use the [Bing Custom Search portal](https://customsearch.ai).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-custom-search-prerequisites](../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-custom-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create a custom search instance

To create a Bing Custom Search instance:

1. Click **Get Started** on the [Bing Custom Search portal](https://customsearch.ai) webpage, and sign in with your Microsoft account.

2. Click **New Instance**, and enter a descriptive name. You can change the name of your instance at any time.
 
3. On the **Active** tab under **Search Experience**, enter the URL of one or more websites you want to include in your search. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Bing Custom Search instances will only return results for domains, and webpages that are public and have been indexed by Bing.

4. You can use the right side of the Bing Custom Search portal to enter a query and examine the search results returned by your search instance. If no results are returned, try entering a different URL.  

5. Click **Publish** to publish your changes to the production environment, and update the instance's endpoints.

6.  Click on the **Production** tab under **Endpoints**, and copy your **Custom Configuration ID**. You need this ID to call the Custom Search API by appending it to the `customconfig=` query parameter in your calls.
