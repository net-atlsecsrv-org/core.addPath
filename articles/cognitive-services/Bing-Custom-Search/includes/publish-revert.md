## Publish or revert
Changes you make to a Custom Search instance are made in the **Configuration** tab so you can validate your changes. When you're done making changes and are ready to publish, click **Publish**. Changes are not reflected against your production endpoints until you publish.

Before publishing, if you decide that you don't want to keep the changes you've made, click **Revert**. When you revert your changes, the live state configuration is unchanged and the **Configuration** tab is reverted to match the live state.
