# What is the Bing News Search API?

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmove).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmigration).

The Bing News Search API makes it easy to integrate Bing's cognitive news searching capabilities into your applications. The API provides a similar experience to [Bing News](https://www.bing.com/news), letting you send search queries and receive relevant news articles.

Be aware that the Bing News Search API provides news search results only. Use the [Bing Web Search API](../bing-web-search/overview.md), [Video Search API](../bing-video-search/overview.md) and [Image Search API](../bing-image-search/overview.md) for other types of web content.

## Bing News Search API features

While the Bing News Search API primarily finds and returns relevant news articles, it provides several features for intelligent, and focused news retrieval on the web.

|Feature  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[Suggesting and using search terms](concepts/search-for-news.md#suggest-and-use-search-terms)     | Improve your search experience by using the [Bing Autosuggest API](../bing-autosuggest/get-suggested-search-terms.md) to display suggested search terms as they're typed.         |
|[Get general news](concepts/search-for-news.md#get-general-news)     | Find news by sending a search query to the Bing News Search API, and getting back a list of relevant news articles.           |
|[Today's top news](concepts/search-for-news.md#get-todays-top-news)      | Get the top news stories for the day, across all categories.       |
|[News by category](concepts/search-for-news.md)     | Search for news in specific categories.        | 
|[Headline news](concepts/search-for-news.md)     | Search for top headlines across all categories.         |

## Workflow

The Bing News Search API is a RESTful web service, making it easy to call from any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. You can use the service using either the REST API, or the SDK.

1. Create a [Cognitive Services API account](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) with access to the Bing Search APIs. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) for free.
2. Send a request to the API, with a valid search query.
3. Process the API response by parsing the returned JSON message.

## Next steps

First, try the [interactive demo](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/bing-news-search-api/) for the Bing News Search API. This demo shows how you can quickly customize a search query and find news on the web.

To quickly get started with your first API request, try a quickstart for the [REST API](./csharp.md) or one of the [SDKs](./quickstarts/client-libraries.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp).
