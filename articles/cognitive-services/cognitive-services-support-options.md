# Azure Cognitive Services support and feedback options

Are you just starting to explore the functionality of Azure Cognitive Services? Perhaps you are implementing a new feature in your application. Or after using the service, do you have suggestions on how to improve it? Here are options for where you can get support, stay up-to-date, give feedback, and report bugs for Cognitive Services.

## Get support

### Create an Azure support request

<div class='icon is-large'>
    <img alt='Azure support' src='https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo_azure.svg'>
</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

* [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview)
* [Azure portal for the United States government](https://portal.azure.us)

### Search

<div class='icon is-large'>
    <img alt='Search' src='https://docs.microsoft.com/media/common/i_search.svg'>
</div>

For faster results, perform a search to relevant sites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/), or [GitHub code samples](https://github.com/azure-samples). Use the `site:` query notation in your [favorite search engine](https://bing.com), for example:

```
{search keywords} site:stackoverflow.com
```

Where `{search keywords}` is the context of your search. Consider using these scoped searches appropriately:

 - Stack Overflow: `site:stackoverflow.com`
 - Microsoft Docs: `site:docs.microsoft.com`
 - GitHub Samples: `site:github.com/azure-samples`

### Post a question on Stack Overflow

<div class='icon is-large'>
    <img alt='Stack Overflow' src='https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo_stackoverflow.svg'>
</div>

If you can't find an answer to your problem with the search box on Stack Overflow, submit a new question. Stack Overflow is the preferred channel for development-related questions. It's where members of the Stack Overflow community and Microsoft team members are directly involved in helping you solve your problems.

Post a question [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2126464). Use the appropriate tag for your question, so we are sure to see the question.

> [!TIP]
> The following posts from Stack Overflow contain tips on how to form questions and add source code. Following these guidelines might help increase the chances that community members assess and respond to your question quickly:
> * [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
> * [How to create a minimal, reproducible example?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)

## Stay informed

Staying informed about features in a new release or news on the Azure blog can help you find the difference between a programming error, a service bug, or a feature not yet available in Cognitive Services.

### Release notes

## Report bugs

### Create a GitHub issue or pull request

<div class='icon is-large'>
    <img alt='GitHub' src='https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo_octokitty.svg'>
</div>

Below are three types of repositories where a developer might post an issue or create a pull request. To create an issue use the *Issues* tab in the respective GitHub repository and select *New issue*. If you want to suggest a correction, submit a pull request by editing a file directly. The pull request will then sit under the *Pull requests* tab until the repository owners can look it over.

#### Cognitive Services Samples

Samples are often found in public repositories as open source. The quickstart samples have their own repository and are referenced in the Microsoft documentation. If you find errors in the code, create an issue or a pull request.

Here is a list of the Cognitive Services quickstart and sample code:

* [Azure Samples - Cognitive Services](https://github.com/Azure-Samples?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=cognitive&type=&language=)
* [Cognitive Services Quickstarts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code)
* [Cognitive Services: Dotnet](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples)
* [Cognitive Services: Go](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples)
* [Cognitive Services: Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-java-sdk-samples)
* [Cognitive Services: Node.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples)
* [Cognitive Services: Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples)

#### Cognitive Services SDK source code

The source code of the SDKs show some of the underpinnings of the SDK for each service. If you have found a bug or want to suggest a correction, file an issue or create a pull request.

Here is a list of the Cognitive Services SDK source code by language:

* [Azure SDK for Dotnet](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices)
