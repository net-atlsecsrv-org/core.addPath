# Language and region support for Bing Spell Check API

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).

These languages are supported by the Bing Spell Check API (only in `spell` mode).

Please note that to work with any other language than `en-US`, the `mkt` should be set and either `Accept-Language` or `setLang` should be set as it has been described in [Spell Check API v7 reference](/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference)
