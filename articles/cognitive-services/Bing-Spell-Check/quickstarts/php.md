# Quickstart: Check spelling with the Bing Spell Check REST API and PHP

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmove).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmigration).

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Spell Check REST API. This simple PHP application sends a request to the API and returns a list of suggested corrections. 

Although this application is written in PHP, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

* [PHP 5.6.x](https://php.net/downloads.php)

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-spell-check-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-spell-check-signup-requirements.md)]


## Get Bing Spell Check REST API results

1. Create a new PHP project in your favorite IDE.
2. Add the code provided below.
3. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. You can use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.
5. Run the program.
    
    ```php
    <?php
    
    // NOTE: Be sure to uncomment the following line in your php.ini file.
    // ;extension=php_openssl.dll
    
    // These properties are used for optional headers (see below).
    // define("CLIENT_ID", "<Client ID from Previous Response Goes Here>");
    // define("CLIENT_IP", "999.999.999.999");
    // define("CLIENT_LOCATION", "+90.0000000000000;long: 00.0000000000000;re:100.000000000000");
    
    $host = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com';
    $path = '/bing/v7.0/spellcheck?';
    $params = 'mkt=en-us&mode=proof';
    
    $input = "Hollo, wrld!";
    
    $data = array (
    	'text' => urlencode ($input)
    );
    
    // NOTE: Replace this example key with a valid subscription key.
    $key = 'ENTER KEY HERE';
    
    // The following headers are optional, but it is recommended
    // that they are treated as required. These headers will assist the service
    // with returning more accurate results.
    //'X-Search-Location' => CLIENT_LOCATION
    //'X-MSEdge-ClientID' => CLIENT_ID
    //'X-MSEdge-ClientIP' => CLIENT_IP
    
    $headers = "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n" .
    	"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $key\r\n";
    
    // NOTE: Use the key 'http' even if you are making an HTTPS request. See:
    // https://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-context-create.php
    $options = array (
        'http' => array (
            'header' => $headers,
            'method' => 'POST',
            'content' => http_build_query ($data)
        )
    );
    $context  = stream_context_create ($options);
    $result = file_get_contents ($host . $path . $params, false, $context);
    
    if ($result === FALSE) {
    	/* Handle error */
    }
    
    $json = json_encode(json_decode($result), JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE | JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
    echo $json;
    ?>
    ```


## Run the application

Run your application by starting a web server and navigating to your file.

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json

   "flaggedTokens": [
      {
         "offset": 0,
         "token": "Hollo",
         "type": "UnknownToken",
         "suggestions": [
            {

            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "offset": 7,
         "token": "wrld",
         "type": "UnknownToken",
         "suggestions": [
            {
