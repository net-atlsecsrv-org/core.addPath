# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data by using the REST API with Python

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Form Recognizer REST API with Python to train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites
To complete this quickstart, you must have:
- Access to the Form Recognizer limited-access preview. To get access to the preview, fill out and submit the [Form Recognizer access request](https://aka.ms/FormRecognizerRequestAccess) form.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (if you want to run the sample locally).
- A set of at least five forms of the same type. You will use this data to train the model. You can use a [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) for this quickstart. Upload the data to the root of an Azure Blob Storage account.

## Create a Form Recognizer resource

[!INCLUDE [create resource](../includes/create-resource.md)]

## Train a Form Recognizer model

First, you'll need a set of training data in an Azure Storage blob container. You should have a minimum of five sample forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure as your main input data. Or, you can use a single empty form with two filled-in forms. The empty form's file name needs to include the word "empty."

To train a Form Recognizer model by using the documents in your Azure blob container, call the **Train** API by running the python code that follows. Before you run the code, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint URL for the Form Recognizer resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys.
1. Replace `<SAS URL>` with the Azure Blob storage container's shared access signature (SAS) URL. To retrieve this, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Click the next dialog and copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.
1. Replace `<Subscription key>` with the subscription key you copied from the previous step.
    ```python
    ########### Python Form Recognizer Train #############
    from requests import post as http_post

    # Endpoint URL
    base_url = r"<Endpoint>" + "/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom"
    source = r"<SAS URL>"
    headers = {
        # Request headers
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<Subscription Key>',
    }
    url = base_url + "/train" 
    body = {"source": source}
    try:
        resp = http_post(url = url, json = body, headers = headers)
        print("Response status code: %d" % resp.status_code)
        print("Response body: %s" % resp.json())
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
    ```
1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, *form-recognize-train.py*.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognize-train.py`.

You'll receive a `200 (Success)` response with this JSON output:

```json
{
  "modelId": "59e2185e-ab80-4640-aebc-f3653442617b",
  "trainingDocuments": [
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_1.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_2.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_3.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_4.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_5.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

Note the `"modelId"` value. You'll need it for the following steps.
  
## Extract key-value pairs and tables from forms

Next, you'll analyze a document and extract key-value pairs and tables from it. Call the **Model - Analyze** API by running the Python script that follows. Before you run the command, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained with your Form Recognizer subscription key. You can find it on your Form Recognizer resource **Overview** tab.
1. Replace `<path to your form>` with the file path of your form (for example, C:\temp\file.pdf).
1. Replace `<modelID>` with the model ID you received in the previous section.
1. Replace `<file type>` with the file type. Supported types: `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with your subscription key.

    ```python
    ########### Python Form Recognizer Analyze #############
    from requests import post as http_post
    
    # Endpoint URL
    base_url = r"<Endpoint>" + "/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom"
    file_path = r"<path to your form>"
    model_id = "<modelID>"
    headers = {
        # Request headers
        'Content-Type': '<file type>',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<subscription key>',
    }

    try:
        url = base_url + "/models/" + model_id + "/analyze" 
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            data_bytes = f.read()  
        resp = http_post(url = url, data = data_bytes, headers = headers)
        print("Response status code: %d" % resp.status_code)    
        print("Response body:\n%s" % resp.json())   
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
    ```

1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, *form-recognize-analyze.py*.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognize-analyze.py`.

### Examine the response

A success response is returned in JSON. It represents the key-value pairs and tables extracted from the form:
