# Quickstart: Use the Form Recognizer client library

Get started with the Form Recognizer client library. Form Recognizer is a Cognitive Service that uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key/value pairs and table data from form documents. It then outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file. Follow these steps to install the SDK package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

Use the Form Recognizer client library to:

* [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content)
* [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)
