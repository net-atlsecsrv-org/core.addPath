> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The code in this article uses synchronous methods and un-secured credentials storage for simplicity reasons. See the reference documentation below. 

[Reference documentation](../../index.yml) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-form-recognizer) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* An Azure Storage blob that contains a set of training data. See [Build a training data set for a custom model](../../build-training-data-set.md) for tips and options for putting together your training data set. For this quickstart, you can use the files under the **Train** folder of the [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) (download and extract *sample_data.zip*).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer"  title="Create a Form Recognizer resource"  target="_blank">create a Form Recognizer resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the `ai-form-recognizer` NPM package:

```console
npm install @azure/ai-form-recognizer
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

Create a file named `index.js`, open it, and import the following libraries:

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_imports)]


> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key. 

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_creds)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the [Product name] resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. See the Cognitive Services [security](../../../cognitive-services-security.md) article for more information.

## Object model 

With Form Recognizer, you can create two different client types. The first, `FormRecognizerClient` is used to query the service to recognized form fields and content. The second, `FormTrainingClient` is use to create and manage custom models that you can use to improve recognition. 

### FormRecognizerClient
`FormRecognizerClient` provides operations for:

 * Recognizing form fields and content using custom models trained to recognize your custom forms. These values are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects.
 * Recognizing form content, including tables, lines and words, without the need to train a model. Form content is returned in a collection of `FormPage` objects.
 * Recognizing common fields from receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model on the Form Recognizer service. These fields and meta-data are returned in a collection of `RecognizedReceipt`.

### FormTrainingClient
`FormTrainingClient` provides operations for:

* Training custom models to recognize all fields and values found in your custom forms. A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the form types the model will recognize, and the fields it will extract for each form type. See the [service's documentation on unlabeled model training](#train-a-model-without-labels) for a more detailed explanation of creating a training data set.
* Training custom models to recognize specific fields and values you specify by labeling your custom forms. A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the fields the model will extract, as well as the estimated accuracy for each field. See the [service's documentation on labeled model training](#train-a-model-with-labels) for a more detailed explanation of applying labels to a training data set.
* Managing models created in your account.
* Copying a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.

> [!NOTE]
> Models can also be trained using a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer Labeling Tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md).


## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Form Recognizer client library for JavaScript:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content)
* [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)

## Authenticate the client



Authenticate a client object using the subscription variables you defined. You'll use an `AzureKeyCredential` object, so that if needed, you can update the API key without creating new client objects. You'll also create a training client object.

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_auth)]


## Get assets for testing

You'll also need to add references to the URLs for your training and testing data.
* To retrieve the SAS URL for your custom model training data, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.
* Use the sample from and receipt images included in the samples below (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/test-assets)) or you can use the above steps to get the SAS URL of an individual document in blob storage. 


## Recognize form content

You can use Form Recognizer to recognize tables, lines, and words in documents, without needing to train a model. To recognize the content of a file at a given URI, use the `beginRecognizeContentFromUrl` method.

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_getcontent)]


> [!TIP]
> You can also get content from a local file. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/javascript/api/@azure/ai-form-recognizer/formrecognizerclient?view=azure-node-latest) methods, such as **beginRecognizeContent**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples) for scenarios involving local images.

### Output

```console
Page 1: width 8.5 and height 11 with unit inch
cell [0,0] has text Invoice Number
cell [0,1] has text Invoice Date
cell [0,2] has text Invoice Due Date
cell [0,3] has text Charges
cell [0,5] has text VAT ID
cell [1,0] has text 34278587
cell [1,1] has text 6/18/2017
cell [1,2] has text 6/24/2017
cell [1,3] has text $56,651.49
cell [1,5] has text PT
```

## Recognize receipts

This section demonstrates how to recognize and extract common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.

To recognize receipts from a URI, use the `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl` method. The following code processes a receipt at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_receipts)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also recognize local receipt images. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/javascript/api/@azure/ai-form-recognizer/formrecognizerclient?view=azure-node-latest) methods, such as **beginRecognizeReceipts**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples) for scenarios involving local images.

### Output

```console
status: notStarted
status: running
status: succeeded
First receipt:
  Receipt Type: 'Itemized', with confidence of 0.659
  Merchant Name: 'Contoso Contoso', with confidence of 0.516
  Transaction Date: 'Sun Jun 09 2019 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)', with confidence of 0.985
    Item Name: '8GB RAM (Black)', with confidence of 0.916
    Item Name: 'SurfacePen', with confidence of 0.858
  Total: '1203.39', with confidence of 0.774
```

## Train a custom model

This section demonstrates how to train a model with your own data. A trained model can output structured data that includes the key/value relationships in the original form document. After you train the model, you can test and retrain it and eventually use it to reliably extract data from more forms according to your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also train models with a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md).

### Train a model without labels

Train custom models to recognize all the fields and values found in your custom forms without manually labeling the training documents.

The following function trains a model on a given set of documents and prints the model's status to the console. 

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_train)]


### Output

This is the output for a model trained with the training data available from the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer).This sample output has been truncated for readability.

```console

...
```

### Train a model with labels

You can also train custom models by manually labeling the training documents. Training with labels leads to better performance in some scenarios. To train with labels, you need to have special label information files (`\<filename\>.pdf.labels.json`) in your blob storage container alongside the training documents. The [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md) provides a UI to help you create these label files. Once you have them, you can call the `beginTraining` method with the `uselabels` parameter set to `true`.

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_trainlabels)]


### Output 

This is the output for a model trained with the training data available from the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples).This sample output has been truncated for readability.

## Analyze forms with a custom model

This section demonstrates how to extract key/value information and other content from your custom form types, using models you trained with your own forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to implement this scenario, you must have already trained a model so you can pass its ID into the method below. See the [Train a model](#train-a-model-without-labels) section.

You'll use the `beginRecognizeCustomFormsFromUrl` method. The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects: one for each page in the submitted document.

[!code-javascript[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/javascript/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.js?name=snippet_analyze)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze local files. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/javascript/api/@azure/ai-form-recognizer/formrecognizerclient?view=azure-node-latest) methods, such as **beginRecognizeCustomForms**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples) for scenarios involving local images.
