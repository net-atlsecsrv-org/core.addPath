> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The Form Recognizer SDK currently targets v2.0 of the From Recognizer service.
> * The code in this article uses synchronous methods and un-secured credentials storage for simplicity reasons. See the reference documentation below. 

[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.formrecognizer-readme-pre) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
* An Azure Storage blob that contains a set of training data. See [Build a training data set for a custom model](../../build-training-data-set.md) for tips and options for putting together your training data set. For this quickstart, you can use the files under the **Train** folder of the [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451).
* The current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer"  title="Create a Form Recognizer resource"  target="_blank">create a Form Recognizer resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Create a new C# application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `formrecognizer-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: _Program.cs_. 

```console
dotnet new console -n formrecognizer-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. Then build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Install the client library

Within the application directory, install the Form Recognizer client library for .NET with the following command:

```console
dotnet add package Azure.AI.FormRecognizer --version 3.0.0
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're using the Visual Studio IDE, the client library is available as a downloadable NuGet package.

From the project directory, open the *Program.cs* file in your preferred editor or IDE. Add the following `using` directives:

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.FormRecognizer;
using Azure.AI.FormRecognizer.Models;
using Azure.AI.FormRecognizer.Training;

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Object model 

With Form Recognizer, you can create two different client types. The first, `FormRecognizerClient` is used to query the service to recognized form fields and content. The second, `FormTrainingClient` is use to create and manage custom models that you can use to improve recognition. 

### FormRecognizerClient

`FormRecognizerClient` provides operations for:

 - Recognizing form fields and content, using custom models trained to recognize your custom forms.  These values are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See example [Analyze custom forms](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model).
 - Recognizing form content, including tables, lines and words, without the need to train a model.  Form content is returned in a collection of `FormPage` objects. See example [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content).
 - Recognizing common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model on the Form Recognizer service.  These fields and meta-data are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See example [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts).

### FormTrainingClient

`FormTrainingClient` provides operations for:

- Training custom models to recognize all fields and values found in your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the form types the model will recognize, and the fields it will extract for each form type.
- Training custom models to recognize specific fields and values you specify by labeling your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the fields the model will extract, as well as the estimated accuracy for each field.
- Managing models created in your account.
- Copying a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.

See examples for [Train a Model](#train-a-custom-model) and [Manage Custom Models](#manage-custom-models).

> [!NOTE]
> Models can also be trained using a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer Labeling Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/label-tool).

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Form Recognizer client library for .NET:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content)
* [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)


## Authenticate the client

Below `Main()`, create a new method named `AuthenticateClient`. You'll use this in future tasks to authenticate your requests to the Form Recognizer service. This method uses the `AzureKeyCredential` object, so that if needed, you can update the API key without creating new client objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get your key and endpoint from the Azure portal. If the Form Recognizer resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview).

```csharp
static private FormRecognizerClient AuthenticateClient(){
    string endpoint = "<replace-with-your-form-recognizer-endpoint-here>";
    string apiKey = "<replace-with-your-form-recognizer-key-here>";
    var credential = new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey);
    var client = new FormRecognizerClient(new Uri(endpoint), credential);
    return client;
}
```

## Get assets for testing 

The code snippets in this guide use remote forms accessed by URLs. If you want to process local form documents instead, see the related methods in the [reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-ai-formrecognizer/azure.ai.formrecognizer) and [samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples).

You'll also need to add references to the URLs for your training and testing data.

* To retrieve the SAS URL for your custom model training data, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.
* Use the sample from and receipt images included in the samples below (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/sample_forms) or you can use the above steps to get the SAS URL of an individual document in blob storage. 

> [!NOTE]
> The code snippets in this guide use remote forms accessed by URLs. If you want to process local form documents instead, see the related methods in the [reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/).

## Recognize form content

You can use Form Recognizer to recognize tables, lines, and words in documents, without needing to train a model. The returned value is a collection of **FormPage** objects: one for each page in the submitted document. 

To recognize the content of a file at a given URI, use the `StartRecognizeContentFromUri` method.

```csharp
static async Task RecognizeContent(){
    var invoiceUri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/tests/sample_forms/forms/Invoice_1.pdf";
    var recognizeClient =  AuthenticateClient();
    FormPageCollection formPages = await recognizeClient
        .StartRecognizeContentFromUri(new Uri(invoiceUri))
        .WaitForCompletionAsync();
    foreach (FormPage page in formPages)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Form Page {page.PageNumber} has {page.Lines.Count} lines.");

        for (int i = 0; i < page.Lines.Count; i++)
        {
            FormLine line = page.Lines[i];
            Console.WriteLine($"    Line {i} has {line.Words.Count} word{(line.Words.Count > 1 ? "s" : "")}, and text: '{line.Text}'.");
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < page.Tables.Count; i++)
        {
            FormTable table = page.Tables[i];
            Console.WriteLine($"Table {i} has {table.RowCount} rows and {table.ColumnCount} columns.");
            foreach (FormTableCell cell in table.Cells)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"    Cell ({cell.RowIndex}, {cell.ColumnIndex}) contains text: '{cell.Text}'.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var analyzeForm = RecognizeContent();
    Task.WaitAll(analyzeForm);
}
```

### Output

```console
Form Page 1 has 18 lines.
    Line 0 has 1 word, and text: 'Contoso'.
    Line 1 has 1 word, and text: 'Address:'.
    Line 2 has 3 words, and text: 'Invoice For: Microsoft'.
    Line 3 has 4 words, and text: '1 Redmond way Suite'.

    Cell (1, 3) contains text: '$56,651.49'.
    Cell (1, 5) contains text: 'PT'.
```

## Recognize receipts

This section demonstrates how to recognize and extract common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.

To recognize receipts from a URI, use the `StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri` method. The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedReceipt` objects: one for each page in the submitted document. The following code processes a receipt at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

```csharp
static async Task RecognizeReceipts(){
    var receiptUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/tests/sample_forms/receipt/contoso-receipt.png";
    var recognizeClient = AuthenticateClient();
    RecognizedFormCollection receipts = await recognizeClient.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUrl)).WaitForCompletionAsync();

    // To see the list of the supported fields returned by service and its corresponding types, consult:
    // https://aka.ms/formrecognizer/receiptfields

    foreach (RecognizedForm receipt in receipts)
    {
        FormField merchantNameField;
        if (receipt.Fields.TryGetValue("MerchantName", out merchantNameField))
        {
            if (merchantNameField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.String)
            {
                string merchantName = merchantNameField.Value.AsString();

                Console.WriteLine($"Merchant Name: '{merchantName}', with confidence {merchantNameField.Confidence}");
            }
        }

        FormField transactionDateField;
        if (receipt.Fields.TryGetValue("TransactionDate", out transactionDateField))
        {
            if (transactionDateField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.Date)
            {
                DateTime transactionDate = transactionDateField.Value.AsDate();

                Console.WriteLine($"Transaction Date: '{transactionDate}', with confidence {transactionDateField.Confidence}");
            }
        }

        FormField itemsField;
        if (receipt.Fields.TryGetValue("Items", out itemsField))
        {
            if (itemsField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.List)
            {
                foreach (FormField itemField in itemsField.Value.AsList())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Item:");

                    if (itemField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.Dictionary)
                    {
                        IReadOnlyDictionary<string, FormField> itemFields = itemField.Value.AsDictionary();

                        FormField itemNameField;
                        if (itemFields.TryGetValue("Name", out itemNameField))
                        {
                            if (itemNameField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.String)
                            {
                                string itemName = itemNameField.Value.AsString();

                                Console.WriteLine($"    Name: '{itemName}', with confidence {itemNameField.Confidence}");
                            }
                        }

                        FormField itemTotalPriceField;
                        if (itemFields.TryGetValue("TotalPrice", out itemTotalPriceField))
                        {
                            if (itemTotalPriceField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.Float)
                            {
                                float itemTotalPrice = itemTotalPriceField.Value.AsFloat();

                                Console.WriteLine($"    Total Price: '{itemTotalPrice}', with confidence {itemTotalPriceField.Confidence}");
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        FormField totalField;
        if (receipt.Fields.TryGetValue("Total", out totalField))
        {
            if (totalField.Value.ValueType == FieldValueType.Float)
            {
                float total = totalField.Value.AsFloat();

                Console.WriteLine($"Total: '{total}', with confidence '{totalField.Confidence}'");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var analyzeReceipts = RecognizeReceipts();
    Task.WaitAll(analyzeReceipts);
}
```

## Train a custom model

This section demonstrates how to train a model with your own data. A trained model can output structured data that includes the key/value relationships in the original form document. After you train the model, you can test and retrain it and eventually use it to reliably extract data from more forms according to your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also train models with a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md).

### Authenticate the training client

Below `AuthenticateClient`, create a new method named `AuthenticateTrainingClient`. You'll use this in future tasks to train custom models. This method uses the `AzureKeyCredential` object (like `AuthenticateClient`), so that if needed, you can update the API key without creating new client objects.

```csharp
static private FormTrainingClient AuthenticateTrainingClient()
{
    string endpoint = "https://formre-ga-sdk-testing.cognitiveservices.azure.com/";
    string apiKey = "<replace-with-your-form-recognizer-key-here>";
    var credential = new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey);
    var trainingClient = new FormTrainingClient(new Uri(endpoint), credential);
    return trainingClient;
}
```

### Train a model without labels

Train custom models to recognize all the fields and values found in your custom forms without manually labeling the training documents. The following method trains a model on a given set of documents and prints the model's status to the console. The returned `CustomFormModel` object contains information on the form types the model can recognize and the fields it can extract from each form type. The following code block prints this information to the console.

```csharp
static async Task TrainCustomModelNoLabels()
{
    var trainingDataUrl = "<SAS-URL-of-your-form-folder-in-blob-storage>";
    var trainingClient = AuthenticateTrainingClient();
    CustomFormModel model = await trainingClient
        .StartTrainingAsync(new Uri(trainingDataUrl), useTrainingLabels: false)
        .WaitForCompletionAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"Custom Model Info:");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Model Id: {model.ModelId}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Model Status: {model.Status}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Training model started on: {model.TrainingStartedOn}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Training model completed on: {model.TrainingCompletedOn}");

    foreach (CustomFormSubmodel submodel in model.Submodels)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Submodel Form Type: {submodel.FormType}");
        foreach (CustomFormModelField field in submodel.Fields.Values)
        {
            Console.Write($"    FieldName: {field.Name}");
            if (field.Label != null)
            {
                Console.Write($", FieldLabel: {field.Label}");
            }
            Console.WriteLine("");
        }
    }
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var trainCustomModel = TrainCustomModelNoLabels();
    Task.WaitAll(trainCustomModel);
}
```

### Train a model with labels

You can also train custom models by manually labeling the training documents. Training with labels leads to better performance in some scenarios. To train with labels, you need to have special label information files (`\<filename\>.pdf.labels.json`) in your blob storage container alongside the training documents. The [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md) provides a UI to help you create these label files. Once you have them, you can call the `StartTrainingAsync` method with the `uselabels` parameter set to `true`. The returned `CustomFormModel` indicates the fields the model can extract, along with its estimated accuracy in each field. The following code block prints this information to the console.

```csharp
static async Task TrainCustomModelWithLabels()
{
    var trainingDataUrl = "<SAS-URL-of-your-form-folder-in-blob-storage>";
    var trainingClient = AuthenticateTrainingClient();

    CustomFormModel model = await trainingClient
        .StartTrainingAsync(new Uri(trainingDataUrl), useTrainingLabels: true)
        .WaitForCompletionAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"Custom Model Info:");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Model Id: {model.ModelId}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Model Status: {model.Status}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Training model started on: {model.TrainingStartedOn}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Training model completed on: {model.TrainingCompletedOn}");

    foreach (CustomFormSubmodel submodel in model.Submodels)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Submodel Form Type: {submodel.FormType}");
        foreach (CustomFormModelField field in submodel.Fields.Values)
        {
            Console.Write($"    FieldName: {field.Name}");
            if (field.Label != null)
            {
                Console.Write($", FieldLabel: {field.Label}");
            }
            Console.WriteLine("");
        }
    }
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var trainCustomModel = TrainCustomModelWithLabels();
    Task.WaitAll(trainCustomModel);
}
```

## Analyze forms with a custom model

This section demonstrates how to extract key/value information and other content from your custom form types, using models you trained with your own forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to implement this scenario, you must have already trained a model so you can pass its ID into the method below.

You'll use the `StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri` method. The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects: one for each page in the submitted document. The following code prints the analysis results to the console. It prints each recognized field and corresponding value, along with a confidence score.

```csharp
static async Task RecognizeContentCustomModel()
{
    // Use the custom model ID returned in the previous example.
    string modelId = "<modelId>";
    var invoiceUri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/tests/sample_forms/forms/Invoice_1.pdf";
    var recognizeClient = AuthenticateClient();

    RecognizedFormCollection forms = await recognizeClient
    .StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri(modelId, new Uri(invoiceUri))
    .WaitForCompletionAsync();
    foreach (RecognizedForm form in forms)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Form of type: {form.FormType}");
        foreach (FormField field in form.Fields.Values)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Field '{field.Name}: ");

            if (field.LabelData != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"    Label: '{field.LabelData.Text}");
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"    Value: '{field.ValueData.Text}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Confidence: '{field.Confidence}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Table data:");
        foreach (FormPage page in form.Pages.Values)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < page.Tables.Count; i++)
            {
                FormTable table = page.Tables[i];
                Console.WriteLine($"Table {i} has {table.RowCount} rows and {table.ColumnCount} columns.");
                foreach (FormTableCell cell in table.Cells)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"    Cell ({cell.RowIndex}, {cell.ColumnIndex}) contains {(cell.IsHeader ? "header" : "text")}: '{cell.Text}'");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var recognizeContentCustomModel = RecognizeContentCustomModel();
    Task.WaitAll(recognizeContentCustomModel);
}
```

## Manage custom models

This section demonstrates how to manage the custom models stored in your account. 

### Check the number of models in the FormRecognizer resource account

The following code block checks how many models you have saved in your Form Recognizer account and compares it to the account limit.

```csharp
static void CheckNumberOfModels()
{
    var trainingClient = AuthenticateTrainingClient();
    AccountProperties accountProperties = trainingClient.GetAccountProperties();
    Console.WriteLine($"Account has {accountProperties.CustomModelCount} models.");
    Console.WriteLine($"It can have at most {accountProperties.CustomModelLimit} models.");
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    CheckNumberOfModels();
}
```

### Output 

```console
Account has 20 models.
It can have at most 5000 models.
```

### List the models currently stored in the resource account

The following code block lists the current models in your account and prints their details to the console.

```csharp
static void ListAllModels()
{
    var trainingClient = AuthenticateTrainingClient();

    Pageable<CustomFormModelInfo> models = trainingClient.GetCustomModels();

    foreach (CustomFormModelInfo modelInfo in models)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Custom Model Info:");
        Console.WriteLine($"    Model Id: {modelInfo.ModelId}");
        Console.WriteLine($"    Model Status: {modelInfo.Status}");
        Console.WriteLine($"    Training model started on: {modelInfo.TrainingStartedOn}");
        Console.WriteLine($"    Training model completed on: {modelInfo.TrainingCompletedOn}");
    }   
}
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    ListAllModels();
}
```

    Training model completed on: 8/24/2020 7:29:36 PM +00:00
```

### Get a specific model using the model's ID

The following code block trains a new model (just like in the [Train a model](#train-a-model-without-labels) section) and then retrieves a second reference to it using its ID.

```csharp
static void GetModelById()
{
    // Use the custom model ID returned in the previous example.
    string modelId = "<modelId>";
    var trainingClient = AuthenticateTrainingClient();
    CustomFormModel modelCopy = trainingClient.GetCustomModel(modelId);

    Console.WriteLine($"Custom Model {modelCopy.ModelId} recognizes the following form types:");

    foreach (CustomFormSubmodel submodel in modelCopy.Submodels)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Submodel Form Type: {submodel.FormType}");
        foreach (CustomFormModelField field in submodel.Fields.Values)
        {
            Console.Write($"    FieldName: {field.Name}");
            if (field.Label != null)
            {
                Console.Write($", FieldLabel: {field.Label}");
            }
            Console.WriteLine("");
        }
    }
}    
```

To run this method, you'll need to call it from `Main`. 

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    GetModelById();
}
```

### Output 

This response has been truncated for readability.

```console

    FieldName: Email
    FieldName: Merchant
    FieldName: PhoneNumber
    FieldName: PurchaseOrderNumber
    FieldName: Quantity
    FieldName: Signature
    FieldName: Subtotal
    FieldName: Tax
    FieldName: Total
    FieldName: VendorName
    FieldName: Website
...
```

### Delete a model from the resource account

You can also delete a model from your account by referencing its ID.

```csharp
static void DeleteModel()
{
    // Use the custom model ID returned in the previous example.
    string modelId = "<modelId>";
    var trainingClient = AuthenticateTrainingClient();
    trainingClient.DeleteModel(modelId);
} 
```

## Run the application

You can run the application at any time with any number of functions you've read about in this quickstart with this command:

```dotnet
dotnet run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

## Troubleshooting

When you interact with the Cognitive Services Form Recognizer client library using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service will result in a `RequestFailedException`. They'll include the same HTTP status code that would have been returned by a REST API request.

For example, if you submit a receipt image with an invalid URI, a `400` error is returned, indicating "Bad Request".

```csharp
try
{
    RecognizedReceiptCollection receipts = await client.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUri)).WaitForCompletionAsync();
}
catch (RequestFailedException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
}
```

You'll notice that additional information, like the client request ID of the operation, is logged.

```
Message:
    Azure.RequestFailedException: Service request failed.
    Status: 400 (Bad Request)

Content:
    {"error":{"code":"FailedToDownloadImage","innerError":
    {"requestId":"8ca04feb-86db-4552-857c-fde903251518"},
    "message":"Failed to download image from input URL."}}
