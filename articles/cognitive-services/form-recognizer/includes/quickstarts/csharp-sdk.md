[Reference documentation](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.formrecognizer-readme) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
* An Azure Storage blob that contains a set of training data. See [Build a training data set for a custom model](../../build-training-data-set.md) for tips and options for putting together your training data set. For this quickstart, you can use the files under the **Train** folder of the [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) (download and extract *sample_data.zip*).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer"  title="Create a Form Recognizer resource"  target="_blank">create a Form Recognizer resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `formrecognizer-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *program.cs*. 

```console
dotnet new console -n formrecognizer-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Install the client library 

Within the application directory, install the Form Recognizer client library for .NET with the following command:

#### [version 2.0](#tab/ga)

```console
dotnet add package Azure.AI.FormRecognizer --version 3.0.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Form Recognizer 3.0.0 SDK reflects API version 2.0

#### [version 2.1 preview](#tab/preview)

```console
dotnet add package Azure.AI.FormRecognizer --version 3.1.0-beta.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Form Recognizer 3.1.0 SDK reflects API version 2.1 preview

---

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

From the project directory, open the *Program.cs* file in your preferred editor or IDE. Add the following `using` directives:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_using)]

In the application's **Program** class, create variables for your resource's key and endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the Form Recognizer resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. See the Cognitive Services [security](../../../cognitive-services-security.md) article for more information.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_creds)]

In the application's **Main** method, add a call to the asynchronous tasks used in this quickstart. You will implement them later.

#### [version 2.0](#tab/ga)
[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_main)]
#### [version 2.1 preview](#tab/preview)

## Object model 

With Form Recognizer, you can create two different client types. The first, `FormRecognizerClient` is used to query the service to recognized form fields and content. The second, `FormTrainingClient` is use to create and manage custom models that you can use to improve recognition. 

### FormRecognizerClient

`FormRecognizerClient` provides operations for:

 - Recognizing form fields and content, using custom models trained to recognize your custom forms.  These values are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See example [Analyze custom forms](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model).
 - Recognizing form content, including tables, lines and words, without the need to train a model.  Form content is returned in a collection of `FormPage` objects. See example [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content).
 - Recognizing common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model on the Form Recognizer service. These fields and meta-data are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See example [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts).

### FormTrainingClient

`FormTrainingClient` provides operations for:

- Training custom models to recognize all fields and values found in your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the form types the model will recognize, and the fields it will extract for each form type.
- Training custom models to recognize specific fields and values you specify by labeling your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the fields the model will extract, as well as the estimated accuracy for each field.
- Managing models created in your account.
- Copying a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.

See examples for [Train a Model](#train-a-custom-model) and [Manage Custom Models](#manage-custom-models).

> [!NOTE]
> Models can also be trained using a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer Labeling Tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md).

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Form Recognizer client library for .NET:

#### [version 2.0](#tab/ga)

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content)
* [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)

#### [version 2.1 preview](#tab/preview)

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content)
* [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Recognize business cards](#recognize-business-cards)
* [Recognize invoices](#recognize-invoices)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)

---

## Authenticate the client

Below **Main**, create a new method named `AuthenticateClient`. You'll use this in other tasks to authenticate your requests to the Form Recognizer service. This method uses the `AzureKeyCredential` object, so that if needed, you can update the API key without creating new client objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get your key and endpoint from the Azure portal. If the Form Recognizer resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_auth)]

Repeat the steps above for a new method that authenticates a training client.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_auth_training)]

## Get assets for testing 

You'll also need to add references to the URLs for your training and testing data. Add these to the root of your **Program** class.

* [!INCLUDE [get SAS URL](../../includes/sas-instructions.md)]
* Then, repeat the above steps to get the SAS URL of an individual document in blob storage container. Save it to a temporary location as well.
* Finally, save the URL of the sample image(s) included below (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/sample_forms)). 

#### [version 2.0](#tab/ga)
[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_urls)]
#### [version 2.1 preview](#tab/preview)
[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_urls)]

## Recognize form content

You can use Form Recognizer to recognize tables, lines, and words in documents, without needing to train a model. The returned value is a collection of **FormPage** objects: one for each page in the submitted document. 

To recognize the content of a file at a given URL, use the `StartRecognizeContentFromUri` method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_getcontent_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also get content from a local file. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient?view=azure-dotnet) methods, such as **StartRecognizeContent**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios involving local images.

The rest of this task prints the content information to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_getcontent_print)]

### Output

```console

## Recognize receipts

This section demonstrates how to recognize and extract common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.

To recognize receipts from a URL, use the `StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri` method. 

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_receipt_call)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also recognize local receipt images. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient?view=azure-dotnet) methods, such as **StartRecognizeReceipts**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios involving local images.

The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedReceipt` objects: one for each page in the submitted document. The following code processes the receipt at the given URI and prints the major fields and values to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_receipt_print)]

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart-preview.cs?name=snippet_invoice_print)]

---


## Train a custom model

This section demonstrates how to train a model with your own data. A trained model can output structured data that includes the key/value relationships in the original form document. After you train the model, you can test and retrain it and eventually use it to reliably extract data from more forms according to your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also train models with a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md).

### Train a model without labels

Train custom models to recognize all the fields and values found in your custom forms without manually labeling the training documents. The following method trains a model on a given set of documents and prints the model's status to the console. 


[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_train)]


The returned `CustomFormModel` object contains information on the form types the model can recognize and the fields it can extract from each form type. The following code block prints this information to the console.


[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_train_response)]

Finally, return the trained model ID for use in later steps.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_train_return)]

### Train a model with labels

You can also train custom models by manually labeling the training documents. Training with labels leads to better performance in some scenarios. To train with labels, you need to have special label information files (`\<filename\>.pdf.labels.json`) in your blob storage container alongside the training documents. The [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md) provides a UI to help you create these label files. Once you have them, you can call the `StartTrainingAsync` method with the `uselabels` parameter set to `true`. 

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_trainlabels)]

The returned `CustomFormModel` indicates the fields the model can extract, along with its estimated accuracy in each field. The following code block prints this information to the console.

## Analyze forms with a custom model

This section demonstrates how to extract key/value information and other content from your custom form types, using models you trained with your own forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to implement this scenario, you must have already trained a model so you can pass its ID into the method below.

You'll use the `StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri` method. 

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_analyze)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also analyze a local file. See the [FormRecognizerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.formrecognizer.formrecognizerclient?view=azure-dotnet) methods, such as **StartRecognizeCustomForms**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md) for scenarios involving local images.

The returned value is a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects: one for each page in the submitted document. The following code prints the analysis results to the console. It prints each recognized field and corresponding value, along with a confidence score.

## Manage custom models

This section demonstrates how to manage the custom models stored in your account. You'll do multiple operations within the following method:

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage)]


### Check the number of models in the FormRecognizer resource account

The following code block checks how many models you have saved in your Form Recognizer account and compares it to the account limit.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_count)]

### Output 

```console
Account has 20 models.
It can have at most 5000 models.
```

### List the models currently stored in the resource account

The following code block lists the current models in your account and prints their details to the console.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_list)]

```

### Get a specific model using the model's ID

The following code block trains a new model (just like in the [Train a model](#train-a-model-without-labels) section) and then retrieves a second reference to it using its ID.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_get)]

    FieldName: Signature
    FieldName: Subtotal
    FieldName: Tax
    FieldName: Total
    FieldName: VendorName
    FieldName: Website
...
```

### Delete a model from the resource account

You can also delete a model from your account by referencing its ID. This step also closes out the method.

[!code-csharp[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/dotnet/FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerQuickstart.cs?name=snippet_manage_model_delete)]


## Run the application

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```dotnet
dotnet run
```


## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

## Troubleshooting

When you interact with the Cognitive Services Form Recognizer client library using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service will result in a `RequestFailedException`. They'll include the same HTTP status code that would have been returned by a REST API request.

For example, if you submit a receipt image with an invalid URI, a `400` error is returned, indicating "Bad Request".

```csharp
try
{
    RecognizedReceiptCollection receipts = await client.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUri)).WaitForCompletionAsync();
}
catch (RequestFailedException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
}
```

You'll notice that additional information, like the client request ID of the operation, is logged.

```
Message:
    Azure.RequestFailedException: Service request failed.
    Status: 400 (Bad Request)

Content:
    {"error":{"code":"FailedToDownloadImage","innerError":
    {"requestId":"8ca04feb-86db-4552-857c-fde903251518"},
    "message":"Failed to download image from input URL."}}
