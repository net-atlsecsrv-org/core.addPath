# What is Form Recognizer?

[!INCLUDE [TLS 1.2 enforcement](../../../includes/cognitive-services-tls-announcement.md)]

Azure Form Recognizer is a cognitive service that lets you build automated data processing software using machine learning technology. Identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, tables, and structure from your documents&mdash;the service outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file, bounding boxes, confidence and more. You quickly get accurate results that are tailored to your specific content without heavy manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Use Form Recognizer to automate data entry in your applications and enrich your documents search capabilities.

Form Recognizer is composed of custom document processing models, prebuilt models for invoices, receipts and business cards, and the layout model. You can call Form Recognizer models by using a REST API or client library SDKs to reduce complexity and integrate it into your workflow or application.

Form Recognizer is composed of the following services:
* **[Layout API](#layout-api)** - Extract text, selection marks, and tables structures, along with their bounding box coordinates, from documents.
* **[Custom models](#custom-models)** - Extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, and table data from forms. These models are trained with your own data, so they're tailored to your forms.
* **[Prebuilt models](#prebuilt-models)** - Extract data from unique form types using prebuilt models. Currently available are the following prebuilt models
    * [Invoices](./concept-invoices.md)
    * [Sales receipts](./concept-receipts.md)
    * [Business cards](./concept-business-cards.md)


## Try it out

To try out the Form Recognizer Service, go to the online Sample UI Tool:


# [v2.0](#tab/v2-0)

You will need an Azure subscription ([create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)) and a [Form Recognizer resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) endpoint and key to try out the Form Recognizer service.

## Layout API

Form Recognizer can extract text, selection marks, and table structure (the row and column numbers associated with the text) using high-definition optical character recognition (OCR) and an enhanced deep learning  model from documents. See the [Layout](./concept-layout.md) conceptual guide for more info.

## Custom models

Form Recognizer custom models train to your own data, and you only need five sample input forms to start. A trained document processing model can output structured data that includes the relationships in the original form document. After you train the model, you can test and retrain it and eventually use it to reliably extract data from more forms according to your needs.

You have the following options when you train custom models: training with labeled data and without labeled data.

### Train without labels

By default, Form Recognizer uses unsupervised learning to understand the layout and relationships between fields and entries in your forms. When you submit your input forms, the algorithm clusters the forms by type, discovers what keys and tables are present, and associates values to keys and entries to tables. This doesn't require manual data labeling or intensive coding and maintenance, and we recommend you try this method first.

See [Build a training data set](./build-training-data-set.md) for tips on how to collect your training documents.

### Train with labels

When you train with labeled data, the model does supervised learning to extract values of interest, using the labeled forms you provide. This results in better-performing models and can produce models that work with complex forms or forms containing values without keys.

Form Recognizer uses the [Layout API](#layout-api) to learn the expected sizes and positions of printed and handwritten text elements. Then it uses user-specified labels to learn the key/value associations in the documents. We recommend that you use five manually labeled forms of the same type (same structure) to get started when training a new model and add more labeled data as needed to improve the model accuracy.

## Prebuilt models

Form Recognizer also includes Prebuilt models for automated data processing of unique form types.

### Prebuilt Invoice model
The Prebuilt Invoice model extracts data from invoices in a variety of formats and returns structured data. This model extracts key information such as the invoice ID, customer details, vendor details, ship to, bill to, total, tax, subtotal and more. In addition, the prebuilt invoice model is trained to recognize and return all of the text and tables on the invoice. See the [Invoices](./concept-invoices.md) conceptual guide for more info.

### Prebuilt Receipt model

The Prebuilt Receipt model is used for reading English sales receipts from Australia, Canada, Great Britain, India, and the United States&mdash;the type used by restaurants, gas stations, retail, and so on. This model extracts key information such as the time and date of the transaction, merchant information, amounts of taxes, line items, totals and more. In addition, the prebuilt receipt model is trained to recognize and return all of the text on a receipt. See the [Receipts](./concept-receipts.md) conceptual guide for more info.

### Prebuilt Business Cards model

The Business Cards model enables you to extract information such as the person's name, job title, address, email, company, and phone numbers from business cards in English. See the [Business cards](./concept-business-cards.md) conceptual guide for more info.
