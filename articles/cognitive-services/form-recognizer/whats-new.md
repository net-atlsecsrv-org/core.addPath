## April 2020

### New features
* **SDK support for Form Recognizer API v2.0 Public Preview** - This month we expanded our service support to include a preview SDK for Form Recognizer v2.0 (preview) release. Use the links below to get started with your language of choice: 
   * [.NET SDK](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.formrecognizer-readme?view=azure-dotnet)
   * [Java SDK](/java/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme?view=azure-java-preview)
   * [Python SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme?view=azure-python-preview)
   * [JavaScript SDK](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-form-recognizer-readme?view=azure-node-preview)

  The new SDK supports all the features of the v2.0 REST API for Form Recognizer. For example, you can train a model with or without labels and extract text, key value pairs and tables from your forms, extract data from receipts with the pre-built receipts service and extract text and tables with the layout service from your documents. You can share your feedback on the SDKs through the [SDK Feedback form](https://aka.ms/FR_SDK_v1_feedback).
 
* **Copy Custom Model** You can now copy models between regions and subscriptions using the new Copy Custom Model feature. Before invoking the Copy Custom Model API, you must first obtain authorization to copy into the target resource by calling the Copy Authorization operation against the target resource endpoint.
   * [Generate a copy authorization](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2/operations/CopyCustomFormModelAuthorization) REST API
   * [Copy a custom model](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2/operations/CopyCustomFormModel) REST API 

### Security improvements

* Customer-Managed Keys are now available for FormRecognizer. For more information, see [Data encryption at rest for Form Recognizer](./form-recognizer-encryption-of-data-at-rest.md).
* Use Managed Identities for access to Azure resources with Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authorize access to managed identities](../authentication.md#authorize-access-to-managed-identities).

## March 2020 

### New features

* **Value types for labeling** You can now specify the types of values you're labeling with the Form Recognizer sample labeling tool. The following value types and variations are currently supported:
  * `string`
    * default, `no-whitespaces`, `alphanumeric`
  * `number`
    * default, `currency`
  * `date` 
    * default, `dmy`, `mdy`, `ymd`
  * `time`
  * `integer`

  See the [Sample labeling tool](./quickstarts/label-tool.md#specify-tag-value-types) guide to learn how to use this feature.


* **Table visualization** The sample labeling tool now displays tables that were recognized in the document. This feature lets you view the tables that have been recognized and extracted from the document, prior to labeling and analyzing. This feature can be toggled on/off using the layers option.

  The following image is an example of how tables are recognized and extracted:

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Table visualization using the sample labeling tool](./media/whats-new/formre-table-viz.png)

    The extracted tables are available in the JSON output under `"pageResults"`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Labeling tables isn't supported. If tables are not recognized and extrated automatically, you can only label them as key/value pairs. When labeling tables as key/value pairs, label each cell as a unique value.

### Extraction enhancements

This release includes extraction enhancements and accuracy improvements, specifically, the capability to label and extract multiple key/value pairs in the same line of text. 
 
### Sample labeling tool is now open-source

The Form Recognizer sample labeling tool is now available as an open-source project. You can integrate it within your solutions and make customer-specific changes to meet your needs.

For more information about the Form Recognizer sample labeling tool, review the documentation available on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/OCR-Form-Tools/blob/master/README.md).

### TLS 1.2 enforcement

TLS 1.2 is now enforced for all HTTP requests to this service. For more information, see [Azure Cognitive Services security](../cognitive-services-security.md).

## January 2020

This release introduces the Form Recognizer 2.0 (preview). In the sections below, you'll find more information about new features, enhancements, and changes. 

### New features

* **Custom model**
  * **Train with labels** You can now train a custom model with manually labeled data. This method results in better-performing models and can produce models that work with complex forms or forms containing values without keys.
  * **Asynchronous API** You can use async API calls to train with and analyze large data sets and files.
  * **TIFF file support** You can now train with and extract data from TIFF documents.
  * **Extraction accuracy improvements**

* **Prebuilt receipt model**
  * **Tip amounts** You can now extract tip amounts and other handwritten values.
  * **Line item extraction** You can extract line item values from receipts.
  * **Confidence values** You can view the model's confidence for each extracted value.
  * **Extraction accuracy improvements**

* **Layout extraction** You can now use the Layout API to extract text data and table data from your forms.

### Custom model API changes

All of the APIs for training and using custom models have been renamed, and some synchronous methods are now asynchronous. The following are major changes:

* The process of training a model is now asynchronous. You initiate training through the **/custom/models** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **custom/models/{modelID}** to return the training results.
* Key/value extraction is now initiated by the **/custom/models/{modelID}/analyze** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **custom/models/{modelID}/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.
* Operation IDs for the Train operation are now found in the **Location** header of HTTP responses, not the **Operation-Location** header.

### Receipt API changes

The APIs for reading sales receipts have been renamed.

* Receipt data extraction is now initiated by the **/prebuilt/receipt/analyze** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **/prebuilt/receipt/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.

### Output format changes

The JSON responses for all API calls have new formats. Some keys and values have been added, removed, or renamed. See the quickstarts for examples of the current JSON formats.
