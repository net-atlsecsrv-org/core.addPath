# Quickstart: Create an image classification project with the Custom Vision Go SDK

This article provides information and sample code to help you get started using the Custom Vision SDK with Go to build an image classification model. After it's created, you can add tags, upload images, train the project, obtain the project's published prediction endpoint URL, and use the endpoint to programmatically test an image. Use this example as a template for building your own Go application. If you wish to go through the process of building and using a classification model _without_ code, see the [browser-based guidance](getting-started-build-a-classifier.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

- [Go 1.8+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [!INCLUDE [create-resources](includes/create-resources.md)]

## Install the Custom Vision SDK

To install the Custom Vision service SDK for Go, run the following command in PowerShell:

```shell
go get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/...
```

or if you use `dep`, within your repo run:
```shell
dep ensure -add github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go
```

[!INCLUDE [get-keys](includes/get-keys.md)]

[!INCLUDE [python-get-images](includes/python-get-images.md)]

## Add the code

Create a new file called *sample.go* in your preferred project directory.

### Create the Custom Vision service project

Add the following code to your script to create a new Custom Vision service project. Insert your subscription keys in the appropriate definitions. Also, get your Endpoint URL from the Settings page of the Custom Vision website.

See the [CreateProject](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.trainings.createproject?view=azure-java-stable#com_microsoft_azure_cognitiveservices_vision_customvision_training_Trainings_createProject_String_CreateProjectOptionalParameter_) method to specify other options when you create your project (explained in the [Build a classifier](getting-started-build-a-classifier.md) web portal guide).

```go
import(
    "context"
    "bytes"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "path"
    "log"
    "time"
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v3.0/customvision/training"
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v3.0/customvision/prediction"
)

var (
    training_key string = "<your training key>"
    prediction_key string = "<your prediction key>"
    prediction_resource_id = "<your prediction resource id>"
    endpoint string = "<your endpoint URL>"
    project_name string = "Go Sample Project"
    iteration_publish_name = "classifyModel"
    sampleDataDirectory = "<path to sample images>"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Creating project...")

    ctx = context.Background()

    trainer := training.New(training_key, endpoint)

    project, err := trainer.CreateProject(ctx, project_name, "sample project", nil, string(training.Multilabel))
    if (err != nil) {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
```

### Create tags in the project

To create classification tags to your project, add the following code to the end of *sample.go*:

```go
// Make two tags in the new project
hemlockTag, _ := trainer.CreateTag(ctx, *project.ID, "Hemlock", "Hemlock tree tag", string(training.Regular))
cherryTag, _ := trainer.CreateTag(ctx, *project.ID, "Japanese Cherry", "Japanese cherry tree tag", string(training.Regular))
```

### Upload and tag images

To add the sample images to the project, insert the following code after the tag creation. This code uploads each image with its corresponding tag. You can upload up to 64 images in a single batch.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to change the path to the images based on where you downloaded the Cognitive Services Go SDK Samples project earlier.

```go
fmt.Println("Adding images...")
japaneseCherryImages, err := ioutil.ReadDir(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Japanese Cherry"))
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error finding Sample images")
}

hemLockImages, err := ioutil.ReadDir(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Hemlock"))
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error finding Sample images")
}

for _, file := range hemLockImages {
    imageFile, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Hemlock", file.Name()))
    imageData := ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(imageFile))

    trainer.CreateImagesFromData(ctx, *project.ID, imageData, []string{ hemlockTag.ID.String() })
}

for _, file := range japaneseCherryImages {
    imageFile, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Japanese Cherry", file.Name()))
    imageData := ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(imageFile))
    trainer.CreateImagesFromData(ctx, *project.ID, imageData, []string{ cherryTag.ID.String() })
}
```

### Train the classifier and publish

This code creates the first iteration of the prediction model and then publishes that iteration to the prediction endpoint. The name given to the published iteration can be used to send prediction requests. An iteration is not available in the prediction endpoint until it is published.

```go
fmt.Println("Training...")
iteration, _ := trainer.TrainProject(ctx, *project.ID)
for {
    if *iteration.Status != "Training" {
        break
    }
    fmt.Println("Training status: " + *iteration.Status)
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    iteration, _ = trainer.GetIteration(ctx, *project.ID, *iteration.ID)
}
fmt.Println("Training status: " + *iteration.Status)

trainer.PublishIteration(ctx, *project.ID, *iteration.ID, iteration_publish_name, prediction_resource_id))
```

### Get and use the published iteration on the prediction endpoint

To send an image to the prediction endpoint and retrieve the prediction, add the following code to the end of the file:

```go
    fmt.Println("Predicting...")
    predictor := prediction.New(prediction_key, endpoint)

    testImageData, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(path.Join(sampleDataDirectory, "Test", "test_image.jpg"))
    results, _ := predictor.ClassifyImage(ctx, *project.ID, iteration_publish_name, ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(testImageData)), "")

    for _, prediction := range *results.Predictions	{
        fmt.Printf("\t%s: %.2f%%", *prediction.TagName, *prediction.Probability * 100)
        fmt.Println("")
    }
}
```

## Run the application

Run *sample.go*.

```shell
go run sample.go
```

The output of the application should be similar to the following text:

```console
Creating project...
Adding images...
Training...
Training status: Training
Training status: Training
Training status: Training
Training status: Completed
Done!
        Hemlock: 93.53%
        Japanese Cherry: 0.01%
```

You can then verify that the test image (found in **<base_image_url>/Images/Test/**) is tagged appropriately. You can also go back to the [Custom Vision website](https://customvision.ai) and see the current state of your newly created project.

## Next steps

Now you have seen how every step of the image classification process can be done in code. This sample executes a single training iteration, but often you will need to train and test your model multiple times in order to make it more accurate.
