As a minimum, we recommend you use at least 30 images per tag in the initial training set. You'll also want to collect a few extra images to test your model once it's trained.

In order to train your model effectively, use images with visual variety. Select images that vary by:
* camera angle
* lighting
* background
* visual style
* individual/grouped subject(s)
* size
* type

Additionally, make sure all of your training images meet the following criteria:
* .jpg, .png, or .bmp format
* no greater than 6MB in size (4MB for prediction images)
* no less than 256 pixels on the shortest edge; any images shorter than this will be automatically scaled up by the Custom Vision Service
