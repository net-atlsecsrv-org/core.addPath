## Get the training and prediction keys

The project needs a valid set of subscription keys in order to interact with the service. To get a set of free trial keys, go to the [Custom Vision website](https://customvision.ai) and sign in with a Microsoft account. Select the __gear icon__ in the upper right. In the __Accounts__ section, see the values in the __Training Key__,  __Prediction Key__ and __Prediction Resource Id__ fields. You will need these later.
