## Get the training and prediction keys

The project needs a valid set of subscription keys to interact with the service. You can find the items at the  [Custom Vision website](https://customvision.ai). Sign in with the account associated with the Azure account used to create your Custom Vision resources. On the home page (the page with the option to add a new project), select the __gear icon__ in the upper right. Find your training and prediction resources in the list and expand them. Here you can find your training key, prediction key, and prediction resource ID values. Save these values to a temporary location.

Or, you can obtain these keys and ID from the [Azure portal](https://www.portal.azure.com) by viewing your Custom Vision Training and Prediction resources and navigating to the __Keys__ tab. There you'll find your training key and prediction key. Navigate to the __Properties__ tab of your Prediction resource to get your prediction resource ID.
