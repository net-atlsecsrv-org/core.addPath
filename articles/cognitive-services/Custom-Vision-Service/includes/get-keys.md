## Get the training and prediction keys

The project needs a valid set of subscription keys to interact with the service. You can find the items at the  [Custom Vision website](https://customvision.ai). Sign in with the account associated with the Azure account used to create your Custom Vision resources. Select the __gear icon__ in the upper right. In the __Accounts__ section, dropdowns will be available for your Azure Resources, allowing you to see the values for __Training Key__,  __Prediction Key__, and __Prediction Resource Id__ fields.

 Alternatively, these keys and ID can be obtained from the [Azure Portal](https://www.portal.azure.com) by viewing your Custom Vision Training and Prediction resources and reviewing the __Keys__ tab. There you can find your __Training Key__ or  __Prediction Key__. Navigate to the __Properties__ tab of your Prediction resource to obtain your __Prediction Resource Id__.
