To use the Custom Vision Service you will need to create Custom Vision Training and Prediction resources in Azure. To do so in the Azure portal, fill out the dialog window on the [Create Custom Vision](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=microsoft_azure_cognitiveservices_customvision#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesCustomVision) page to create both a Training and Prediction resource.
