# Tutorial: Use an ONNX model from Custom Vision with Windows ML (preview)

Learn how to use an ONNX model exported from the Custom Vision service with Windows ML (preview).

The information in this document demonstrates how to use an ONNX file exported from the Custom Vision Service with Windows ML. An example Windows UWP application is provided. A trained model that can recognize is included with the example. Steps are also provided on how you can use your own model with this example.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 version 1809 or higher

* Windows SDK for build 17763 or higher

* Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or later with the __Universal Windows Platform development__ workload enabled.

* Developer mode enabled. For more information, see the [Enable your device for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) document.

## About the example app

The application is a generic Windows UWP application. It allows you to select an image from your computer, which is then sent to the model. The tags and scores returned by the model are displayed next to the image.

## Get the example code

The example application is available at [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-onnx-customvision-sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-onnx-customvision-sample).

## Run the example

1. Use the `F5` key to start the application from Visual Studio. You may be prompted to enable Developer mode. For more information, see the [Enable your device for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) document.

1. When the application starts, use the button to select an image for scoring.

## Use your own model

To use your own model, use the following steps:

1. [Create and train](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier) a classifier with the Custom Vision Service. To export the model, select a __compact__ domain such as **General (compact)**. To export an existing classifier, convert the domain to compact by selecting the gear icon at the top right. In __Settings__, choose a compact model, save, and train your project.  

1. [Export your model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/export-your-model) by going to the Performance tab. Select an iteration trained with a compact domain, an "Export" button will appear. Select *Export*, *ONNX*, and then *Export*. Once the file is ready, select the *Download* button.

1. Drop the ONNX file into your project's __Assets__ folder. 

1. In Solutions Explorer, right-click the Assets Folder and select __Add Existing Item__. Select the ONNX file.

1. In Solutions Explorer, select the ONNX file from the Assets folder. Change the following properties for the file:

    * __Build Action__ -> __Content__
    * __Copy to Output Directory__ -> __Copy if newer__

1. Change the `_onnxFileNames` variable to the name of the ONNX file. Also modify `ClassLabel` to the number of labels the model contains.

1. Build and run.

1. Click button to select image to evaluate.
