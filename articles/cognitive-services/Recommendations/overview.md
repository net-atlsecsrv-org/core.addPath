# Recommendations API (discontinued)

The Recommendations API preview is no longer under active development and was officially retired on February 15. 

For an alternative, consider the new open-source [Recommendations Solution template](https://aka.ms/recopcs), which lets you host a recommendations engine within your own Azure subscription. It supports the core scenarios of the Recommendations API, while also giving you the freedom to deploy to any Azure region and more closely control the computational resources used to train models and serve recommendations. 

Learn more about the Recommendations Solution template by reading [the documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/Product-Recommendations).
