# Throttling requests to the Bing Web Search API

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).
