# Language and region support for the Bing Visual Search API

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmove).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmigration).

Bing Visual Search API supports more than three dozen countries/regions, many with more than one language. Each request should include the user's country/region and language of choice. Knowing the user's market helps Bing return appropriate results. If you don't specify a country/region and language, Bing makes a best effort to determine the user's country/region and language. Because the results may contain links to Bing, knowing the country/region and language may provide a preferred localized Bing user experience if the user clicks the Bing links.

To specify the country/region and language, set the `mkt` (market) query parameter to a code from the **Markets** table below. The market specifies both a country/region and language. If the user prefers to see display text in a different language, set `setLang` query parameter to the appropriate language code.

Alternatively, you can specify the country/region using the `cc` query parameter. If you specify a country/region, you must also specify one or more language codes using the `Accept-Language` HTTP header. The supported languages vary by country/region; they are given for each country in the Markets table.



> [!NOTE]
> The following market restrictions apply:
>
> - Image recognition annotations are available in English only.
> - Recipe, shopping, and pages-including insights are available in the en-US market only.
