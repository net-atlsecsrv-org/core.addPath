# Quickstart: Get image insights using the Bing Visual Search REST API and Python

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Visual Search API and view the results. This Python application uploads an image to the API and displays the information it returns. Though this application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

When you upload a local image, the form data must include the `Content-Disposition` header. You must set its `name` parameter to "image", and you can set the `filename` parameter to any string. The contents of the form include the binary data of the image. The maximum image size you can upload is 1 MB.

```
--boundary_1234-abcd
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="myimagefile.jpg"

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-visual-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Initialize the application

1. Create a new Python file in your favorite IDE or editor, and add the following `import` statement:

    ```python
    import requests, json
    ```

2. Create variables for your subscription key, endpoint, and the path to the image you're uploading:

    ```python

    BASE_URI = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/visualsearch'
    SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = 'your-subscription-key'
    imagePath = 'your-image-path'
    ```

3. Create a dictionary object to hold your request's header information. Bind your subscription key to the string `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`, as shown below:

    ```python
    HEADERS = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}
    ```

4. Create another dictionary to contain your image, which is opened and uploaded when you send the request:

    ```python
    file = {'image' : ('myfile', open(imagePath, 'rb'))}
    ```

## Parse the JSON response

1. Create a method called `print_json()` to take in the API response, and print the JSON:

    ```python
    def print_json(obj):
        """Print the object as json"""
        print(json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2, separators=(',', ': ')))
    ```

## Send the request

1. Use `requests.post()` to send a request to the Bing Visual Search API. Include the string for your endpoint, header, and file information. Print `response.json()` with `print_json()`:

    ```python
    try:
        response = requests.post(BASE_URI, headers=HEADERS, files=file)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print_json(response.json())
    
    except Exception as ex:
        raise ex
    ```
