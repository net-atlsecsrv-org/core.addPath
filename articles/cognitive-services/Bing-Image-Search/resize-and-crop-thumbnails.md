# Resize and crop thumbnail images

Upon processing a search query, Bing will generate thumbnail information for all images in its [response](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/concepts/bing-image-search-get-images#bing-image-search-response-format). This information can be used to display all, or a subset of the returned thumbnails. If you display a subset, provide an option to view the remaining images.


<!-- Removing image until we can replace it with a sanatized version.

-->

If the user clicks the thumbnail, you can use [contentUrl](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-contenturl) to display the full-size image to the user. Be sure to attribute the image.

If `shoppingSourcesCount` or `recipeSourcesCount` are greater than zero, add badging, such as a shopping cart, to the thumbnail to indicate that shopping or recipes exist for the item in the image.

<!-- this is a sanitized version but we're removing all images for now until everything is sanitized.

To get insights about the image, such as web pages that include the image or people that were recognized in the image, use [imageInsightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-imageinsightstoken). For details, see [Image Insights](image-insights.md).

## Resizing and cropping thumbnails

You can also resize and expand thumbnails, such as when a user's cursor hovers above it.
> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to attribute the image if you expand it. For example, by extracting the host from [hostPageDisplayUrl](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-hostpagedisplayurl) and displaying it below the image.
