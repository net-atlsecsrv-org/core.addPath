# Quickstart: Search for images using the Bing Image Search REST API and Ruby

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmove).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmigration).

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Image Search API and receive a JSON response. This simple Ruby application sends a search query to the API and displays the raw results.

Although this application is written in Ruby, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

The source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/ruby/Search/BingImageSearchv7.rb).

## Prerequisites

* [The latest version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements.md)]

For more information, see [Cognitive Services Pricing - Bing Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/search-api/).

## Create and initialize the application

1. Import the following packages into your code file:

    ```ruby
    require 'net/https'
    require 'uri'
    require 'json'
    ```

2. Create variables for the API endpoint, image API search path, your subscription key, and search term. For `uri`, you can use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.

    ```ruby
    uri  = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
    path = "/bing/v7.0/images/search"
    term = "puppies"
    ```

## Format and make an API request

Use the variables from the previous step to format a search URL for the API request. Then, send the request.

```ruby
uri = URI(uri + path + "?q=" + URI.escape(term))


request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = accessKey

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end
```

## Process and print the JSON

After the response is received, you can parse the JSON, and get values from it. For example, the thumbnail URL to the first result, and the total number of returned images.

```ruby
response.each_header do |key, value|
    # header names are lowercased
    if key.start_with?("bingapis-") or key.start_with?("x-msedge-") then
        puts key + ": " + value
    end
end

parsed_json = JSON.parse(response.body)
total_returned_images = parsed_json["totalEstimatedMatches"]
first_result = parsed_json["value"][0]["thumbnailUrl"]

puts "total number of returned matches: #{total_returned_images}"
puts "Url to the thumbnail of the first returned search result: #{first_result}"
```

## Example JSON response

Responses from the Bing Image Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.

```json

    "_type":"ResponseInstrumentation"
