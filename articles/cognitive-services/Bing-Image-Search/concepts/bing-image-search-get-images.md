# Get images from the web with the Bing Image Search API

When you use the Bing Image Search REST API, you can get images from the web that are related to your search term by sending the following GET request:

```http
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/search?q=sailing+dinghies&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE
X-MSEdge-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999
X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100
X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>
Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com
```

Use the [q](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#query) query parameter for your url-encoded search term. For example, if you enter *sailing dinghies*, set `q` to `sailing+dinghies` or `sailing%20dinghies`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * All requests must be made from a server, and not from a client.
> * If it's your first time calling any of the Bing search APIs, don't include the client ID header. Only include the client ID if you've previously called a Bing API that returned a client ID for the user and device combination.

## Get images from a specific web domain

To get images from a specific domain, use the [site:](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) query operator.

```http
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/search?q=sailing+dinghies+site:contososailing.com&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Responses to queries using the `site:` operator might include adult content regardless of the [safeSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#safesearch) setting. Only use `site:` if you're aware of the content on the domain.

## Filter images

 By default, the Image Search API returns all images that are relevant to the query. If you want to filter the images that Bing returns (for example, to return only images with a transparent background or specific size), use the following query parameters:

* [aspect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#aspect)—Filter images by aspect ratio (for example, standard or wide screen images).
* [color](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#color)—Filter images by dominant color or black and white.
* [freshness](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#freshness)—Filter images by age (for example, images discovered by Bing in the past week).
* [height](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#height), [width](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#width)—Filter images by width and height.
* [imageContent](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#imagecontent)—Filter images by content (for example, images that show only a person's face).
* [imageType](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#imagetype)—Filter images by type (for example, clip art, animated GIFs, or transparent backgrounds).
* [license](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#license)—Filter images by the type of license associated with the site.
* [size](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#size)—Filter images by size, such as small images up to 200x200 pixels.

To get images from a specific domain, use the [site:](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) query operator.

The following example shows how to get small images from ContosoSailing.com that Bing discovered in the past week.  

```http
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/search?q=sailing+dinghies+site:contososailing.com&size=small&freshness=week&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1  
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE  
X-MSEdge-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999  
X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100  
X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>  
Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com  
```

## Bing Image Search response format

The response message from Bing contains an [Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#images) answer that contains a list of images that Cognitive Services determined to be relevant to the query. Each [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image) object in the list includes the following information about the image: the URL, its size, its dimensions, its encoding format, a URL to a thumbnail of the image, and the thumbnail's dimensions.

> [!NOTE]
> * Images must be displayed in the order provided in the response.
> * Because URL formats and parameters are subject to change without notice, use all URLs as-is. You should not take dependencies on the URL format or parameters except where noted.

```json

    "name": "Rich Passage Sailing Dinghy",

    },

    "accentColor": "376094"
},
```

When you call the Bing Image Search API, Bing returns a list of results. The list is a subset of the total number of results that are relevant to the query. The response's `totalEstimatedMatches` field contains an estimate of the number of images that are available to view. For details about how to page through the rest of the images, see [Paging Images](../paging-images.md).

## Next steps

If you haven't tried the Bing Image Search API before, try a [quickstart](../quickstarts/csharp.md). If you're looking for something more complex, try the tutorial to create a [single-page web app](../tutorial-bing-image-search-single-page-app.md).
