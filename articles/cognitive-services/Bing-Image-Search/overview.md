# What is the Bing Image Search API?

The Bing Image Search API enables you to use Bing's image search capabilities in your application. By sending search queries to the API, you can get high-quality images similar to [bing.com/images](https://www.bing.com/images).

While the Bing Image Search API provides image-only search results, you can combine or use the other available [Bing Search APIs](../bing-web-search/bing-api-comparison.md) to find many types of content on the web.

## Workflow

The Bing Image Search API is a RESTful web service, making it easy to call from any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. You can use the service using either the [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/quickstarts/csharp?), or the [SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/image-search-sdk-quickstart).

1. Create a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with access to the Bing Search APIs. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) for free.
2. Send a request to the API, with a valid [search query](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/concepts/bing-image-search-sending-queries).
3. Process the API response by parsing the returned JSON message.

## Next steps

First, try the Bing Image Search API [interactive demo](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/).
This demo shows how you can quickly customize a search query and scour the web for images.

When you're ready to call the API, create a [Cognitive services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account). If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) for free.

To quickly get started with your first API request, you can learn to:

* [Send search queries to Bing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/quickstarts/csharp) using the REST API, or
* [Request and filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/image-search-sdk-quickstart) the images Bing returns using the SDK.
