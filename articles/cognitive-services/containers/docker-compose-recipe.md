# Use multiple containers in a private network with Docker Compose

Learn how to deploy multiple Cognitive Services containers. This procedure shows you how to orchestrate multiple Docker container images with Docker Compose.

> [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

When appropriate, orchestrating multiple container images on a single host computer can be compelling. In this article, we'll pull the Recognize Text service and Form Recognizer service together.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires several tools that must be installed and run locally.

* Use an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* [Docker engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) and validate that the Docker CLI works in a console window.
* An Azure resource with the correct pricing tier. Not all pricing tiers work with this container:
  * **Computer Vision** resource with F0 or Standard pricing tiers only.
  * **Form Recognizer** resource with F0 or Standard pricing tiers only.
  * **Cognitive Services** resource with the S0 pricing tier.

## Request access to the container registry

Complete and submit the [Cognitive Services Speech Containers Request form](https://aka.ms/speechcontainerspreview/) to request access to the container. 

[!INCLUDE [Request access to the container registry](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-request-access-only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Authenticate to the container registry](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-access-registry.md)]

## Docker compose file

The YAML file defines all the services to be deployed. These services rely on either a `DockerFile` or an existing container image, in this case we'll use two preview images. Copy and paste the following YAML file and save it as *docker-compose.yaml*. Provide the appropriate _apikey_, _billing_, and _endpoint URI_ values in the _docker-compose.yml_ file below.

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  forms:
    image: "containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-form-recognizer"
    environment:
       eula: accept
       billing: # < Your form recognizer billing URL >
       apikey: # < Your form recognizer API key >
       FormRecognizer__ComputerVisionApiKey: # < Your form recognizer API key >
       FormRecognizer__ComputerVisionEndpointUri: # < Your form recognizer URI >
    volumes:
       - type: bind
         source: e:\publicpreview\output
         target: /output
       - type: bind
         source: e:\publicpreview\input
         target: /input
    ports:
      - "5010:5000"

  ocr:
    image: "containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-recognize-text"
    environment:
      eula: accept
      apikey: # < Your recognize text API key >
      billing: # < Your recognize text billing URL >
    ports:
      - "5021:5000"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Create the directories on the host machine that are specified under the `volumes` node. This is required as the directories must exist before attempting to mount an image with volume bindings.

## Start the configured docker compose services

A docker compose file enables the management of all the defined service's life-cycles; from starting/stopping and rebuilding services, viewing service status, and log streaming. Open a command-line interface from the project directory (where the *docker-compose.yaml* file sits).

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid errors, ensure that the host machine is correctly sharing drives with the **Docker Engine**. For example, if *e:\publicpreview* is used as a directory in the *docker-compose.yaml* share the *E Drive* with docker.

From the command-line interface, execute the following command to start (or restart) all the services defined in the *docker-compose.yaml*:

```console
docker-compose up
```

The first time executing the `docker-compose up` command with this configuration, **Docker** will pull the images configured under the `services` node -- downloading/mounting them:

The images are downloaded, then the image services are started.

```

### Test the recognize text container

Open a browser on the host machine and navigate to `localhost` with the specified port from the *docker-compose.yaml*, for example, `http://localhost:5021/swagger/index.html`. You can use the Try it feature of the API to test the recognize text endpoint.

### Test the form recognizer container

Open a browser on the host machine and navigate to `localhost` with the specified port from the *docker-compose.yaml*, for example, `http://localhost:5010/swagger/index.html`. You can use the Try it feature of the API to test the form recognizer endpoint.
