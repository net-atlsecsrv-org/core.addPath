## Azure Cognitive Services container security

Security should be a primary focus whenever you're developing applications. The importance of security is a metric for success. When you're architecting a software solution that includes Cognitive Services containers, it's vital to understand the limitations and capabilities available to you. For more information about network security, see [Configure Azure Cognitive Services virtual networks][az-security].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default there is *no security* on the Cognitive Services container API. The reason for this is that most often the container will run as part of a pod which is protected from the outside by a network bridge. However, it is possible to enable authentication which works identically to the authentication used when accessing the [cloud-based Cognitive Services][request-authentication].

The diagram below illustrates the default and **non-secure** approach:

As an alternative and *secure* approach, consumers of Cognitive Services containers could augment a container with a front-facing component, keeping the container endpoint private. Let's consider a scenario where we use [Istio][istio] as an ingress gateway. Istio supports HTTPS/TLS and client-certificate authentication. In this scenario, the Istio frontend exposes the container access, presenting the client certificate that is approved beforehand with Istio.

[Nginx][nginx] is another popular choice in the same category. Both Istio and Nginx act as a service mesh and offer additional features including things like load-balancing, routing, and rate-control.

### Container networking

The Cognitive Services containers are required to submit metering information for billing purposes. Failure to allow list various network channels that the Cognitive Services containers rely on will prevent the container from working.

#### Allow list Cognitive Services domains and ports

The host should allow list **port 443** and the following domains:

* `*.cognitive.microsoft.com`
* `*.cognitiveservices.azure.com`

#### Disable deep packet inspection

> [Deep packet inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection) (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects in detail the data being sent over a computer network, and usually takes action by blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly.

Disable DPI on the secure channels that the Cognitive Services containers create to Microsoft servers. Failure to do so will prevent the container from functioning correctly.
