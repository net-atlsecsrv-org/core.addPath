#### "Ungated" preview 

The following preview containers are available publicly. The Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) syndicates all of the publicly available ungated containers for Cognitive Services. The containers are also available directly from the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-cognitive-services).

| Service | Container | Container Registry / Repository / Image Name |
|--|--|--|
| [Text Analytics](../../text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-install-containers.md) | Key Phrase Extraction | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/keyphrase` |
| [Text Analytics](../../text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-install-containers.md) | Language Detection | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language` |


#### "Gated" preview

Previously, gated preview containers were hosted on the `containerpreview.azurecr.io` repository. Starting September 22nd 2020, these containers (except Text Analytics for health) are hosted on the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), and downloading them doesn't require using the docker login command. To use the container you will need to:

1. Complete a [request form](https://aka.ms/csgate) with your Azure Subscription ID and user scenario. 
2. Upon approval, download the container from the MCR. 
3. Use the key and endpoint from an appropriate Azure resource to authenticate the container at runtime.
