# Azure Cognitive Services container image tags and release notes

Azure Cognitive Services offers many container images. The container registries and corresponding repositories vary between container images. Each container image name offers multiple tags. A container image tag is a mechanism of versioning the container image. This article is intended to be used as a comprehensive reference for listing all the Cognitive Services container images and their available tags.

> [!TIP]
> When using [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/), pay close attention to the casing of the container registry, repository, container image name and corresponding tag - as they are **case sensitive**.

# [Previous versions](#tab/previous)

Release notes for `1.1.013050001-amd64-preview`

* Added `ReadEngineConfig:ResultExpirationPeriod` container initialization configuration to specify when the system should clean up recognition results. 
    * The setting is in hours, and the default value is 48 hours.
    * The setting can reduce memory usage for result storing, especially when container in-memory storage is used.
    * Example 1. ReadEngineConfig:ResultExpirationPeriod=1, the system will clear the recognition result 1hr after the process.
    * If this configuration is set to 0, the system will clear the recognition result after the result is retrieved.

* Fixed a 500 internal server error when an invalid image format is passed to the system. It will now return a 400 error:

    ```json
    {
        "error": {
        "code": "InvalidImageSize",
        "message": "Image must be between 1024 and 209715200 bytes."
        }
    }
    ```
