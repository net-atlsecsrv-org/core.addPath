# Quickstart: Send a search request to the Bing Entity Search REST API using Node.js

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource).

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Entity Search API and view the JSON response. This simple JavaScript application sends a news search query to the API, and displays the response. The source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/nodejs/Search/BingEntitySearchv7.js).

Although this application is written in JavaScript, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

* The latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

* The [JavaScript Request Library](https://github.com/request/request).

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-news-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-entity-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create and initialize the application

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your favorite IDE or editor, and set the strictness and HTTPS requirements.

    ```javaScript
    'use strict';
    let https = require ('https');
    ```

2. Create variables for the API endpoint, your subscription key, and search query. You can use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.

    ```javascript
    let subscriptionKey = 'ENTER YOUR KEY HERE';
    let host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com';
    let path = '/bing/v7.0/entities';
    
    let mkt = 'en-US';
    let q = 'italian restaurant near me';
    ```

3. Append your market and query parameters to a string called `query`. Be sure to url-encode your query with `encodeURI()`.
    ```javascript 
    let query = '?mkt=' + mkt + '&q=' + encodeURI(q);
    ```

## Handle and parse the response

1. Define a function named `response_handler()` that takes an HTTP call, `response`, as a parameter. 

2. Within this function, define a variable to contain the body of the JSON response.  
    ```javascript
    let response_handler = function (response) {
        let body = '';
    };
    ```

3. Store the body of the response when the `data` flag is called.
    ```javascript
    response.on('data', function (d) {
        body += d;
    });
    ```

4. When an `end` flag is signaled, parse the JSON, and print it.

    ```javascript
    response.on ('end', function () {
    let json = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(body), null, '  ');
    console.log (json);
    });
        ```

## Send a request

1. Create a function called `Search()` to send a search request. In it, perform the following steps:

2. Within this function, create a JSON object containing your request parameters. Use `Get` for the method, and add your host and path information. Add your subscription key to the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header. 

3. Use `https.request()` to send the request with the response handler created previously, and your search parameters.
    
   ```javascript
   let Search = function () {
    let request_params = {
        method : 'GET',
        hostname : host,
        path : path + query,
        headers : {
            'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' : subscriptionKey,
        }
    };
    
    let req = https.request (request_params, response_handler);
    req.end ();
   }
      ```

2. Call the `Search()` function.

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json
{
  "_type": "SearchResponse",
  "queryContext": {
    "originalQuery": "italian restaurant near me",
    "askUserForLocation": true
  },

      {
        "_type": "LocalBusiness",
        "webSearchUrl": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=sinful+bakery&filters=local...",
        "name": "Liberty's Delightful Sinful Bakery & Cafe",
        "url": "https://www.contoso.com/",
        "entityPresentationInfo": {
          "entityScenario": "ListItem",
          "entityTypeHints": [

          ]
        },

          "neighborhood": "Madison Park"
        },
        "telephone": "(800) 555-1212"
      },

      . . .
      {
        "_type": "Restaurant",
        "webSearchUrl": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Pickles+and+Preserves...",

        "url": "https://www.princi.com/",
        "entityPresentationInfo": {
          "entityScenario": "ListItem",
          "entityTypeHints": [
            "Place",
            "LocalBusiness",
            "Restaurant"
          ]
        },
        "address": {
          "addressLocality": "Seattle",
          "addressRegion": "WA",
          "postalCode": "98101",
          "addressCountry": "US",
          "neighborhood": "Capitol Hill"

        "telephone": "(800) 555-1212"
      },
      
      . . .
    ]
  }
}
```
