# Quickstart: Send a search request to the Bing Entity Search REST API using C#

> [!WARNING]
> Bing Search APIs are moving from Cognitive Services to Bing Search Services. Starting **October 30, 2020**, any new instances of Bing Search need to be provisioned following the process documented [here](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmove).
> Bing Search APIs provisioned using Cognitive Services will be supported for the next three years or until the end of your Enterprise Agreement, whichever happens first.
> For migration instructions, see [Bing Search Services](https://aka.ms/cogsvcs/bingmigration).

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Entity Search API and view the JSON response. This simple C# application sends a news search query to the API, and displays the response. The source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Search/BingEntitySearchv7.cs).

Although this application is written in C#, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.


## Prerequisites

- Any edition of [Visual Studio 2017 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
- Or if you're using Linux or MacOS, you can follow this quickstart using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [.NET Core](/dotnet/core/install/macos)
- [Free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet)

## Create and initialize a project

1. Create a new C# console solution in Visual Studio. 
1. Add the [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) NuGet package.
    1. Right-click your project in **Solution Explorer**.
    2. Select **Manage NuGet Packages**.
    3. Search for and select *Newtonsoft.Json*, and then install the package.
1. Then, add the following namespaces into the main code file:
    
    ```csharp
    using Newtonsoft.Json;
    using System;
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Text;
    ```

2. Create a new class, and add variables for the API endpoint, your subscription key, and the query you want to search. You can use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.

    ```csharp
    namespace EntitySearchSample
    {
        class Program
        {
            static string host = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com";
            static string path = "/bing/v7.0/entities";
    
            static string market = "en-US";
    
            // NOTE: Replace this example key with a valid subscription key.
            static string key = "ENTER YOUR KEY HERE";
    
            static string query = "italian restaurant near me";
        //...
        }
    }
    ```

## Send a request and get the API response

1. Within the class, create a function called `Search()`. Within this function, create a new `HttpClient` object, and add your subscription key to the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

2. Construct the URI for your request by combining the host and path. Then, add your market and URL-encode your query.

3. Await `client.GetAsync()` to get an HTTP response, and then store the JSON response by awaiting `ReadAsStringAsync()`.

4. Format the JSON string with `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject()` and print it to the console.

      ```csharp
      async static void Search()
      {
       //...
       HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
       client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", key);

       string uri = host + path + "?mkt=" + market + "&q=" + System.Net.WebUtility.UrlEncode(query);

       HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(uri);

       string contentString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
       dynamic parsedJson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(contentString);
       Console.WriteLine(parsedJson);
      }
      ```

5. In the `Main()` method of your application, call the `Search()` function.
    
    ```csharp
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Search();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    ```


## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json
{
  "_type": "SearchResponse",
  "queryContext": {
    "originalQuery": "italian restaurant near me",
    "askUserForLocation": true
  },
  "places": {
    "value": [
      {
        "_type": "LocalBusiness",
        "webSearchUrl": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=sinful+bakery&filters=local...",
        "name": "Liberty's Delightful Sinful Bakery & Cafe",
        "url": "https://www.contoso.com/",
        "entityPresentationInfo": {
          "entityScenario": "ListItem",
          "entityTypeHints": [
            "Place",
            "LocalBusiness"
          ]
        },
        "address": {
          "addressLocality": "Seattle",
          "addressRegion": "WA",

          "neighborhood": "Madison Park"
        },
        "telephone": "(800) 555-1212"
      },

      . . .
      {
        "_type": "Restaurant",
        "webSearchUrl": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Pickles+and+Preserves...",
        "name": "Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm",
        "url": "https://www.princi.com/",
        "entityPresentationInfo": {
          "entityScenario": "ListItem",
          "entityTypeHints": [
            "Place",
            "LocalBusiness",
            "Restaurant"
          ]
        },
        "address": {
          "addressLocality": "Seattle",
          "addressRegion": "WA",
          "postalCode": "98101",
          "addressCountry": "US",
          "neighborhood": "Capitol Hill"
        },
        "telephone": "(800) 555-1212"
      },
      
      . . .
    ]
  }
}
```
