# Quickstart for Bing Entity Search API with Ruby

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Entity Search API and view the JSON response. This simple Ruby application sends a news search query to the API, and displays the response. The source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/ruby/Search/BingEntitySearchv7.rb).

While this application is written in Ruby, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

* [Ruby 2.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or later.

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-news-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-entity-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create and initialize the application

1. In your favorite IDE or code editor, create a news Ruby file and import the following packages.

    ```ruby
    require 'net/https'
    require 'cgi'
    require 'json'
    ```

2. Create variables for your API endpoint, News search URL, your subscription key, and a search query.
    
    ```ruby
    host = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
    path = '/bing/v7.0/entities'
    
    mkt = 'en-US'
    query = 'italian restaurants near me'
    ```

## Format and make an API request

1. Create the parameters string for your request by appending your market variable to the `?mkt=` parameter. Encode your query and append it to the `&q=` parameter. Combine your API host, path, and the parameters for your request, and cast them as a URI object.

    ```ruby
    params = '?mkt=' + mkt + '&q=' + CGI.escape(query)
    uri = URI (host + path + params)
    ```

2. Use the variables from the last step to create the request. Add your subscription key to the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

    ```ruby
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
    request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = subscriptionKey
    ```

3. Send the request, and print the response

    ```ruby
    response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
        http.request (request)
    end

    puts JSON::pretty_generate (JSON (response.body))
    ```

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json
