# Quickstart: Send a search request to the Bing Entity Search REST API using Python

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Entity Search API and view the JSON response. This simple Python application sends a news search query to the API, and displays the response. The source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/python/Search/BingEntitySearchv7.py).

While this application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.x or 3.x

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-news-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-entity-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create and initialize the application

1. Create a new Python file in your favorite IDE or editor, and add the following imports. Create variables for your subscription key, endpoint, market, and a search query. You can find your endpoint in the Azure dashboard.

    ```python
    import http.client, urllib.parse
    import json
    
    subscriptionKey = 'ENTER YOUR KEY HERE'
    host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
    path = '/bing/v7.0/entities'
    mkt = 'en-US'
    query = 'italian restaurants near me'
    ```

2. Create a request url by appending your market variable to the `?mkt=` parameter. Url-encode your query and appending it to the `&q=` parameter. 
    
    ```python
    params = '?mkt=' + mkt + '&q=' + urllib.parse.quote (query)
    ```

## Send a request and get a response

1. Create a function called `get_suggestions()`. Then perform the following steps.
   1. Add your subscription key to a dictionary with `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` as a key.
   2. Use `http.client.HTTPSConnection()` to create a HTTPS client object. Send a `GET` request using `request()` with your path and parameters, and header information.
   3. Store the response with `getresponse()`, and return `response.read()`.

      ```python
      def get_suggestions ():
       headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey}
       conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection (host)
       conn.request ("GET", path + params, None, headers)
       response = conn.getresponse ()
       return response.read()
      ```

2. Call `get_suggestions()`, and print the json response.

    ```python
    result = get_suggestions ()
    print (json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=4))
    ```

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json

  "_type": "SearchResponse",
  "queryContext": {
    "originalQuery": "italian restaurant near me",
    "askUserForLocation": true

    ]
  }
