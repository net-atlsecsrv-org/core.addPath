# Authoring API changes 

The authoring APIs are updated, for V3, to allow for [model decomposition with machine-learned entities](luis-concept-data-extraction.md). 

You can author in the V2 or preview V3 APIS. The same app can also choose to use V2 or V3 prediction endpoint responses. You do not have to have the same version of API for authoring and prediction endpoint response.

The LUIS portal uses the V3 authoring APIs exclusively.

## Next steps

Review [changes to the prediction endpoint](luis-migration-api-v3.md) for V3 API.
