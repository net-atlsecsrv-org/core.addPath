# Tutorial:  Get sentiment of utterance

In this tutorial, create an app that demonstrates how to determine positive, negative, and neutral sentiment from utterances. Sentiment is determined from the entire utterance.

**In this tutorial, you learn how to:**

> * Train app
> * Publish app
> * Get sentiment of utterance from endpoint

## Sentiment analysis is a publish setting

The following utterances show examples of sentiment:

|Sentiment|Score|Utterance|
|:--|:--|:--|
|positive|0.91 |John W. Smith did a great job on the presentation in Paris.|
|positive|0.84 |The Seattle engineers did fabulous work on the Parker sales pitch.|

Sentiment analysis is a publish setting that applies to every utterance. You do not have to find the words indicating sentiment in the utterance and mark them. 

Because it is a publish setting, you do not see it on the intents or entities pages. You can see it in the [interactive test](luis-interactive-test.md#view-sentiment-results) pane or when testing at the endpoint URL. 


## Create a new app

[!INCLUDE [Follow these steps to create a new LUIS app](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-create-new-app-steps.md)]

## Add PersonName prebuilt entity 

1. Select **Build** from the navigation menu.

1. Select **Entities** from the left navigation menu.

1. Select **Add prebuilt entity** button.

1. Select the following entity from the list of prebuilt entities then select **Done**:

   * **[PersonName](luis-reference-prebuilt-person.md)** 

     ![Screenshot of number select in prebuilt entities dialog](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-sentiment-analysis/add-personname-prebuilt-entity.png)

## Create an intent to determine employee feedback

Add a new intent to capture employee feedback from members of the company. 

1. Select **Intents** from the left panel.

1. Select **Create new intent**.

1. Name the new intent  name `EmployeeFeedback`.

    ![Create new intent dialog box with EmployeeFeedback as name](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-sentiment-analysis/hr-create-new-intent-ddl.png)

4. Add several utterances that indicate an employee doing something well or an area that needs improvement:

    |Utterances|
    |--|
    |John Smith did a nice job of welcoming back a co-worker from maternity leave|
    |Jill Jones did a great job of comforting a co-worker in her time of grief.|
    |Bob Barnes didn't have all the required invoices for the paperwork.|
    |Todd Thomas turned in the required forms a month late with no signatures|
    |Katherine Kelly didn't make it to the important marketing off-site meeting.|
    |Denise Dillard missed the meeting for June reviews.|
    |Mark Mathews rocked the sales pitch at Harvard|
    |Walter Williams did a great job on the presentation at Stanford|

    Select the **View options**, select **Show entity values** to see the names.

## Add example utterances to the None intent 

[!INCLUDE [Follow these steps to add the None intent to the app](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-create-the-none-intent.md)]

## Train the app so the changes to the intent can be tested 

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Train steps](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-train.md)]

## Configure app to include sentiment analysis

1. Select **Manage** in the top right navigation, then select **Publish settings** from the left menu.

1. Select **Use sentiment analysis to determine if a user's utterance is positive, negative, or neutral.** to enable this setting. 

    ![Turn on Sentiment Analysis as publishing setting](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-sentiment-analysis/turn-on-sentiment-analysis-as-publish-setting.png)

## Publish the app so the trained model is queryable from the endpoint

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Publish steps](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-publish.md)]

## Get the sentiment of an utterance from the endpoint

1. [!INCLUDE [LUIS How to get endpoint first step](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-get-endpoint.md)]

1. Go to the end of the URL in the address and enter the following utterance:

    `Jill Jones work with the media team on the public portal was amazing` 

    The last querystring parameter is `q`, the utterance **query**. This utterance is not the same as any of the labeled utterances so it is a good test and should return the `EmployeeFeedback` intent with the sentiment analysis extracted.
    
    ```json
    {
      "query": "Jill Jones work with the media team on the public portal was amazing",
      "topScoringIntent": {
        "intent": "EmployeeFeedback",
        "score": 0.9616192
      },
      "intents": [
        {
          "intent": "EmployeeFeedback",
          "score": 0.9616192
        },
        {
          "intent": "None",
          "score": 0.09347677
        }
      ],
      "entities": [
        {
          "entity": "jill jones",
          "type": "builtin.personName",
          "startIndex": 0,
          "endIndex": 9
        }
      ],
      "sentimentAnalysis": {
        "label": "positive",
        "score": 0.8694164
      }
    }
    ```

    The sentimentAnalysis is positive with a score of 86%. 

    Try another utterance by removing the value for `q` in the address bar of the browser: `William Jones did a terrible job presenting his ideas.` The sentiment score indicates a negative sentiment by returning a low score `0.18597582`.
