# Publish your active, trained app to a staging or production endpoint

When you finish building and testing your active LUIS app, make it available to your client application by publishing it to the endpoint. 

<a name="publish-your-trained-app-to-an-http-endpoint"></a>

## Publishing

To publish to the endpoint, select **Publish** in the top, right panel. 

![Top, right nav bar](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/publish-top-nav-bar.png)

Select the correct slot when the pop-up window displays: staging or production. By using two publishing slots, this allows you to have two different versions with published endpoints or the same version on two different endpoints. 

The app is published to all regions associated with the LUIS resources added in the LUIS portal. For example, for an app created on [www.luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai), if you create a LUIS resource in **westus** and add it to the app as a resource, the app is published in that region. For more information about LUIS regions, see [Regions](luis-reference-regions.md).

When your app is successfully published, a green success notification appears at the top of the browser. The green notification bar also includes a link to the endpoints.

If you need the endpoint URL, select the link. You can also get to the endpoint URLs by selecting **Manage** in the top menu, then select **Keys and Endpoints** in the left menu. 

## Configuring publish settings

Configure publish settings by selecting **Manage** in the top, right navigation, then selecting **Publish Settings**.

### Publish after enabling sentiment analysis

<a name="enable-sentiment-analysis"></a>

Sentiment analysis allows LUIS to integrate with [Text Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) to provide sentiment and key phrase analysis. 

You do not have to provide a Text Analytics key and there is no billing charge for this service to your Azure account. Once you check this setting, it is persistent. 

Sentiment data is a score between 1 and 0 indicating the positive (closer to 1) or negative (closer to 0) sentiment of the data. The sentiment label of `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative` is per supported culture. Currently, only English supports sentiment labels. 

For more information about the JSON endpoint response with sentiment analysis, see [Sentiment analysis](luis-concept-data-extraction.md#sentiment-analysis)
