# Email prebuilt entity for a LUIS app
Email extraction includes the entire email address from an utterance. Because this entity is already trained, you do not need to add example utterances containing email to the application intents. Email entity is supported in `en-us` culture only. 

## Resolution for prebuilt email

The following entity objects are returned for the query:

`please send the information to patti@contoso.com`

#### [V3 response](#tab/V3)

The following JSON is with the `verbose` parameter set to `false`:

```json
"entities": {
    "email": [
        "patti@contoso.com"
    ]
}
```
#### [V3 verbose response](#tab/V3-verbose)

The following JSON is with the `verbose` parameter set to `true`:

```json
"entities": {
    "email": [
        "patti@contoso.com"
    ],
    "$instance": {
        "email": [
            {
                "type": "builtin.email",
                "text": "patti@contoso.com",
                "startIndex": 31,
                "length": 17,
                "modelTypeId": 2,
                "modelType": "Prebuilt Entity Extractor",
                "recognitionSources": [
                    "model"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
#### [V2 response](#tab/V2)

The following example shows the resolution of the **builtin.email** entity.

```json
"entities": [
    {
        "entity": "patti@contoso.com",
        "type": "builtin.email",
        "startIndex": 31,
        "endIndex": 55,
        "resolution": {
        "value": "patti@contoso.com"
        }
    }
]
```
