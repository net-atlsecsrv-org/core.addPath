# Use descriptors to boost signal of word list

You can add features to your LUIS app to improve its accuracy. Features help LUIS by providing hints that certain words and phrases are part of an app domain vocabulary. 

A [descriptor](luis-concept-feature.md) (phrase list) includes a group of values (words or phrases) that belong to the same class and must be treated similarly (for example, names of cities or products). What LUIS learns about one of them is automatically applied to the others as well. This list is not the same thing as a [list entity](reference-entity-list.md) (exact text matches) of matched words.

A descriptor adds to the vocabulary of the app domain as a second signal to LUIS about those words.

Review [feature concepts](luis-concept-feature.md) to understand when and why to use a descriptor.

## Add descriptor

1. Open your app by clicking its name on **My Apps** page, and then click **Build**, then click **Descriptors** in your app's left panel. 

1. On the **Descriptors** page, click **+ Add Descriptor**. 
 
1. In the **Create new phrase list descriptor** dialog box, enter a name such as `Cities` for the descriptor. In the **Value** box, type the values of the descriptors, such as `Seattle`. You can type one value at a time, or a set of values separated by commas, and then press **Enter**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add descriptor Cities](./media/luis-add-features/add-phrase-list-cities.png)

    Once you have entered enough values for LUIS, suggestions appear. You can **+ Add all** of the proposed values, or select individual terms.

1. Keep **These values are interchangeable** checked if the added descriptor values are alternatives that can be used interchangeably.

1. Select **Done**. The new descriptor is added to the **Descriptors** page.

<a name="edit-phrase-list"></a>
<a name="delete-phrase-list"></a>
<a name="deactivate-phrase-list"></a>

> [!Note]
> You can delete, or deactivate a descriptor from the contextual toolbar on the **Descriptors** page.

## Next steps

After adding, editing, deleting, or deactivating a descriptor, [train and test the app](luis-interactive-test.md) again to see if performance improves.
