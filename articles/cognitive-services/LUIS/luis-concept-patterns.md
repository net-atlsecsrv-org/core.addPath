# Patterns improve prediction accuracy
Patterns are designed to improve accuracy when several utterances are very similar.  A pattern allows you to gain more accuracy for an intent without providing many more utterances. 

## Patterns solve low intent confidence
Consider a Human Resources app that reports on the organizational chart in relation to an employee. Given an employee's name and relationship, LUIS returns the employees involved. Consider an employee, Tom, with a manager name Alice, and a team of subordinates named: Michael, Rebecca, and Carl.

|Utterances|Intent predicted|Intent score|
|--|--|--|
|Who is Tom's subordinate?|GetOrgChart|.30|
|Who is the subordinate of Tom?|GetOrgChart|.30|

If an app has between 10 and 20 utterances with different lengths of sentence, different word order, and even different words (synonyms of "subordinate", "manage", "report"), LUIS may return a low confidence score. Create a pattern to help LUIS understand the importance of the word order. 

Patterns solve the following situations: 

* The intent score is low
* The correct intent is not the top score but too close to the top score. 

## Patterns are not a guarantee of intent
Patterns use a mix of prediction technologies. Setting an intent for a template utterance in a pattern is not a guarantee of the intent prediction but it is a strong signal.

## Patterns do not improve machine-learned entity detection

A pattern is primarily meant to help the prediction of intents and roles. The pattern.any entity is used to extract free-form entities. While patterns use entities, a pattern does not help detect a machine-learned entity.  

Do not expect to see improved entity prediction if you collapse multiple utterances into a single pattern. For Simple entities to fire, you need to add utterances or use list entities else your pattern will not fire.

## Patterns use entity roles
If two or more entities in a pattern are contextually related, patterns use entity [roles](luis-concept-roles.md) to extract contextual information about entities.  

## Prediction scores with and without patterns
Given enough example utterances, LUIS would be able to increase prediction confidence without patterns. Patterns increase the confidence score without having to provide as many utterances.  

## Pattern matching
A pattern is matched based on detecting the entities inside the pattern first, then validating the rest of the words and word order of the pattern. Entities are required in the pattern for a pattern to match. The pattern is applied at the token level, not the character level. 

## Pattern syntax
Pattern syntax is a template for an utterance. The template should contain words and entities you want to match as well as words and punctuation you want to ignore. It is **not** a regular expression. 

Entities in patterns are surrounded by curly brackets, `{}`. Patterns can include entities, and entities with roles. [Pattern.any](luis-concept-entity-types.md#patternany-entity) is an entity only used in patterns. 

Pattern syntax supports the following syntax:

|Function|Syntax|Nesting level|Example|
|--|--|--|--|
|entity| {} - curly brackets|2|Where is form {entity-name}?|
|optional|[] - square brackets<BR><BR>There is a limit of 3 on nesting levels of any combination of optional and grouping |2|The question mark is optional [?]|
|grouping|() - parentheses|2|is (a \| b)|
|or| \| - vertical bar (pipe)<br><br>There is a limit of 2 on the vertical bars (Or) in one group |-|Where is form ({form-name-short} &#x7c; {form-name-long} &#x7c; {form-number})| 
|beginning and/or end of utterance|^ - caret|-|^begin the utterance<br>the utterance is done^<br>^strict literal match of entire utterance with {number} entity^|

## Nesting syntax in patterns

The **optional** syntax, with square brackets, can be nested two levels. For example: `[[this]is] a new form`. This example allows for the following utterances: 

|Nested optional utterance example|Explanation|
|--|--|
|this is a new form|matches all words in pattern|
|is a new form|matches outer optional word and non-optional words in pattern|
|a new form|matches required words only|

The **grouping** syntax, with parentheses, can be nested two levels. For example: `(({Entity1.RoleName1} | {Entity1.RoleName2} ) | {Entity2} )`. This feature allows any of the three entities to be matched. 

If Entity1 is a Location with roles such as origin (Seattle) and destination (Cairo) and Entity 2 is a known building name from a list entity (RedWest-C), the following utterances would map to this pattern:

|Nested grouping utterance example|Explanation|
|--|--|
|RedWest-C|matches outer grouping entity|
|Seattle|matches one of the inner grouping entities|
|Cairo|matches one of the inner grouping entities|

## Nesting limits for groups with optional syntax

A combination of **grouping** with **optional** syntax has a limit of 3 nesting levels.

|Allowed|Example|
|--|--|
|Yes|( [ ( test1 &#x7c; test2 ) ] &#x7c; test3 )|
|No|( [ ( [ test1 ] &#x7c; test2 ) ] &#x7c; test3 )|

## Nesting limits for groups with or-ing syntax

A combination of **grouping** with **or-ing** syntax has a limit of 2 vertical bars.

|Allowed|Example|
|--|--|
|Yes|( test1 &#x7c; test2 &#x7c; ( test3 &#x7c; test4 ) )|
|No|( test1 &#x7c; test2 &#x7c; test3 &#x7c; ( test4 &#x7c; test5 ) ) |

## Syntax to add an entity to a pattern template
To add an entity into the pattern template, surround the entity name with curly braces, such as `Who does {Employee} manage?`. 

|Pattern with entity|
|--|
|`Who does {Employee} manage?`|

## Syntax to add an entity and role to a pattern template
An entity role is denoted as `{entity:role}` with the entity name followed by a colon, then the role name. To add an entity with a role into the pattern template, surround the entity name and role name with curly braces, such as `Book a ticket from {Location:Origin} to {Location:Destination}`. 

|Pattern with entity roles|
|--|
|`Book a ticket from {Location:Origin} to {Location:Destination}`|

## Syntax to add a pattern.any to pattern template
The Pattern.any entity allows you to add an entity of varying length to the pattern. As long as the pattern template is followed, the pattern.any can be any length. 

To add a **Pattern.any** entity into the pattern template, surround the Pattern.any entity with the curly braces, such as `How much does {Booktitle} cost and what format is it available in?`.  

|Pattern with Pattern.any entity|
|--|
|`How much does {Booktitle} cost and what format is it available in?`|

|Book titles in the pattern|
|--|
|How much does **steal this book** cost and what format is it available in?|
|How much does **ask** cost and what format is it available in?|
|How much does **The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time** cost and what format is it available in?| 

The words of the book title are not confusing to LUIS because LUIS knows where the book title ends, based on the Pattern.any entity.

## Explicit lists

create an [Explicit List](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5ade550bd5b81c209ce2e5a8) through the authoring API to allow the exception when:

* Your pattern contains a [Pattern.any](luis-concept-entity-types.md#patternany-entity)
* And that pattern syntax allows for the possibility of an incorrect entity extraction based on the utterance. 

For example, suppose you have a pattern containing both optional syntax, `[]`, and entity syntax, `{}`, combined in a way to extract data incorrectly.

Consider the pattern `[find] email about {subject} [from {person}]'.

In the following utterances, the **subject** and **person** entity are extracted correctly and incorrectly:

|Utterance|Entity|Correct extraction|
|--|--|:--:|
|email about dogs from Chris|subject=dogs<br>person=Chris|âœ”|
|email about the man from La Mancha|subject=the man<br>person=La Mancha|X|

In the preceding table, the subject should be `the man from La Mancha` (a book title) but because the subject includes the optional word `from`, the title is incorrectly predicted. 

To fix this exception to the pattern, add `the man from la mancha` as an explicit list match for the {subject} entity using the [authoring API for explicit list](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5ade550bd5b81c209ce2e5a8).

## Syntax to mark optional text in a template utterance
Mark optional text in the utterance using the regular expression square bracket syntax, `[]`. The optional text can nest square brackets up to two brackets only.

|Pattern with optional text|Meaning|
|--|--|
|`[find] email about {subject} [from {person}]`|`find` and `from {person}` are optional|
|`Can you help me[?]|The punctuation mark is optional|

Punctuation marks (`?`, `!`, `.`) should be ignored and you need to ignore them using the square bracket syntax in patterns. 

## Pattern-only apps
You can build an app with intents that have no example utterances, as long as there's a pattern for each intent. For a pattern-only app, the pattern shouldn't contain machine-learned entities because these do require example utterances.
