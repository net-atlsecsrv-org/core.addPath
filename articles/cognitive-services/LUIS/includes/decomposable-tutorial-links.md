To take advantage of [decomposable concepts](../luis-concept-model.md#v3-authoring-model-decomposition), start with the machine-learning entity. Follow the [machine-learning entity tutorial](../tutorial-machine-learned-entity.md) for steps on how to create this type of entity including examples of:

* [Create and label machine-learning entity](../tutorial-machine-learned-entity.md#label-text-as-entities-in-example-utterances) with structure and a feature (phrase list) from example utterance on **Intent detail page**
* [Add prebuilt number entity](../tutorial-machine-learned-entity.md#add-prebuilt-number-entity-to-app) from the **Entities list page**.
* [Add subentity with required feature](../tutorial-machine-learned-entity.md#create-subcomponent-entity-with-constraint-to-help-extract-data) from the **Entity detail page**.
* [Label example utterance with subentity](../tutorial-machine-learned-entity.md#label-example-utterance-to-teach-luis-about-the-entity) on **Intent detail page**
