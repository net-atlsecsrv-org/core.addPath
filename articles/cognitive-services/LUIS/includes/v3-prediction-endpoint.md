1. In the LUIS portal, in the **Manage** section (top-right menu), on the **Azure Resources** page (left menu), on the **Prediction Resources** tab, copy the **Example Query** at the bottom of the page.

    Paste the URL into a new browser tab.

    The URL has your app ID, key, and slot name. The V3 prediction endpoint URL looks like:

    `https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/prediction/v3.0/apps/APP-ID/slots/SLOT-NAME/predict?subscription-key=YOUR-PREDICTION-KEY&<optional-name-value-pairs>&query=YOUR_QUERY_HERE`
