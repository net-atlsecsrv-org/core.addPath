If your apps need to be authored by other people, you need to add the associated email addresses in the Azure portal's authoring resource.

If you're the owner or administrator of your Azure subscription, you can add a contributor to the resource.

If you're not the owner or administrator of your Azure subscription, your Azure account needs to have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions.

If you have trouble with this role assignment, review:

* [Azure access control troubleshooting](../../../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#problems-with-azure-role-assignments)
