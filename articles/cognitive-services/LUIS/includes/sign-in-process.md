## Sign in to LUIS portal

A new user to LUIS needs to follow this procedure:

1. Sign in to [LUIS portal (preview)](https://preview.luis.ai), select your country and agree to the terms of use. If you see **My Apps** instead, a LUIS resource already exists and you should skip ahead to create an app.

1. Select **Create Azure resource** then select **Create an authoring resource to migrate your apps to.**

1. Fill in the details for the resource.

    ![Create authoring resource](../media/migrate-authoring-key/choose-authoring-resource-form.png)

    When **creating a new authoring resource**, provide the following information: 

    * **Resource name** - a custom name you choose, used as part of the URL for your authoring and prediction endpoint queries.
    * **Tenant** - the tenant your Azure subscription is associated with. 
    * **Subscription name** - the subscription that will be billed for the resource.
    * **Resource group** - a custom resource group name you choose or create. Resource groups allow you to group Azure resources for access and management. 
    * **Location** - the location choice is based on the **resource group** selection.
    * **Pricing tier** - the pricing tier determines the maximum transaction per second and month.

1. A summary of the resource to be created is displayed. Select **Next**.
