#Customer intent: As an API or REST developer new to the LUIS service, I want to query the LUIS endpoint of a published model using C# so that I can see the JSON prediction response.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Community 2017 edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
* C# programming language (included with VS Community 2017)
* Public app ID: df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2

## Get intent with browser

## Get intent programmatically

Use C# to query the prediction endpoint GET [API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5819c76f40a6350ce09de1ac/operations/5819c77140a63516d81aee78) to get the same results as you saw in the browser window in the previous section. 

1. Create a new console application in Visual Studio.

2. In the Visual Studio project, in the Solutions Explorer, select **Add reference**, then select **System.Web** from the Assemblies tab.

3. Overwrite Program.cs with the following code:
    
   [!code-csharp[Console app code that calls a LUIS endpoint](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/quickstarts/analyze-text/csharp/Program.cs)]

4. Replace the value of `YOUR_KEY` with your LUIS key.

5. Build and run the console application. It displays the same JSON that you saw earlier in the browser window.
