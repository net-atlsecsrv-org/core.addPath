# Tutorial: Get exact text-matched data from an utterance with list entity

In this tutorial, understand how to get data that exactly matches a predefined list of items.

**In this tutorial, you learn how to:**

> * Import app and use existing intent
> * Add list entity
> * Train, publish, and query app to get extracted data

## What is a list entity?

A list entity is an exact text match to the words in the utterance. Each item on the list can include a list of synonyms. Use a list entity when you want an exact match.

For this imported pizza application, create a list entity for the different types of pizza crust.

A list entity is a good choice for this type of data when:

* The data values are a known set.
* The set doesn't exceed the maximum LUIS [boundaries](luis-limits.md) for this entity type.
* The text in the utterance is a case-insensitive match with a synonym or the canonical name. LUIS doesn't use the list beyond the match. Stemming, plurals, and other variations are not resolved with just a list entity. To manage variations, consider using a [pattern](reference-pattern-syntax.md#syntax-to-mark-optional-text-in-a-template-utterance) with the optional text syntax.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are not sure if you want a list entity or a machine-learned entity with a phrase list as a descriptor, the best and most flexible practice is to use a machine-learned entity with a phrase list as a descriptor. This method allows LUIS to learn and extend the values of the data to extract.

## Import example .json and add utterances

1.  Download and save the [app JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-language-understanding/master/documentation-samples/tutorials/machine-learned-entity/pizza-tutorial-with-entities.json).

    [!INCLUDE [Import app steps](includes/import-app-steps.md)]

1. The imported app has an `OrderPizza` intent. Select that intent, and add a few utterances with new crust types:

    |New utterances|
    |--|--|
    |please order a pan crust small pepperoni pizza|
    |3 thin crust hawaiian pizzas|
    |deliver 2 stuffed crust pizzas with bread sticks|
    |one thick crust pizza for pickup|
    |one deep dish pepperoni pizza|

## Crust list entity

Now that the **OrderPizza** intent has example utterances with crust types, LUIS needs to understand which words represent the crust types.

Examples of the primary name and synonyms are:

|Canonical name|Synonyms|
|--|--|
|Deep dish|deep<br>deep dish crust<br>thick<br>thick crust|
|Pan|regular<br>original<br>normal<br>regular crust<br>original crust<br>normal crust|
|Stuffed|stuffed crust|
|Thin|thin crust<br>skinny<br>skinny crust|

1. Select **Entities** in the left panel.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. In the entity pop-up dialog, enter `CrustList` for the entity name, and  **List** for entity type. Select **Next**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of creating new entity pop-up dialog](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/create-pizza-crust-list-entity.png)

1. On the **Create a list entity** page, enter the canonical names and synonyms for each canonical name then select **Create**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of adding items to list entity](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/add-pizza-crust-items-list-entity.png)

    When you add a list entity to a LUIS app, you don't need to [label](label-entity-example-utterance.md) the text with the list entity. It is applied to all utterances in all intents.

## Train the app before testing or publishing

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Train steps](includes/howto-train.md)]

## Publish the app to query from the endpoint

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Publish steps](includes/howto-publish.md)]

## Get intent and entity prediction from endpoint

1. [!INCLUDE [LUIS How to get endpoint first step](includes/howto-get-endpoint.md)]

2. Go to the end of the URL in the address and enter the following utterance:

    `Deliver 2 deep dish hawaiian pizzas and a thin pepperoni`

    The last querystring parameter is `query`, the utterance **query**.


    ```json
    {
        "query": "Deliver 2 deep dish hawaiian pizzas and a thin pepperoni",
        "prediction": {
            "topIntent": "OrderPizza",

                    [
                        "Thin"
                    ]

                "$instance": {

                            ]
                        }
                    ],
                    "CrustList": [
                        {
                            "type": "CrustList",
                            "text": "deep dish",
                            "startIndex": 10,
                            "length": 9,
                            "modelTypeId": 5,
                            "modelType": "List Entity Extractor",
                            "recognitionSources": [
                                "model"
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "CrustList",
                            "text": "thin",
                            "startIndex": 42,
                            "length": 4,
                            "modelTypeId": 5,
                            "modelType": "List Entity Extractor",
                            "recognitionSources": [
                                "model"
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    The types of crust were found as exact text matches and returned in the JSON response. This information is used by the client application to process the order.

This tutorial added example utterances, then created a list entity to extract exact text matches from the utterances. After training, and publishing the app, a query to the endpoint identified the intention and returned the extracted data.
