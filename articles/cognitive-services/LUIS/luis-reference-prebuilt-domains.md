# Prebuilt domain reference for your LUIS app
This reference provides information about the [prebuilt domains](luis-how-to-use-prebuilt-domains.md), which are prebuilt collections of intents and entities that LUIS offers.

[Custom domains](luis-how-to-start-new-app.md), by contrast, start with no intents and models. You can add any prebuilt domain intents and entities to a custom model.

## Supported domains across cultures

The only supported culture is english.
