# Quickstart: Use prebuilt Home automation app

In this quickstart, create a LUIS app that uses the prebuilt domain `HomeAutomation` for turning lights and appliances on and off. This prebuilt domain provides intents, entities, and example utterances for you. When you're finished, you'll have a LUIS endpoint running in the cloud.

[!INCLUDE [Sign in to LUIS](./includes/sign-in-process.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Select authoring resource](./includes/select-authoring-resource.md)]

## Create a new app
You can create and manage your applications on **My Apps**.

1. In the LUIS portal, on the My apps list, select **+ Create**.

    ![In the LUIS portal, on the My apps list, select '+ Create.](./media/create-app-in-portal.png)

1. In the dialog box, name your application `Home Automation` then select **Done**. LUIS creates the app. The description is optional and isn't used for authoring or prediction. The prediction resource is also optional when creating a LUIS app. When you publish your app to production, you should assign a prediction resource so your app can handle many requests.

    ![In the dialog box, name your application `Home Automation`](./media/create-new-app-details.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >The culture cannot be changed once the application is created.

## Add prebuilt domain

Select **Prebuilt domains** then search for **HomeAutomation**. Select **Add domain** on the HomeAutomation card.

![Select 'Prebuilt domains' then search for 'HomeAutomation'. Select 'Add domain' on the HomeAutomation card.](media/luis-quickstart-new-app/home-automation.png)

When the domain is successfully added, the prebuilt domain box displays a **Remove domain** button.

## Intents and entities

Select **Intents** to review the HomeAutomation domain intents. The prebuilt domain intents have sample utterances.

> [!NOTE]
> **None** is an intent provided by all LUIS apps. You use it to handle utterances that don't correspond to functionality your app provides.

Select the **HomeAutomation.TurnOff** intent. You can see that the intent contains a list of utterances that are labeled with entities.

## Train the LUIS app

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Train steps](includes/howto-train.md)]

## Test your app
Once you've trained your app, you can test it. Select **Test**. Type a test utterance like `Turn off the lights` into the interactive test pane, and press Enter.

```
Turn off the lights
```

Check that the top scoring intent corresponds to the intent you expected for each test utterance.

In this example, `Turn off the lights` is correctly identified as the top scoring intent of **HomeAutomation.TurnOff**.

![Screenshot of Test panel with utterance highlighted](media/luis-quickstart-new-app/review-test-inspection-pane-in-portal.png)

Select **Inspect** to review more information about the prediction.

Select **Test** again to collapse the test pane.

## Publish the app to get the endpoint URL

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Publish steps](./includes/howto-publish.md)]

<a name="query-the-v2-api-prediction-endpoint"></a>

## Query the V3 API prediction endpoint

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to get endpoint first step](./includes/v3-prediction-endpoint.md)]

1. In the browser address bar, for the query string, make sure the following name and value bars are in the URL. If they are not in the query string, add them:

    |Name/value pair|
    |--|
    |`verbose=true`|
    |`show-all-intents=true`|

1. In the browser address bar, go to the end of the URL and enter `turn off the living room light` for the _query_ value, then press Enter.

    ```json

        "query": "turn off the living room light",
