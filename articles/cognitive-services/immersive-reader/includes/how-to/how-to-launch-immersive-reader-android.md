## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* An Immersive Reader resource configured for Azure Active Directory authentication. Follow [these instructions](../../how-to-create-immersive-reader.md) to get set up.  You will need some of the values created here when configuring the environment properties. Save the output of your session into a text file for future reference.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
* [Immersive Reader SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/immersive-reader-sdk).
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Configure authentication credentials

1. Start Android Studio, and open the project from the **immersive-reader-sdk/js/samples/quickstart-java-android** directory (Java) or the **immersive-reader-sdk/js/samples/quickstart-kotlin** directory (Kotlin).

1. Create a file named **env** inside the **/assets** folder. Add the following names and values, and supply values as appropriate. Don't commit this file into source control because it contains secrets that shouldn't be made public.
    
    ```text
    TENANT_ID=<YOUR_TENANT_ID>
    CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
    CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
    SUBDOMAIN=<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>
    ```

## Start the Immersive Reader with sample content
