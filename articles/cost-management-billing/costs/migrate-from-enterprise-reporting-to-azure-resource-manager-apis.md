# Migrate from Enterprise Reporting to Azure Resource Manager APIs

This article helps developers who have built custom solutions using the [Azure Reporting APIs for Enterprise Customers](../manage/enterprise-api.md) to migrate onto the Azure Resource Manager APIs for Cost Management. Service Principal support for the newer Azure Resource Manager APIs is now generally available. Azure Resource Manager APIs are in active development. Consider migrating to them instead of using the older Azure Reporting APIs for Enterprise Customers. The older APIs are being deprecated. This article helps you understand the differences between the Reporting APIs and the Azure Resource Manager APIs, what to expect when you migrate to the Azure Resource Manager APIs, and the new capabilities that are available with the new Azure Resource Manager APIs.

## API differences

The following information describes the differences between the older Reporting APIs for Enterprise Customers and the newer Azure Resource Manager APIs.

| **Use** | **Enterprise Agreement APIs** | **Azure Resource Manager APIs** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | API Key provisioned in the Enterprise Agreement (EA) portal | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authentication using User tokens or Service Principals. Service Principals take the place of API Keys. |
| Scopes and Permissions | All requests are at the Enrollment scope. The API Key permission assignments will determine whether data for the entire Enrollment, a Department, or a specific Account is returned. No user authentication. | Users or Service Principals are assigned access to the Enrollment, Department, or Account scope. |
| URI Endpoint | https://consumption.azure.com | https://management.azure.com |
| Development Status | In maintenance mode. On the path to deprecation. | Actively being developed |
| Available APIs | Limited to what is available currently | Equivalent APIs are available to replace each EA API. <p> Additional [Cost Management APIs](/rest/api/cost-management/) are also available to you, including: <p> <ul><li>Budgets</li><li>Alerts<li>Exports</li></ul> |

## Migration checklist

- Familiarize yourself with the [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](/rest/api/azure).
- Determine which EA APIs you use and see which Azure Resource Manager APIs to move to at [EA API mapping to new Azure Resource Manager APIs](#ea-api-mapping-to-new-azure-resource-manager-apis).
- Configure service authorization and authentication for the Azure Resource Manager APIs
  - If you're not already using Azure Resource Manager APIs, [register your client app with Azure AD](/rest/api/azure/#register-your-client-application-with-azure-ad). Registration creates a service principal for you to use to call the APIs.
  - Assign the service principal access to the scopes needed, as outlined below.
  - Update any programming code to use [Azure AD authentication](/rest/api/azure/#create-the-request) with your Service Principal.
- Test the APIs and then update any programming code to replace EA API calls with Azure Resource Manager API calls.
- Update error handling to use new error codes. Some considerations include:
  - Azure Resource Manager APIs have a timeout period of 60 seconds.
  - Azure Resource Manager APIs have rate limiting in place. This results in a 429 throttling error if rates are exceeded. Build your solutions so that you don't place too many API calls in a short time period.
- Review the other Cost Management APIs available through Azure Resource Manager and assess for use later. For more information, see [Use additional Cost Management APIs](#use-additional-cost-management-apis).

## Assign Service Principal access to Azure Resource Manager APIs

After you create a Service Principal to programmatically call the Azure Resource Manager APIs, you need to assign it the proper permissions to authorize against and execute requests in Azure Resource Manager. There are two permission frameworks for different scenarios.

### Azure Billing Hierarchy Access

To assign Service Principal permissions to your Enterprise Billing Account, Departments, or Enrollment Account scopes, use [Billing Permissions](/rest/api/billing/2019-10-01-preview/billingpermissions), [Billing Role Definitions](/rest/api/billing/2019-10-01-preview/billingroledefinitions), and [Billing Role Assignments](/rest/api/billing/2019-10-01-preview/billingroleassignments) APIs.

- Use the Billing Permissions APIs to identify the permissions that a Service Principal already has on a given scope, like a Billing Account or Department.
- Use the Billing Role Definitions APIs to enumerate the available roles that can be assigned to your Service Principal.
  - Only Read-Only EA Admin and Read-Only Department Admin roles can be assigned to Service Principals at this time.
- Use the Billing Role Assignments APIs to assign a role to your Service Principal.

The following example shows how to call the Role Assignments API to grant a Service Principal access to your billing account. We recommend using [PostMan](https://postman.com) to do these one-time permission configurations.

```json
POST https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountName}/createBillingRoleAssignment?api-version=2019-10-01-preview
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "principalId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "billingRoleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountName}/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingRoleDefinition/10000000-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-100000000000"
}

```

### Azure role-based access control

New Service Principal support extends to Azure-specific scopes, like management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. You can assign Service Principal permissions to these scopes directly [in the Azure portal](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#assign-a-role-to-the-application) or by using [Azure PowerShell](../../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md#assign-the-application-to-a-role).

## EA API mapping to new Azure Resource Manager APIs

Use the table below to identify the EA APIs that you currently use and the replacement Azure Resource Manager API to use instead.

### Reserved instance usage details

Microsoft isn't actively working on synchronous-based Reservation Details APIs. We recommend at you move to the newer SPN-supported asynchronous API call pattern as a part of the migration. Asynchronous requests better handle large amounts of data and will reduce timeout errors.

#### Supported requests

Use the following request URIs when calling the new Asynchronous Reservation Details API. Your enrollment number should be used as the `billingAccountId`. You can call the API with the following scopes:

- Enrollment: `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`

#### Sample request to generate a reservation details report

```json
POST 
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/generateReservationDetailsReport?startDate={startDate}&endDate={endDate}&api-version=2019-11-01

```

#### Sample request to poll report generation status

```json
GET
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/reservationDetailsOperationResults/{operationId}?api-version=2019-11-01

```

#### Sample poll response

```json
{
  "status": "Completed",
  "properties": {
    "reportUrl": "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/details/20200911/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000?sv=2016-05-31&sr=b&sig=jep8HT2aphfUkyERRZa5LRfd9RPzjXbzB%2F9TNiQ",
    "validUntil": "2020-09-12T02:56:55.5021869Z"
  }
}

```

## Use additional Cost Management APIs

After you've migrated to Azure Resource Manager APIs for your existing reporting scenarios, you can use many other APIs, too. The APIs are also available through Azure Resource Manager and can be automated using Service Principal-based authentication. Here's a quick summary of the new capabilities that you can use.

- [Budgets](/rest/api/consumption/budgets/createorupdate) - Use to set thresholds to proactively monitor your costs, alert relevant stakeholders, and automate actions in response to threshold breaches.

- [Alerts](/rest/api/cost-management/alerts) - Use to view alert information including, but not limited to, budget alerts, invoice alerts, credit alerts, and quota alerts.

- [Exports](/rest/api/cost-management/exports) - Use to schedule recurring data export of your charges to an Azure Storage account of your choice. It's the recommended solution for customers with a large Azure presence who want to analyze their data and use it in their own internal systems.

## Next steps

- Familiarize yourself with the [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](/rest/api/azure).
- If needed, determine which EA APIs you use and see which Azure Resource Manager APIs to move to at [EA API mapping to new Azure Resource Manager APIs](#ea-api-mapping-to-new-azure-resource-manager-apis).
- If you're not already using Azure Resource Manager APIs, [register your client app with Azure AD](/rest/api/azure/#register-your-client-application-with-azure-ad).
- If needed, update any of your programming code to use [Azure AD authentication](/rest/api/azure/#create-the-request) with your Service Principal.
