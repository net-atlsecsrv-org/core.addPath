# Programmatically create Azure subscriptions for a Microsoft Customer Agreement with the latest APIs

This article helps you programmatically create Azure subscriptions for a Microsoft Customer Agreement using the most recent API versions. If you are still using the older preview version, see [Programmatically create Azure subscriptions withÂ preview APIs](programmatically-create-subscription-preview.md). 

In this article, you learn how to create subscriptions programmatically using Azure Resource Manager.

When you create an Azure subscription programmatically, that subscription is governed by the agreement under which you obtained Azure services from Microsoft or an authorized reseller. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Legal Information](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

You must have an owner, contributor, or Azure subscription creator role on an invoice section or owner or contributor role on a billing profile or a billing account to create subscriptions. For more information, see [Subscription billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#subscription-billing-roles-and-tasks).

If you don't know whether you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement account, see [Check access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](../understand/mca-overview.md#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

The following examples use REST APIs. Currently, PowerShell and Azure CLI aren't supported.

## Find billing accounts that you have access to

Make the following request to list all the billing accounts.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getBillingAccounts)

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingaccounts/?api-version=2020-05-01

```
The API response lists the billing accounts that you have access to.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "name": "5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "properties": {
        "accountStatus": "Active",
        "accountType": "Enterprise",
        "agreementType": "MicrosoftCustomerAgreement",
        "billingProfiles": {
          "hasMoreResults": false
        },
        "displayName": "Contoso",
        "hasReadAccess": false
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `displayName` property to identify the billing account for which you want to create subscriptions. Ensure, the agreementType of the account is *MicrosoftCustomerAgreement*. Copy the `name` of the account.  For example, to create a subscription for the `Contoso` billing account, copy `5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx`. Paste the value somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.

## Find billing profiles & invoice sections to create subscriptions

The charges for your subscription appear on a section of a billing profile's invoice. Use the following API to get the list of billing profiles and invoice sections on which you have permission to create Azure subscriptions.

First you get the list of billing profiles under the billing account that you have access to.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getBillingProfiles)
```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingaccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingprofiles/?api-version=2020-05-01
```
The API response lists all the billing profiles on which you have access to create subscriptions:

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
      "name": "AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
      "properties": {
        "billingRelationshipType": "Direct",
        "billTo": {
          "addressLine1": "One Microsoft Way",
          "city": "Redmond",
          "companyName": "Contoso",
          "country": "US",
          "email": "kenny@contoso.com",
          "phoneNumber": "425xxxxxxx",
          "postalCode": "98052",
          "region": "WA"
        },
        "currency": "USD",
        "displayName": "Contoso Billing Profile",
        "enabledAzurePlans": [
          {
            "skuId": "0002",
            "skuDescription": "Microsoft Azure Plan for DevTest"
          },
          {
            "skuId": "0001",
            "skuDescription": "Microsoft Azure Plan"
          }
        ],
        "hasReadAccess": true,
        "invoiceDay": 5,
        "invoiceEmailOptIn": false,
        "invoiceSections": {
          "hasMoreResults": false
        },
        "poNumber": "001",
        "spendingLimit": "Off",
        "status": "Active",
        "systemId": "AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
        "targetClouds": []
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/billingProfiles"
    }
  ]
}
```

 Copy the `id` to next identify the invoice sections underneath the billing profile. For example, copy `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx` and call the following API.

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx/invoicesections?api-version=2020-05-01
```
### Response

```json
{
  "totalCount": 1,
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx/invoiceSections/SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
      "name": "SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
      "properties": {
        "displayName": "Development",
        "state": "Active",
        "systemId": "SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx"
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/billingProfiles/invoiceSections"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `id` property to identify the invoice section for which you want to create subscriptions. Copy the entire string. For example, `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx/invoiceSections/SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx`.

## Create a subscription for an invoice section

The following example creates a subscription named *Dev Team subscription* for the *Development* invoice section. The subscription is billed to the *Contoso Billing Profile* billing profile and appears on the *Development* section of its invoice. You use the copied billing scope from the previous step: `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx/invoiceSections/SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx`. 

### [REST](#tab/rest-MCA)

```json
PUT  https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias?api-version=2020-09-01
```

### Request body

```json

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell-MCA)

To install the latest version of the module that contains the `New-AzSubscriptionAlias` cmdlet, run `Install-Module Az.Subscription`. To install a recent version of PowerShellGet, see [Get PowerShellGet Module](/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget).

Run the following [New-AzSubscriptionAlias](/powershell/module/az.subscription/new-azsubscription) command and the billing scope `"/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx/invoiceSections/SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx"`. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzSubscriptionAlias -AliasName "sampleAlias" -SubscriptionName "Dev Team Subscription" -BillingScope "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/AW4F-xxxx-xxx-xxx/invoiceSections/SH3V-xxxx-xxx-xxx" -Workload 'Production"
```

You get the subscriptionId as part of the response from the command.

```azurepowershell
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias",
  "name": "sampleAlias",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",

  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "subscriptionId": "4921139b-ef1e-4370-a331-dd2229f4f510"
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.Subscription/aliases"
}
```

## Next steps

* Now that you've created a subscription, you can grant that ability to other users and service principals. For more information, see [Grant access to create Azure Enterprise subscriptions (preview)](grant-access-to-create-subscription.md).
* For more information about managing large numbers of subscriptions using management groups, see [Organize your resources with Azure management groups](../../governance/management-groups/overview.md).
