# Add or update a credit card for Azure

This document applies to customers who signed up for Azure online with a credit card.

In the Azure portal, you can change your default payment method to a new credit card and update your credit card details. You must be an [Account Administrator](../understand/subscription-transfer.md#whoisaa) to make these changes.

If you want to a delete credit card, see [Delete an Azure billing payment method](delete-azure-payment-method.md).

The supported payment methods for Microsoft Azure are credit cards and check/wire transfer. To get approved to pay by check/wire transfer, see [Pay for Azure subscriptions by invoice](pay-by-invoice.md).

With a Microsoft Customer Agreement, your payment methods are associated with billing profiles. Learn how to [check access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-the-type-of-your-account). If you have an MCA, skip to [manage credit cards for a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#manage-credit-cards-for-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

## Manage credit cards for an Azure subscription

The following sections apply to customers who have a Microsoft Online Services Program billing account. Learn how to [check your billing account type](#check-the-type-of-your-account). If your billing account type is Microsoft Online Services Program, payment methods are associated with individual Azure subscriptions. If you get an error after you add the credit card, see [Credit card declined at Azure sign-up](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/troubleshoot-declined-card).

### Change credit card for a subscription by adding a new credit card

You can change the default credit of your Azure subscription to a new credit card or previously saved credit card in the Azure portal. You must be the Account Administrator to change the credit card. If multiple subscriptions have the same active payment method, then changing the active payment method on any of the subscriptions also updates the active payment method on the others.

You can change your subscription's default credit card to a new one by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the Account Administrator.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.  
    ![Screenshot that shows search](./media/change-credit-card/search.png)
1. Select the subscription you'd like to add the credit card to.
1. Select **Payment methods**.  
    ![Screenshot that shows Manage payment methods option selected](./media/change-credit-card/payment-methods-blade-x.png)
1. In the top-left corner, select “+” to add a card. A credit card form will appear on the right.
1. Enter credit card details.  
    ![Screenshot that shows adding a new card](./media/change-credit-card/sub-add-new-x.png)
1. To make this card your active payment method, check the box next to **Make this my active payment method** above the form. This card will become the active payment instrument for all subscriptions using the same card as the selected subscription.
1. Select **Next**.

### Change credit card for a subscription to a previously saved credit card

You can also change your subscription's default credit card to a one that is already saved to your account by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the Account Administrator.

    ![Screenshot that shows search](./media/change-credit-card/search.png)

If your credit card number changes because the card is lost, stolen, or expired, follow the steps in the [Add a credit card as a payment method](#addcard) section. You don't need to update the CVV.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the Account Administrator.

## Troubleshooting

Azure doesn't support virtual or prepaid cards. If you're getting errors when adding or updating a valid credit card, try opening your browser in private mode.

## Frequently asked questions

The following sections answer commonly asked questions about changing your credit card information.

### Why do I keep getting "Your login session has expired. Please click here to log back in"?

If you keep getting this error message even if you've already logged out and back in, try again with a private browsing session.

### How do I use a different card for each subscription I have?

Unfortunately, if your subscriptions are already using the same card, it's not possible to separate them to use different cards. However, when you sign up for a new subscription, you can choose to use a new payment method for that subscription.

### How do I make payments?

If you set up a credit card as your payment method, we automatically charge your card after each billing period. You don't need to do anything.

If you're [paying by invoice](pay-by-invoice.md), send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.

### How do I change the tax ID?

To add or update tax ID, update your profile in the  [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), then select **Tax record**. This tax ID is used for tax exemption calculations and appears on your invoice.
