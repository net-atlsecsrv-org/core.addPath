# Managing Azure Enterprise roles

To help manage your organization's usage and spend, Azure customers with an Enterprise Agreement (EA) can assign five distinct administrative roles:

- Enterprise Administrator
- Enterprise Administrator (read only)<sup>1</sup>
- Department Administrator
- Department Administrator (read only)
- Account Owner<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup> The Bill-To contact of the EA contract will be under this role.

<sup>2</sup> The Bill-To contact cannot be added or changed in the Azure EA Portal and will be added to the EA enrollment based on the user who is set up as the Bill-To contact on agreement level. To change the Bill-To contact, a request needs to be made through a partner/software advisor to the Regional Operations Center (ROC).

The first enrollment administrator that is set up during the enrollment provisioning determines the authentication type of the Bill-to contact account. When the bill-to contact gets added to the EA Portal as a read-only administrator, they are given Microsoft account authentication. 

For example, if the initial authentication type is set to Mixed, the EA will be added as a Microsoft account and the Bill-to contact will have read-only EA admin privileges. If the EA admin doesn’t approve Microsoft account authorization for an existing Bill-to contact, the EA admin may delete the user in question and ask the customer to add the user back as a read-only administrator with a Work or School account Only set at enrollment level in the EA portal.

These roles are specific to managing Azure Enterprise Agreements and are in addition to the built-in roles Azure has to control access to resources. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

The following sections describe the limitations and capabilities of each role.

## User limit for admin roles

|Role| User limit|
|---|---|
|Enterprise Administrator|Unlimited|
|Enterprise Administrator (read only)|Unlimited|
|Department Administrator|Unlimited|
|Department Administrator (read only)|Unlimited|
|Account Owner|1 per account<sup>3</sup>|

<sup>3</sup> Each account requires a unique Microsoft account, or work or school account.

## Add a new enterprise administrator

Enterprise administrators have the most privileges when managing an Azure EA enrollment. The initial Azure EA admin was created when the EA agreement was set up. However, you can add or remove new admins at any time. New admins are only added by existing admins. For more information about adding  additional enterprise admins, see [Create another enterprise admin](ea-portal-get-started.md#create-another-enterprise-administrator). For more information about billing profile roles and tasks, see [Billing profile roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#billing-profile-roles-and-tasks).

## Update account owner state from pending to active

When new Account Owners (AO) are added to an Azure EA enrollment for the first time, their status appears as _pending_. When a new account owner receives the activation welcome email, they can sign in to activate their account. Once they activate their account, the account status is updated from _pending_ to _active_. The account owner needs to read the 'Warning' message and select **Continue**. New users might get prompted enter their first and last name to create a Commerce Account. If so, they must add the required information to continue and then the account is activated.

## Add a department Admin

After an Azure EA admin creates a department, the Azure Enterprise administrator can add department administrators and associate each one to a department. A department administrator can create new accounts. New accounts are needed for Azure EA subscriptions to get created.

For more information about adding a department admin, see [Create an Azure EA department admin](ea-portal-get-started.md#add-a-department-administrator).

## Usage and costs access by role

|Tasks| Enterprise Administrator|Enterprise Administrator (read only)|Department Administrator|Department Administrator (read only) |Account Owner| Partner|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|View credit balance including Azure Prepayment|✔|✔|✘|✘|✘|✔|
|View department spending quotas|✔|✔|✘|✘|✘|✔|

|View usage and cost details|✔|✔|✔<sup>6</sup>|✔<sup>6</sup>|✔<sup>7</sup>|✔|
|Manage resources in Azure portal|✘|✘|✘|✘|✔|✘|

- <sup>6</sup> Requires that the Enterprise Administrator enable **DA view charges** policy in the Enterprise portal. The Department Administrator can then see cost details for the department.
- <sup>7</sup> Requires that the Enterprise Administrator enable **AO view charges** policy in the Enterprise portal. The Account Owner can then see cost details for the account.

## See pricing for different user roles

You may see different pricing in the Azure portal depending on your administrative role and how the view charges policies are set by the Enterprise Administrator. The two policies in the Enterprise portal that affect the pricing you see in the Azure portal are:

- DA view charges
- AO view charges

To learn how to set these policies, see [Manage access to billing information for Azure](manage-billing-access.md).

The following table shows the relationship between the Enterprise Agreement admin roles, the view charges policy, the Azure role in the Azure portal, and the pricing that you see in the Azure portal. The Enterprise Administrator always sees usage details based on the organization's EA pricing. However, the Department Administrator and Account Owner see different pricing views based on the view charge policy and their Azure role. The Department Admin role listed in the following table refers to both Department Admin and Department Admin (read only) roles.

|Enterprise Agreement admin role|View charges policy for role|Azure role|Pricing view|
|---|---|---|---|
|Account Owner OR Department Admin|✔ Enabled|Owner|Organization's EA pricing|
|Account Owner OR Department Admin|✘ Disabled|Owner|Retail pricing|
|Account Owner OR Department Admin|✔ Enabled |none|No pricing|
|Account Owner OR Department Admin|✘ Disabled |none|No pricing|
|None|Not applicable |Owner|Retail pricing|

You set the Enterprise admin role and view charges policies in the Enterprise portal. The Azure role can be updated in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Manage access using RBAC and the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
