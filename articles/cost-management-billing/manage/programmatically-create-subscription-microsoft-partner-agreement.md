# Programmatically create Azure subscriptions for a Microsoft Partner Agreement with the latest APIs

This article helps you programmatically create Azure subscriptions for a Microsoft Partner Agreement using the most recent API versions. If you are still using the older preview version, see [Programmatically create Azure subscriptions withÂ preview APIs](programmatically-create-subscription-preview.md). 

In this article, you learn how to create subscriptions programmatically using Azure Resource Manager.

When you create an Azure subscription programmatically, that subscription is governed by the agreement under which you obtained Azure services from Microsoft or an authorized reseller. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Legal Information](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

You must have a Global Admin or  Admin Agent role in your organization's cloud solution provider account to create subscription for your billing account. For more information, see [Partner Center - Assign users roles and permissions](/partner-center/permissions-overview).

If you don't know whether you have access to a Microsoft Partner Agreement account, see [Check access to a Microsoft Partner Agreement](mpa-request-ownership.md#check-access-to-a-microsoft-partner-agreement).

The following examples use REST APIs. Currently, PowerShell and Azure CLI aren't supported.

## Find the billing accounts that you have access to

Make the following request to list all billing accounts that you have access to.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getBillingAccount-MPA)

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingaccounts/?api-version=2020-05-01
```

The API response lists the billing accounts.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "name": "99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "properties": {
        "accountStatus": "Active",
        "accountType": "Partner",
        "agreementType": "MicrosoftPartnerAgreement",
        "billingProfiles": {
          "hasMoreResults": false
        },
        "displayName": "Contoso",
        "hasReadAccess": true
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `displayName` property to identify the billing account for which you want to create subscriptions. Ensure, the agreementType of the account is *MicrosoftPartnerAgreement*. Copy the `name` for the account. For example, to create a subscription for the `Contoso` billing account, copy `99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx`. Paste the value somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.

## Find customers that have Azure plans

Make the following request, with the `name` copied from the first step (```99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx```) to list all customers in the billing account for whom you can create Azure subscriptions.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getCustomers)

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers?api-version=2020-05-01
```

The API response lists the customers in the billing account with Azure plans. You can create subscriptions for these customers.

```json
{
  "totalCount": 2,
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/7d15644f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "7d15644f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "properties": {
        "billingProfileDisplayName": "Fabrikam toys Billing Profile",
        "billingProfileId": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/YL4M-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
        "displayName": "Fabrikam toys"
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/customers"
    },
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/acba85c9-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "acba85c9-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "properties": {
        "billingProfileDisplayName": "Contoso toys Billing Profile",
        "billingProfileId": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/YL4M-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
        "displayName": "Contoso toys"
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/customers"
    }
  ]
}

```

Use the `displayName` property to identify the customer for which you want to create subscriptions. Copy the `id` for the customer. For example, to create a subscription for `Fabrikam toys`, copy `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/7d15644f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. Paste the value somewhere to use it in later steps.

## Get the resellers for a customer

This section is optional for Indirect providers only.

If you're an Indirect provider in the CSP two-tier model, you can specify a reseller while creating subscriptions for customers.

Make the following request, with the `id` copied from the second step (```/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2281f543-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx```) to list all resellers that are available for a customer.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getIndirectResellers)

```json
GET "https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2281f543-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx?$expand=resellers&api-version=2020-05-01"
```
The API response lists the resellers for the customer:

```json
{
  "value": [{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2ed2c490-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "name": "2ed2c490-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/customers",
  "properties": {
    "billingProfileDisplayName": "Fabrikam toys Billing Profile",
    "billingProfileId": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/billingProfiles/YL4M-xxxx-xxx-xxx",
    "displayName": "Fabrikam toys",
    "resellers": [
      {
        "resellerId": "3xxxxx",
        "description": "Wingtip"
      }
    ]
  }
}]
}
```

Use the `description` property to identify the reseller who is associated with the subscription. Copy the `resellerId` for the reseller. For example, to associate `Wingtip`, copy `3xxxxx`. Paste the value somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell-MPA)

To install the latest version of the module that contains the `New-AzSubscriptionAlias` cmdlet, run `Install-Module Az.Subscription`. To install a recent version of PowerShellGet, see [Get PowerShellGet Module](/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget).

Run the following [New-AzSubscriptionAlias](/powershell/module/az.subscription/new-azsubscription) command, using the billing scope `"/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2281f543-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzSubscriptionAlias -AliasName "sampleAlias" -SubscriptionName "Dev Team Subscription" -BillingScope "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2281f543-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" -Workload 'Production"

```azurepowershell
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias",
  "name": "sampleAlias",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "subscriptionId": "4921139b-ef1e-4370-a331-dd2229f4f510"

}
```

Pass the optional *resellerId* copied from the second step in the `New-AzSubscriptionAlias` call.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli-MPA)

First, install the extension by running `az extension add --name account` and `az extension add --name alias`.

## Next steps

* Now that you've created a subscription, you can grant that ability to other users and service principals. For more information, see [Grant access to create Azure Enterprise subscriptions (preview)](grant-access-to-create-subscription.md).
* For more information about managing large numbers of subscriptions using management groups, see [Organize your resources with Azure management groups](../../governance/management-groups/overview.md).
