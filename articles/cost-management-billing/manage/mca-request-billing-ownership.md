# Get billing ownership of Azure subscriptions from other accounts

You might want to take over ownership of Azure subscriptions if the existing billing owner is leaving your organization, or when you want to pay for the subscriptions through your billing account. Taking ownership transfers subscription billing responsibilities to your account.

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-for-access).

To request the billing ownership, you must be an **invoice section owner** or **invoice section contributor**. To learn more, see [invoice section roles tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).

The person that you're requesting billing ownership from must have one of the following roles:

- For an Enterprise Microsoft Customer Agreement, the user be a Billing Owner.
- For an Enterprise Agreement, the user must be an Account Owner.
- For a Microsoft Online Service Program billing account, the user must be an Account Administrator.

For more information, see [view your billing accounts in Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md).

## Request billing ownership

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an invoice section owner or contributor for a billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.  
    ![Screenshot that shows Azure portal search for cost management + billing](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png)
1. In the billing scopes page, select **Billing scopes** and then select the billing account, which would be used to pay for the subscriptions' usage. The billing account should be of type **Microsoft Customer Agreement**.  
    [![Screenshot that shows search in portal for cost management + billing](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/list-of-scopes.png)](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/list-of-scopes.png#lightbox)
    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure portal remembers the last billing scope that you access and displays the scope the next time you come to Cost Management + Billing page. You won't see the billing scopes page if you have visited Cost Management + Billing earlier. If so, check that you are in the [right scope](#check-for-access). If not, [switch the scope](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal) to select the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
1. Select **Billing profiles** from the left-hand side.  
    [![Screenshot that shows selecting billing profiles](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-profiles.png)](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-profiles.png#lightbox)
    > [!Note]
    > If you don't see Billing profiles, you are not in the right billing scope. You need to select a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement and then select Billing profiles. To learn how to change scopes, see [Switch billing scopes in the Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal).
1. Select a **Billing profile** from the list. Once you take over the ownership of the subscriptions, their usage  will be billed to this billing profile.
1. Select **Invoice sections** from the left-hand side.  
    [![Screenshot that shows selecting invoice sections](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-invoice-sections.png)](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-invoice-sections.png#lightbox)   
1. Select an invoice section from the list. Once you take over the ownership of the subscriptions, their usage will be assigned to this section of the billing profile's invoice.
1. Select **Transfer requests** from the lower-left side and then select **Add a new request**.  
    [![Screenshot that shows selecting transfer requests](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-transfer-requests.png)](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-transfer-requests.png#lightbox)
1. Enter the email address of the user you're requesting billing ownership from. Select **Send transfer request**.  
    [![Screenshot that shows sending a transfer request](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-send-transfer-requests.png)](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-send-transfer-requests.png#lightbox)
1. The user gets an email with instructions to review your transfer request.  
    ![Screenshot that shows review transfer request email](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-review-transfer-request-email.png)
1. To approve the transfer request, the user selects the link in the email and follows the instructions.
    [![Screenshot that shows review transfer request](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-requests.png)](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-requests.png#lightbox)
    The user can select the billing account that they want to transfer Azure products from. Once selected, eligible products that can be transferred are shown. **Note:** Disabled subscriptions can't be transferred and will show up in the "Non-transferrable Azure Products" list if applicable. Once the Azure products to be transferred are selected, select **Validate**.
1. The **Transfer Validation Result** area will show the impact of the Azure products that are going to be transferred. Here are the possible states:
    * **Passed** - Validation for this Azure product has passed and can be transferred.
    * **Warning** - There's a warning for the selected Azure product. While the product can still be transferred, doing so will have some impact that the user should be aware of in case they want to take mitigating actions. For example, the Azure subscription being transferred is benefitting from an RI. After transfer, the subscription will no longer receive that benefit. To maximize savings, ensure that the RI is associated to another subscription that can use its benefits. Instead, the user can also choose to go back to the selection page and unselect this Azure subscription.
    * **Failed** - The selected Azure product can't be transferred because of an error. User will need to go back to the selection page and unselect this product to transfer the other selected Azure products.

## Additional information

The following section provides additional information about transferring subscriptions.

### No service downtime

Azure services in the subscription keep running without any interruption. We only transition the billing relationship for the Azure subscriptions that the user selects to transfer.

### Disabled subscriptions

Disabled subscriptions can't be transferred. Subscriptions must be in active state to transfer their billing ownership.

### Azure resources transfer

All resources from the subscriptions like VMs, disks, and websites transfer.

### Azure Marketplace products transfer

Azure Marketplace products transfer along with their respective subscriptions.

### Azure Reservations transfer

If you're transferring Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscriptions or Microsoft Customer Agreements, Azure Reservations don't automatically move with the subscriptions. [Contact Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to move Reservations.

### Access to Azure services

Access for existing users, groups, or service principals that was assigned using [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) isn't affected during the transition.

### Azure support plan

Azure support doesn't transfer with the subscriptions. If the user transfers all Azure subscriptions, ask them to cancel their support plan.

### Charges for transferred subscription

The original billing owner of the subscriptions is responsible for any charges that were reported up to the point that the transfer is completed. Your invoice section is responsible for charges reported from the time of transfer onwards. There may be some charges that took place before transfer but was reported afterwards. These charges show up on your invoice section.

### Cancel a transfer request

You can cancel the transfer request until the request is approved or declined. To cancel the transfer request, go to the [transfer details page](#check-the-transfer-request-status) and select cancel from the bottom of the page.

### Software as a Service (SaaS) transfer

SaaS products don't transfer with the subscriptions. Ask the user to [Contact Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to transfer billing ownership of SaaS products. Along with the billing ownership, the user can also transfer resource ownership. Resource ownership lets you conduct management operations like deleting and viewing the details of the product. The user must be a resource owner on the SaaS product to transfer resource ownership.
