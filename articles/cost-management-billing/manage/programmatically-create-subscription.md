# Programmatically create Azure subscriptions with the latest APIs

This article helps you programmatically create Azure subscriptions using the most recent API versions. If you are still using the older preview version, see [Programmatically create Azure subscriptions withÂ preview APIs](programmatically-create-subscription-preview.md). 

Azure customers with a billing account for the following agreement types can create subscriptions programmatically:

- [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/)
- [Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/microsoft-customer-agreement/)
- [Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/news/introducing-microsoft-partner-agreement)

In this article, you learn how to create subscriptions programmatically using Azure Resource Manager.

When you create an Azure subscription programmatically, that subscription is governed by the agreement under which you obtained Azure services from Microsoft or an authorized reseller. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Legal Information](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Create subscriptions for an EA billing account

Use the information in the following sections to create EA subscriptions.

### Prerequisites

You must have an Owner role on an Enrollment Account to create a subscription. There are two ways to get the role:

* The Enterprise Administrator of your enrollment can [make you an Account Owner](https://ea.azure.com/helpdocs/addNewAccount) (sign in required) which makes you an Owner of the Enrollment Account.
* An existing Owner of the Enrollment Account can [grant you access](grant-access-to-create-subscription.md). Similarly, to use a service principal to create an EA subscription, you must [grant that service principal the ability to create subscriptions](grant-access-to-create-subscription.md).

### Find accounts you have access to

After you're added to an Enrollment Account associated to an Account Owner, Azure uses the account-to-enrollment relationship to determine where to bill the subscription charges. All subscriptions created under the account are billed to the EA enrollment that the account is in. To create subscriptions, you must pass in values about the enrollment account and the user principals to own the subscription.

To run the following commands, you must be logged in to the Account Owner's *home directory*, which is the directory that subscriptions are created in by default.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getEnrollments)

Request to list all enrollment accounts you have access to:

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingaccounts/?api-version=2020-05-01
```

The API response lists all enrollment accounts you have access to:

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/1234567",
      "name": "1234567",
      "properties": {
        "accountStatus": "Unknown",
        "accountType": "Enterprise",
        "agreementType": "EnterpriseAgreement",
        "soldTo": {
          "companyName": "Contoso",
          "country": "US "
        },
        "billingProfiles": {
          "hasMoreResults": false
        },
        "displayName": "Contoso",
        "enrollmentAccounts": [
          {
            "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/1234567/enrollmentAccounts/7654321",
            "name": "7654321",
            "type": "Microsoft.Billing/enrollmentAccounts",
            "properties": {
              "accountName": "Contoso",
              "accountOwnerEmail": "kenny@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
              "costCenter": "Test",
              "isDevTest": false
            }
          }
        ],
        "hasReadAccess": false
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts"
    }
  ]
}

```

Note the `id` from one of your `enrollmentAccounts`. It's the billing scope under which a subscription creation request is initiated.

### Create subscriptions under a specific enrollment account

The following example creates a subscription named *Dev Team Subscription* in the enrollment account selected in the previous step. 

### [REST](#tab/rest-EA)

Call the PUT API to create a subscription creation request/alias.

```json
PUT  https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias?api-version=2020-09-01 
```

In the request body, provide as the `billingScope` the `id` from one of your `enrollmentAccounts`.

```json 
{
  "properties": {
	    "billingScope": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/BillingAccounts/1234567/enrollmentAccounts/7654321",
	    "DisplayName": "Dev Team Subscription", //Subscription Display Name
	    "Workload": "Production"
  }
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias",
  "name": "sampleAlias",
  "type": "Microsoft.Subscription/aliases",
  "properties": {
    "subscriptionId": "b5bab918-e8a9-4c34-a2e2-ebc1b75b9d74",
    "provisioningState": "Accepted"
  }
}
```

You can do a GET on the same URL to get the status of the request.

### Request

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias?api-version=2020-09-01
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias",

  "type": "Microsoft.Subscription/aliases",
  "properties": {
    "subscriptionId": "b5bab918-e8a9-4c34-a2e2-ebc1b75b9d74",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  }
}
```

An in-progress status is returned as an `Accepted` state under `provisioningState`.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell-EA)

To install the latest version of the module that contains the `New-AzSubscriptionAlias` cmdlet, run `Install-Module Az.Subscription`. To install a recent version of PowerShellGet, see [Get PowerShellGet Module](/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget).

Run the following [New-AzSubscriptionAlias](/powershell/module/az.subscription/new-azsubscription) command, using the billing scope `"/providers/Microsoft.Billing/BillingAccounts/1234567/enrollmentAccounts/7654321"`. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzSubscriptionAlias -AliasName "sampleAlias" -SubscriptionName "Dev Team Subscription" -BillingScope "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/BillingAccounts/1234567/enrollmentAccounts/7654321" -Workload 'Production"
```

You get the subscriptionId as part of the response from the command.

```azurepowershell
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias",
  "name": "sampleAlias",
  "type": "Microsoft.Subscription/aliases",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "subscriptionId": "4921139b-ef1e-4370-a331-dd2229f4f510"

Run the following [az account alias create](/cli/azure/ext/account/account/alias?view=azure-cli-latest#ext_account_az_account_alias_create&preserve-view=true) command and provide `billing-scope` and `id` from one of your `enrollmentAccounts`. 

```azurecli-interactive
az account alias create --name "sampleAlias" --billing-scope "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/1234567/enrollmentAccounts/654321" --display-name "Dev Team Subscription" --workload "Production"
```

You get the subscriptionId as part of the response from the command.

```azurecli
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/aliases/sampleAlias",
  "name": "sampleAlias",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "subscriptionId": "4921139b-ef1e-4370-a331-dd2229f4f510"

### Limitations of Azure Enterprise subscription creation API

- Only Azure Enterprise subscriptions are created using the API.
- There's a limit of 2000 subscriptions per enrollment account. After that, more subscriptions for the account can only be created in the Azure portal. To create more subscriptions through the API, create another enrollment account. Canceled, deleted, and transferred subscriptions count toward the 2000 limit.
- Users who aren't Account Owners, but were added to an enrollment account via Azure RBAC, can't create subscriptions in the Azure portal.
- You can't select the tenant for the subscription to be created in. The subscription is always created in the home tenant of the Account Owner. To move the subscription to a different tenant, see [change subscription tenant](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory.md).


## Create subscriptions for an MCA account

Use the information in the following sections to create MCA subscriptions.

### Prerequisites

You must have an owner, contributor, or Azure subscription creator role on an invoice section or owner or contributor role on a billing profile or a billing account to create subscriptions. For more information, see [Subscription billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#subscription-billing-roles-and-tasks).

The following examples use REST APIs. Currently, PowerShell and Azure CLI aren't supported.

### Find billing accounts that you have access to

Make the following request to list all the billing accounts.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getBillingAccounts)

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingaccounts/?api-version=2020-05-01

```
The API response lists the billing accounts that you have access to.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "name": "5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "properties": {
        "accountStatus": "Active",
        "accountType": "Enterprise",
        "agreementType": "MicrosoftCustomerAgreement",
        "billingProfiles": {
          "hasMoreResults": false
        },
        "displayName": "Contoso",
        "hasReadAccess": false
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `displayName` property to identify the billing account for which you want to create subscriptions. Ensure, the agreementType of the account is *MicrosoftCustomerAgreement*. Copy the `name` of the account.  For example, to create a subscription for the `Contoso` billing account, copy `5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx`. Paste the value somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.

### Optional for Indirect providers: Get the resellers for a customer

If you're an Indirect provider in the CSP two-tier model, you can specify a reseller while creating subscriptions for customers.

Make the following request, with the `id` copied from the second step (```/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2281f543-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx```) to list all resellers that are available for a customer.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getIndirectResellers)

```json
GET "https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2281f543-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx?$expand=resellers&api-version=2020-05-01"
```
The API response lists the resellers for the customer:

```json
{
  "value": [{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/99a13315-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx/customers/2ed2c490-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "name": "2ed2c490-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/customers",
  "properties": {
    "billingProfileDisplayName": "Fabrikam toys Billing Profile",

    "displayName": "Fabrikam toys",
    "resellers": [
      {
        "resellerId": "3xxxxx",
        "description": "Wingtip"
      }
    ]
  }
}]
}
```

Use the `description` property to identify the reseller who is associated with the subscription. Copy the `resellerId` for the reseller. For example, to associate `Wingtip`, copy `3xxxxx`. Paste the value somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.

## Create subscriptions using ARM templates

You can create subscriptions on your Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template), allowing you to automate your production/test deployment processes. In the following example, you use an ARM template to create an Azure subscription and an Azure resource group.

### Prerequisites

To create subscriptions you must have one of the below roles: 

- Azure Subscription Owner on an Inovice Section
- Azure Subscription Contributor on an Inovice Section
- Azure Subscription Creator role on an Inovice Section
- Azure Subcription Owner on a Billing Profile or a Billing account
- Azure Subscription Contributor Role on a Billing Profile or a Billing account

 For more information, see [Subscription billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#subscription-billing-roles-and-tasks).

Additionally, since you are doing an ARM template deployment, you need to have write permissions on the root object. So if you're creating the ARM deployment under a management group, you need to have write permissions on the management group. Note that the action is purely to create an ARM deployment, if a subscription is created, it is created only in the management group specified in the ARM template.

The following examples use REST APIs. Currently, PowerShell and Azure CLI aren't supported.

### Find billing accounts that you have access to

Make the following request to list all the billing accounts.

### [REST](#tab/rest-getBillingAccounts)

```json
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingaccounts/?api-version=2020-05-01
```

The API response lists the billing accounts that you have access to.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "name": "5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx",
      "properties": {
        "accountStatus": "Active",
        "accountType": "Enterprise",
        "agreementType": "MicrosoftCustomerAgreement",
        "billingProfiles": {
          "hasMoreResults": false
        },
        "displayName": "Contoso",
        "hasReadAccess": false
      },
      "type": "Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `displayName` property to identify the billing account for which you want to create subscriptions. Ensure, the agreementType of the account is *MicrosoftCustomerAgreement*. Copy the `name` of the account. For example, to create a subscription for the `Contoso` billing account, copy `5e98e158-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx-xx-xx`. Paste the value somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.
