# View and download your Microsoft Azure invoice

For most subscriptions, you can download your invoice from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) or have it sent in email. If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), you can't download your organization's invoices. Invoices are sent to whoever is set up to receive invoices for the enrollment.

Only certain roles have permission to view invoices. For example, the Account Administrator or Enterprise Administrator. For more information about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](../manage/manage-billing-access.md).

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), you must have one of the following roles to get your invoices:

- Billing profile Owner
- Contributor
- Reader
- Invoice manager

If you have a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), you must be the Global Admin or Admin Agent in the partner organization to view and download Azure invoices. [Check your billing account type](#check-your-billing-account-type) to figure out what permissions you need.

<!-- For more information about billing roles for Microsoft Customer Agreements, see [Billing profile roles and tasks](../manage/understand-mca-roles.md#billing-profile-roles-and-tasks). -->

## <a name="noinvoice"></a> Why you might not get an invoice

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.

- Azure bills you at the end of your invoice period. So, an invoice might not have been generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.

- You don't have permission to view invoices. If you have an MCA or MPA, you must be the billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager. For other subscriptions, you might not see old invoices if you aren't the Account Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](../manage/manage-billing-access.md).

- If you have a Free Trial or a monthly credit amount with your subscription, you only get an invoice when you exceed the monthly credit amount. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement or Microsoft Partner Agreement, you always receive an invoice.
