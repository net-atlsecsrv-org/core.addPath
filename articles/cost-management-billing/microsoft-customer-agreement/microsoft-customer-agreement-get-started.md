# Key next steps after accepting your Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article helps you get started as you begin to manage Azure billing and subscriptions under your new Microsoft Customer Agreement.

Some of the benefits under the agreement include:

- Flexibility to choose how you want to pay for your Azure consumption.
- Free tools to help you understand and optimize your costs.
- A single place to manage your Azure purchases at Azure.com.

## How billing works under the agreement

When you or your organization signed the Microsoft Customer Agreement, a billing account was automatically created. You use your Microsoft Customer Agreement (billing account) to track costs and manage billing. By default, the user who accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement becomes the owner of the billing account. They have permission to manage billing for the account. The user can add other users, who also have permission to view and manage the billing account.

- [Organize your costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RxTfShGHwU) and [customize billing to meet your needs](../manage/mca-section-invoice.md).

## Start building your solutions in Azure

When you move existing subscriptions to your Microsoft Customer Agreement billing profile, service isn't changed and there's no service downtime.

If you're a new customer, Azure automatically creates a default subscription for you. You can use the subscription to create resources and build your solutions. When you have existing pay-as-you-go subscriptions, you can link your subscriptions to the new MCA billing account by using billing ownership transfer.

- [Move your existing pay-as-you-go subscriptions](../manage/mca-request-billing-ownership.md).
- [Move your existing EA subscriptions](../manage/mca-setup-account.md).
- No previous Azure subscriptions? [Create an additional Azure subscription](../manage/create-subscription.md).

After your subscriptions are moved, access to the subscriptions is unchanged for your users. All consumption against the subscriptions route invoices under your new contract.

When you start consuming Azure services, your new invoice under the Microsoft Customer Agreement is generated on the fifth day of every month. Your default payment method is wire transfer. To learn how to set up your payment method to avoid delays, see [How to pay for your subscription](../understand/pay-bill.md#wire-bank-details). The article explains how to get the required bank payment information.

## Confirm payment details

When you move from a pay-as-you-go or an enterprise agreement to a Microsoft Customer Agreement, your payment method changes. The following table compares your previous payment method against your new one.

| MCA purchase method | Previous payment method - Credit card | Previous payment method - Invoice | New payment method under MCA - Credit card | New payment method under MCA - Invoice |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |
| Through a Microsoft representative |  | ✔  |  ✔ <sup>4</sup> | ✔ <sup>2</sup> |
| Azure website | ✔ | ✔ <sup>1</sup> | ✔ | ✔ <sup>3</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> By request.

<sup>2</sup> You continue to pay by invoice/wire transfer under the MCA but will need to send your payments to a different bank account. For information about where to send your payment, see [Pay your bill](../understand/pay-bill.md#wire-bank-details) after you select your country in the list.

<sup>3</sup> For more information, see [Pay for your Azure subscription by invoice](../manage/pay-by-invoice.md).

<sup>4</sup> For more information, see [Pay your bill for Microsoft Azure](../understand/pay-bill.md#pay-now-in-the-azure-portal).

## Complete outstanding payments

Make sure that you complete any outstanding payments for your older [pay-as-you-go](../understand/download-azure-invoice.md) or [EA](../manage/ea-portal-enrollment-invoices.md) contract subscription invoices. For more information, see [Understand your Microsoft Customer Agreement Invoice in Azure](../understand/mca-understand-your-invoice.md#billing-period).

## Update a PO number

By default, an invoice for billing profile doesn't have an associated PO number. After you add a PO number for a billing profile, it appears on invoices for the billing profile.

To add or change the PO number for a billing profile, use the following steps.

1.	Sign in to the Azure portal.
1.	Search for **Cost Management + Billing** and then select **Billing scopes**.
1.	Select your billing scope.
1.	In the left menu under **Billing**, select **Billing profiles**.
1.	Select the appropriate billing profile.
1.	In the left menu under **Settings**, select **Properties**.
1.	Select **Update PO number**.
1.	Enter a PO number and then select **Update**.


## Update your tax ID

Ensure you update your tax ID after moving your subscriptions. The tax ID is used for tax exemption calculations and appears on your invoice.

**To update billing account information**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/) or [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com/).
1. Select **Manage**, and then select **Billing accounts**.
1. On **Overview**, select **Edit billing account information**.
1. Make your updates, and then select **Save**.
