# Azure security baseline for Cost Management

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Cost Management. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Cost Management. **Controls** not applicable to Cost Management have been excluded.

To see how Cost Management completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Cost Management security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management.md).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Cost Management is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that is Azure's default identity and access management service. You should standardize on Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:

- Microsoft cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machines (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.

- Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Securing Azure AD should be a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you assess your identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

Note: Azure AD supports external identity providers, which allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

- [Tenancy in Azure AD](../active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps.md)

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md)

- [What is the identity secure score in Azure AD](../active-directory/fundamentals/identity-secure-score.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Azure Cost Management uses Azure Active Directory to provide identity and access management to
Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This
includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external
identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. This enables single
sign-on (SSO) to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and
resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications,
and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility
and control.

- [Understand Application SSO with Azure AD](../active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Azure Cost Management is integrated with Azure AD that supports strong authentication controls through multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong passwordless methods.

- Multi-factor authentication - Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.

- Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

- [How to enable MFA in Azure](../active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted.md) 

- [Introduction to passwordless authentication options for Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless.md)

- [Eliminate bad passwords using Azure AD Password Protection](../active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Azure Cost Management is integrated with Azure Active Directory in which provides the following data sources:

- Sign-ins - The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

- Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

- Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

These data sources can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third party SIEM systems.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

- [How to integrate Azure Activity Logs into Azure Monitor](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access.md).*

### PA-1: Protect and limit highly privileged users

**Guidance**: Cost Management for Enterprise Agreements (EA) has below highly privileged account.

- Enterprise Administrator

It is recommended to routinely review the users assigned to roles within your Enterprise Agreement (EA).

It is also recommended as a rule, to limit the number of highly privileged accounts or roles and protect these accounts at an elevated level because users with this privilege can directly or indirectly read and modify every resource in your Azure environment.

You can enable just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to Azure resources and Azure AD using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). JIT grants temporary permissions to perform privileged tasks only when users need it. PIM can also generate security alerts when there is suspicious or unsafe activity in your Azure AD organization.

- [Administrator role permissions in Azure AD](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md) 

- [Use Azure Privileged Identity Management security alerts](../active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-configure-security-alerts.md) 

- [Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD](../active-directory/roles/security-planning.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: Azure Cost Management relies on the appropriate access to view and manage organizational cost data. Access is controlled with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) at the subscription level and through administrative roles with Enterprise Agreements (EA) or Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) for billing scopes. Audit and review the access granted on a regular basis to make sure that the users or groups have the requisite access required.

- [Managing Azure Enterprise roles](manage/understand-ea-roles.md)

- [Understand Microsoft Customer Agreement administrative roles in Azure](manage/understand-mca-roles.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

**Guidance**: Azure Cost Management integrates with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage resources (e.g. budgets, saved reports, etc.). Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups  and service principals. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

Azure Cost Management offers built-in roles, readers and contributors.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-data-protection.md).*

### DP-1: Discovery, classify and label sensitive data

**Guidance**: It is recommended to discover, classify, and label your sensitive data so that you can design the appropriate controls to ensure sensitive information is stored, processed, and transmitted securely by the organization's technology systems.

Use Azure Information Protection (and its associated scanning tool) for sensitive information within Office documents on Azure, on-premises, on Office 365, and in other locations.

You can use Azure SQL Information Protection to assist in the classification and labeling of information stored in Azure SQL Databases.

- [Tag sensitive information using Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection) 

- [How to implement Azure SQL Data Discovery](../azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### DP-2: Protect sensitive data

**Guidance**: It is recommended to protect sensitive data by restricting access using Azure Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC), network-based access controls, and specific controls in Azure services (such as encryption in SQL and other databases).

To ensure consistent access control, all types of access control should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy. The enterprise segmentation strategy should also be informed by the location of sensitive or business critical data and systems.

For the underlying platform, which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guards against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented some default data protection controls and capabilities.

- [Assign access to Cost Management data](costs/assign-access-acm-data.md)

- [Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md) 

- [Understand customer data protection in Azure](../security/fundamentals/protection-customer-data.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### DP-3: Monitor for unauthorized transfer of sensitive data

**Guidance**: Monitor for unauthorized transfer of data to locations outside of enterprise visibility and control. This typically involves monitoring for anomalous activities (large or unusual transfers) that could indicate unauthorized data exfiltration.

Azure Storage Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and Azure SQL ATP can alert on anomalous transfer of information that might indicate unauthorized transfers of sensitive information.

Azure Information protection (AIP) provides monitoring capabilities for information that has been classified and labeled.

If required for compliance of data loss prevention (DLP), you can use a host-based DLP solution to enforce detective and/or preventative controls to prevent data exfiltration.

- [Enable Azure SQL ATP](../azure-sql/database/threat-detection-overview.md) 

- [Enable Azure Storage ATP](../storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure.md?tabs=azure-security-center)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### DP-5: Encrypt sensitive data at rest

**Guidance**: To complement access controls, Azure Cost Management’s Exports feature supports Azure Storage encryption of the data at rest to protect against ‘out of band’ attacks (such as accessing underlying storage) using Microsoft-managed keys encryption. This default settings helps ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data.

For more information see:

- [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md)

- [Understand encryption at rest in Azure](../security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest.md#encryption-at-rest-in-microsoft-cloud-services)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management.md).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Note: Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

- [Overview of Azure Management Groups](../governance/management-groups/overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-4: Ensure security of asset lifecycle management

**Guidance**: Establish or update security policies that address asset lifecycle management processes for potentially high impact modifications. These modifications include changes to: identity providers and access, data sensitivity, network configuration, and administrative privilege assignment.

Remove Azure resources when they are no longer needed.

- [Delete Azure resource group and resource](../azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-detection.md).*

### LT-2: Enable threat detection for Azure identity and access management

**Guidance**: Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

- Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

- Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

- Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

It is also recommended to routinely review the users assigned to roles within your Enterprise Agreement (EA).

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-incident-response.md).*

### IR-1: Preparation – update incident response process for Azure

**Guidance**: Ensure your organization has processes to respond to security incidents, has updated these processes for Azure, and is regularly exercising them to ensure readiness.

- [Implement security across the enterprise environment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/security/security-top-10#4-process-update-incident-response-ir-processes-for-cloud)

- [Incident response reference guide](/microsoft-365/downloads/IR-Reference-Guide.pdf)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-2: Preparation – setup incident notification

**Guidance**: Set up security incident contact information in Azure Security Center. This contact information is used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. You also have options to customize incident alert and notification in different Azure services based on your incident response needs. 

- [How to set the Azure Security Center security contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

- [How to configure export](../security-center/continuous-export.md)

- [How to stream alerts into Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/connect-azure-security-center.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

- [Investigate incidents with Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/tutorial-investigate-cases.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

- [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

## Posture and Vulnerability Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Posture and Vulnerability Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-posture-vulnerability-management.md).*

### PV-7: Rapidly and automatically remediate software vulnerabilities

**Guidance**: Rapidly deploy software updates to remediate software vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications.

Prioritize use a common risk scoring program (for example, Common Vulnerability Scoring System) or the default risk ratings provided by your third-party scanning tool and tailor to your environment using context of which applications present a high security risk and which ones require high uptime.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PV-8: Conduct regular attack simulation

**Guidance**: As required, conduct penetration testing or red team activities on your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings.
Follow the Microsoft Cloud Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement to ensure your penetration tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies.
