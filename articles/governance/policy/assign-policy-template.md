# Quickstart: Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources by using a Resource Manager template

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.
This quickstart steps you through the process of creating a policy assignment to identify virtual
machines that aren't using managed disks.

At the end of this process, you'll successfully identify virtual machines that aren't using managed
disks. They're *non-compliant* with the policy assignment.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account
before you begin.

## Create a policy assignment

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign a built-in policy definition called
*Audit VMs that do not use managed disks*. For a partial list of available built-in policies, see [Azure Policy samples](./samples/index.md).

There are several methods for creating policy assignments. In this quickstart, you use a
[quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-azurepolicy-assign-builtinpolicy-resourcegroup/).
Here is a copy of the template:

[!code-json[policy-assignment](~/quickstart-templates/101-azurepolicy-assign-builtinpolicy-resourcegroup/azuredeploy.json)]

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Policy service is free.  For more information, see [Overview of Azure Policy](./overview.md).

1. Select the following image to sign in to the Azure portal and open the template:

   [![Deploy the Policy template to Azure](./media/assign-policy-template/deploy-to-azure.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-azurepolicy-assign-builtinpolicy-resourcegroup%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. Select or enter the following values:

   | Name | Value |
   |------|-------|
   | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
   | Resource group | Select **Create new**, specify a name, and then select **OK**. In the screenshot, the resource group name is *mypolicyquickstart\<Date in MMDD>rg*. |
   | Location | Select a region. For example, **Central US**. |
   | Policy Assignment Name | Specify a policy assignment name. You can use the policy definition display if you want. For example, **Audit VMs that do not use managed disks**. |
   | Rg Name | Specify a resource group name where you want to assign the policy to. In this quickstart, use the default value **[resourceGroup().name]**. **[resourceGroup()](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions-resource.md#resourcegroup)** is a template function that retrieves the resource group. |
   | Policy Definition ID | Specify **/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/0a914e76-4921-4c19-b460-a2d36003525a**. |
   | I agree to the terms and conditions stated above | (Select) |

1. Select **Purchase**.

  [Azure Quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Authorization&pageNumber=1&sort=Popular).
- To see the template reference, go to [Azure template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/allversions).
- To learn how to develop Resource Manager templates, see [Azure Resource Manager documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/).
- To learn subscription-level deployment, see
  [Create resource groups and resources at the subscription level](../../azure-resource-manager/deploy-to-subscription.md).

## Identify non-compliant resources

Select **Compliance** in the left side of the page. Then locate the **Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks** policy assignment you created.

If there are any existing resources that aren't compliant with this new assignment, they appear
under **Non-compliant resources**.

For more information, see [How compliance works](./how-to/get-compliance-data.md#how-compliance-works).

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, follow these steps:

1. Select **Compliance** (or **Assignments**) in the left side of the Azure Policy page and locate
   the **Audit VMs that do not use managed disks** policy assignment you created.

1. Right-click the **Audit VMs that do not use managed disks** policy assignment and select **Delete
   assignment**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a built-in policy definition to a scope and evaluated its
compliance report. The policy definition validates that all the resources in the scope are compliant
and identifies which ones aren't.
