# Azure Policy built-in policy definitions

This page is an index of Azure Policy built-in policy definitions.

The name of each built-in links to the policy definition in Azure portal. Use the link in the
**Source** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy). The built-ins are grouped by the
**category** property in **metadata**. To jump to a specific **category**, use the menu on the right
side of the page. Otherwise, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd> to use your browser's search feature.
