# Azure Policy built-in initiative definitions

This page is an index of Azure Policy built-in initiative definitions.

The name on each built-in links to the initiative definition source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy). The built-ins are grouped by the
**category** property in **metadata**. To jump to a specific **category**, use the menu on the right
side of the page. Otherwise, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd> to use your browser's search feature.
