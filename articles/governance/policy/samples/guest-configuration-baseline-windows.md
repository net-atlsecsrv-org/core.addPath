## Security Options - Accounts

|Name<br /><sub>(ID)</sub> |Details |Expected value<br /><sub>(Type)</sub> |Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
|Accounts: Guest account status<br /><sub>(CCE-37432-2)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system. The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`. **Note:** This setting will have no impact when applied to the domain controller organizational unit via group policy because domain controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.<br />**Key Path**: [System Access]EnableGuestAccount<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\= 0<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |

## Security Options - Audit

|Name<br /><sub>(ID)</sub> |Details |Expected value<br /><sub>(Type)</sub> |Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
|Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings<br /><sub>(CCE-37850-5)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities present in Windows Vista.  The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to be configured to Enabled.<br />**Key Path**: SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |Doesn't exist or \= 1<br /><sub>(Registry)</sub> |Critical |
|Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits<br /><sub>(CCE-35907-5)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts. The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.<br />**Key Path**: SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\CrashOnAuditFail<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |Doesn't exist or \= 0<br /><sub>(Registry)</sub> |Critical |

|Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer to use online identities<br /><sub>(CCE-38047-7)</sub> |**Description**: This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called Homegroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain. With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, `Spnego.dll`. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, `Negoexts.dll`, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U. When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, `Negoexts.dll` calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes. The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.<br />**Key Path**: SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\pku2u\AllowOnlineID<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |Doesn't exist or \= 0<br /><sub>(Registry)</sub> |Warning |

The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash. Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can then be easily compromised if the database is attacked. **Note:** Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.

|Network security: LAN Manager authentication level<br /><sub>(CCE-36173-3)</sub> |**Description**: LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: - Join a domain - Authenticate between Active Directory forests - Authenticate to down-level domains - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP) - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level settings are: - Send LM & NTLM responses - Send LM & NTLM  — use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated - Send NTLM responses only - Send NTLMv2 responses only - Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM - Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM & NTLM - Not Defined The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers accept as follows: - Send LM & NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Send LM & NTLM  — use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Send NTLM response only. Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication). - Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM & NTLM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). These settings correspond to the levels discussed in other Microsoft documents as follows: - Level 0  — Send LM and NTLM response; never use NTLMv2 session security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Level 1  — Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Level 2  — Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Level 3  — Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. - Level 4  — Domain controllers refuse LM responses. Clients use NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. - Level 5  — Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, use and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it.

|Enforce password history<br /><sub>(CCE-37166-6)</sub> |**Description**: <p><span>This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The recommended state for this setting is: '24 or more password(s)'.</span></p><br />**Key Path**: [System Access]PasswordHistorySize<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\>\= 24<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Maximum password age<br /><sub>(CCE-37167-4)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The recommended state for this setting is `60 or fewer days, but not 0`.<br />**Key Path**: [System Access]MaximumPasswordAge<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |In 1-70<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Minimum password age<br /><sub>(CCE-37073-4)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days. The recommended state for this setting is: `1 or more day(s)`.<br />**Key Path**: [System Access]MinimumPasswordAge<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\>\= 1<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Minimum password length<br /><sub>(CCE-36534-6)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: `14 or more character(s)`.<br />**Key Path**: [System Access]MinimumPasswordLength<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\>\= 14<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Password must meet complexity requirements<br /><sub>(CCE-37063-5)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: - Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters - Be at least six characters in length - Contain characters from three of the following four categories: - English uppercase characters (A through Z) - English lowercase characters (a through z) - Base 10 digits (0 through 9) - Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) - A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.<br />**Key Path**: [System Access]PasswordComplexity<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\= true<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Store passwords using reversible encryption<br /><sub>(CCE-36286-3)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the passwords.

|Allow log on locally<br /><sub>(CCE-37659-0)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through Terminal Services or IIS also require this user right. The Guest account is assigned this user right by default. Although this account is disabled by default, Microsoft recommends that you enable this setting through Group Policy. However, this user right should generally be restricted to the Administrators and Users groups. Assign this user right to the Backup Operators group if your organization requires that they have this capability.  When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.<br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeInteractiveLogonRight<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\= Administrators<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services<br /><sub>(CCE-37072-6)</sub> |**Description**: <p><span>This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a Terminal Services client. Remote desktop users require this user right. If your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user right through Group Policy. If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user right only to the Administrators group or use the restricted groups feature to ensure that no user accounts are part of the Remote Desktop Users group. Restrict this user right to the Administrators group, and possibly the Remote Desktop Users group, to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to computers on your network by means of the Remote Assistance feature. - **Level 1 - Domain Controller.** The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators'. - **Level 1 - Member Server.** The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users'. **Note:** A Member Server that holds the _Remote Desktop Services_ Role with _Remote Desktop Connection Broker_ Role Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow the 'Authenticated Users' group to be granted this user right. **Note 2:** The above lists are to be treated as allow lists, which implies that the above principals need not be present for assessment of this recommendation to pass.</span></p><br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member | Administrators, Remote Desktop Users<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Back up files and directories<br /><sub>(CCE-35912-5)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up the system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as NTBACKUP) attempts to access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application programming interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions apply. The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.<br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeBackupPrivilege<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Member, Workgroup Member | Administrators, Backup Operators, Server Operators<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Bypass traverse checking<br /><sub>(AZ-WIN-00184)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting allows users who do not have the Traverse Folder access permission to pass through folders when they browse an object path in the NTFS file system or the registry. This user right does not allow users to list the contents of a folder.  When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts.

|Change the system time<br /><sub>(CCE-37452-0)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. **Note:** Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain controllers.

|Create global objects<br /><sub>(CCE-37453-8)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not have this user right. Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run under other users' sessions. This capability could lead to a variety of problems, such as application failure or data corruption. The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE`. **Note:** A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server _and_ its optional "Integration Services" component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.<br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeCreateGlobalPrivilege<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member | Administrators, SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Warning |
|Create permanent shared objects<br /><sub>(CCE-36532-0)</sub> |**Description**: This user right is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace. However, components that run in kernel mode have this user right inherently. Therefore, it is typically not necessary to specifically assign this user right. The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.<br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeCreatePermanentPrivilege<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\= No One<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Warning |
|Create symbolic links<br /><sub>(CCE-35823-4)</sub> |**Description**: <p><span>This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links. - **Level 1 - Domain Controller.** The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators'. - **Level 1 - Member Server.** The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators' and (when the _Hyper-V_ Role is installed) 'NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines'.</span></p><br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member | Administrators, NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Deny access to this computer from the network<br /><sub>(CCE-37954-5)</sub> |**Description**: <p><span>This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network, which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer. Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. - **Level 1 - Domain Controller.** The recommended state for this setting is to include: 'Guests, Local account'. - **Level 1 - Member Server.** The recommended state for this setting is to include: 'Guests, Local account and member of Administrators group'. **Caution:** Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the server. **Note:** Configuring a member server or standalone server as described above may adversely affect applications that create a local service account and place it in the Administrators group - in which case you must either convert the application to use a domain-hosted service account, or remove Local account and member of Administrators group from this User Right Assignment. Using a domain-hosted service account is strongly preferred over making an exception to this rule, where possible.</span></p><br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeDenyNetworkLogonRight<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\>\= Guests<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |
|Deny log on as a batch job<br /><sub>(CCE-36923-1)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines which accounts will not be able to log on to the computer as a batch job. A batch job is not a batch (.bat) file, but rather a batch-queue facility. Accounts that use the Task Scheduler to schedule jobs need this user right. The **Deny log on as a batch job** user right overrides the **Log on as a batch job** user right, which could be used to allow accounts to schedule jobs that consume excessive system resources. Such an occurrence could cause a DoS condition. Failure to assign this user right to the recommended accounts can be a security risk.

|Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services<br /><sub>(CCE-36867-0)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Terminal Services clients. After the baseline member server is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to use local accounts to access the server from the network. Domain accounts can access the server for administration and end-user processing. The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Guests, Local account`. **Caution:** Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the server.<br />**Key Path**: [Privilege Rights]SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Workgroup Member |\>\= Guests<br /><sub>(Policy)</sub> |Critical |

|Force shutdown from a remote system<br /><sub>(CCE-37877-8)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting allows users to shut down Windows Vista-based computers from remote locations on the network. Anyone who has been assigned this user right can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer unavailable to service user requests. Therefore, it is recommended that only highly trusted administrators be assigned this user right.

If the status is set to Enabled, Remote Desktop Services accepts requests from RPC clients that support secure requests, and does not allow unsecured communication with untrusted clients.  If the status is set to Disabled, Remote Desktop Services always requests security for all RPC traffic. However, unsecured communication is allowed for RPC clients that do not respond to the request.  If the status is set to Not Configured, unsecured communication is allowed.  Note: The RPC interface is used for administering and configuring Remote Desktop Services.<br />**Key Path**: SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\fEncryptRPCTraffic<br />**OS**: WS2008, WS2008R2, WS2012, WS2012R2, WS2016<br />**Server Type**: Domain Controller, Domain Member, Workgroup Member |\= 1<br /><sub>(Registry)</sub> |Critical |

|Set the default behavior for AutoRun<br /><sub>(CCE-38217-6)</sub> |**Description**: This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands.            Autorun commands are generally stored in autorun.inf files. They often launch the installation program or other routines.            Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the system will automatically execute the program without user intervention.            This creates a major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is to be run. The autorun command is represented as a handler in the Autoplay dialog.            If you enable this policy setting, an Administrator can change the default Windows Vista or later behavior for autorun to:            a) Completely disable autorun commands, or           b) Revert back to pre-Windows Vista behavior of automatically executing the autorun command.
