# Quickstart: Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources by using a Bicep file

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.
This quickstart steps you through the process of using a
[Bicep (Preview)](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) file compiled to an Azure Resource
Manager template (ARM template) to create a policy assignment to identify virtual machines that
aren't using managed disks. At the end of this process, you'll successfully identify virtual
machines that aren't using managed disks. They're _non-compliant_ with the policy assignment.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the
**Deploy to Azure** button. The template opens in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
  account before you begin.
- Bicep version `0.3` or higher installed. If you don't yet have Bicep CLI or need to update, see
  [Install Bicep (Preview)](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/bicep-install.md).

## Review the Bicep file

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign a built-in policy definition called
_Audit VMs that do not use managed disks_ (`06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d`). For a partial
list of available built-in policies, see [Azure Policy samples](./samples/index.md).

Create the following Bicep file as `assignment.bicep`:

```bicep
param policyAssignmentName string = 'audit-vm-manageddisks'
param policyDefinitionID string = '/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d'

resource assignment 'Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments@2019-09-01' = {
    name: policyAssignmentName
    properties: {
        scope: subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups', resourceGroup().name)
        policyDefinitionId: policyDefinitionID
    }
}

output assignmentId string = assignment.id
```

The resource defined in the file is:

- [Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments](/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/policyassignments)

## Deploy the template

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Policy service is free. For more information, see
> [Overview of Azure Policy](./overview.md).

After the Bicep CLI is installed and file created, you can deploy the Bicep file with:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name PolicyDeployment `
  -ResourceGroupName PolicyGroup `
  -TemplateFile assignment.bicep
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create \
  --name PolicyDeployment \
  --resource-group PolicyGroup \
  --template-file assignment.bicep
```

---

Some additional resources:

- To find more samples templates, see
  [Azure Quickstart Template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Authorization&pageNumber=1&sort=Popular).
- To see the template reference, go to
  [Azure template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/allversions).
- To learn how to develop ARM templates, see
  [Azure Resource Manager documentation](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).
- To learn subscription-level deployment, see
  [Create resource groups and resources at the subscription level](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription.md).

## Validate the deployment

Select **Compliance** in the left side of the page. Then locate the _Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks_ policy assignment you created.

:::image type="content" source="./media/assign-policy-template/policy-compliance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of compliance details on the Policy Compliance page." border="false":::

If there are any existing resources that aren't compliant with this new assignment, they appear
under **Non-compliant resources**.

For more information, see
[How compliance works](./how-to/get-compliance-data.md#how-compliance-works).

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, follow these steps:

1. Select **Compliance** (or **Assignments**) in the left side of the Azure Policy page and locate
   the _Audit VMs that do not use managed disks_ policy assignment you created.

1. Right-click the _Audit VMs that do not use managed disks_ policy assignment and select **Delete
   assignment**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/assign-policy-template/delete-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of using the context menu to delete an assignment from the Compliance page." border="false":::

1. Delete the `assignment.bicep` file.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a built-in policy definition to a scope and evaluated its
compliance report. The policy definition validates that all the resources in the scope are compliant
and identifies which ones aren't.
