# Azure Policy assignment structure

Policy assignments are used by Azure Policy to define which resources are assigned which policies or
initiatives. The policy assignment can determine the values of parameters for that group of
resources at assignment time, making it possible to reuse policy definitions that address the same
resource properties with different needs for compliance.

You use JSON to create a policy assignment. The policy assignment contains elements for:

- display name
- description
- metadata
- enforcement mode
- excluded scopes
- policy definition
- parameters

For example, the following JSON shows a policy assignment in _DoNotEnforce_ mode with dynamic parameters:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "displayName": "Enforce resource naming rules",
        "description": "Force resource names to begin with DeptA and end with -LC",
        "metadata": {
            "assignedBy": "Cloud Center of Excellence"
        },
        "enforcementMode": "DoNotEnforce",
        "notScopes": [],
        "policyDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{mySubscriptionID}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/ResourceNaming",
        "parameters": {
            "prefix": {
                "value": "DeptA"
            },
            "suffix": {
                "value": "-LC"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

All Azure Policy samples are at [Azure Policy samples](../samples/index.md).

## Display name and description

You use **displayName** and **description** to identify the policy assignment and provide context
for its use with the specific set of resources. **displayName** has a maximum length of _128_
characters and **description** a maximum length of _512_ characters.

## Enforcement Mode

The **enforcementMode** property provides customers the ability to test the outcome of a policy on
existing resources without initiating the policy effect or triggering entries in the
[Azure Activity log](../../../azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview.md). This scenario is
commonly referred to as "What If" and aligns to safe deployment practices. **enforcementMode** is
different from the [Disabled](./effects.md#disabled) effect, as that effect prevents resource
evaluation from happening at all.

This property has the following values:

|Mode |JSON Value |Type |Remediate manually |Activity log entry |Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Enabled |Default |string |Yes |Yes |The policy effect is enforced during resource creation or update. |
|Disabled |DoNotEnforce |string |Yes |No | The policy effect isn't enforced during resource creation or update. |

If **enforcementMode** isn't specified in a policy or initiative definition, the value _Default_ is
used. [Remediation tasks](../how-to/remediate-resources.md) can be started for [deployIfNotExists](./effects.md#deployifnotexists)
policies, even when **enforcementMode** is set to _DoNotEnforce_.

## Excluded scopes

The **scope** of the assignment includes all child resource containers and child resources. If a
child resource container or child resource shouldn't have the definition applied, each can be
excluded from evaluation by setting **notScopes**. This property is an array to enable excluding one
or more resource containers or resources from evaluation. **notScopes** can be added or updated
after creation of the initial assignment.

## Policy definition ID

This field must be the full path name of either a policy definition or an initiative definition.
`policyDefinitionId` is a string and not an array. It's recommended that if multiple policies are
often assigned together, to use an [initiative](./definition-structure.md#initiatives) instead.

## Parameters

This segment of the policy assignment provides the values for the parameters defined in the [policy definition or initiative definition](./definition-structure.md#parameters).
This design makes it possible to reuse a policy or initiative definition with different resources,
but check for different business values or outcomes.

```json
"parameters": {
    "prefix": {
        "value": "DeptA"
    },
    "suffix": {
        "value": "-LC"
    }
}
```

In this example, the parameters previously defined in the policy definition are `prefix` and
`suffix`. This particular policy assignment sets `prefix` to **DeptA** and `suffix` to **-LC**. The
same policy definition is reusable with a different set of parameters for a different department,
reducing the duplication and complexity of policy definitions while providing flexibility.
