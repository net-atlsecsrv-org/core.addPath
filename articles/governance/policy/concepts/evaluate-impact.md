# Evaluate the impact of a new Azure policy

Azure Policy is a powerful tool for managing your Azure resources to business standards and to meet
compliance needs. When people, processes, or pipelines create or update resources, Azure Policy
reviews the request. When the policy definition effect is [Append](./effects.md#deny) or [DeployIfNotExists](./effects.md#deployifnotexists),
Policy alters the request or adds to it. When the policy definition effect is [Audit](./effects.md#audit)
or [AuditIfNotExists](./effects.md#auditifnotexists), Policy causes an Activity log entry to be
created. And when the policy definition effect is [Deny](./effects.md#deny), Policy stops the
creation or alteration of the request.

These outcomes are exactly as desired when you know the policy is defined correctly. However, it's
important to validate a new policy works as intended before allowing it to change or block work. The
validation must ensure only the intended resources are determined to be non-compliant and no
compliant resources are incorrectly included (known as a _false positive_) in the results.

The recommended approach to validating a new policy definition is by following these steps:

- Tightly define your policy
- Audit your existing resources
- Audit new or updated resource requests
- Deploy your policy to resources
- Continuous monitoring

## Tightly define your policy

It's important to understand how the business policy is implemented as a policy definition and the
relationship of Azure resources with other Azure services. This step is accomplished by
[identifying the requirements](../tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition.md#identify-requirements)
and
[determining the resource properties](../tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition.md#determine-resource-properties).
But it's also important to see beyond the narrow definition of your business policy. Does your
policy state for example "All Virtual Machines must..."? What about other Azure services that make
use of VMs, such as HDInsight or AKS? When defining a policy, we must consider how this policy
impacts resources that are used by other services.

For this reason, your policy definitions should be as tightly defined and focused on the resources
and the properties you need to evaluate for compliance as possible.

## Audit existing resources

Before looking to manage new or updated resources with your new policy definition, it's best to see
how it evaluates a limited subset of existing resources, such as a test resource group. Use the [enforcement mode](./assignment-structure.md#enforcement-mode)
_Disabled_ (DoNotEnforce) on your policy assignment to prevent the [effect](./effects.md) from
triggering or activity log entries from being created.

This step gives you a chance to evaluate the compliance results of the new policy on existing
resources without impacting work flow. Check that no compliant resources are marked as non-compliant
(_false positive_) and that all the resources you expect to be non-compliant are marked correctly.
After the initial subset of resources validates as expected, slowly expand the evaluation to all
existing resources.

Evaluating existing resources in this way also provides an opportunity to remediate non-compliant
resources before full implementation of the new policy. This cleanup can be done manually or through
a [remediation task](../how-to/remediate-resources.md) if the policy definition effect is
_DeployIfNotExists_.

## Audit new or updated resources

Once you've validated your new policy definition is reporting correctly on existing resources, it's
time to look at the impact of the policy when resources get created or updated. If the policy
definition supports effect parameterization, use [Audit](./effects.md#audit). This configuration
allows you to monitor the creation and updating of resources to see if the new policy definition
triggers an entry in Azure Activity log for a resource that is non-compliant without impacting
existing work or requests.

It's recommended to both update and create new resources that match your policy definition to see
that the _Audit_ effect is correctly being triggered when expected. Be on the lookout for resource
requests that shouldn't be impacted by the new policy definition that trigger the _Audit_ effect.
These impacted resources are another example of _false positives_ and must be fixed in the policy
definition before full implementation.

In the event the policy definition is changed at this stage of testing, it's recommended to begin
the validation process over with the auditing of existing resources. A change to the policy
definition for a _false positive_ on new or updated resources is likely to also have an impact on
existing resources.

## Deploy your policy to resources

After completing validation of your new policy definition with both existing resources and new or
updated resource requests, you begin the process of implementing the policy. It's recommended to
create the policy assignment for the new policy definition to a subset of all resources first, such
as a resource group. After validating initial deployment, extend the scope of the policy to broader
and broader levels, such as subscriptions and management groups. This expansion is achieved by
removing the assignment and creating a new one at the target scopes until it's assigned to the full
scope of resources intended to be covered by your new policy definition.

During rollout, if resources are located that should be exempt from your new policy definition,
address them in one of the following ways:

- Update the policy definition to be more explicit to reduce unintended impact
- Change the scope of the policy assignment (by removing and creating a new assignment)
- Add the group of resources to the exclusion list for the policy assignment

Any changes to the scope (level or exclusions) should be fully validated and communicated with your
security and compliance organizations to ensure there are no gaps in coverage.

## Monitor your policy and compliance

Implementing and assigning your policy definition isn't the final step. Continuously monitor the [compliance](../how-to/get-compliance-data.md)
level of resources to your new policy definition and setup appropriate [Azure Monitor alerts and notifications](../../../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview.md)
for when non-compliant devices are identified. It's also recommended to evaluate the policy
definition and related assignments on a scheduled basis to validate the policy definition is meeting
business policy and compliance needs. Policies should be removed if no longer needed. Policies also
need updating from time to time as the underlying Azure resources evolve and add new properties and
capabilities.
