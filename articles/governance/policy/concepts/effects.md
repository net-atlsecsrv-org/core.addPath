# Understand Azure Policy effects

Each policy definition in Azure Policy has a single effect. That effect determines what happens when
the policy rule is evaluated to match. The effects behave differently if they are for a new
resource, an updated resource, or an existing resource.

These effects are currently supported in a policy definition:

- [Append](#append)
- [Audit](#audit)
- [AuditIfNotExists](#auditifnotexists)
- [Deny](#deny)
- [DeployIfNotExists](#deployifnotexists)
- [Disabled](#disabled)
- [Modify](#modify)

The following effects are _deprecated_:

- [EnforceOPAConstraint](#enforceopaconstraint)
- [EnforceRegoPolicy](#enforceregopolicy)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In place of the **EnforceOPAConstraint** or **EnforceRegoPolicy** effects, use _audit_ and
> _deny_ with Resource Provider mode `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`. The built-in policy definitions
> have been updated. When existing policy assignments of these built-in policy definitions are
> modified, the _effect_ parameter must be changed to a value in the updated _allowedValues_ list.

## Order of evaluation

Requests to create or update a resource are evaluated by Azure Policy first. Azure Policy creates a
list of all assignments that apply to the resource and then evaluates the resource against each
definition. For a [Resource Manager mode](./definition-structure.md#resource-manager-modes), Azure
Policy processes several of the effects before handing the request to the appropriate Resource
Provider. This order prevents unnecessary processing by a Resource Provider when a resource doesn't
meet the designed governance controls of Azure Policy. With a
[Resource Provider mode](./definition-structure.md#resource-provider-modes), the Resource Provider
manages the evaluation and outcome and reports the results back to Azure Policy.

- **Disabled** is checked first to determine if the policy rule should be evaluated.
- **Append** and **Modify** are then evaluated. Since either could alter the request, a change made
  may prevent an audit or deny effect from triggering. These effects are only available with a
  Resource Manager mode.
- **Deny** is then evaluated. By evaluating deny before audit, double logging of an undesired
  resource is prevented.
- **Audit** is evaluated last.

After the Resource Provider returns a success code on a Resource Manager mode request,
**AuditIfNotExists** and **DeployIfNotExists** evaluate to determine if additional compliance
logging or action is required.

## Append

Append is used to add additional fields to the requested resource during creation or update. A
common example is specifying allowed IPs for a storage resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Append is intended for use with non-tag properties. While Append can add tags to a resource during
> a create or update request, it's recommended to use the [Modify](#modify) effect for tags instead.

### Append evaluation

Append evaluates before the request gets processed by a Resource Provider during the creation or
updating of a resource. Append adds fields to the resource when the **if** condition of the policy
rule is met. If the append effect would override a value in the original request with a different
value, then it acts as a deny effect and rejects the request. To append a new value to an existing
array, use the **\[\*\]** version of the alias.

When a policy definition using the append effect is run as part of an evaluation cycle, it doesn't
make changes to resources that already exist. Instead, it marks any resource that meets the **if**
condition as non-compliant.

### Append properties

An append effect only has a **details** array, which is required. As **details** is an array, it can
take either a single **field/value** pair or multiples. Refer to
[definition structure](definition-structure.md#fields) for the list of acceptable fields.

### Append examples

Example 1: Single **field/value** pair using a non-**\[\*\]** [alias](definition-structure.md#aliases)
with an array **value** to set IP rules on a storage account. When the non-**\[\*\]** alias is an
array, the effect appends the **value** as the entire array. If the array already exists, a deny
event occurs from the conflict.

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "append",
    "details": [{
        "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/networkAcls.ipRules",
        "value": [{
            "action": "Allow",
            "value": "134.5.0.0/21"
        }]
    }]
}
```

Example 2: Single **field/value** pair using an **\[\*\]** [alias](definition-structure.md#aliases)
with an array **value** to set IP rules on a storage account. By using the **\[\*\]** alias, the
effect appends the **value** to a potentially pre-existing array. If the array doesn't exist yet,
it's created.

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "append",
    "details": [{
        "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/networkAcls.ipRules[*]",
        "value": {
            "value": "40.40.40.40",
            "action": "Allow"
        }
    }]
}
```

## Audit

Audit is used to create a warning event in the activity log when evaluating a non-compliant
resource, but it doesn't stop the request.

### Audit evaluation

Audit is the last effect checked by Azure Policy during the creation or update of a resource. For a
Resource Manager mode, Azure Policy then sends the resource to the Resource Provider. Audit works
the same for a resource request and an evaluation cycle. For new and updated resources, Azure Policy
adds a `Microsoft.Authorization/policies/audit/action` operation to the activity log and marks the
resource as non-compliant.

### Audit properties

For a Resource Manager mode, the audit effect doesn't have any additional properties for use in the
**then** condition of the policy definition.

For a Resource Provider mode of `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`, the audit effect has the following
additional subproperties of **details**.

- **constraintTemplate** (required)
  - The Constraint template CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that defines new Constraints. The
    template defines the Rego logic, the Constraint schema, and the Constraint parameters that are
    passed via **values** from Azure Policy.
- **constraint** (required)
  - The CRD implementation of the Constraint template. Uses parameters passed via **values** as
    `{{ .Values.<valuename> }}`. In example 2 below, these values are
    `{{ .Values.excludedNamespaces }}` and `{{ .Values.allowedContainerImagesRegex }}`.
- **values** (optional)
  - Defines any parameters and values to pass to the Constraint. Each value must exist in the
    Constraint template CRD.

### Audit example

Example 1: Using the audit effect for Resource Manager modes.

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "audit"
}
```

Example 2: Using the audit effect for a Resource Provider mode of `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`. The
additional information in **details** defines the Constraint template and CRD to use in Kubernetes
to limit the allowed container images.

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "audit",
    "details": {
        "constraintTemplate": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/Kubernetes/container-allowed-images/template.yaml",
        "constraint": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/Kubernetes/container-allowed-images/constraint.yaml",
        "values": {
            "allowedContainerImagesRegex": "[parameters('allowedContainerImagesRegex')]",
            "excludedNamespaces": "[parameters('excludedNamespaces')]"
        }
    }
}
```

## AuditIfNotExists

AuditIfNotExists enables auditing of resources _related_ to the resource that matches the **if**
condition, but don't have the properties specified in the **details** of the **then** condition.

### AuditIfNotExists evaluation

AuditIfNotExists runs after a Resource Provider has handled a create or update resource request and
has returned a success status code. The audit occurs if there are no related resources or if the
resources defined by **ExistenceCondition** don't evaluate to true. For new and updated resources,
Azure Policy adds a `Microsoft.Authorization/policies/audit/action` operation to the activity log
and marks the resource as non-compliant. When triggered, the resource that satisfied the **if**
condition is the resource that is marked as non-compliant.

### AuditIfNotExists properties

The **details** property of the AuditIfNotExists effects has all the subproperties that define the
related resources to match.

- **Type** (required)
  - Specifies the type of the related resource to match.
  - If **details.type** is a resource type underneath the **if** condition resource, the policy
    queries for resources of this **type** within the scope of the evaluated resource. Otherwise,
    policy queries within the same resource group as the evaluated resource.
- **Name** (optional)
  - Specifies the exact name of the resource to match and causes the policy to fetch one specific
    resource instead of all resources of the specified type.
  - When the condition values for **if.field.type** and **then.details.type** match, then **Name**
    becomes _required_ and must be `[field('name')]`, or `[field('fullName')]` for a child resource.
    However, an [audit](#audit) effect should be considered instead.
- **ResourceGroupName** (optional)
  - Allows the matching of the related resource to come from a different resource group.
  - Doesn't apply if **type** is a resource that would be underneath the **if** condition resource.
  - Default is the **if** condition resource's resource group.
- **ExistenceScope** (optional)
  - Allowed values are _Subscription_ and _ResourceGroup_.
  - Sets the scope of where to fetch the related resource to match from.
  - Doesn't apply if **type** is a resource that would be underneath the **if** condition resource.
  - For _ResourceGroup_, would limit to the **if** condition resource's resource group or the
    resource group specified in **ResourceGroupName**.
  - For _Subscription_, queries the entire subscription for the related resource.
  - Default is _ResourceGroup_.
- **ExistenceCondition** (optional)
  - If not specified, any related resource of **type** satisfies the effect and doesn't trigger the
    audit.
  - Uses the same language as the policy rule for the **if** condition, but is evaluated against
    each related resource individually.
  - If any matching related resource evaluates to true, the effect is satisfied and doesn't trigger
    the audit.
  - Can use [field()] to check equivalence with values in the **if** condition.
  - For example, could be used to validate that the parent resource (in the **if** condition) is in
    the same resource location as the matching related resource.

### AuditIfNotExists example

Example: Evaluates Virtual Machines to determine if the Antimalware extension exists then audits
when missing.

```json
{
    "if": {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
    },
    "then": {
        "effect": "auditIfNotExists",
        "details": {
            "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
            "existenceCondition": {
                "allOf": [{
                        "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/publisher",
                        "equals": "Microsoft.Azure.Security"
                    },
                    {
                        "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/type",
                        "equals": "IaaSAntimalware"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Deny

Deny is used to prevent a resource request that doesn't match defined standards through a policy
definition and fails the request.

### Deny evaluation

When creating or updating a matched resource in a Resource Manager mode, deny prevents the request
before being sent to the Resource Provider. The request is returned as a `403 (Forbidden)`. In the
portal, the Forbidden can be viewed as a status on the deployment that was prevented by the policy
assignment. For a Resource Provider mode, the resource provider manages the evaluation of the
resource.

During evaluation of existing resources, resources that match a deny policy definition are marked as
non-compliant.

### Deny properties

For a Resource Manager mode, the deny effect doesn't have any additional properties for use in the
**then** condition of the policy definition.

For a Resource Provider mode of `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`, the deny effect has the following
additional subproperties of **details**.

- **constraintTemplate** (required)
  - The Constraint template CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that defines new Constraints. The
    template defines the Rego logic, the Constraint schema, and the Constraint parameters that are
    passed via **values** from Azure Policy.
- **constraint** (required)
  - The CRD implementation of the Constraint template. Uses parameters passed via **values** as
    `{{ .Values.<valuename> }}`. In example 2 below, these values are
    `{{ .Values.excludedNamespaces }}` and `{{ .Values.allowedContainerImagesRegex }}`.
- **values** (optional)
  - Defines any parameters and values to pass to the Constraint. Each value must exist in the
    Constraint template CRD.

### Deny example

Example 1: Using the deny effect for Resource Manager modes.

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "deny"
}
```

Example 2: Using the deny effect for a Resource Provider mode of `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`. The
additional information in **details** defines the Constraint template and CRD to use in Kubernetes
to limit the allowed container images.

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "deny",
    "details": {
        "constraintTemplate": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/Kubernetes/container-allowed-images/template.yaml",
        "constraint": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/Kubernetes/container-allowed-images/constraint.yaml",
        "values": {
            "allowedContainerImagesRegex": "[parameters('allowedContainerImagesRegex')]",
            "excludedNamespaces": "[parameters('excludedNamespaces')]"
        }
    }
}
```

## DeployIfNotExists

Similar to AuditIfNotExists, a DeployIfNotExists policy definition executes a template deployment
when the condition is met.

> [!NOTE]
> [Nested templates](../../../azure-resource-manager/templates/linked-templates.md#nested-template) are supported with **deployIfNotExists**, but
> [linked templates](../../../azure-resource-manager/templates/linked-templates.md#linked-template) are currently not supported.

### DeployIfNotExists evaluation

DeployIfNotExists runs about 15 minutes after a Resource Provider has handled a create or update
resource request and has returned a success status code. A template deployment occurs if there are
no related resources or if the resources defined by **ExistenceCondition** don't evaluate to true.
The duration of the deployment depends on the complexity of resources included in the template.

During an evaluation cycle, policy definitions with a DeployIfNotExists effect that match resources
are marked as non-compliant, but no action is taken on that resource. Existing non-compliant
resources can be remediated with a [remediation task](../how-to/remediate-resources.md).

### DeployIfNotExists properties

The **details** property of the DeployIfNotExists effect has all the subproperties that define the
related resources to match and the template deployment to execute.

- **Type** (required)
  - Specifies the type of the related resource to match.
  - Starts by trying to fetch a resource underneath the **if** condition resource, then queries
    within the same resource group as the **if** condition resource.
- **Name** (optional)
  - Specifies the exact name of the resource to match and causes the policy to fetch one specific
    resource instead of all resources of the specified type.
  - When the condition values for **if.field.type** and **then.details.type** match, then **Name**
    becomes _required_ and must be `[field('name')]`, or `[field('fullName')]` for a child resource.
- **ResourceGroupName** (optional)
  - Allows the matching of the related resource to come from a different resource group.
  - Doesn't apply if **type** is a resource that would be underneath the **if** condition resource.
  - Default is the **if** condition resource's resource group.
  - If a template deployment is executed, it's deployed in the resource group of this value.
- **ExistenceScope** (optional)
  - Allowed values are _Subscription_ and _ResourceGroup_.
  - Sets the scope of where to fetch the related resource to match from.
  - Doesn't apply if **type** is a resource that would be underneath the **if** condition resource.
  - For _ResourceGroup_, would limit to the **if** condition resource's resource group or the
    resource group specified in **ResourceGroupName**.
  - For _Subscription_, queries the entire subscription for the related resource.
  - Default is _ResourceGroup_.
- **ExistenceCondition** (optional)
  - If not specified, any related resource of **type** satisfies the effect and doesn't trigger the
    deployment.
  - Uses the same language as the policy rule for the **if** condition, but is evaluated against
    each related resource individually.
  - If any matching related resource evaluates to true, the effect is satisfied and doesn't trigger
    the deployment.
  - Can use [field()] to check equivalence with values in the **if** condition.
  - For example, could be used to validate that the parent resource (in the **if** condition) is in
    the same resource location as the matching related resource.
- **roleDefinitionIds** (required)
  - This property must include an array of strings that match role-based access control role ID
    accessible by the subscription. For more information, see
    [remediation - configure policy definition](../how-to/remediate-resources.md#configure-policy-definition).
- **DeploymentScope** (optional)
  - Allowed values are _Subscription_ and _ResourceGroup_.
  - Sets the type of deployment to be triggered. _Subscription_ indicates a
    [deployment at subscription level](../../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription.md),
    _ResourceGroup_ indicates a deployment to a resource group.
  - A _location_ property must be specified in the _Deployment_ when using subscription level
    deployments.
  - Default is _ResourceGroup_.
- **Deployment** (required)
  - This property should include the full template deployment as it would be passed to the
    `Microsoft.Resources/deployments` PUT API. For more information, see the [Deployments REST API](/rest/api/resources/deployments).

  > [!NOTE]
  > All functions inside the **Deployment** property are evaluated as components of the template,
  > not the policy. The exception is the **parameters** property that passes values from the policy
  > to the template. The **value** in this section under a template parameter name is used to
  > perform this value passing (see _fullDbName_ in the DeployIfNotExists example).

### DeployIfNotExists example

Example: Evaluates SQL Server databases to determine if transparentDataEncryption is enabled. If
not, then a deployment to enable is executed.

```json
"if": {
    "field": "type",
    "equals": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases"
},
"then": {
    "effect": "DeployIfNotExists",
    "details": {
        "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/transparentDataEncryption",
        "name": "current",
        "roleDefinitionIds": [
            "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleGUID}",
            "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{builtinroleGUID}"
        ],
        "existenceCondition": {
            "field": "Microsoft.Sql/transparentDataEncryption.status",
            "equals": "Enabled"
        },
        "deployment": {
            "properties": {
                "mode": "incremental",
                "template": {
                    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
                    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
                    "parameters": {
                        "fullDbName": {
                            "type": "string"
                        }
                    },
                    "resources": [{
                        "name": "[concat(parameters('fullDbName'), '/current')]",
                        "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/transparentDataEncryption",
                        "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
                        "properties": {
                            "status": "Enabled"
                        }
                    }]
                },
                "parameters": {
                    "fullDbName": {
                        "value": "[field('fullName')]"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Disabled

This effect is useful for testing situations or for when the policy definition has parameterized the
effect. This flexibility makes it possible to disable a single assignment instead of disabling all
of that policy's assignments.

An alternative to the Disabled effect is **enforcementMode**, which is set on the policy assignment.
When **enforcementMode** is _Disabled_, resources are still evaluated. Logging, such as Activity
logs, and the policy effect don't occur. For more information, see
[policy assignment - enforcement mode](./assignment-structure.md#enforcement-mode).

## EnforceOPAConstraint

This effect is used with a policy definition _mode_ of `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`. It's used to
pass Gatekeeper v3 admission control rules defined with
[OPA Constraint Framework](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/frameworks/tree/master/constraint#opa-constraint-framework)
to [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) to Kubernetes clusters on Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The limited preview policy definitions with **EnforceOPAConstraint** effect and the related
> **Kubernetes Service** category are _deprecated_. Instead, use the effects _audit_ and _deny_ with
> Resource Provider mode `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`.

### EnforceOPAConstraint evaluation

The Open Policy Agent admission controller evaluates any new request on the cluster in real time.
Every 15 minutes, a full scan of the cluster is completed and the results reported to Azure Policy.

### EnforceOPAConstraint properties

The **details** property of the EnforceOPAConstraint effect has the subproperties that describe the
Gatekeeper v3 admission control rule.

- **constraintTemplate** (required)
  - The Constraint template CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that defines new Constraints. The
    template defines the Rego logic, the Constraint schema, and the Constraint parameters that are
    passed via **values** from Azure Policy.
- **constraint** (required)
  - The CRD implementation of the Constraint template. Uses parameters passed via **values** as
    `{{ .Values.<valuename> }}`. In the example below, these values are `{{ .Values.cpuLimit }}` and
    `{{ .Values.memoryLimit }}`.
- **values** (optional)
  - Defines any parameters and values to pass to the Constraint. Each value must exist in the
    Constraint template CRD.

### EnforceOPAConstraint example

Example: Gatekeeper v3 admission control rule to set container CPU and memory resource limits in
Kubernetes.

```json
"if": {
    "allOf": [
        {
            "field": "type",
            "in": [
                "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters",
                "AKS Engine"
            ]
        },
        {
            "field": "location",
            "equals": "westus2"
        }
    ]
},
"then": {
    "effect": "enforceOPAConstraint",
    "details": {
        "constraintTemplate": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/Kubernetes/container-resource-limits/template.yaml",
        "constraint": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/Kubernetes/container-resource-limits/constraint.yaml",
        "values": {
            "cpuLimit": "[parameters('cpuLimit')]",
            "memoryLimit": "[parameters('memoryLimit')]"
        }
    }
}
```

## EnforceRegoPolicy

This effect is used with a policy definition _mode_ of `Microsoft.ContainerService.Data`. It's used
to pass Gatekeeper v2 admission control rules defined with
[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#what-is-rego) to
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) on
[Azure Kubernetes Service](../../../aks/intro-kubernetes.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The limited preview policy definitions with **EnforceRegoPolicy** effect and the related
> **Kubernetes Service** category are _deprecated_. Instead, use the effects _audit_ and _deny_ with
> Resource Provider mode `Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data`.

### EnforceRegoPolicy evaluation

The Open Policy Agent admission controller evaluates any new request on the cluster in real time.
Every 15 minutes, a full scan of the cluster is completed and the results reported to Azure Policy.

### EnforceRegoPolicy properties

The **details** property of the EnforceRegoPolicy effect has the subproperties that describe the
Gatekeeper v2 admission control rule.

- **policyId** (required)
  - A unique name passed as a parameter to the Rego admission control rule.
- **policy** (required)
  - Specifies the URI of the Rego admission control rule.
- **policyParameters** (optional)
  - Defines any parameters and values to pass to the rego policy.

### EnforceRegoPolicy example

Example: Gatekeeper v2 admission control rule to allow only the specified container images in AKS.

```json
"if": {
    "allOf": [
        {
            "field": "type",
            "equals": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters"
        },
        {
            "field": "location",
            "equals": "westus2"
        }
    ]
},
"then": {
    "effect": "EnforceRegoPolicy",
    "details": {
        "policyId": "ContainerAllowedImages",
        "policy": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy/master/built-in-references/KubernetesService/container-allowed-images/limited-preview/gatekeeperpolicy.rego",
        "policyParameters": {
            "allowedContainerImagesRegex": "[parameters('allowedContainerImagesRegex')]"
        }
    }
}
```

## Modify

Modify is used to add, update, or remove properties or tags on a resource during creation or update.
A common example is updating tags on resources such as costCenter. Existing non-compliant resources
can be remediated with a [remediation task](../how-to/remediate-resources.md). A single Modify rule
can have any number of operations.

The following operations are supported by Modify:

- Add, replace or remove resource tags. For tags, a Modify policy should have `mode` set to
  _Indexed_ unless the target resource is a resource group.
- Add or replace the value of managed identity type (`identity.type`) of virtual machines and
  virtual machine scale sets.
- Add or replace the values of certain aliases (preview).
  - Use
    `Get-AzPolicyAlias | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'Aliases' | Where-Object { $_.DefaultMetadata.Attributes -eq 'Modifiable' }`
    in Azure PowerShell **4.6.0** or higher to get a list of aliases that can be used with Modify.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're managing tags, it's recommended to use Modify instead of Append as Modify provides
> additional operation types and the ability to remediate existing resources. However, Append is
> recommended if you aren't able to create a managed identity or Modify doesn't yet support the
> alias for the resource property.

### Modify evaluation

Modify evaluates before the request gets processed by a Resource Provider during the creation or
updating of a resource. The Modify operations are applied to the request content when the **if**
condition of the policy rule is met. Each Modify operation can specify a condition that determines
when it's applied. Operations with conditions that are evaluated to _false_ are skipped.

When an alias is specified, the following additional checks are performed to ensure that the Modify
operation doesn't change the request content in a way that causes the resource provider to reject
it:

- The property the alias maps to is marked as 'Modifiable' in the request's API version.
- The token type in the Modify operation matches the expected token type for the property in the
  request's API version.

If either of these checks fail, the policy evaluation falls back to the specified
**conflictEffect**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommeneded that Modify definitions that include aliases use the _audit_ **conflict effect**
> to avoid failing requests using API versions where the mapped property isn't 'Modifiable'. If the
> same alias behaves differently between API versions, conditional modify operations can be used to
> determine the modify operation used for each API version.

When a policy definition using the Modify effect is run as part of an evaluation cycle, it doesn't
make changes to resources that already exist. Instead, it marks any resource that meets the **if**
condition as non-compliant.

### Modify properties

The **details** property of the Modify effect has all the subproperties that define the permissions
needed for remediation and the **operations** used to add, update, or remove tag values.

- **roleDefinitionIds** (required)
  - This property must include an array of strings that match role-based access control role ID
    accessible by the subscription. For more information, see
    [remediation - configure policy definition](../how-to/remediate-resources.md#configure-policy-definition).
  - The role defined must include all operations granted to the
    [Contributor](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role.
- **conflictEffect** (optional)
  - Determines which policy definition "wins" in the event that more than one policy definition
    modifies the same property or when the Modify operation doesn't work on the specified alias.
    - For new or updated resources, the policy definition with _deny_ takes precedence. Policy
      definitions with _audit_ skip all **operations**. If more than one policy definition has
      _deny_, the request is denied as a conflict. If all policy definitions have _audit_, then none
      of the **operations** of the conflicting policy definitions are processed.
    - For existing resources, if more than one policy definition has _deny_, the compliance status
      is _Conflict_. If one or fewer policy definitions have _deny_, each assignment returns a
      compliance status of _Non-compliant_.
  - Available values: _audit_, _deny_, _disabled_.
  - Default value is _deny_.
- **operations** (required)
  - An array of all tag operations to be completed on matching resources.
  - Properties:
    - **operation** (required)
      - Defines what action to take on a matching resource. Options are: _addOrReplace_, _Add_,
        _Remove_. _Add_ behaves similar to the [Append](#append) effect.
    - **field** (required)
      - The tag to add, replace, or remove. Tag names must adhere to the same naming convention for
        other [fields](./definition-structure.md#fields).
    - **value** (optional)
      - The value to set the tag to.
      - This property is required if **operation** is _addOrReplace_ or _Add_.
    - **condition** (optional)
      - A string containing an Azure Policy language expression with
        [Policy functions](./definition-structure.md#policy-functions) that evaluates to _true_ or
        _false_.
      - Doesn't support the following Policy functions: `field()`, `resourceGroup()`,
        `subscription()`.

### Modify operations

The **operations** property array makes it possible to alter several tags in different ways from a
single policy definition. Each operation is made up of **operation**, **field**, and **value**
properties. Operation determines what the remediation task does to the tags, field determines which
tag is altered, and value defines the new setting for that tag. The example below makes the
following tag changes:

- Sets the `environment` tag to "Test", even if it already exists with a different value.
- Removes the tag `TempResource`.
- Sets the `Dept` tag to the policy parameter _DeptName_ configured on the policy assignment.

```json
"details": {
    ...
    "operations": [
        {
            "operation": "addOrReplace",
            "field": "tags['environment']",
            "value": "Test"
        },
        {
            "operation": "Remove",
            "field": "tags['TempResource']",
        },
        {
            "operation": "addOrReplace",
            "field": "tags['Dept']",
            "value": "[parameters('DeptName')]"
        }
    ]
}
```

The **operation** property has the following options:

|Operation |Description |
|-|-|
|addOrReplace |Adds the defined property or tag and value to the resource, even if the property or tag already exists with a different value. |
|Add |Adds the defined property or tag and value to the resource. |
|Remove |Removes the defined property or tag from the resource. |

### Modify examples

Example 1: Add the `environment` tag and replace existing `environment` tags with "Test":

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "modify",
    "details": {
        "roleDefinitionIds": [
            "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c"
        ],
        "operations": [
            {
                "operation": "addOrReplace",
                "field": "tags['environment']",
                "value": "Test"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Example 2: Remove the `env` tag and add the `environment` tag or replace existing `environment` tags
with a parameterized value:

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "modify",
    "details": {
        "roleDefinitionIds": [
            "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c"
        ],
        "conflictEffect": "deny",
        "operations": [
            {
                "operation": "Remove",
                "field": "tags['env']"
            },
            {
                "operation": "addOrReplace",
                "field": "tags['environment']",
                "value": "[parameters('tagValue')]"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Example 3: Ensure that a storage account doesn't allow blob public access, the Modify operation
is applied only when evaluating requests with API version greater or equals to '2019-04-01':

```json
"then": {
    "effect": "modify",
    "details": {
        "roleDefinitionIds": [
            "/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/17d1049b-9a84-46fb-8f53-869881c3d3ab"
        ],
        "conflictEffect": "audit",
        "operations": [
            {
                "condition": "[greaterOrEquals(requestContext().apiVersion, '2019-04-01')]",
                "operation": "addOrReplace",
                "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/allowBlobPublicAccess",
                "value": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Layering policy definitions

A resource may be impacted by several assignments. These assignments may be at the same scope or at
different scopes. Each of these assignments is also likely to have a different effect defined. The
condition and effect for each policy is independently evaluated. For example:

- Policy 1
  - Restricts resource location to 'westus'
  - Assigned to subscription A
  - Deny effect
- Policy 2
  - Restricts resource location to 'eastus'
  - Assigned to resource group B in subscription A
  - Audit effect
  
This setup would result in the following outcome:

- Any resource already in resource group B in 'eastus' is compliant to policy 2 and non-compliant to
  policy 1
- Any resource already in resource group B not in 'eastus' is non-compliant to policy 2 and
  non-compliant to policy 1 if not in 'westus'
- Any new resource in subscription A not in 'westus' is denied by policy 1
- Any new resource in subscription A and resource group B in 'westus' is created and non-compliant
  on policy 2

If both policy 1 and policy 2 had effect of deny, the situation changes to:

- Any resource already in resource group B not in 'eastus' is non-compliant to policy 2
- Any resource already in resource group B not in 'westus' is non-compliant to policy 1
- Any new resource in subscription A not in 'westus' is denied by policy 1
- Any new resource in resource group B of subscription A is denied

Each assignment is individually evaluated. As such, there isn't an opportunity for a resource to
slip through a gap from differences in scope. The net result of layering policy definitions is
considered to be **cumulative most restrictive**. As an example, if both policy 1 and 2 had a deny
effect, a resource would be blocked by the overlapping and conflicting policy definitions. If you
still need the resource to be created in the target scope, review the exclusions on each assignment
to validate the right policy assignments are affecting the right scopes.
