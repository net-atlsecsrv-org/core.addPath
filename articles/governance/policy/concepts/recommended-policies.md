# Recommended policies for Azure services

Customers who are new to Azure Policy often look to find common policy definitions to manage and
govern their resources. Azure Policy's **Recommended policies** provides a focused list of common
policy definitions to start with. The **Recommended policies** experience for supported resources is
embedded within the portal experience for that resource.

For additional Azure Policy built-ins, see
[Azure Policy built-in definitions](../samples/built-in-policies.md).

## Azure Virtual Machines

The **Recommended policies** for [Azure Virtual Machines](../../../virtual-machines/index.yml) are
on the **Overview** page for virtual machines and under the **Capabilities** tab. In the _Azure
Policy_ card, select the "Not configured" or "# assigned" text to open a side pane with the
recommended policies. Any policy definition already assigned to a scope the virtual machine is a
member of is grayed-out. Select the recommended policies to apply to this virtual machine and select
**Assign policies** to create an assignment for each.

As an organization reaches maturity with
[organizing their resources and resource hierarchy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/organize-subscriptions),
it's recommended to transition these policy assignments from one per resource to the subscription or
[management group](../../management-groups/index.yml) level.
