# Explore your Azure resources with Resource Graph

Azure Resource Graph provides the ability to explore and discover your Azure resources quickly and
at scale. Engineered for fast responses, it's a great way to learn about your environment and also
about the properties that make up your Azure resources.

## Explore virtual machines

A common resource in Azure is a virtual machine. As a resource type, virtual machines have many
properties that can be queried. Each property provides an option for filtering or finding exactly
the resource you're looking for.

### Virtual machine discovery

Let's start with a simple query to get a single VM from our environment and look at the properties
returned.

```kusto
Resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
| limit 1
```

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' | limit 1"
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' | limit 1" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure PowerShell `Search-AzGraph` cmdlet returns a **PSCustomObject** by default. To have the
> output look the same as what is returned by Azure CLI, the `ConvertTo-Json` cmdlet is used. The
> default value for **Depth** is _2_. Setting it to _100_ should convert all returned levels.

The JSON results are structured similar to the following example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/ContosoVM1",
    "kind": "",
    "location": "westus2",
    "managedBy": "",
    "name": "ContosoVM1",
    "plan": {},
    "properties": {
      "hardwareProfile": {
        "vmSize": "Standard_B2s"
      },
      "networkProfile": {
        "networkInterfaces": [
          {
            "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/contosovm1535",
            "resourceGroup": "MyResourceGroup"
          }
        ]
      },
      "osProfile": {
        "adminUsername": "localAdmin",
        "computerName": "ContosoVM1",
        "secrets": [],
        "windowsConfiguration": {
          "enableAutomaticUpdates": true,
          "provisionVMAgent": true
        }
      },
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
      "storageProfile": {
        "dataDisks": [],
        "imageReference": {
          "offer": "WindowsServer",
          "publisher": "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
          "sku": "2016-Datacenter",
          "version": "latest"
        },
        "osDisk": {
          "caching": "ReadWrite",
          "createOption": "FromImage",
          "diskSizeGB": 127,
          "managedDisk": {
            "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166",
            "resourceGroup": "MyResourceGroup",
            "storageAccountType": "Premium_LRS"
          },
          "name": "ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166",
          "osType": "Windows"
        }
      },
      "vmId": "bbb9b451-6dc7-4117-bec5-c971eb1118c6"
    },
    "resourceGroup": "MyResourceGroup",
    "sku": {},
    "subscriptionId": "<subscriptionId>",
    "tags": {},
    "type": "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
  }
]
```

The properties tell us additional information about the virtual machine resource itself, everything
from SKU, OS, disks, tags, and the resource group and subscription it's a member of.

### Virtual machines by location

Taking what we learned about the virtual machines resource, let's use the **location** property to
count all virtual machines by location. To update the query, we'll remove the limit and summarize
the count of location values.

```kusto
Resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
| summarize count() by location
```

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' | summarize count() by location"
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' | summarize count() by location"
```

The JSON results are structured similar to the following example:

```json
[
  {
    "count_": 386,
    "location": "eastus"
  },
  {
    "count_": 215,
    "location": "southcentralus"
  },
  {
    "count_": 59,
    "location": "westus"
  }
]
```

We can now see how many virtual machines we have in each Azure region.

### Virtual machines by SKU

Going back to the original virtual machine properties, let's try to find all the virtual machines
that have a SKU size of **Standard_B2s**. Looking at the JSON returned, we see that it's stored in
**properties.hardwareprofile.vmsize**. We'll update the query to find all VMs that match this size
and return just the name of the VM and region.

```kusto
Resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize == 'Standard_B2s'
| project name, resourceGroup
```

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize == 'Standard_B2s' | project name, resourceGroup"
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize == 'Standard_B2s' | project name, resourceGroup"
```

### Virtual machines connected to premium-managed disks

If we wanted to get the details of premium-managed disks that are attached to these
**Standard_B2s** virtual machines, we can expand the query to give us the resource ID of those
managed disks.

```kusto
Resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachines' and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize == 'Standard_B2s'
| extend disk = properties.storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk
| where disk.storageAccountType == 'Premium_LRS'
| project disk.id
```

> [!NOTE]
> Another way to get the SKU would have been by using the **aliases** property
> **Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/sku.name**. See the [Show aliases](../samples/starter.md#show-aliases)
> and [Show distinct alias values](../samples/starter.md#distinct-alias-values) examples.

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachines' and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize == 'Standard_B2s' | extend disk = properties.storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk | where disk.storageAccountType == 'Premium_LRS' | project disk.id"
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachines' and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize == 'Standard_B2s' | extend disk = properties.storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk | where disk.storageAccountType == 'Premium_LRS' | project disk.id"
```

The result is a list of disk IDs.

### Managed disk discovery

With the first record from the previous query, we'll explore the properties that exist on the
managed disk that was attached to the first virtual machine. The updated query uses the disk ID and
changes the type.

Example output from the previous query for example:

```json
[
  {
    "disk_id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166"
  }
]
```

```kusto
Resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/disks' and id == '/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166'
```

Before running the query, how did we know the **type** should now be **Microsoft.Compute/disks**?
If you look at the full ID, you'll see **/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/** as part of the
string. This string fragment gives you a hint as to what type to search for. An alternative method
would be to remove the limit by type and instead only search by the ID field. As the ID is unique,
only one record would be returned and the **type** property on it provides that detail.

> [!NOTE]
> For this example to work, you must replace the ID field with a result from your own environment.

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/disks' and id == '/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166'"
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/disks' and id == '/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166'"
```

The JSON results are structured similar to the following example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166",
    "kind": "",
    "location": "westus2",
    "managedBy": "",
    "name": "ContosoVM1_OsDisk_1_9676b7e1b3c44e2cb672338ebe6f5166",
    "plan": {},
    "properties": {
      "creationData": {
        "createOption": "Empty"
      },
      "diskSizeGB": 127,
      "diskState": "ActiveSAS",
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
      "timeCreated": "2018-09-14T12:17:32.2570000Z"
    },
    "resourceGroup": "MyResourceGroup",
    "sku": {
      "name": "Premium_LRS",
      "tier": "Premium"
    },
    "subscriptionId": "<subscriptionId>",
    "tags": {
      "environment": "prod"
    },
    "type": "microsoft.compute/disks"
  }
]
```

## Explore virtual machines to find public IP addresses

This set of queries first finds and stores all the network interfaces (NIC) resources connected to
virtual machines. Then the queries use the list of NICs to find each IP address resource that is a
public IP address and store those values. Finally, the queries provide a list of the public IP
addresses.

```azurecli-interactive
# Use Resource Graph to get all NICs and store in the 'nics.txt' file
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' | project nic = tostring(properties['networkProfile']['networkInterfaces'][0]['id']) | where isnotempty(nic) | distinct nic | limit 20" --output table | tail -n +3 > nics.txt

# Review the output of the query stored in 'nics.txt'
cat nics.txt
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Use Resource Graph to get all NICs and store in the $nics variable
$nics = Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines' | project nic = tostring(properties['networkProfile']['networkInterfaces'][0]['id']) | where isnotempty(nic) | distinct nic | limit 20"

# Review the output of the query stored in the variable
$nics.nic
```

Use the file (Azure CLI) or variable (Azure PowerShell) in the next query to get the related network
interface resources details where there's a public IP address attached to the NIC.

```azurecli-interactive
# Use Resource Graph with the 'nics.txt' file to get all related public IP addresses and store in 'publicIp.txt' file
az graph query -q="Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces' | where id in ('$(awk -vORS="','" '{print $0}' nics.txt | sed 's/,$//')') | project publicIp = tostring(properties['ipConfigurations'][0]['properties']['publicIPAddress']['id']) | where isnotempty(publicIp) | distinct publicIp" --output table | tail -n +3 > ips.txt

# Review the output of the query stored in 'ips.txt'
cat ips.txt
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Use Resource Graph  with the $nics variable to get all related public IP addresses and store in $ips variable
$ips = Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces' | where id in ('$($nics.nic -join "','")') | project publicIp = tostring(properties['ipConfigurations'][0]['properties']['publicIPAddress']['id']) | where isnotempty(publicIp) | distinct publicIp"

# Review the output of the query stored in the variable
$ips.publicIp
```

Last, use the list of public IP address resources stored in the file (Azure CLI) or variable (Azure
PowerShell) to get the actual public IP address from the related object and display.

```azurecli-interactive
# Use Resource Graph with the 'ips.txt' file to get the IP address of the public IP address resources
az graph query -q="Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses' | where id in ('$(awk -vORS="','" '{print $0}' ips.txt | sed 's/,$//')') | project ip = tostring(properties['ipAddress']) | where isnotempty(ip) | distinct ip" --output table
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Use Resource Graph with the $ips variable to get the IP address of the public IP address resources
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses' | where id in ('$($ips.publicIp -join "','")') | project ip = tostring(properties['ipAddress']) | where isnotempty(ip) | distinct ip"
```

To see how to accomplish these steps in a single query with the `join` operator, see the
[List virtual machines with their network interface and public IP](../samples/advanced.md#join-vmpip)
sample.
