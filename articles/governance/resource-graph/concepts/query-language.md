# Understanding the Azure Resource Graph query language

The query language for the Azure Resource Graph supports a number of operators and functions. Each
work and operate based on [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](/azure/kusto/query/index). To learn about the
query language used by Resource Graph, start with the
[tutorial for KQL](/azure/kusto/query/tutorial).

This article covers the language components supported by Resource Graph:

- [Resource Graph tables](#resource-graph-tables)
- [Supported KQL language elements](#supported-kql-language-elements)
- [Escape characters](#escape-characters)

## Resource Graph tables

Resource Graph provides several tables for the data it stores about Resource Manager resource types
and their properties. These tables can be used with `join` or `union` operators to get properties
from related resource types. Here is the list of tables available in Resource Graph:

|Resource Graph tables |Description |
|---|---|
|Resources |The default table if none defined in the query. Most Resource Manager resource types and properties are here. |
|ResourceContainers |Includes subscription (in preview -- `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions`) and resource group (`Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups`) resource types and data. |
|AlertsManagementResources |Includes resources _related_ to `Microsoft.AlertsManagement`. |
|SecurityResources |Includes resources _related_ to `Microsoft.Security`. |

> [!NOTE]
> _Resources_ is the default table. While querying the _Resources_ table, it isn't required to
> provide the table name unless `join` or `union` are used. However, the recommended practice is to
> always include the initial table in the query.

Use Resource Graph Explorer in the portal to discover what resource types are available in each
table. As an alternative, use a query such as `<tableName> | distinct type` to get a list of
resource types the given Resource Graph table supports that exist in your environment.

The following query shows a simple `join`. The query result blends the columns together and any
duplicate column names from the joined table, _ResourceContainers_ in this example, are appended
with **1**. As _ResourceContainers_ table has types for both subscriptions and resource groups,
either type might be used to join to the resource from _resources_ table.

```kusto
Resources
| join ResourceContainers on subscriptionId
| limit 1
```

The following query shows a more complex use of `join`. The query limits the joined table to
subscriptions resources and with `project` to include only the original field _subscriptionId_ and
the _name_ field renamed to _SubName_. The field rename avoids `join` adding it as _name1_ since the
field already exists in _Resources_. The original table is filtered with `where` and the following
`project` includes columns from both tables. The query result is a single key vault displaying type,
the name of the key vault, and the name of the subscription it's in.

```kusto
Resources
| where type == 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults'
| join (ResourceContainers | where type=='microsoft.resources/subscriptions' | project SubName=name, subscriptionId) on subscriptionId
| project type, name, SubName
| limit 1
```

> [!NOTE]
> When limiting the `join` results with `project`, the property used by `join` to relate the two
> tables, _subscriptionId_ in the above example, must be included in `project`.

## Supported KQL language elements

Resource Graph supports all KQL [data types](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/),
[scalar functions](/azure/kusto/query/scalarfunctions),
[scalar operators](/azure/kusto/query/binoperators), and
[aggregation functions](/azure/kusto/query/any-aggfunction). Specific
[tabular operators](/azure/kusto/query/queries) are supported by Resource Graph, some of which have
different behaviors.

### Supported tabular/top level operators

Here is the list of KQL tabular operators supported by Resource Graph with specific samples:

|KQL |Resource Graph sample query |Notes |
|---|---|---|
|[count](/azure/kusto/query/countoperator) |[Count key vaults](../samples/starter.md#count-keyvaults) | |
|[distinct](/azure/kusto/query/distinctoperator) |[Show distinct values for a specific alias](../samples/starter.md#distinct-alias-values) | |
|[extend](/azure/kusto/query/extendoperator) |[Count virtual machines by OS type](../samples/starter.md#count-os) | |
|[join](/azure/kusto/query/joinoperator) |[Key vault with subscription name](../samples/advanced.md#join) |Join flavors supported: [innerunique](/azure/kusto/query/joinoperator#default-join-flavor), [inner](/azure/kusto/query/joinoperator#inner-join), [leftouter](/azure/kusto/query/joinoperator#left-outer-join). Limit of 3 `join` in a single query. Custom join strategies, such as broadcast join, aren't allowed. May be used within a single table or between the _Resources_ and _ResourceContainers_ tables. |
|[limit](/azure/kusto/query/limitoperator) |[List all public IP addresses](../samples/starter.md#list-publicip) |Synonym of `take` |
|[mvexpand](/azure/kusto/query/mvexpandoperator) | | Legacy operator, use `mv-expand` instead. _RowLimit_ max of 400. The default is 128. |
|[mv-expand](/azure/kusto/query/mvexpandoperator) |[List Cosmos DB with specific write locations](../samples/advanced.md#mvexpand-cosmosdb) |_RowLimit_ max of 400. The default is 128. |
|[order](/azure/kusto/query/orderoperator) |[List resources sorted by name](../samples/starter.md#list-resources) |Synonym of `sort` |
|[project](/azure/kusto/query/projectoperator) |[List resources sorted by name](../samples/starter.md#list-resources) | |
|[project-away](/azure/kusto/query/projectawayoperator) |[Remove columns from results](../samples/advanced.md#remove-column) | |
|[sort](/azure/kusto/query/sortoperator) |[List resources sorted by name](../samples/starter.md#list-resources) |Synonym of `order` |
|[summarize](/azure/kusto/query/summarizeoperator) |[Count Azure resources](../samples/starter.md#count-resources) |Simplified first page only |
|[take](/azure/kusto/query/takeoperator) |[List all public IP addresses](../samples/starter.md#list-publicip) |Synonym of `limit` |
|[top](/azure/kusto/query/topoperator) |[Show first five virtual machines by name and their OS type](../samples/starter.md#show-sorted) | |
|[union](/azure/kusto/query/unionoperator) |[Combine results from two queries into a single result](../samples/advanced.md#unionresults) |Single table allowed: _T_ `| union` \[`kind=` `inner`\|`outer`\] \[`withsource=`_ColumnName_\] _Table_. Limit of 3 `union` legs in a single query. Fuzzy resolution of `union` leg tables isn't allowed. May be used within a single table or between the _Resources_ and _ResourceContainers_ tables. |
|[where](/azure/kusto/query/whereoperator) |[Show resources that contain storage](../samples/starter.md#show-storage) | |

## Escape characters

Some property names, such as those that include a `.` or `$`, must be wrapped or escaped in the
query or the property name is interpreted incorrectly and doesn't provide the expected results.

- `.` - Wrap the property name as such: `['propertyname.withaperiod']`
  
  Example query that wraps the property _odata.type_:

  ```kusto
  where type=~'Microsoft.Insights/alertRules' | project name, properties.condition.['odata.type']
  ```

- `$` - Escape the character in the property name. The escape character used depends on the shell
  Resource Graph is run from.

  - **bash** - `\`

    Example query that escapes the property _\$type_ in bash:

    ```kusto
    where type=~'Microsoft.Insights/alertRules' | project name, properties.condition.\$type
    ```

  - **cmd** - Don't escape the `$` character.

  - **PowerShell** - ``` ` ```

    Example query that escapes the property _\$type_ in PowerShell:

    ```kusto
    where type=~'Microsoft.Insights/alertRules' | project name, properties.condition.`$type
    ```
