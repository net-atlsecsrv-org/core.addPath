# Troubleshoot errors using Azure Resource Graph

You may run into errors when querying Azure resources with Azure Resource Graph. This article
describes various errors that may occur and how to resolve them.

## Finding error details

Most errors are the result of an issue while running a query with Azure Resource Graph. When a query
fails, the SDK provides details about the failed query. This information indicates the issue so that
it can be fixed and a later query succeeds.

## General errors

### <a name="toomanysubscription"></a>Scenario: Too many subscriptions

#### Issue

Customers with access to more than 1000 subscriptions, including cross-tenant subscriptions with [Azure Lighthouse](../../../lighthouse/overview.md),
can't fetch data across all subscriptions in a single call to Azure Resource Graph.

#### Cause

Azure CLI and PowerShell forward only the first 1000 subscriptions to Azure Resource Graph. The REST
API for Azure Resource Graph accepts a maximum number of subscriptions to perform the query on.

#### Resolution

Batch requests for the query with a subset of subscriptions to stay under the 1000 subscription
limit. The solution is using the **Subscription** parameter in PowerShell.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Replace this query with your own
$query = 'project type'

# Fetch the full array of subscription IDs
$subscriptions = Get-AzSubscription
$subscriptionIds = $subscriptions.Id

# Create a counter, set the batch size, and prepare a variable for the results
$counter = [PSCustomObject] @{ Value = 0 }
$batchSize = 1000
$response = @()

# Group the subscriptions into batches
$subscriptionsBatch = $subscriptionIds | Group -Property { [math]::Floor($counter.Value++ / $batchSize) }

# Run the query for each batch
foreach ($batch in $subscriptionsBatch){ $response += Search-AzGraph -Query $query -Subscription $batch.Group }

# View the completed results of the query on all subscriptions
$response
```
