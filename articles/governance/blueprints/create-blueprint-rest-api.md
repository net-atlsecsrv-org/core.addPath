# Quickstart: Define and Assign an Azure Blueprint with REST API

Learning how to create and assign blueprints enables the definition of common patterns to develop
reusable and rapidly deployable configurations based on Resource Manager templates, policy,
security, and more. In this tutorial, you learn to use Azure Blueprints to do some of the common
tasks related to creating, publishing, and assigning a blueprint within your organization, such as:

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
  [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) before you begin.
- Register the `Microsoft.Blueprint` resource provider. For directions, see
  [Resource providers and types](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Getting started with REST API

If you're unfamiliar with REST API, start by reviewing [Azure REST API Reference](/rest/api/azure/)
to get a general understanding of REST API, specifically request URI and request body. This article
uses these concepts to provide directions for working with Azure Blueprints and assumes a working
knowledge of them. Tools such as [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient) and others
may handle authorization automatically and are recommended for beginners.

For the Blueprints specs, see [Azure Blueprints REST API](/rest/api/blueprints/).

### REST API and PowerShell

If you don't already have a tool for making REST API calls, consider using PowerShell for these
instructions. Following is a sample header for authenticating with Azure. Generate an authentication
header, sometimes called a **Bearer token**, and provide the REST API URI to connect to with any
parameters or a **Request Body**:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Log in first with Connect-AzAccount if not using Cloud Shell

$azContext = Get-AzContext
$azProfile = [Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Common.Authentication.Abstractions.AzureRmProfileProvider]::Instance.Profile
$profileClient = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceManager.Common.RMProfileClient -ArgumentList ($azProfile)
$token = $profileClient.AcquireAccessToken($azContext.Subscription.TenantId)
$authHeader = @{
    'Content-Type'='application/json'
    'Authorization'='Bearer ' + $token.AccessToken
}

# Invoke the REST API
$restUri = 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}?api-version=2016-06-01'
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $restUri -Method Get -Headers $authHeader
```

Replace `{subscriptionId}` in the **$restUri** variable above to get information about your
subscription. The $response variable holds the result of the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet, which can
be parsed with cmdlets such as
[ConvertFrom-Json](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertfrom-json). If the REST
API service endpoint expects a **Request Body**, provide a JSON formatted variable to the `-Body`
parameter of `Invoke-RestMethod`.

## Create a blueprint

The first step in defining a standard pattern for compliance is to compose a blueprint from the
available resources. We'll create a blueprint named 'MyBlueprint' to configure role and policy
assignments for the subscription. Then we'll add a resource group, a Resource Manager template, and
a role assignment on the resource group.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the REST API, the _blueprint_ object is created first. For each _artifact_ to be added
> that has parameters, the parameters need to be defined in advance on the initial _blueprint_.

In each REST API URI, there are variables that are used that you need to replace with your own
values:

- `{YourMG}` - Replace with the ID of your management group
- `{subscriptionId}` - Replace with your subscription ID

> [!NOTE]
> Blueprints may also be created at the subscription level. To see an example, see
> [create blueprint at subscription example](/rest/api/blueprints/blueprints/createorupdate#subscriptionblueprint).

1. Create the initial _blueprint_ object. The **Request Body** includes properties about the
   blueprint, any resource groups to create, and all of the blueprint level parameters. The
   parameters are set during assignment and used by the artifacts added in later steps.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "properties": {
             "description": "This blueprint sets tag policy and role assignment on the subscription, creates a ResourceGroup, and deploys a resource template and role assignment to that ResourceGroup.",
             "targetScope": "subscription",
             "parameters": {
                 "storageAccountType": {
                     "type": "string",
                     "metadata": {
                         "displayName": "storage account type.",
                         "description": null
                     }
                 },
                 "tagName": {
                     "type": "string",
                     "metadata": {
                         "displayName": "The name of the tag to provide the policy assignment.",
                         "description": null
                     }
                 },
                 "tagValue": {
                     "type": "string",
                     "metadata": {
                         "displayName": "The value of the tag to provide the policy assignment.",
                         "description": null
                     }
                 },
                 "contributors": {
                     "type": "array",
                     "metadata": {
                         "description": "List of AAD object IDs that is assigned Contributor role at the subscription"
                     }
                 },
                 "owners": {
                     "type": "array",
                     "metadata": {
                         "description": "List of AAD object IDs that is assigned Owner role at the resource group"
                     }
                 }
             },
             "resourceGroups": {
                 "storageRG": {
                     "description": "Contains the resource template deployment and a role assignment."
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

1. Add role assignment at subscription. The **Request Body** defines the _kind_ of artifact, the
   properties align to the role definition identifier, and the principal identities are passed as an
   array of values. In the example below, the principal identities granted the specified role are
   configured to a parameter that is set during blueprint assignment. This example uses the
   _Contributor_ built-in role with a GUID of `b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c`.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint/artifacts/roleContributor?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "kind": "roleAssignment",
         "properties": {
             "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c",
             "principalIds": "[parameters('contributors')]"
         }
     }
     ```

1. Add policy assignment at subscription. The **Request Body** defines the _kind_ of artifact, the
   properties that align to a policy or initiative definition, and configures the policy assignment
   to use the defined blueprint parameters to configure during blueprint assignment. This example
   uses the _Apply tag and its default value to resource groups_ built-in policy with a GUID of
   `49c88fc8-6fd1-46fd-a676-f12d1d3a4c71`.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint/artifacts/policyTags?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "kind": "policyAssignment",
         "properties": {
             "description": "Apply tag and its default value to resource groups",
             "policyDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/49c88fc8-6fd1-46fd-a676-f12d1d3a4c71",
             "parameters": {
                 "tagName": {
                     "value": "[parameters('tagName')]"
                 },
                 "tagValue": {
                     "value": "[parameters('tagValue')]"
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

1. Add another policy assignment for Storage tag (reusing _storageAccountType_ parameter) at
   subscription. This additional policy assignment artifact demonstrates that a parameter defined on
   the blueprint is usable by more than one artifact. In the example, the **storageAccountType** is
   used to set a tag on the resource group. This value provides information about the storage
   account that is created in the next step. This example uses the _Apply tag and its default value
   to resource groups_ built-in policy with a GUID of `49c88fc8-6fd1-46fd-a676-f12d1d3a4c71`.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint/artifacts/policyStorageTags?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "kind": "policyAssignment",
         "properties": {
             "description": "Apply storage tag and the parameter also used by the template to resource groups",
             "policyDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/49c88fc8-6fd1-46fd-a676-f12d1d3a4c71",
             "parameters": {
                 "tagName": {
                     "value": "StorageType"
                 },
                 "tagValue": {
                     "value": "[parameters('storageAccountType')]"
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

1. Add template under resource group. The **Request Body** for a Resource Manager template includes
   the normal JSON component of the template and defines the target resource group with
   **properties.resourceGroup**. The template also reuses the **storageAccountType**, **tagName**,
   and **tagValue** blueprint parameters by passing each to the template. The blueprint parameters
   are available to the template by defining **properties.parameters** and inside the template JSON
   that key-value pair is used to inject the value. The blueprint and template parameter names could
   be the same, but were made different to illustrate how each passes from the blueprint to the
   template artifact.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint/artifacts/templateStorage?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "kind": "template",
         "properties": {
             "template": {
                 "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
                 "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
                 "parameters": {
                     "storageAccountTypeFromBP": {
                         "type": "string",
                         "defaultValue": "Standard_LRS",
                         "allowedValues": [
                             "Standard_LRS",
                             "Standard_GRS",
                             "Standard_ZRS",
                             "Premium_LRS"
                         ],
                         "metadata": {
                             "description": "Storage Account type"
                         }
                     },
                     "tagNameFromBP": {
                         "type": "string",
                         "defaultValue": "NotSet",
                         "metadata": {
                             "description": "Tag name from blueprint"
                         }
                     },
                     "tagValueFromBP": {
                         "type": "string",
                         "defaultValue": "NotSet",
                         "metadata": {
                             "description": "Tag value from blueprint"
                         }
                     }
                 },
                 "variables": {
                     "storageAccountName": "[concat(uniquestring(resourceGroup().id), 'standardsa')]"
                 },
                 "resources": [{
                     "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
                     "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
                     "apiVersion": "2016-01-01",
                     "tags": {
                        "[parameters('tagNameFromBP')]": "[parameters('tagValueFromBP')]"
                     },
                     "location": "[resourceGroups('storageRG').location]",
                     "sku": {
                         "name": "[parameters('storageAccountTypeFromBP')]"
                     },
                     "kind": "Storage",
                     "properties": {}
                 }],
                 "outputs": {
                     "storageAccountSku": {
                         "type": "string",
                         "value": "[variables('storageAccountName')]"
                     }
                 }
             },
             "resourceGroup": "storageRG",
             "parameters": {
                 "storageAccountTypeFromBP": {
                     "value": "[parameters('storageAccountType')]"
                 },
                 "tagNameFromBP": {
                     "value": "[parameters('tagName')]"
                 },
                 "tagValueFromBP": {
                     "value": "[parameters('tagValue')]"
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

1. Add role assignment under resource group. Similar to the previous role assignment entry, the
   example below uses the definition identifier for the **Owner** role and provides it a different
   parameter from the blueprint. This example uses the _Owner_ built-in role with a GUID of
   `8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635`.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint/artifacts/roleOwner?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "kind": "roleAssignment",
         "properties": {
             "resourceGroup": "storageRG",
             "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635",
             "principalIds": "[parameters('owners')]"
         }
     }
     ```

## Publish a blueprint

Now that the artifacts have been added to the blueprint, it's time to publish it. Publishing makes
it available to assign to a subscription.

- REST API URI

  ```http
  PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint/versions/{BlueprintVersion}?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
  ```

The value for `{BlueprintVersion}` is a string of letters, numbers, and hyphens (no spaces or other
special characters) with a max length of 20 characters. Use something unique and informational such
as **v20180622-135541**.

## Assign a blueprint

Once a blueprint is published using REST API, it's assignable to a subscription. Assign the
blueprint you created to one of the subscriptions under your management group hierarchy. If the
blueprint is saved to a subscription, it can only be assigned to that subscription. The **Request
Body** specifies the blueprint to assign, provides name and location to any resource groups in the
blueprint definition, and provides all parameters defined on the blueprint and used by one or more
attached artifacts.

In each REST API URI, there are variables that are used that you need to replace with your own
values:

- `{tenantId}` - Replace with your tenant ID
- `{YourMG}` - Replace with the ID of your management group
- `{subscriptionId}` - Replace with your subscription ID

1. Provide the Azure Blueprint service principal the **Owner** role on the target subscription. The
   AppId is static (`f71766dc-90d9-4b7d-bd9d-4499c4331c3f`), but the service principal ID varies by
   tenant. Details can be requested for your tenant using the following REST API. It uses
   [Azure Active Directory Graph API](../../active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api.md)
   which has different authorization.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     GET https://graph.windows.net/{tenantId}/servicePrincipals?api-version=1.6&$filter=appId eq 'f71766dc-90d9-4b7d-bd9d-4499c4331c3f'
     ```

1. Run the blueprint deployment by assigning it to a subscription. As the **contributors** and
   **owners** parameters require an array of objectIds of the principals to be granted the role
   assignment, use
   [Azure Active Directory Graph API](../../active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api.md)
   for gathering the objectIds for use in the **Request Body** for your own users, groups, or
   service principals.

   - REST API URI

     ```http
     PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/assignMyBlueprint?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
     ```

   - Request Body

     ```json
     {
         "properties": {
             "blueprintId": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint",
             "resourceGroups": {
                 "storageRG": {
                     "name": "StorageAccount",
                     "location": "eastus2"
                 }
             },
             "parameters": {
                 "storageAccountType": {
                     "value": "Standard_GRS"
                 },
                 "tagName": {
                     "value": "CostCenter"
                 },
                 "tagValue": {
                     "value": "ContosoIT"
                 },
                 "contributors": {
                     "value": [
                         "7be2f100-3af5-4c15-bcb7-27ee43784a1f",
                         "38833b56-194d-420b-90ce-cff578296714"
                     ]
                 },
                 "owners": {
                     "value": [
                         "44254d2b-a0c7-405f-959c-f829ee31c2e7",
                         "316deb5f-7187-4512-9dd4-21e7798b0ef9"
                     ]
                 }
             }
         },
         "identity": {
             "type": "systemAssigned"
         },
         "location": "westus"
     }
     ```

   - User-assigned managed identity

     A blueprint assignment can also use a
     [user-assigned managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).
     In this case, the **identity** portion of the request body changes as follows. Replace
     `{yourRG}` and `{userIdentity}` with your resource group name and the name of your
     user-assigned managed identity, respectively.

     ```json
     "identity": {
         "type": "userAssigned",
         "tenantId": "{tenantId}",
         "userAssignedIdentities": {
             "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{yourRG}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{userIdentity}": {}
         }
     },
     ```

     The **user-assigned managed identity** can be in any subscription and resource group the user
     assigning the blueprint has permissions to.

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Blueprints doesn't manage the user-assigned managed identity. Users are responsible for
     > assigning sufficient roles and permissions or the blueprint assignment will fail.

## Clean up resources

### Unassign a blueprint

You can remove a blueprint from a subscription. Removal is often done when the artifact resources
are no longer needed. When a blueprint is removed, the artifacts assigned as part of that blueprint
are left behind. To remove a blueprint assignment, use the following REST API operation:

- REST API URI

  ```http
  DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/assignMyBlueprint?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
  ```

### Delete a blueprint

To remove the blueprint itself, use the following REST API operation:

- REST API URI

  ```http
  DELETE https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{YourMG}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/MyBlueprint?api-version=2018-11-01-preview
  ```
