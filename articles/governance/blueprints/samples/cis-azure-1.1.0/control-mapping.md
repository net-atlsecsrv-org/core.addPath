# Recommendation mapping of the CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark blueprint sample

The following article details how the Azure Blueprints CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark
blueprint sample maps to the CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark recommendations. For more
information about the recommendations, see [CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/).

The following mappings are to the **CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0**
recommendations. Use the navigation on the right to jump directly to a specific recommendation mapping.
Many of the mapped recommendations are implemented with an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
initiative. To review the complete initiative, open **Policy** in the Azure portal and select the
**Definitions** page. Then, find and select the **\[Preview\] Audit CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations
Benchmark v1.1.0 recommendations and deploy specific VM Extensions to support audit requirements** 
built-in policy initiative.

> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
