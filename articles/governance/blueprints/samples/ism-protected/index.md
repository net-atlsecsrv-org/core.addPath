# Overview of the Australian Government ISM PROTECTED blueprint sample

ISM Governance blueprint sample provides a set of governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) which help towards ISM PROTECTED attestation (Feb 2020 version). This Blueprint helps customers deploy a core set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture requiring accreditation or compliance with the ISM framework. The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this initiative and how these policies help meet various controls defined by ISM framework. When assigned to an architecture, resources will be evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies.
