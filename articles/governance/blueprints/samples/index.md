# Azure Blueprints samples

The following table includes links to samples for Azure Blueprints. Each sample is production
quality and ready to deploy today to assist you in meeting your various compliance needs.

| [CAF Migrate landing zone](./caf-migrate-landing-zone/index.md) | Provides a set of controls to help you set up for migrating your first workload and manage your cloud estate in alignment with the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF)](/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/migrate/index). |

## Samples Strategy

![Blueprint samples strategy](../media/blueprint-samples-strategy.png)

The CAF foundation and the CAF Migrate landing zone blueprints assume that the customer is preparing
an existing clean single subscription for migrating on premises assets / workloads in to Azure.
(Region A and B in Figure above).  

There's an opportunity to iterate on the sample blueprints and look for patterns of customizations
that a customer is applying. There is also an opportunity to proactively address blueprints that are
industry-specific like financial services and e-commerce (top end of Region B). Similarly, we
envision building blueprints for complex architectural considerations like, multiple subscriptions,
high availability, cross region resources and customers who are implementing controls over existing
subscriptions and resources (Region C and D).

There are sample blueprints that address customer scenario where the compliance requirements are
high and the architectural complexities are high (Region E in Figure above). The region F above is
one that will be addressed by customers and partners leveraging the sample blueprints and
customizing it for their unique needs.
