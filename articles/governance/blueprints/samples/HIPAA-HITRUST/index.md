# Overview of the HIPAA HITRUST blueprint sample

HIPAA HITRUST blueprint sample provides a
set of governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) that help towards
[HIPAA HITRUST](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)
attestation. 

## Blueprint sample

The blueprint sample helps customers deploy a core set of policies for any
Azure-deployed architecture requiring accreditation or compliance with the HITRUST HIPAA
framework. The [control mapping](./control-mapping.md) section provides details on policies included
within this initiative and how these policies help meet various controls defined by HITRUST HIPAA framework. When assigned to an architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for
compliance with assigned policies.
