# Control mapping of the Media blueprint sample

The following article details how the Azure Blueprints Media blueprint sample maps to the Media controls. For more
information about the controls, see
[Media](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html).

The following mappings are to the **Media** controls. Use the navigation on the right
to jump directly to a specific control mapping. Many of the mapped controls are implemented with an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
initiative. To review the complete initiative, open **Policy** in the Azure portal and select the
**Definitions** page. Then, find and select the **\[Preview\]: Audit Media controls**
built-in policy initiative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
> definitions. These policies may help you [assess compliance](../../../policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md)
> with the control; however, there often is not a 1:1 or complete match between a control and one or
> more policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves; this
> doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the
> compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at
> this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance
> status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy definitions for this compliance
> blueprint sample may change over time. To view the change history, see the
> [GitHub Commit History](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/commits/master/articles/governance/blueprints/samples/media/control-mapping.md).
