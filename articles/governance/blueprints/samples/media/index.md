# Overview of the Media blueprint sample

Media blueprint sample provides a
set of governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) that help towards
[Media](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)
attestation. 

## Blueprint sample

The blueprint sample helps customers deploy a core set of policies for any
Azure-deployed architecture requiring accreditation or compliance with the Media
framework. The [control mapping](./control-mapping.md) section provides details on policies included
within this initiative and how these policies help meet various controls defined by Media framework. When assigned to an architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for compliance with assigned policies.
