# Control mapping of the FedRAMP High blueprint sample

The following article details how the Azure Blueprints FedRAMP High blueprint sample maps to the
FedRAMP High controls. For more information about the controls, see
[FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline](https://www.fedramp.gov/).

The following mappings are to the **FedRAMP High** controls. Use the navigation on the right to jump
directly to a specific control mapping. Many of the mapped controls are implemented with an
[Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) initiative. To review the complete initiative, open
**Policy** in the Azure portal and select the **Definitions** page. Then, find and select the
**\[Preview\]: Audit FedRAMP High controls and deploy specific VM Extensions to support audit
requirements** built-in policy initiative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
> definitions. These policies may help you
> [assess compliance](../../../policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md) with the control; however,
> there often is not a 1:1 or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such,
> **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves; this doesn't ensure you're
> fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes
> controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time. Therefore, compliance
> in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between
> controls and Azure Policy definitions for this compliance blueprint sample may change over time.

## AC-2 Account Management

This blueprint helps you review accounts that may not comply with your organization's account
management requirements. This blueprint assigns [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
definitions that audit external accounts with read, write, and owner permissions on a subscription
and deprecated accounts. By reviewing the accounts audited by these policies, you can take
appropriate action to ensure account management requirements are met.

- Deprecated accounts should be removed from your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with read permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with write permissions should be removed from your subscription

## AC-2 (7) Account Management | Role-Based Schemes

Azure implements [role-based access control](../../../../role-based-access-control/overview.md)
(RBAC) to help you manage who has access to resources in Azure. Using the Azure portal, you can
review who has access to Azure resources and their permissions. This blueprint also assigns
[Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions to audit use of Azure Active Directory
authentication for SQL Servers and Service Fabric. Using Azure Active Directory authentication
enables simplified permission management and centralized identity management of database users and
other Microsoft services. Additionally, this blueprint assigns an Azure Policy definition to audit
the use of custom RBAC rules. Understanding where custom RBAC rules are implement can help you
verify need and proper implementation, as custom RBAC rules are error prone.

- An Azure Active Directory administrator should be provisioned for SQL servers

- Service Fabric clusters should only use Azure Active Directory for client authentication

## AC-2 (12) Account Management | Account Monitoring / Atypical Usage

Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access locks down inbound traffic to Azure virtual machines,
reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed. All JIT
requests to access virtual machines are logged in the Activity Log allowing you to monitor for
atypical usage. This blueprint assigns an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definition
that helps you monitor virtual machines that can support just-in-time access but haven't yet been
configured.

- Just-In-Time network access control should be applied on virtual machines

## AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement

Cross origin resource sharing (CORS) can allow App Services resources to be requested from an
outside domain. Microsoft recommends that you allow only required domains to interact with your API,
function, and web applications. This blueprint assigns an
[Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definition to help you monitor CORS resources access
restrictions in Azure Security Center. Understanding CORS implementations can help you verify that
information flow controls are implemented.

- CORS should not allow every resource to access your Web Application

## AC-5 Separation of Duties

Having only one Azure subscription owner doesn't allow for administrative redundancy. Conversely,
having too many Azure subscription owners can increase the potential for a breach via a compromised
owner account. This blueprint helps you maintain an appropriate number of Azure subscription owners
by assigning [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions that audit the number of owners
for Azure subscriptions. This blueprint also assigns Azure Policy definitions that help you control
membership of the Administrators group on Windows virtual machines. Managing subscription owner and
virtual machine administrator permissions can help you implement appropriate separation of duties.
