# Overview of the UK OFFICIAL and UK NHS blueprint samples

The UK OFFICIAL and UK NHS blueprint samples provides a set of governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
that help towards UK OFFICIAL and UK NHS attestation. These blueprint samples help customers deploy a
core set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture requiring accreditation or compliance with
the UK OFFICIAL and UK NHS frameworks.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this initiative and how
these policies help meet various controls defined by the UK OFFICIAL and UK NHS frameworks. When
assigned to an architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with
assigned policies. For more information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
