# Overview of the IRS 1075 blueprint sample

The IRS 1075 blueprint sample provides governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
that help you assess specific IRS 1075 controls. This blueprint helps customers deploy a 
core set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture that must implement IRS 1075 
controls.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this blueprint and how 
these policies address various controls in IRS 1075. When assigned to an architecture, 
resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies. For more 
information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
