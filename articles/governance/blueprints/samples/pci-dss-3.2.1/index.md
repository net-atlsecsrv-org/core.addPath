# Overview of the PCI-DSS v3.2.1 blueprint sample

The PCI-DSS v3.2.1 blueprint sample is a set of policies which aides in achieving PCI-DSS v3.2.1
compliance. This blueprint helps customers govern cloud-based environments with PCI-DSS workloads.
The PCI-DSS blueprint deploys a core set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture requiring
this accreditation.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this initiative and how
these policies help meet various controls defined by PCI-DSS v3.2.1. When assigned to an
architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies.

After assigning this blueprint, view your Azure environments level of compliance in the Azure Policy
Compliance Dashboard.
