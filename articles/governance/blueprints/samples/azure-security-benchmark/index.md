# Overview of the Azure Security Benchmark blueprint sample

The Azure Security Benchmark blueprint sample provides governance guard-rails using
[Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) that help you assess specific
[Azure Security Benchmark](../../../../security/benchmarks/overview.md) controls. This blueprint helps
customers deploy a core set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture where they intend to
implement Azure Security Benchmark controls.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this blueprint and how
these policies address various controls in the Azure Security Benchmark. When assigned to an
architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies. For
more information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
