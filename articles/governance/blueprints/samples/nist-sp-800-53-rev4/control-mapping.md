# Control mapping of the NIST SP 800-53 R4 blueprint sample

The following article details how the Azure Blueprints NIST SP 800-53 R4 blueprint sample maps to
the NIST SP 800-53 R4 controls. For more information about the controls, see [NIST SP 800-53](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53).

The following mappings are to the **NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 4)** controls. Use the navigation on the
right to jump directly to a specific control mapping. Many of the mapped controls are implemented
with an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) initiative. To review the complete initiative,
open **Policy** in the Azure portal and select the **Definitions** page. Then, find and select the **[Preview]:
Audit NIST SP 800-53 R4 controls and deploy specific VM Extensions to support audit requirements**
built-in policy initiative.

## AC-2 Account Management

This blueprint helps you review accounts that may not comply with your organizationâ€™s account
management requirements. This blueprint assigns five Azure Policy definitions that audit external
accounts with read, write and owner permissions on a subscription and deprecated accounts. By
reviewing the accounts audited by these policies, you can take appropriate action to ensure account
management requirements are met.

- [Preview]: Audit deprecated accounts on a subscription
- [Preview]: Audit deprecated accounts with owner permissions on a subscription
- [Preview]: Audit external accounts with owner permissions on a subscription
- [Preview]: Audit external accounts with read permissions on a subscription
- [Preview]: Audit external accounts with write permissions on a subscription

## AC-2 (7) Account Management | Role-Based Schemes

Azure implements [role-based access control](../../../../role-based-access-control/overview.md)
(RBAC) to help you manage who has access to resources in Azure. Using the Azure portal, you can
review who has access to Azure resources and their permissions. This blueprint also assigns two [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
definitions to audit use of Azure Active Directory authentication for SQL Servers and Service
Fabric. Using Azure Active Directory authentication enables simplified permission management and
centralized identity management of database users and other Microsoft services.

- Audit provisioning of an Azure Active Directory administrator for SQL server
- Audit usage of Azure Active Directory for client authentication in Service Fabric

## AC-2 (12) Account Management | Account Monitoring / Atypical Usage

Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access locks down inbound traffic to Azure virtual machines,
reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed. All JIT
requests to access virtual machines are logged in the Activity Log allowing you to monitor for
atypical usage. This blueprint assigns an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definition
that helps you monitor virtual machines that can support just-in-time access but have not yet been
configured.

- [Preview]: Monitor possible network Just In Time (JIT) access in Azure Security Center

## AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement

Cross origin resource sharing (CORS) can allow App Services resources to be requested from an
outside domain. Microsoft recommends that you allow only required domains to interact with your API,
function, and web applications. This blueprint assigns an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
definition to help you monitor CORS resources access restrictions in Azure Security Center.
Understanding CORS implementations can help you verify that information flow controls are
implemented.

- [Preview]: Audit CORS resource access restrictions for a Web Application

## AC-5 Separation of Duties

Having only one Azure subscription owner doesn't allow for administrative redundancy. Conversely,
having too many Azure subscription owners can increase the potential for a breach via a compromised
owner account. This blueprint helps you maintain an appropriate number of Azure subscription owners
by assigning two [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions that audit the number of
owners for Azure subscriptions. This blueprint also assigns four Azure Policy definitions that help
you control membership of the Administrators group on Windows virtual machines. Managing
subscription owner and virtual machine administrator permissions can help you implement appropriate
separation of duties.

- [Preview]: Audit maximum number of owners for a subscription
- [Preview]: Audit minimum number of owners for subscription
- Audit that the Administrators group inside Windows VMs excludes the specified members

(RBAC) to help you manage who has access to resources in Azure. Using the Azure portal, you can
review who has access to Azure resources and their permissions. This blueprint assigns six [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
definitions to audit accounts that should be prioritized for review. Reviewing these account
indicators can help you ensure least privilege controls are implemented.

This blueprint helps you restrict and control privileged access by assigning two [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
definitions to audit accounts with owner and/or write permissions that don't have multi-factor
authentication enabled. Multi-factor authentication helps keep accounts secure even if one piece of
authentication information is compromised. By monitoring accounts without multi-factor

## SC-7 Boundary Protection

This blueprint helps you manage and control the system boundary by assigning an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
definition that monitors network security groups with permissive rules. Rules that are too
permissive may allow unintended network access and should be reviewed. This blueprint also assigns a
policy definition that monitors for network security group hardening recommendations in Azure
Security Center. Azure Security Center analyzes traffic patterns of Internet facing virtual machines
and provides network security group rule recommendations to reduce the potential attack surface.
Additionally, this blueprint also assigns three policy definitions that monitor unprotected
endpoints, applications, and storage accounts. Endpoints and applications that aren't protected by a
firewall, and storage accounts with unrestricted access can allow unintended access to information
contained within the information system.

where your Azure resources may have non-optimal cryptographic configurations can help you take
corrective actions to ensure resources are configured in accordance with your information security
policy. Specifically, the policy definitions assigned by this blueprint require encryption for data
lake storage accounts; require transparent data encryption on SQL databases; and audit missing
encryption on SQL databases, virtual machine disks, and automation account variables.
