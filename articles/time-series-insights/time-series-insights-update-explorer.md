# Visualize data in the explorer Preview

This document describes the user interface and user experience features and interface of the Azure Time Series Insights Preview [demo web app](https://insights.timeseries.azure.com/preview/demo). Specifically, it discusses the layout of the hosted sample, interface customization options, and navigation through the provided demo.

## Prerequisites

To get started with the Azure Time Series Insights Preview explorer, you must:

* Have a Time Series Insights environment set up. To learn more about provisioning an instance, try the [Azure Time Series Insights Preview](./time-series-insights-update-create-environment.md) tutorial.
* [Provide data access](./time-series-insights-data-access.md) to the Time Series Insights environment that you created for the account. You can provide access to others as well as to yourself.
* Add an event source to the Time Series Insights environment to push data to the environment:
  * Learn [how to connect to an event hub](./time-series-insights-how-to-add-an-event-source-eventhub.md).
  * Learn [how to connect to an IoT hub](./time-series-insights-how-to-add-an-event-source-iothub.md).

## Learn about the Preview explorer

The Azure Time Series Insights Preview explorer consists of the following elements:

[![The Explorer view](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-one.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-one.png#lightbox)

- <a href="#environment-drop-down-list">Environment panel</a>: Displays your Azure Time Series Insights environments.
- <a href="#navigation-menu">Navigation menu</a>: Use it to switch between the **Analyze** and **Model** pages.
- <a href="#hierarchy-tree">Hierarchy tree</a>: Use it to select specific model and data elements to be charted.
- <a href="#preview-well">Time series well</a>: Displays your currently selected data elements in table format with color coding.
- <a href="#preview-chart">Chart panel</a>: Displays your current working chart.
- <a href="#time-editor-panel">Timeline</a>: Use it to modify your working time span.
- <a href="#navigation-panel">App bar</a>: Contains your user management options, such as current tenant. You can use it to change theme and language settings.

## Environment drop-down list

The environment drop-down list displays all the Time Series Insights environments you have access to. The list includes pay-as-you-go environments, such as the Time Series Insights Preview. The list also includes S1/S2 environments, which are generally available.

1. Select the drop-down arrow next to your displayed environment.

   [![The control panel](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-two.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-two.png#lightbox)

1. Then, select the environment you want.

## Navigation menu

  [![The navigation menu](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-three.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-three.png#lightbox)

Use the navigation menu to select between two views:

* **Analyze**: Use it to chart and perform rich analytics on your modeled or unmodeled time series data.
* **Model**: Use it to push new Time Series Insights Preview types, hierarchies, and instances to your Time Series Insights model.

## Hierarchy tree

The hierarchy tree displays selected data elements that include models, specific devices, and sensors on your devices.

### Model search panel

You can use the model search panel to easily search and navigate your Time Series Model hierarchy to find the specific time series instances you want to display on your chart. After you select your instances, they're added to both the current chart and the data well.

  [![The model search panel](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-four.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-four.png#lightbox)

### Model authoring

The Azure Time Series Insights Preview supports full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on your Time Series Model.

* **Time Series Model type**: You can use Time Series Insights types to define variables or formulas for doing computations. They're associated with a given Time Series Insights instance. A type can have one or more variables.
* **Time Series Model hierarchy**: Hierarchies are systematic organizations of your data. Hierarchies depict the relationships between different entities in your Time Series Insights data.
* **Time Series Model instance**: Instances are the time series themselves. In most cases, they're the **DeviceID** or **AssetID**, which is the unique identifier of the asset in the environment.

To learn more about the Time Series Model, see [Times Series Models](./time-series-insights-update-tsm.md).

## Preview well

The well displays instance fields and other metadata associated with selected Time Series Insights instances. By selecting the check boxes on the right side, you can hide or display specific instances from the current chart. You can also remove specific data elements from your current data well by selecting the red **Delete** (trash can) control on the left side of the element.

  [![The Preview well](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-five.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-five.png#lightbox)

To reconfigure the layout of your **Analyze** chart page, select the ellipses icon in the upper-right corner:

  [![Telemetry layout options](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-six.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-six.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> If you see the following message, the instance doesn't have any data during the time span selected. To resolve the issue, increase the time span or confirm that the instance is pushing data.
>
> ![No data notification](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-seven.png)

## Preview chart

With the chart, you can display Time Series Insights instances as lines. You can collapse the environment panel, data model, and time span control panel by selecting the web controls to make the chart larger.

  [![Preview chart overview](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-eight.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-eight.png#lightbox)

- **Selected date range**: Controls which data elements are available for visualization.

- **Inner date range slider tool**: Use the two endpoint controls by dragging them over the time span you want.

- **Time span collapse control**: Collapses and expands the time span panel editor.

- **Y-axis format control**: Cycles through the available y-axis view options:

    * `Default`: Each line has an individual y-axis.
    * `Stacked`: Use it to stack multiple lines on the same y-axis, with the y-axis data changing based on the line selected.
    * `Shared`: All y-axis data displayed together.

- **Current data element**: The currently selected data element and its associated details.

To  drill further into a specific data slice, left-click a data point on the current graph, and then drag the selected area to the endpoint of your choice. Right-click the gray selected area, and select **Zoom**, as shown in this following image:

  [![Preview chart zoom](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-nine.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-nine.png#lightbox)

After you perform the **Zoom** action, you see your selected data set. Select the y-axis format control to cycle through the three y-axis representations of your Time Series Insights data.

  [![Preview chart y-axis](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-ten.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-ten.png#lightbox)

Here, you can see an example of shared Y axes:

## Time editor panel

When you work with Time Series Insights Preview, you first select a time span. The selected time span controls the data set that's available for manipulation with the Time Series Insights Preview widgets. The following web controls are available in Time Series Insights Preview for selecting your working time span:

  [![Time selection panel](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-twelve.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-twelve.png#lightbox)

1. **Inner date range slider tool**: Use the two endpoint controls by dragging them over the time span you want. This inner date range is constrained by the outer date range slider control.

1. **Increase and decrease date range buttons**: Increase or decrease your time span by selecting either button for the interval you want.

1. **Time span collapse control**: This web control lets you hide all the controls except for the inner date range slider tool.

1. **Outer date range slider control**: Use the endpoint controls to select the outer date range, which will be available for your inner date range control.

1. **Quick Times date-range drop-down list**: Use it to quickly switch between preset time span selections, such as the last **30 minutes**, the **last 12 hours**, or a **custom range**. Changing this value also changes the available interval ranges discussed in the interval-size slider tool.

1. **Interval-size slider tool**: Use it to zoom in and out of intervals over the same time span. This action provides more precise control of movement between large slices of time. It displays smooth trends down to slices as small as a millisecond. You can use it to see granular, high-resolution cuts of your data. The sliderâ€™s default starting point is set as the most optimal view of the data from your selection, which balances resolution, query speed, and granularity.

1. **Date range to-and-from web control**: With this web control, you can easily select the date and time ranges you want. You can also use the control to switch between different time zones. After you make the changes to apply to your current workspace, select **Save**.

   [![To and from selection panel](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-thirteen.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-thirteen.png#lightbox)

## S1/S2 environment controls

### Preview terms panel

This section applies only to existing S1/S2 environments that attempt to use the explorer in the updated UI. You might want to use the generally available product and Preview in combination. Weâ€™ve added some functionality from the existing UI to the updated explorer, but you can get the full UI experience for S1/S2 environment in the existing Time Series Insights explorer. 

Instead of the hierarchy, you see the Time Series Insights terms panel, where you define queries in your environment. Use it to filter your data based on a predicate.

  [![Where query panel](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-eighteen.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-eighteen.png#lightbox)

The Time Series Insights Preview terms editor panel takes the following parameters:

**Where**: Use the where clause to quickly filter your events by using the set of operands listed in the following table. If you conduct a search by selecting an operand, the predicate is automatically updated based on that search. Supported operand types include the following:

| Operation	| Supported types	| Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Double, DateTime, TimeSpan | |
| `=`, `!=`, `<>` | String, Bool, Double, DateTime, TimeSpan, NULL |
| `IN` | String, Bool, Double, DateTime, TimeSpan, NULL | All operands should be of the same type or be NULL constant. |
| `HAS` | String | Only constant string literals are allowed on the right side. Empty string and NULL aren't allowed. |

To learn more about supported query operations and data types, see [Time Series Expression (TSX)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/preview-tsx).

### Examples of where clauses

  [![Where clause examples](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-nineteen.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-nineteen.png#lightbox)

**Measure**: A drop-down list that displays all the numeric columns (**Doubles**) you can use as elements for your current chart.

**Split by**: This drop-down list displays all the available categorical columns (Strings) in your model that you can group your data by. You can add up to five terms to view on the same x-axis. Enter the parameters you want, and then select **Add** to add a fresh term.

  [![Queried and filtered view one](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-twenty.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/explorer-twenty.png#lightbox)

You can show and hide elements in the chart panel by selecting the visible icon, as shown in the following image. To completely remove queries, select the red **X**.
