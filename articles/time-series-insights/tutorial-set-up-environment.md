>[!TIP]
> [IoT solution accelerators](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators) provide enterprise-grade preconfigured solutions that you can use to accelerate the development of custom IoT solutions.

Sign up for a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

## Prerequisites

* At minimum, you must have the **Contributor** role for the Azure subscription. For more information, read [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

* Create an environment using either the [Azure portal](#create-an-azure-time-series-insights-gen2-environment) or [CLI](how-to-create-environment-using-cli.md).

## Create a device simulation

In this section, you will create three simulated devices that send data to an Azure IoT Hub instance.

1. Go to the [Azure IoT solution accelerators page](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators). Sign in by using your Azure account, then select **Device Simulation**.

   [![Azure IoT solution accelerators page.](media/tutorial-set-up-environment/iot-solution-accelerators-landing-page.png)](media/tutorial-set-up-environment/iot-solution-accelerators-landing-page.png#lightbox)

1. Scroll down to read the [Overview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-device-simulation#overview) and [Getting started](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-device-simulation#getting-started) sections.

1. Follow the [deployment instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-device-simulation/blob/master/deployment/README.md) in the Getting Started section.

   It may take up to 20 minutes to complete this process.

1. When deployment has finished, you'll be provided the URL to your simulation. Keep this page open because you'll return to it later.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't enter your solution accelerator yet! Keep this web page open because you'll return to it later.

## Create an Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment

This section describes how to create an Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment and connect it to the IoT hub created by the IoT Solution Accelerator using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using your Azure subscription account.
1. Select **+ Create a resource** in the upper left.
1. Select the **Internet of Things** category, and then select **Time Series Insights**.

   [![Select the Time Series Insights environment resource.](media/tutorial-set-up-environment/create-new-environment.png)](media/tutorial-set-up-environment/create-new-environment.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Create Time Series Insights environment** pane, on the **Basics** tab, set the following parameters:

    | Parameter | Action |
    | --- | ---|
    | **Environment name** | Enter a unique name for the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment. |
    | **Subscription** | Enter the subscription where you want to create the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment. A best practice is to use the same subscription as the rest of the IoT resources that are created by the device simulator. |
    | **Resource group** | Select an existing resource group or create a new resource group for the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment resource. A resource group is a container for Azure resources. A best practice is to use the same resource group as the other IoT resources that are created by the device simulator. |
    | **Location** | Select a data center region for your Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment. To avoid additional latency, it's best to create your Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment in the same region as your IoT hub created by the device simulator. |
    | **Tier** |  Select **Gen2(L1)**. This is the SKU for the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 product. |
    | **Time Series ID property name** | Enter a name of a property that contains values that uniquely identify your time series instances. The value you enter in the **Property name** box as Time Series ID cannot be changed later. For this tutorial, enter ***iothub-connection-device-id***. To learn more about Time Series ID including composite Time Series ID, read [Best practices for choosing a Time Series ID](./how-to-select-tsid.md). |
    | **Storage account name** | Enter a globally unique name for a new storage account.|
    | **Storage account kind** | Select the storage kind for a new storage account. We recommend StorageV2|
    | **Storage account replication** | Select the storage kind for a new storage account. Based on your location selection, you can choose from LRS, GRS, and ZRS. For this tutorial, you can select LRS|
    | **Hierarchical namespace** |This option is selectable, once you select the storage kind to be StorageV2. By default, it is disabled. For this tutorial, you can leave it in its default *disabled* state|
    |**Enable warm store**|Select **Yes** to enable warm store. This setting can be disabled and re-enabled after the environment has been created as well. |
    |**Data retention (in days)**|Choose the default option of 7 days. |
