[![Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 Explorer overview](media/v2-update-explorer/preview-explorer-overview.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/preview-explorer-overview.png#lightbox)

1. [Environment panel](#1-environment-panel): Displays all your Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environments.
1. [Navigation bar](#2-navigation-bar): Lets you switch between the **Analyze** and **Model** pages.
1. [Hierarchy tree and search panel](#3-hierarchy-tree-and-search-panel): Lets you select and search for specific data elements to be charted.
1. [Time series well](#4-time-series-well): Shows all your currently selected data elements.
1. [Chart panel](#5-chart-panel): Displays your current working chart.
1. [Timeline](#6-time-editor-panel): Lets you modify your working time span.
1. [App bar](#7-app-bar): Contains your user management options (such as current tenant), and allows you to change them and language settings.


## 1. Environment panel

The environment panel displays all the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environments you have access to. The list includes Gen2 environments as well as Gen 1 environments. Simply select the environment you want to use to immediately be taken there.

1. Select the drop-down arrow next to your displayed environment.

   [![Environment panel](media/v2-update-explorer/environment-panel.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/environment-panel.png#lightbox)

1. Then, select the environment you want.

## 2. Navigation bar

  [![The navigation bar](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-navigation-bar.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-navigation-bar.png#lightbox)

Use the navigation bar to select between two views:

* **Analyze**: Use it to chart and perform rich analytics on your modeled or unmodeled time series data.
* **Model**: Use it to push new Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 types, hierarchies, and instances to your Time Series Model.

### Model authoring

The Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 supports full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on your Time Series Model.

[![The model search panel](media/v2-update-explorer/model-search-panel.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/model-search-panel.png#lightbox)

* **Time Series Model type**: You can use Time Series Model types to define variables or formulas for doing computations. They're associated with a given Time Series Model instance. A type can have one or more variables.
* **Time Series Model hierarchy**: Hierarchies are systematic organizations of your data. Hierarchies depict the relationships between different instances in your Time Series Model.
* **Time Series Model instance**: Instances are the time series themselves. In most cases, they're the **DeviceID** or **AssetID**, which is the unique identifier of the asset in the environment.

To learn more about the Time Series Model, read [Times Series Models](./concepts-model-overview.md).

## 3. Hierarchy tree and search panel

The hierarchy tree and search panel allow you to easily search and navigate your [Time Series Model](./concepts-model-overview.md) hierarchy to find the specific time series instances you want to display on your chart. When you select your instances, they are not only added to the current chart but are also added to the data well. 

[![Hierarchy tree and search panel](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-explorer-hierarchy-search.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-explorer-hierarchy-search.png#lightbox)

The search results pane also lets you view your results in a hierarchy view or a list view making it easy to find the instances you want to display.
 
## 4. Time series well

The well displays instance fields and other metadata associated with selected Time Series Model instances. By selecting the check boxes on the right side, you can hide or display specific instances from the current chart. 

  [![The Gen2 well](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-ui-explorer-well.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-ui-explorer-well.png#lightbox)

You may remove specific data elements from your current data well by selecting the red **Delete** (trash can) control on the left side of the element. The well also lets you control how each element is displayed in the chart. You can choose to add min/max shadows, data points, shift the element in time and visualize the instance a stepped manner. 

Additionally, The explorations control lets you create time shifts and scatter plots easily.

## 5. Chart panel

The chart enables you to display time series instances as lines. You can collapse the environment panel, data model, and time span control panel by clicking the web controls to make the chart larger. 

  [![Gen2 chart overview](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-chart-overview.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-chart-overview.png#lightbox)

1. **Chart type**: Controls which data elements are available for visualization.

1. **Interval size**: The Interval size slider tool enables you to zoom in and out of intervals over the same time span. This provides more precise control of movement between large slices of time that show smooth trends down to slices as small as the millisecond, allowing you to review granular, high-resolution cuts of your data. The slider's default starting point is set as the most optimal view of the data from your selection; balancing resolution, query speed, and granularity.

1. **Zoom and pan**: Select this control to zoom and pan the chart.

1. **Y-axis control**: Cycles through the available y-axis view options:

    * `Stacked`: Each line has an individual Y-axis.
    * `Overlap`: Use it to stack multiple lines on the same Y-axis, with the Y-axis data changing based on the line selected.
    * `Shared`: All Y-axis data displayed together.

1. **Marker element**: The currently selected data element and its associated details.

You can further drill into a specific data slice by **left-clicking** a data point on the current graph while holding down the mouse and then dragging the selected area to the endpoint of your choice. **Right-click** the blue, selected area and then select **Zoom** as shown below. You can also view and download the telemetry events in the selected timespan.

  [![Gen2 chart zoom](media/v2-update-explorer/preview-chart-zoom.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/preview-chart-zoom.png#lightbox)

After you perform the **Zoom** action, your selected data set will be displayed. Select the format control to cycle through the three y-axis representations of your data.

  [![Gen2 chart y-axis](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-explorer-standard-chart.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-explorer-standard-chart.png#lightbox)

Here, an example of an **overlapping chart** is provided:

  [![Overlapping chart option](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-explorer-overlapping-chart.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-explorer-overlapping-chart.png#lightbox)

> A portion of the timeline is highlighted in an amber or orange color to indicate the span of data that is available in warm store.

The following web controls are available in Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 for selecting your working time span. 

  [![Exploration well control](media/v2-update-explorer/exploration-well-control.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/exploration-well-control.png#lightbox)

1. **Inner date range slider control**: Use the two endpoint controls by dragging them over the time span you want. This inner date range is constrained by the outer date range slider control.

1. **Increase and decrease date range buttons**: Increase or decrease your time span by selecting either button for the interval you want.

1. **Time span collapse control**: This web control lets you hide all the controls except for the inner date range slider tool.

1. **Outer date range slider control**: Use the endpoint controls to select the outer date range, which will be available for your inner date range control.

1. **Time range slider control**: Use it to quickly switch between preset time span selections, such as the last **30 minutes**, the **last 12 hours**, or a **custom range**. Changing this value also changes the available interval ranges discussed in the interval-size slider tool.

## Gen 1 environment controls

### Gen2 terms panel

This section applies only to existing Gen 1 environments that attempt to use the Explorer in the updated UI. You might want to use the Gen 1 product and Gen2 product in combination. We've added some functionality from the existing UI to the updated Explorer, but you can get the full UI experience for a Gen 1 environment in the new Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 Explorer. 

Instead of the hierarchy, the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 terms panel is displayed. The terms panel allows you to define queries in your environment. Use it to also filter data based on a predicate.

  [![Where query panel](media/v2-update-explorer/s1-s2-preview-query.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/s1-s2-preview-query.png#lightbox)

The Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 terms editor panel takes the following parameters:

**Where**: Use the where clause to quickly filter your events by using the set of operands listed in the following table. If you conduct a search by selecting an operand, the predicate is automatically updated based on that search. Supported operand types include the following:

| Operation    | Supported types    | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Double, DateTime, TimeSpan | |
| `=`, `!=`, `<>` | String, Bool, Double, DateTime, TimeSpan, NULL |
| `IN` | String, Bool, Double, DateTime, TimeSpan, NULL | All operands should be of the same type or be NULL constant. |
| `HAS` | String | Only constant string literals are allowed on the right side. Empty string and NULL aren't allowed. |

To learn more about supported query operations and data types, read [Time Series Expression (TSX)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/preview#time-series-expression-and-syntax).

### Examples of where clauses

  [![Where clause examples](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-example-queries.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/tsi-preview-example-queries.png#lightbox)

**Measure**: A drop-down list that displays all the numeric columns (**Doubles**) you can use as elements for your current chart.

**Split by**: This drop-down list displays all the available categorical columns (Strings) in your model that you can group your data by. You can add up to five terms to view on the same x-axis. Enter the parameters you want, and then select **Add** to add a fresh term.

  [![Queried and filtered view one](media/v2-update-explorer/s1-s2-preview-filtered-view.png)](media/v2-update-explorer/s1-s2-preview-filtered-view.png#lightbox)
