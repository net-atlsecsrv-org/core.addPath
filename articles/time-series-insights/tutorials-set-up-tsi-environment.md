This tutorial guides you through the process of creating an Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 *pay-as-you-go* (PAYG) environment.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create an Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment.
> * Connect the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment to an IoT Hub.
> * Run a solution accelerator sample to stream data into the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment.
> * Perform basic analysis on the data.
> * Define a Time Series Model type and hierarchy, and associate it with your instances.

>[!TIP]
> [IoT solution accelerators](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators) provide enterprise-grade preconfigured solutions that you can use to accelerate the development of custom IoT solutions.

Sign up for a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

## Prerequisites

* At minimum, you must have the **Contributor** role for the Azure subscription. For more information, read [Manage access by using role-based access control and the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

## Create a device simulation

In this section, you will create three simulated devices that send data to an Azure IoT Hub instance.

1. Go to the [Azure IoT solution accelerators page](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators). The page displays several prebuilt examples. Sign in by using your Azure account. Then, select **Device Simulation**.

   [![Azure IoT solution accelerators page.](media/v2-update-provision/iot-solution-accelerators-landing-page.png)](media/v2-update-provision/iot-solution-accelerators-landing-page.png#lightbox)

1. Enter the subscription where you want to create the device simulation.

   Parameter|Description
   ---|---
   **Deployment name** | This unique value is used to create a new resource group. The listed Azure resources are created and assigned to the resource group.
   **Azure subscription** | Specify the same subscription that was used to create your Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment in the previous section.
   **Deployment options** | Select **Provision new IoT Hub** to create a new IoT hub specific to this tutorial.
   **Azure location** | Specify the same region that was used to create your Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment in the previous section.

   When you're finished, select **Create** to provision the solution's Azure resources. It may take up to 20 minutes to complete this process.

   [![Provision the device simulation solution.](media/v2-update-provision/iot-solution-accelerators-configuration.png)](media/v2-update-provision/iot-solution-accelerators-configuration.png#lightbox)

1. After provisioning has finished, two notifications will appear announcing that the deployment state has moved from **Provisioning** to **Ready**.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't enter your solution accelerator yet! Keep this web page open because you'll return to it later.
