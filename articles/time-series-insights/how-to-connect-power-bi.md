# Visualize data from Azure Time Series Insights in Power BI

Azure Time Series Insights is a platform for storing, managing, querying, and visualizing time-series data in the cloud. [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a business analytics tool with rich visualization capabilities that allows you to share insights and results across your organization. Both services can now be integrated to get the best of both Azure Time Series Insights' inherent visualization capabilities as well as Power BI's.

You'll learn how to:

* Connect Azure Time Series Insights to Power BI using the cloud connector
* Create visuals with your data in Power BI
* Publish the report to Power BI and share with the rest of your organization

By the end, you'll learn how to visualize time-series data through Azure Time Series Insights and enhance it with the strong data visualization and easy sharing capabilities of Power BI.

Make sure to sign up for a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

## Prerequisites

* Download and install the latest version of [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* Have or create an [Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment](time-series-insights-update-how-to-manage.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * The connector is presently supported in Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environments configured with **Warm Store only**.
> * If you have guest access to the Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 environment from another Azure AD Tenant, you will not be able to access the connector. Read about the [environment access policies](./concepts-access-policies.md).

## Connect data from Azure Time Series Insights to Power BI

To connect your Azure Time Series Insights environment to Power BI, follow these steps:

1. Open Azure Time Series Insights Explorer
1. Export data as a query or as raw data
1. Open Power BI Desktop
1. Load from Custom Query

### Export data into Power BI desktop

To get started:

1. Open the Azure Time Series Insights Explorer and curate your data.
1. Once you have created a view you are satisfied with, navigate to the **More actions** dropdown menu and select **Connect to Power BI**.

    [![Azure Time Series Insights Explorer export](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/time-series-insights-export-option.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/time-series-insights-export-option.png#lightbox)

1. Set your parameters inside this tab:

   1. Specify a relative timeframe to view. If you are happy with your existing view, leave this as **Existing timeframe**.

   1. Choose between **Aggregated** and **Raw Events**.

       > [!NOTE]
       > You can always aggregate your data later in Power BI, but you cannot revert to raw data after aggregation.

       > [!NOTE]
       > There is a 250,000 event count limit for Raw Event level data.

   1. If you have not configured your Azure Time Series Insights environment with **Warm Store**, you will receive a warning.

       [![Warm store warning](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/connect-to-power-bi-warning.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/connect-to-power-bi-warning.png#lightbox)

       > [!TIP]
       > You may configure your existing instance for **Warm Store** in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Copy query to clipboard**.
1. Now, launch Power BI Desktop.
1. In Power BI Desktop on the **Home** tab, select **Get Data** in the upper left corner, then **More**.

    [![Home dropdown](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-home-drop-down.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-home-drop-down.png#lightbox)

1. Search for **Azure Time Series Insights**, select **Azure Time Series Insights (Beta)**, then **Connect**.

    Alternatively, navigate to the **Azure** tab, select **Azure Time Series Insights (Beta)**, then **Connect**.

1. A message dialogue box will display asking for permission to connect to third-party resources. Select **continue**.

    [![Choose Create Custom Query](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/confirm-the-connection.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/confirm-the-connection.png#lightbox)

1. In the dropdown menu under **Data Source**, choose **Create custom query**. Paste from your clipboard into the optional **Custom Query (optional)** field below, then press **OK**.

    [![Pass in the custom query and select OK](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/custom-query-load.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/custom-query-load.png#lightbox)  

1. The data table will now load. Press **Load** to load into Power BI.

    [![Review the loaded data in the table and select Load](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/review-the-loaded-data-table.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/review-the-loaded-data-table.png#lightbox)  

If you have completed these steps, skip ahead to the next section.

## Create a report with visuals

Now that you have imported the data into Power BI, it’s time to build a report with visuals.

1. On the left side of the window, make sure you have selected the **Report** view.

    [![Screenshot shows Report view icon.](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/select-the-report-view.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/select-the-report-view.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Visualizations** column, select your visual of choice. For example, select **Line chart**. This will add a blank line chart to your canvas.

1. In the **Fields** list, select **_Timestamp** and drag it to the **Axis** field to display items along the X-axis. Make sure to switch to **_Timestamp** to as the value for the **Axis** (default is **Date Hierarchy**).

    [![Screenshot shows Timestamp menu with _Timestamp selected.](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/select-timestamp.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/select-timestamp.png#lightbox)

1. Again, in the **Fields** list, select **TimeSeriesId** and drag it to the **Values** field to display items along the Y-axis.

    [![Create a line chart](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-line-chart.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-line-chart.png#lightbox)

1. To add another chart to your canvas, select anywhere on the canvas outside the line chart and repeat this process.

    [![Create additional charts to share](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-additional-charts.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-additional-charts.png#lightbox)

Once you have created your report, you can publish it to Power BI Reporting Services.

## Advanced editing

If you have already loaded a dataset in Power BI but would like to modify the query (such as the date/time or Environment ID parameters), you can do this via Power BI’s Advanced Editor functionality. Refer to the [Power BI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-query-overview) to learn more.

As an overview:

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **Edit Queries**.
1. Press **Advanced Editor**.

    [![Edit queries in the Advanced Editor](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-advanced-query-editing.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/power-bi-advanced-query-editing.png#lightbox)

1. Modify the JSON payload as desired.
1. Select **Done** and then **Close & Apply** within the **Power Query Editor Window**.

The interface will now reflect the desired changes you applied.
