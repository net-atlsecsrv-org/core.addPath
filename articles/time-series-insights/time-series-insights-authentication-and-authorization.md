# Authentication and authorization for Azure Time Series Insights API

Depending on your business needs, your solution might include one or more client applications that you use to interact with your Azure Time Series Insights environment's [APIs](/rest/api/time-series-insights/reference-data-access-overview). Azure Time Series Insights performs authentication using [Azure AD Security Tokens based on OAUTH 2.0](../active-directory/develop/security-tokens.md#json-web-tokens-and-claims). To authenticate your client(s), you'll need to get a bearer token with the right permissions, and pass it along with your API calls. This document describes several methods for getting credentials that you can use to get a bearer token and authenticate, including using managed identity and Azure Active Directory app registration.

## Managed identities

The following sections describe how to use a managed identity from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to access the Azure Time Series Insights API. On Azure, managed identities eliminate the need for developers having to manage credentials by providing an identity for the Azure resource in Azure AD and using it to obtain Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens. Here are some of the benefits of using Managed identities:

- You don't need to manage credentials. Credentials are not even accessible to you.
- You can use managed identities to authenticate to any Azure service that supports Azure AD authentication including Azure Key Vault.
- Managed identities can be used without any additional cost.

For more information on the two types of managed identities read [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md)

You can use managed identities from your:

- Azure VMs
- Azure App Services
- Azure Functions
- Azure Container instances
- and more ...

See [Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-managed-identities-for-azure-resources) for the complete list.

## Azure Active Directory app registration

We recommend using managed identities whenever possible so that you don't need to manage credentials. If your client application is not hosted on an Azure service that supports managed identities you can register your application with an Azure AD tenant. When you register your application with Azure AD, you are creating an identity configuration for your application that allows it to integrate with Azure AD. When you register an app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), you choose whether it's a single tenant (only accessible in your tenant) or multi-tenant (accessible in other tenants) and can optionally set a redirect URI (where the access token is sent to).

When you've completed the app registration, you have a globally unique instance of the app (the application object) which lives within your home tenant or directory. You also have a globally unique ID for your app (the app or client ID). In the portal, you can then add secrets or certificates and scopes to make your app work, customize the branding of your app in the sign-in dialog, and more.

If you register an application in the portal, an application object as well as a service principal object are automatically created in your home tenant. If you register/create an application using the Microsoft Graph APIs, creating the service principal object is a separate step. A service principal object is required to request tokens.

Be sure to review the [Security](../active-directory/develop/identity-platform-integration-checklist.md#security) checklist for your application. As a best practice, you should use [certificate credentials](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials.md), not password credentials (client secrets).

See [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md) for more details.

## Step 1: Create your managed identity or app registration

Once you've identified whether you'll be using a managed identity or app registration, your next step is to provision one.

### Managed identity

The steps you'll use to create a managed identity will vary depending on where your code is located and whether or not you're creating a system assigned or user assigned identity. Read [Managed identity types](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md#managed-identity-types) to understand the difference. Once you've selected your identity type, locate and follow the correct tutorial in the Azure AD-managed identities [documentation](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/index.yml). There you will find instructions for how to configure managed identities for:

- [Azure VMs](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-during-creation-of-a-vm)
- [App Service and Azure Functions](../app-service/overview-managed-identity.md)
- [Azure Container Instances](../container-instances/container-instances-managed-identity.md)
- and more ...

### Application registration

Follow the steps listed in [Register an application](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md#register-an-application).

[!INCLUDE [Azure Active Directory app registration](../../includes/time-series-insights-aad-registration.md)]

## Step 2: Grant Access

When your Azure Time Series Insights environment receives a request, first the caller's bearer token is validated. If validation passes, the caller has been authenticated, and then another check is made to ensure the caller is authorized to perform the requested action. To authorize any user or service principal, you must first grant them access to the environment by assigning them either the Reader or Contributor role.

- To grant access via the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) UI, follow the instructions listed in the [Grant data access to an environment](concepts-access-policies.md) article. When selecting the user, you can search for the managed identity or app registration by its name or by ID.

- To grant access using the Azure CLI, run the following command. Review the documentation [here](/cli/azure/tsi/access-policy) for the full list of commands available to manage access.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az tsi access-policy create --name "ap1" --environment-name "env1" --description "some description" --principal-object-id "aGuid" --roles Reader Contributor --resource-group "rg1"
   ```

> [!Note]
> The timeseriesinsights extension for Azure CLI requires version 2.11.0 or higher. The extension will automatically install the first time you run an az tsi access-policy command. [Learn more](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview) about extensions.

## Step 3: Requesting Tokens

Once your managed identity or app registration has been provisioned and assigned a role, you're ready to begin using it to request OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens. The method you use to obtain a token will differ depending on where your code is hosted and your language of choice. When specifying the resource (also known as the "audience" of the token), you can identify Azure Time Series Insights by its URL or GUID:

* `https://api.timeseries.azure.com/`
* `120d688d-1518-4cf7-bd38-182f158850b6`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the URL as the resource ID, the token must be issued exactly to `https://api.timeseries.azure.com/`. The trailing slash is required.

> * If using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) your **AuthURL** will therefore be: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=https://api.timeseries.azure.com//.default`
> * `https://api.timeseries.azure.com/` is valid but `https://api.timeseries.azure.com` is not.

### Managed identities

When accessing from Azure App Service or Functions follow the guidance in the [Obtain tokens for Azure resources](../app-service/overview-managed-identity.md).

For .NET applications and functions, the simplest way to work with a managed identity is through the [Azure Identity client library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme) for .NET. This client library is popular due to its simplicity and security benefits. Developers can write code once and let the client library determine how to authenticate based on the application environment - whether on a developer workstation using a developer's account or deployed in Azure using a managed service identity. For migration guidance from the predecessor AppAuthentication library read [AppAuthentication to Azure.Identity Migration Guidance](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/app-auth-migration).

Request a token for Azure Time Series Insights using C# and the Azure Identity client library for .NET:

   ```csharp
   using Azure.Identity;
   // ...
   var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
   var token = credential.GetToken(
   new Azure.Core.TokenRequestContext(
       new[] { "https://api.timeseries.azure.com/" }));
   var accessToken = token.Token;
   ```

### App registration

* Developers may use the [Microsoft Authentication Library](../active-directory/develop/msal-overview.md) (MSAL) to obtain tokens for app registrations.

MSAL can be used in many application scenarios, including, but not limited to:

* [Single page applications (JavaScript)](../active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-overview.md)
* [Web application signing in a user and calling a web API on behalf of the user](../active-directory/develop/scenario-web-app-call-api-overview.md)
* [Web API calling another downstream web API on behalf of the signed-in user](../active-directory/develop/scenario-web-api-call-api-overview.md)
* [Desktop application calling a web API on behalf of the signed-in user](../active-directory/develop/scenario-desktop-overview.md)
* [Mobile application calling a web API on behalf of the user who's signed-in interactively](../active-directory/develop/scenario-mobile-overview.md).
* [Desktop/service daemon application calling web API on behalf of itself](../active-directory/develop/scenario-daemon-overview.md)

### HTTP parameters

> [!TIP]
> Find more information about required and optional query information in the [reference documentation](/rest/api/time-series-insights/).

Required URL query string parameters depend on API version.

| Release | API version values |
| --- |  --- |
| Gen1 | `api-version=2016-12-12`|
| Gen2 | `api-version=2020-07-31`|

Optional URL query string parameters include setting a timeout for HTTP request execution times.

| Optional query parameter | Description | Version |
| --- |  --- | --- |
| `timeout=<timeout>` | Server-side timeout for HTTP request execution. Applicable only to the [Get Environment Events](/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccess(preview)/query/getavailability) and [Get Environment Aggregates](/rest/api/time-series-insights/gen1-query-api#get-environment-aggregates-api) APIs. Timeout value should be in ISO 8601 duration format, for example `"PT20S"` and should be in the range `1-30 s`. Default value is `30 s`. | Gen1 |
| `storeType=<storeType>` | For Gen2 environments with warm store enabled, the query can be executed either on the `WarmStore` or `ColdStore`. This parameter in the query defines which store the query should be executed on. If not defined, the query will be executed on the cold store. To query the warm store, **storeType** needs to be set to `WarmStore`. If not defined, the query will be executed against the cold store. | Gen2 |
