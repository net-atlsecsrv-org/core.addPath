# Build and push an image from an app using a Cloud Native Buildpack

The Azure CLI command `az acr pack build` uses the [`pack`](https://github.com/buildpack/pack) CLI tool, from [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/), to build an app and push its image into an Azure container registry. This feature provides an option to quickly build a container image from your application source code in Node.js, Java, and other languages without having to define a Dockerfile.

You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to run the examples in this article. If you'd like to use it locally, version 2.0.70 or later is required. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in preview. Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).

## Use the build command

To build and push a container image using Cloud Native Buildpacks, run the [az acr pack build][az-acr-pack-build] command. Whereas the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command builds and pushes an image from a Dockerfile source and related code, with `az acr pack build` you specify an application source tree directly.

At a minimum, specify the following when you run `az acr pack build`:

* An Azure container registry where you run the command
* An image name and tag for the resulting image
* One of the [supported context locations](container-registry-tasks-overview.md#context-locations) for ACR Tasks, such as a local directory, a GitHub repo, or a remote tarball
* The name of a Buildpack builder image suitable for your application. Azure Container Registry caches builder images such as `cloudfoundry/cnb:0.0.34-cflinuxfs3` for faster builds.  

`az acr pack build` supports other features of ACR Tasks commands including [run variables](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md#run-variables) and [task run logs](container-registry-tasks-logs.md) that are streamed and also saved for later retrieval.

## Example: Build Node.js image with Cloud Foundry builder

The following example builds a container image from a Node.js app in the [Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world) repo, using the `cloudfoundry/cnb:0.0.34-cflinuxfs3` builder. This builder is cached by Azure Container Registry, so a `--pull` parameter isn't required:

```azurecli
az acr pack build \
    --registry myregistry \
    --image {{.Run.Registry}}/node-app:1.0 \
    --builder cloudfoundry/cnb:0.0.34-cflinuxfs3 \
    https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world.git
```

This example builds the `node-app` image with the `1.0` tag and pushes it to the *myregistry* container registry. In this example, the target registry name is explicitly prepended to the image name. If not specified, the registry login server name is automatically prepended to the image name.

Command output shows the progress of building and pushing the image. 

After the image is successfully built, you can run it with Docker, if you have it installed. First sign into your registry:

```azurecli
az acr login --name myregistry
```

Run the image:

```console
docker run --rm -p 1337:1337 myregistry.azurecr.io/node-app:1.0
```

Browse to `localhost:1337` in your favorite browser to see the sample web app. Press `[Ctrl]+[C]` to stop the container.

## Example: Build Java image with Heroku builder

The following example builds a container image from the Java app in the [buildpack/sample-java-app](https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app) repo, using the `heroku/buildpacks:18` builder. The `--pull` parameter specifies that the command should pull the latest builder image. 

```azurecli
az acr pack build \
    --registry myregistry \
    --image java-app:{{.Run.ID}} \
    --pull --builder heroku/buildpacks:18 \
    https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
```

This example builds the `java-app` image tagged with the run ID of the command and pushes it to the *myregistry* container registry.

Command output shows the progress of building and pushing the image. 

After the image is successfully built, you can run it with Docker, if you have it installed. First sign into your registry:

```azurecli
az acr login --name myregistry
```

Run the image, substituting your image tag for *runid*:

```console
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 myregistry.azurecr.io/java-app:runid
```

Browse to `localhost:8080` in your favorite browser to see the sample web app. Press `[Ctrl]+[C]` to stop the container.


## Next steps

After you build and push a container image with `az acr pack build`, you can deploy it like any image to a target of your choice. Azure deployment options include running it in [App Service](../app-service/tutorial-custom-container.md) or [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster.md), among others.
