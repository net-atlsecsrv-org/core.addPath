# Troubleshoot network issues with registry

This article helps you troubleshoot problems you might encounter when accessing an Azure container registry in a virtual network or behind a firewall. 

## Symptoms

May include one or more of the following:

* Unable to push or pull images and you receive error `dial tcp: lookup myregistry.azurecr.io`
* Unable to push or pull images and you receive Azure CLI error `Could not connect to the registry login server`
* Unable to pull images from registry to Azure Kubernetes Service or another Azure service
* Unable to access a registry behind an HTTPS proxy and you receive error `Error response from daemon: login attempt failed with status: 403 Forbidden`
* Unable to configure virtual network settings and you receive error `Failed to save firewall and virtual network settings for container registry`
* Unable to access or view registry settings in Azure portal or manage registry using the Azure CLI
* Unable to add or modify virtual network settings or public access rules
* ACR Tasks is unable to push or pull images
* Azure Security Center can't scan images in registry, or scan results don't appear in Azure Security Center

## Causes

* A client firewall or proxy prevents access - [solution](#configure-client-firewall-access)
* Public network access rules on the registry prevent access - [solution](#configure-public-access-to-registry)
* Virtual network configuration prevents access - [solution](#configure-vnet-access)
* You attempt to integrate Azure Security Center or certain other Azure services with a registry that has a private endpoint, service endpoint, or public IP access rules - [solution](#configure-service-access)

## Further diagnosis 

Run the [az acr check-health](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-check-health) command to get more information about the health of the registry environment and optionally access to a target registry. For example, diagnose certain network connectivity or configuration problems. 

See [Check the health of an Azure container registry](container-registry-check-health.md) for command examples. If errors are reported, review the [error reference](container-registry-health-error-reference.md) and the following sections for recommended solutions.

> [!NOTE]
> Some network connectivity symptoms can also occur when there are issues with registry authentication or authorization. See [Troubleshoot registry login](container-registry-troubleshoot-login.md).

## Potential solutions

### Configure client firewall access

To access a registry from behind a client firewall or proxy server, configure firewall rules to access the registry's public REST and data endpoints. If [dedicated data endpoints](container-registry-firewall-access-rules.md#enable-dedicated-data-endpoints) are enabled, you need rules to access:

* REST endpoint: `<registryname>.azurecr.io`
* Data endpoint(s): `<registry-name>.<region>.data.azurecr.io`

For a geo-replicated registry, configure access to the data endpoint for each regional replica.

Behind an HTTPS proxy, ensure that both your Docker client and Docker daemon are configured for proxy behavior.

Registry resource logs in the ContainerRegistryLoginEvents table may help diagnose an attempted connection that is blocked.

### Configure public access to registry

If accessing a registry over the internet, confirm the registry allows public network access from your client. By default, an Azure container registry allows access to the public registry endpoints from all networks. A registry can limit access to selected networks, or selected IP addresses. 

If the registry is configured for a virtual network with a service endpoint, disabling public network access also disables access over the service endpoint. If your registry is configured for a virtual network with Private Link, IP network rules don't apply to the registry's private endpoints.

* [Restrict access to a container registry using a service endpoint in an Azure virtual network](container-registry-vnet.md)


### Configure VNet access

Confirm that the virtual network is configured with either a private endpoint for Private Link or a service endpoint (preview). Currently an Azure Bastion endpoint isn't supported.

Review NSG rules and service tags used to limit traffic from other resources in the network to the registry. 

If a service endpoint to the registry is configured, confirm that a network rule is added to the registry that allows access from that network subnet. The service endpoint only supports access from virtual machines and AKS clusters in the network.

If you want to restrict registry access using a virtual network in a different Azure subscription, ensure that you register the `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry` resource provider in that subscription. [Register the resource provider](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md) for Azure Container Registry using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or other Azure tools.

If Azure Firewall or a similar solution is configured in the network, check that egress traffic from other resources such as an AKS cluster is enabled to reach the registry endpoints.

If a private endpoint is configured, confirm that DNS resolves the registry's public FQDN such as *myregistry.azurecr.io* to the registry's private IP address. Use a network utility such as `dig` or `nslookup` for DNS lookup.

### Configure service access

Currently, Azure Security Center can't perform [image vulnerability scanning](../security-center/azure-container-registry-integration.md?toc=/azure/container-registry/toc.json&bc=/azure/container-registry/breadcrumb/toc.json) in a registry that restricts access to private endpoints, selected subnets, or IP addresses. Also, resources of the following services are unable to access a container registry with network restrictions:

* Azure DevOps Services 
* Azure Container Instances
* Azure Container Registry Tasks

If access or integration of these Azure services with your container registry is required, remove the network restriction. For example, remove the registry's private endpoints, or remove or modify the registry's public access rules.

## Advanced troubleshooting

If [collection of resource logs](container-registry-diagnostics-audit-logs.md) is enabled in the registry, review the ContainterRegistryLoginEvents log. This log stores authentication events and status, including the incoming identity and IP address. Query the log for [registry authentication failures](container-registry-diagnostics-audit-logs.md#registry-authentication-failures).
