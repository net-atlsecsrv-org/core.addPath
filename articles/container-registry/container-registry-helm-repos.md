# Push and pull Helm charts to an Azure container registry

To quickly manage and deploy applications for Kubernetes, you can use the [open-source Helm package manager][helm]. With Helm, application packages are defined as [charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), which are collected and stored in a [Helm chart repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/).

This article shows you how to host Helm charts repositories in an Azure container registry, using either a Helm 3 or Helm 2 installation. In many scenarios, you would build and upload your own charts for the applications you develop. For more information on how to build your own Helm charts, see the [Chart Template Developer's Guide][develop-helm-charts]. You can also store an existing Helm chart from another Helm repo.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for Helm charts in Azure Container Registry is currently in preview. Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the supplemental [terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).

## Helm 3 or Helm 2?

To store, manage, and install Helm charts, you use a Helm client and the Helm CLI. Major releases of the Helm client include Helm 3 and Helm 2. Helm 3 supports a new chart format and no longer installs the Tiller server-side component. For details on the version differences, see the [version FAQ](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/). If you've previously deployed Helm 2 charts, see [Migrating Helm v2 to v3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/).

You can use either Helm 3 or Helm 2 to host Helm charts in Azure Container Registry, with workflows specific to each version:

* [Helm 3 client](#use-the-helm-3-client) - use `helm chart` commands in the Helm CLI to manage charts in your registry as [OCI artifacts](container-registry-image-formats.md#oci-artifacts)
* [Helm 2 client](#use-the-helm-2-client) - use [az acr helm][az-acr-helm] commands in the Azure CLI to add and manage your container registry as a Helm chart repository

### Additional information

* For most scenarios, we recommend using the Helm 3 workflow with native `helm chart` commands to manage charts as OCI artifacts.
* You can use legacy [az acr helm][az-acr-helm] Azure CLI commands and workflow with the Helm 3 client and charts. However, certain commands such as `az acr helm list` aren't compatible with Helm 3 charts.
* As of Helm 3, [az acr helm][az-acr-helm] commands are supported mainly for compatibility with the Helm 2 client and chart format. Future development of these commands isn't currently planned.

## Use the Helm 3 client

### Prerequisites

- **An Azure container registry** in your Azure subscription. If needed, create a registry using the [Azure portal](container-registry-get-started-portal.md) or the [Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).
- **Helm client version 3.1.0 or later** - Run `helm version` to find your current version. For more information on how to install and upgrade Helm, see [Installing Helm][helm-install].
- **A Kubernetes cluster** where you will install a Helm chart. If needed, create an [Azure Kubernetes Service cluster][aks-quickstart]. 
- **Azure CLI version 2.0.71 or later** - Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

### High level workflow

With **Helm 3** you:

* Can create one or more Helm repositories in an Azure container registry
* Store Helm 3 charts in a registry as [OCI artifacts](container-registry-image-formats.md#oci-artifacts). Currently, Helm 3 support for OCI is *experimental*.
* Authenticate with your registry using the `helm registry login` command.
* Use `helm chart` commands in the Helm CLI to push, pull, and manage Helm charts in a registry
* Use `helm install` to install charts to a Kubernetes cluster from a local repository cache.

See the following sections for examples.

### Enable OCI support

Set the following environment variable to enable OCI support in the Helm 3 client. Currently, this support is experimental. 

```console
export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
```

### Create a sample chart

Create a test chart using the following commands:

```console
mkdir helmtest

cd helmtest
helm create hello-world
```

As a basic example, change directory to the `templates` folder and first delete the contents there:

```console
rm -rf *
```

In the `templates` folder, create a file called `configmap.yaml` with the following contents:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: hello-world-configmap
data:
  myvalue: "Hello World"
```

For more about creating and running this example, see [Getting Started](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/) in the Helm Docs.

### Save chart to local registry cache

Change directory to the `hello-world` subdirectory. Then, run `helm chart save` to save a copy of the chart locally and also create an alias with the fully qualified name of the registry (all lowercase) and the target repository and tag. 

In the following example, the registry name is *mycontainerregistry*, the target repo is *hello-world*, and the target chart tag is *v1*, but substitute values for your environment:

```console
cd ..
helm chart save . hello-world:v1
helm chart save . mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1
```

Run `helm chart list` to confirm you saved the charts in the local registry cache. Output is similar to:

```console
REF                                                      NAME            VERSION DIGEST  SIZE            CREATED
hello-world:v1                                           hello-world       0.1.0   5899db0 3.2 KiB        2 minutes 
mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1       hello-world       0.1.0   5899db0 3.2 KiB        2 minutes
```

### Authenticate with the registry

Run the `helm registry login` command in the Helm 3 CLI to [authenticate with the registry](container-registry-authentication.md) using credentials appropriate for your scenario.

For example, create an Azure Active Directory [service principal with pull and push permissions](container-registry-auth-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal) (AcrPush role) to the registry. Then supply the service principal credentials to `helm registry login`. The following example supplies the password using an environment variable:

```console
echo $spPassword | helm registry login mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io \
  --username <service-principal-id> \
  --password-stdin
```

### Push chart to Azure Container Registry

Run the `helm chart push` command in the Helm 3 CLI to push the chart to the fully qualified target repository:

```console
helm chart push mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1
```

After a successful push, output is similar to:

```output
The push refers to repository [mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world]
ref:     mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1
digest:  5899db028dcf96aeaabdadfa5899db025899db025899db025899db025899db02
size:    3.2 KiB
name:    hello-world
version: 0.1.0
```

### List charts in the repository

As with images stored in an Azure container registry, you can use [az acr repository][az-acr-repository] commands to show the repositories hosting your charts, and chart tags and manifests. 

For example, run [az acr repository show][az-acr-repository-show] to see the properties of the repo you created in the previous step:

```azurecli
az acr repository show \
  --name mycontainerregistry \
  --repository helm/hello-world
```

Output is similar to:

```output
{
  "changeableAttributes": {
    "deleteEnabled": true,
    "listEnabled": true,
    "readEnabled": true,
    "writeEnabled": true
  },
  "createdTime": "2020-03-20T18:11:37.6701689Z",
  "imageName": "helm/hello-world",
  "lastUpdateTime": "2020-03-20T18:11:37.7637082Z",
  "manifestCount": 1,
  "registry": "mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io",
  "tagCount": 1
}
```

Run the [az acr repository show-manifests][az-acr-repository-show-manifests] command to see details of the chart stored in the repository. For example:

```azurecli
az acr repository show-manifests \
  --name mycontainerregistry \
  --repository helm/hello-world --detail
```

Output, abbreviated in this example, shows a `configMediaType` of `application/vnd.cncf.helm.config.v1+json`:

```output
[
  {
    [...]
    "configMediaType": "application/vnd.cncf.helm.config.v1+json",
    "createdTime": "2020-03-20T18:11:37.7167893Z",
    "digest": "sha256:0c03b71c225c3ddff53660258ea16ca7412b53b1f6811bf769d8c85a1f0663ee",
    "imageSize": 3301,
    "lastUpdateTime": "2020-03-20T18:11:37.7167893Z",
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
    "tags": [
      "v1"
    ]
```

### Pull chart to local cache

To install a Helm chart to Kubernetes, the chart must be in the local cache. In this example, first run `helm chart remove` to remove the existing local chart named `mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1`:

```console
helm chart remove mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1
```

Run `helm chart pull` to download the chart from the Azure container registry to your local cache:

```console
helm chart pull mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1
```

### Export Helm chart

To work further with the chart, export it to a local directory using `helm chart export`. For example, export the chart you pulled to the `install` directory:

```console
helm chart export mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/helm/hello-world:v1 \
  --destination ./install
```

To view information for the exported chart in the repo, run the `helm show chart` command in the directory where you exported the chart.

```console
cd install
helm show chart hello-world
```

Helm returns detailed information about the latest version of your chart, as shown in the following sample output:

```output
apiVersion: v2
appVersion: 1.16.0
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
name: hello-world
type: application
version: 0.1.0    
```

### Install Helm chart

Run `helm install` to install the Helm chart you pulled to the local cache and exported. Specify a release name such as *myhelmtest*, or pass the `--generate-name` parameter. For example:

```console
helm install myhelmtest ./hello-world
```

Output after successful chart installation is similar to:

```console
NAME: myhelmtest
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Mar 20 14:14:42 2020
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

To verify the installation, run the `helm get manifest` command. The command returns the YAML data in your `configmap.yaml` template file.

Run `helm uninstall` to uninstall the chart release on your cluster:

```console
helm uninstall myhelmtest
```

### Delete a Helm chart from the repository

To delete a chart from the repository, use the [az acr repository delete][az-acr-repository-delete] command. Run the following command and confirm the operation when prompted:

```azurecli
az acr repository delete --name mycontainerregistry --image helm/hello-world:v1
```

## Use the Helm 2 client

### Prerequisites

- **An Azure container registry** in your Azure subscription. If needed, create a registry using the [Azure portal](container-registry-get-started-portal.md) or the [Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).
- **Helm client version 2.11.0 (not an RC version) or later** - Run `helm version` to find your current version. You also need a Helm server (Tiller) initialized within a Kubernetes cluster. If needed, create an [Azure Kubernetes Service cluster][aks-quickstart]. For more information on how to install and upgrade Helm, see [Installing Helm][helm-install-v2].
- **Azure CLI version 2.0.46 or later** - Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

### High level workflow

With **Helm 2** you:

* Configure your Azure container registry as a *single* Helm chart repository. Azure Container Registry manages the index definition as you add and remove charts to the repository.
* Authenticate with your Azure container registry via the Azure CLI, which then updates your Helm client automatically with the registry URI and credentials. You don't need to manually specify this registry information, so the credentials aren't exposed in the command history.
* Use the [az acr helm][az-acr-helm] commands in the Azure CLI to add your Azure container registry as a Helm chart repository, and to push and manage charts. These Azure CLI commands wrap Helm 2 client commands.
* Add the chart repository in your Azure container registry to your local Helm repo index, supporting chart search.
* Use `helm install` to install charts to a Kubernetes cluster from a local repository cache.

See the following sections for examples.

### Add repository to Helm client

Add your Azure Container Registry Helm chart repository to your Helm client using the [az acr helm repo add][az-acr-helm-repo-add] command. This command gets an authentication token for your Azure container registry that is used by the Helm client. The authentication token is valid for 3 hours. Similar to `docker login`, you can run this command in future CLI sessions to authenticate your Helm client with your Azure Container Registry Helm chart repository:

```azurecli
az acr helm repo add --name mycontainerregistry
```

### Add a sample chart to the repository

First, create a local directory at *~/acr-helm*, then download the existing *stable/wordpress* chart:

```console
mkdir ~/acr-helm && cd ~/acr-helm
helm repo update
helm fetch stable/wordpress
```

Type `ls` to list the downloaded chart, and note the Wordpress version included in the filename. The `helm fetch stable/wordpress` command didn't specify a particular version, so the *latest* version was fetched. In the following example output, the Wordpress chart is version *8.1.0*:

```output
wordpress-8.1.0.tgz
```

Push the chart to your Helm chart repository in Azure Container Registry using the [az acr helm push][az-acr-helm-push] command in the Azure CLI. Specify the name of your Helm chart downloaded in the previous step, such as *wordpress-8.1.0.tgz*:

```azurecli
az acr helm push --name mycontainerregistry wordpress-8.1.0.tgz
```

After a few moments, the Azure CLI reports that your chart is saved, as shown in the following example output:

```output
{
  "saved": true
}
```

### List charts in the repository

To use the chart uploaded in the previous step, the local Helm repository index must be updated. You can reindex the repositories in the Helm client, or use the Azure CLI to update the repository index. Each time you add a chart to your repository, this step must be completed:

```azurecli
az acr helm repo add --name mycontainerregistry
```

With a chart stored in your repository and the updated index available locally, you can use the regular Helm client commands to search or install. To see all the charts in your repository, use the `helm search` command, providing your own Azure Container Registry name:

```console
helm search mycontainerregistry
```

The Wordpress chart pushed in the previous step is listed, as shown in the following example output:

```output
NAME                  CHART VERSION    APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION
helmdocs/wordpress    8.1.0           5.3.2          Web publishing platform for building blogs and websites.
```

You can also list the charts with the Azure CLI, using [az acr helm list][az-acr-helm-list]:

```azurecli
az acr helm list --name mycontainerregistry
```

### Show information for a Helm chart

To view information for a specific chart in the repo, you can use the `helm inspect` command.

```console
helm inspect mycontainerregistry/wordpress
```

When no version number is provided, the *latest* version is used. Helm returns detailed information about your chart, as shown in the following condensed example output:

```output
apiVersion: v1
appVersion: 5.3.2
description: Web publishing platform for building blogs and websites.
engine: gotpl
home: http://www.wordpress.com/
icon: https://bitnami.com/assets/stacks/wordpress/img/wordpress-stack-220x234.png
keywords:
- wordpress
- cms
- blog
- http
- web
- application
- php
maintainers:
- email: containers@bitnami.com
  name: Bitnami
name: wordpress
sources:
- https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wordpress
version: 8.1.0
[...]
```

You can also show the information for a chart with the Azure CLI [az acr helm show][az-acr-helm-show] command. Again, the *latest* version of a chart is returned by default. You can append `--version` to list a specific version of a chart, such as *8.1.0*:

```azurecli
az acr helm show --name mycontainerregistry wordpress
```

### Install a Helm chart from the repository

The Helm chart in your repository is installed by specifying the repository name and the chart name. Use the Helm client to install the Wordpress chart:

```console
helm install mycontainerregistry/wordpress
```

> [!TIP]
> If you push to your Azure Container Registry Helm chart repository and later return in a new CLI session, your local Helm client needs an updated authentication token. To obtain a new authentication token, use the [az acr helm repo add][az-acr-helm-repo-add] command.

The following steps are completed during the install process:

- The Helm client searches the local repository index.
- The corresponding chart is downloaded from the Azure Container Registry repository.
- The chart is deployed using the Tiller in your Kubernetes cluster.

As the installation proceeds, follow the instructions in the command output to see the WorPress URLs and credentials. You can also run the `kubectl get pods` command to see the Kubernetes resources deployed through the Helm chart:

```output
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wordpress-1598530621-67c77b6d86-7ldv4   1/1     Running   0          2m48s
wordpress-1598530621-mariadb-0          1/1     Running   0          2m48s
[...]
```

### Delete a Helm chart from the repository

To delete a chart from the repository, use the [az acr helm delete][az-acr-helm-delete] command. Specify the name of the chart, such as *wordpress*, and the version to delete, such as *8.1.0*.

```azurecli
az acr helm delete --name mycontainerregistry wordpress --version 8.1.0
```

If you wish to delete all versions of the named chart, leave out the `--version` parameter.

The chart continues to be returned when you run `helm search`. Again, the Helm client doesn't automatically update the list of available charts in a repository. To update the Helm client repo index, use the [az acr helm repo add][az-acr-helm-repo-add] command again:

```azurecli
az acr helm repo add --name mycontainerregistry
```
