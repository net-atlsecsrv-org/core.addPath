# Tutorial: Run a multi-step container workflow in the cloud when you commit source code

In addition to a [quick task](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md), ACR Tasks supports multi-step, multi-container-based workflows that can automatically trigger when you commit source code to a Git repository. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to use example YAML files to define multi-step tasks that build, run, and push one or more container images to a registry when you commit source code. To create a task that only automates a single image build on code commit, see [Tutorial: Automate container image builds in the cloud when you commit source code](container-registry-tutorial-build-task.md). For an overview of ACR Tasks, see [Automate OS and framework patching with ACR Tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md),

> * Define a multi-step task using a YAML file
> * Create a task
> * Optionally add credentials to the task to enable access to another registry
> * Test the task
> * View task status
> * Trigger the task with a code commit

This tutorial assumes you've already completed the steps in the [previous tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md). If you haven't already done so, complete the steps in the [Prerequisites](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md#prerequisites) section of the previous tutorial before proceeding.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you'd like to use the Azure CLI locally, you must have Azure CLI version **2.0.62** or later installed and logged in with [az login][az-login]. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade the CLI, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-task-tutorial-prereq.md](../../includes/container-registry-task-tutorial-prereq.md)]

## Create a multi-step task

Now that you've completed the steps required to enable ACR Tasks to read commit status and create webhooks in a repository, create a multi-step task that triggers building, running, and pushing a container image.

### YAML file

You define the steps for a multi-step task in a [YAML file](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md). The first example multi-step task for this tutorial is defined in the file `taskmulti.yaml`, which is in the root of the GitHub repo that you cloned:

```yml
version: v1.0.0
steps:
# Build target image
- build: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}} -f Dockerfile .
# Run image 
- cmd: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}
  id: test
  detach: true
  ports: ["8080:80"]
- cmd: docker stop test
# Push image
- push:
  - {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}
```

This multi-step task does the following:

1. Runs a `build` step to build an image from the Dockerfile in the working directory. The image targets the `Run.Registry`, the registry where the task is run, and is tagged with a unique ACR Tasks run ID. 
1. Runs a `cmd` step to run the image in a temporary container. This example starts a long-running container in the background and returns the container ID, then stops the container. In a real-world scenario, you might include steps to test the running container to ensure it runs correctly.
1. In a `push` step, pushes the image that was built to the run registry.

### Task command

First, populate these shell environment variables with values appropriate for your environment. This step isn't strictly required, but makes executing the multiline Azure CLI commands in this tutorial a bit easier. If you don't populate these environment variables, you must manually replace each value wherever it appears in the example commands.

```azurecli-interactive
ACR_NAME=<registry-name>        # The name of your Azure container registry
GIT_USER=<github-username>      # Your GitHub user account name
GIT_PAT=<personal-access-token> # The PAT you generated in the previous section
```

Now, create the task by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task create \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --name example1 \
    --context https://github.com/$GIT_USER/acr-build-helloworld-node.git \
    --file taskmulti.yaml \
    --git-access-token $GIT_PAT
```

This task specifies that any time code is committed to the *master* branch in the repository specified by `--context`, ACR Tasks will run the multi-step task from the code in that branch. The YAML file specified by `--file` from the repository root defines the steps. 

Output from a successful [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command is similar to the following:

```console
{
  "agentConfiguration": {
    "cpu": 2
  },

        },

        ],
        "status": "Enabled"
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/tasks"
}
```

## Test the multi-step workflow

To test the multi-step task, trigger it manually by executing the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name example1
```

By default, the `az acr task run` command streams the log output to your console when you execute the command. The output shows the progress of running each of the task steps. The output below is condensed to show key steps.

```

## Trigger a build with a commit

Now that you've tested the task by manually running it, trigger it automatically with a source code change.

First, ensure you're in the directory containing your local clone of the [repository][sample-repo]:

```azurecli-interactive
cd acr-build-helloworld-node
```

Next, execute the following commands to create, commit, and push a new file to your fork of the repo on GitHub:

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Hello World!" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Testing ACR Tasks"
git push origin master
```

You may be asked to provide your GitHub credentials when you execute the `git push` command. Provide your GitHub username, and enter the personal access token (PAT) that you created earlier for the password.

```console
$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': <github-username>
Password for 'https://githubuser@github.com': <personal-access-token>
```

Once you've pushed a commit to your repository, the webhook created by ACR Tasks fires and kicks off the task in Azure Container Registry. Display the logs for the currently running task to verify and monitor the build progress:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
```

Output is similar to the following, showing the currently executing (or last-executed) task:

```console
$ az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
Showing logs of the last created run.
Run ID: cf1d

[...]

Run ID: cf1d was successful after 37s
```

## List builds

To see a list of the task runs that ACR Tasks has completed for your registry, run the [az acr task list-runs][az-acr-task-list-runs] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
```

Output from the command should appear similar to the following. The runs that ACR Tasks has executed are displayed, and "Git Commit" appears in the TRIGGER column for the most recent task:

```console
$ az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table

RUN ID    TASK       PLATFORM    STATUS     TRIGGER    STARTED               DURATION

```

## Create a multi-registry multi-step task

ACR Tasks by default has permissions to push or pull images from the registry where the task runs. You might want to run a multi-step task that targets one or more registries in addition to the run registry. For example, you might need to build images in one registry, and store images with different tags in a second registry that is accessed by a production system. This example shows you how to create such a task and provide credentials for another registry.

If you don't already have a second registry, create one for this example. If you need a registry, see the [previous tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md), or [Quickstart: Create a container registry using the Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).

To create the task, you need the name of the registry login server, which is of the form *mycontainerregistrydate.azurecr.io* (all lowercase). In this example, you use the second registry to store images tagged by build date.

### YAML file

The second example multi-step task for this tutorial is defined in the file `taskmulti-multiregistry.yaml`, which is in the root of the GitHub repo that you cloned:

```yml
version: v1.0.0
steps:
# Build target images
- build: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}} -f Dockerfile .
- build: -t {{.Values.regDate}}/hello-world:{{.Run.Date}} -f Dockerfile .
# Run image 
- cmd: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}
  id: test
  detach: true
  ports: ["8080:80"]
- cmd: docker stop test
# Push images
- push:
  - {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}
  - {{.Values.regDate}}/hello-world:{{.Run.Date}}
```

This multi-step task does the following:

1. Runs two `build` steps to build images from the Dockerfile in the working directory:
    * The first targets the `Run.Registry`, the registry where the task is run, and is tagged with the ACR Tasks run ID. 
    * The second targets the registry identified by the value of `regDate`, which you set when you create the task (or provide through an external `values.yaml` file passed to `az acr task create`). This image is tagged with the run date.
1. Runs a `cmd` step to run one of the built containers. This example starts a long-running container in the background and returns the container ID, then stops the container. In a real-world scenario, you might test a running container to ensure it runs correctly.
1. In a `push` step, pushes the images that were built, the first to the run registry, the second to the registry identified by `regDate`.

### Task command

Using the shell environment variables defined previously, create the task by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. Substitute the name of your registry for *mycontainerregistrydate*.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task create \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --name example2 \
    --context https://github.com/$GIT_USER/acr-build-helloworld-node.git \
    --file taskmulti-multiregistry.yaml \
    --git-access-token $GIT_PAT \
    --set regDate=mycontainerregistrydate.azurecr.io
```

### Add task credential

To push images to the registry identified by the value of `regDate`, use the [az acr task credential add][az-acr-task-credential-add] command to add login credentials for that registry to the task.

For this example, we recommend that you create a [service principal](container-registry-auth-service-principal.md) with access to the registry scoped to the *AcrPush* role. To create the service principal, see this [Azure CLI script](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cli-samples/blob/master/container-registry/service-principal-create/service-principal-create.sh).

Pass the service principal application ID and password in the following `az acr task credential add` command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task credential add --name example2 \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --login-server mycontainerregistrydate.azurecr.io \
    --username <service-principal-application-id> \
    --password <service-principal-password>
```

The CLI returns the name of the registry login server you added.

### Test the multi-step workflow

As in the preceding example, to test the multi-step task, trigger it manually by executing the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command. To trigger the task with a commit to the Git repository, see the section [Trigger a build with a commit](#trigger-a-build-with-a-commit).

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name example2
```

By default, the `az acr task run` command streams the log output to your console when you execute the command. As before, the output shows the progress of running each of the task steps. The output is condensed to show key steps.

Output:

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to create multi-step, multi-container-based tasks that automatically trigger when you commit source code to a Git repository. For advanced features of multi-step tasks, including parallel and dependent step execution, see the [ACR Tasks YAML reference](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md). Move on to the next tutorial to learn how to create tasks that trigger builds when a container image's base image is updated.
