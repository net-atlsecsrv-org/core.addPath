# Azure security baseline for Container Registry

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Container Registry. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Container Registry. **Controls** not applicable to Container Registry have been excluded.

 
To see how Container Registry completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Container Registry security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual Network provides secure, private networking for your Azure and on-premises resources. By limiting access to your private Azure container registry from an Azure virtual network, you ensure that only resources in
 the virtual network access the registry. For cross-premises scenarios, you can also configure firewall rules to allow
 registry access only from specific IP addresses.
 From behind a firewall, configure firewall access rules and service tags to access your container registry.

- [Restrict access to an Azure container registry using an Azure virtual network or firewall rules](container-registry-vnet.md) 

- [Configure rules to access an Azure container registry behind a firewall](container-registry-firewall-access-rules.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: The [Azure Security Benchmark](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark.md) is the default policy initiative for Security Center and is the foundation for [Security Center's recommendations](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/security-center-recommendations.md). The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/azure-defender.md) plan for the related services.

**Azure Policy built-in definitions - Microsoft.ContainerRegistry**:

[!INCLUDE [Resource Policy for Microsoft.ContainerRegistry 1.1](../../includes/policy/standards/asb/rp-controls/microsoft.containerregistry-1-1.md)]

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations to help protect your network resources in Azure. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a Storage Account for traffic audit.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable DDoS Standard protection on your virtual networks for protections from DDoS attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses. Deploy Azure Firewall at each of the organization's network boundaries with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

You may use Azure Security Center Just In Time Network access to configure NSGs to limit exposure of endpoints to approved IP addresses for a limited period.
 Also, use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG configurations that limit Ports and Source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities. If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

Deploy the firewall solution of your choice at each of your organization's network boundaries to detect and/or deny malicious traffic.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: For resources that need access to your container registry, use virtual network service tags for the Azure Container Registry service to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name "AzureContainerRegistry" in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
