# Quickstart: Build and push Java container images to Azure Container Registry

This quickstart shows you how to build a containerized Java app and push it to Azure Container Registry using the Maven Jib plugin. The use of Maven and Jib is one example of using developer tooling to interact with an Azure container registry.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription; if you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details) or sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).
* The [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/overview).
* A supported Java Development Kit (JDK). For more information about the JDKs available for use when developing on Azure, see <https://aka.ms/azure-jdks>.
* Apache's [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) build tool (Version 3 or above).
* A [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.
* A [Docker](https://www.docker.com) client.
* The [ACR Docker credential helper](https://github.com/Azure/acr-docker-credential-helper).

## Create the Spring Boot on Docker Getting Started web app

The following steps walk you through building a Spring Boot web application and testing it locally.

1. From the command prompt, use the following command to clone the [Spring Boot on Docker Getting Started](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-docker) sample project.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-docker.git
   ```

1. Change directory to the completed project.

   ```bash
   cd gs-spring-boot-docker/complete
   ```

1. Use Maven to build and run the sample app.

   ```bash
   mvn package spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Test the web app by browsing to `http://localhost:8080`, or with the following `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

You should see the following message displayed: **Hello Docker World**

## Create an Azure Container Registry using the Azure CLI

Next, you'll create an Azure resource group and your ACR using the following steps:

1. Log in to your Azure account by using the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

1. Specify the Azure subscription to use:

   ```azurecli
   az account set -s <subscription ID>
   ```

1. Create a resource group for the Azure resources used in this tutorial. In the following command, be sure to replace the placeholders with your own resource name and a location such as `eastus`.

   ```azurecli
   az group create \
       --name=<your resource group name> \
       --location=<location>
   ```

1. Create a private Azure container registry in the resource group, using the following command. Be sure to replace the placeholders with actual values. The tutorial pushes the sample app as a Docker image to this registry in later steps.

   ```azurecli
   az acr create \
       --resource-group <your resource group name> \
       --location <location> \
       --name <your registry name> \
       --sku Basic
   ```

## Push your app to the container registry via Jib

Finally, you'll update your project configuration and use the command prompt to build and deploy your image.

> [!NOTE]
> To log in the Azure container registry that you just created, you will need to have the Docker daemon running. To install Docker on your machine, [here is the official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

1. Log in to your Azure Container Registry from the Azure CLI using the following command. Be sure to replace the placeholder with your own registry name.

   ```azurecli
   az configure --defaults acr=<your registry name>
   az acr login
   ```

   The `az configure` command sets the default registry name to use with `az acr` commands.

1. Navigate to the completed project directory for your Spring Boot application (for example, "*C:\SpringBoot\gs-spring-boot-docker\complete*" or "*/users/robert/SpringBoot/gs-spring-boot-docker/complete*"), and open the *pom.xml* file with a text editor.

1. Update the `<properties>` collection in the *pom.xml* file with the following XML. Replace the placeholder with your registry name, and add a `<jib-maven-plugin.version>` property with value `2.2.0`, or a newer version of the [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin).

   ```xml
   <properties>
      <docker.image.prefix><your registry name>.azurecr.io</docker.image.prefix>
      <java.version>1.8</java.version>
      <jib-maven-plugin.version>2.2.0</jib-maven-plugin.version>
   </properties>
   ```

1. Update the `<plugins>` collection in the *pom.xml* file so that the `<plugin>` element contains and entry for the `jib-maven-plugin`, as shown in the following example. Note that we are using a base image from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR): `mcr.microsoft.com/java/jdk:8-zulu-alpine`, which contains an officially supported JDK for Azure. For other MCR base images with officially supported JDKs, see [Java SE JDK](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jdk), [Java SE JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jre), [Java SE Headless JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jre-headless), and [Java SE JDK and Maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-maven).

   ```xml
   <plugin>
     <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
     <version>${jib-maven-plugin.version}</version>
     <configuration>
        <from>
            <image>mcr.microsoft.com/java/jdk:8-zulu-alpine</image>
        </from>
        <to>
            <image>${docker.image.prefix}/${project.artifactId}</image>
        </to>
     </configuration>
   </plugin>
   ```

1. Navigate to the completed project directory for your Spring Boot application and run the following command to build the image and push the image to the registry:

   ```bash
   az acr login && mvn compile jib:build
   ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> For security reasons, the credential created by `az acr login` is valid for 1 hour only. If you receive a *401 Unauthorized* error, you can run the `az acr login -n <your registry name>` command again to reauthenticate.

## Verify your container image

Congratulations! Now you have your containerized Java App build on Azure supported JDK pushed to your ACR. You can now test the image by deploying it to Azure App Service, or pulling it to local with command (replacing the placeholder):

```bash
docker pull <your registry name>.azurecr.io/gs-spring-boot-docker
```

## Next steps

For other versions of the official Microsoft-supported Java base images, see:

* [Java SE JDK](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jdk)
* [Java SE JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jre)
* [Java SE Headless JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jre-headless)
* [Java SE JDK and Maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-maven)
