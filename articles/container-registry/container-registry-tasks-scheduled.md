# Tutorial: Run an ACR task on a defined schedule

This tutorial shows you how to run an [ACR Task](container-registry-tasks-overview.md) on a schedule. Schedule a task by setting up one or more *timer triggers*. Timer triggers can be used alone, or in combination with other task triggers.

In this tutorial, learn about scheduling tasks and:

Scheduling a task is useful for scenarios like the following:

* Run a container workload for scheduled maintenance operations. For example, run a containerized app to remove unneeded images from your registry.
* Run a set of tests on a production image during the workday as part of your live-site monitoring.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

## About scheduling a task

* **Trigger with cron expression** - The timer trigger for a task uses a *cron expression*. The expression is a string with five fields specifying the minute, hour, day, month, and day of week to trigger the task. Frequencies of up to once per minute are supported.

  For example, the expression `"0 12 * * Mon-Fri"` triggers a task at noon UTC on each weekday. See [details](#cron-expressions) later in this article.
* **Multiple timer triggers** - Adding multiple timers to a task is allowed, as long as the schedules differ.
    * Specify multiple timer triggers when you create the task, or add them later.
    * Optionally name the triggers for easier management, or ACR Tasks will provide default trigger names.
    * If timer schedules overlap at a time, ACR Tasks triggers the task at the scheduled time for each timer.
* **Other task triggers** - In a timer-triggered task, you can also enable triggers based on [source code commit](container-registry-tutorial-build-task.md) or [base image updates](container-registry-tutorial-base-image-update.md). Like other ACR tasks, you can also [manually run][az-acr-task-run] a scheduled task.

## Create a task with a timer trigger

### Task command

First, populate the following shell environment variable with a value appropriate for your environment. This step isn't strictly required, but makes executing the multiline Azure CLI commands in this tutorial a bit easier. If you don't populate the environment variable, you must manually replace each value wherever it appears in the example commands.

[![Embed launch](https://shell.azure.com/images/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Azure Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com)

```console
ACR_NAME=<registry-name>        # The name of your Azure container registry
```

When you create a task with the [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command, you can optionally add a timer trigger. Add the `--schedule` parameter and pass a cron expression for the timer.

As a simple example, the following task triggers running the `hello-world` image from Microsoft Container Registry every day at 21:00 UTC. The task runs without a source code context.

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --name timertask \
  --registry $ACR_NAME \
  --cmd mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world \
  --schedule "0 21 * * *" \
  --context /dev/null
```

Run the [az acr task show][az-acr-task-show] command to see that the timer trigger is configured. By default, the base image update trigger is also enabled.

```azurecli
az acr task show --name timertask --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
```

```output
NAME      PLATFORM    STATUS    SOURCE REPOSITORY       TRIGGERS
--------  ----------  --------  -------------------     -----------------
timertask linux       Enabled                           BASE_IMAGE, TIMER
```

## Trigger the task

Trigger the task manually with [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] to ensure that it is set up properly:

```azurecli
az acr task run --name timertask --registry $ACR_NAME
```

If the container runs successfully, the output is similar to the following. The output is condensed to show key steps

```output
Queued a run with ID: cf2a
Waiting for an agent...
2020/11/20 21:03:36 Using acb_vol_2ca23c46-a9ac-4224-b0c6-9fde44eb42d2 as the home volume
2020/11/20 21:03:36 Creating Docker network: acb_default_network, driver: 'bridge'
[...]
2020/11/20 21:03:38 Launching container with name: acb_step_0

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
[...]
```

After the scheduled time, run the [az acr task list-runs][az-acr-task-list-runs] command to verify that the timer triggered the task as expected:

```azurecli
az acr task list-runs --name timertask --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
```

When the timer is successful, output is similar to the following:

```output
RUN ID    TASK       PLATFORM    STATUS     TRIGGER    STARTED               DURATION
--------  ---------  ----------  ---------  ---------  --------------------  ----------
ca15      timertask  linux       Succeeded  Timer      2020-11-20T21:00:23Z  00:00:06
ca14      timertask  linux       Succeeded  Manual     2020-11-20T20:53:35Z  00:00:06
```

## Manage timer triggers

Use the [az acr task timer][az-acr-task-timer] commands to manage the timer triggers for an ACR task.

### Add or update a timer trigger

After a task is created, optionally add a timer trigger by using the [az acr task timer add][az-acr-task-timer-add] command. The following example adds a timer trigger name *timer2* to *timertask* created previously. This timer triggers the task every day at 10:30 UTC.

```azurecli
az acr task timer add \
  --name timertask \
  --registry $ACR_NAME \
  --timer-name timer2 \
  --schedule "30 10 * * *"
```

Update the schedule of an existing trigger, or change its status, by using the [az acr task timer update][az-acr-task-timer-update] command. For example, update the trigger named *timer2* to trigger the task at 11:30 UTC:

```azurecli
az acr task timer update \
  --name timertask \
  --registry $ACR_NAME \
  --timer-name timer2 \
  --schedule "30 11 * * *"
```

### List timer triggers

The [az acr task timer list][az-acr-task-timer-list] command shows the timer triggers set up for a task:

```azurecli
az acr task timer list --name timertask --registry $ACR_NAME
```

Example output:

```JSON
[
  {
    "name": "timer2",
    "schedule": "30 11 * * *",
    "status": "Enabled"
  },
  {
    "name": "t1",
    "schedule": "0 21 * * *",
    "status": "Enabled"
  }
]
```

### Remove a timer trigger

Use the [az acr task timer remove][az-acr-task-timer-remove] command to remove a timer trigger from a task. The following example removes the *timer2* trigger from *timertask*:

```azurecli
az acr task timer remove \
  --name timertask \
  --registry $ACR_NAME \
  --timer-name timer2
```

## Cron expressions

ACR Tasks uses the [NCronTab](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab) library to interpret cron expressions. Supported expressions in ACR Tasks have five required fields separated by white space:

`{minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}`

The time zone used with the cron expressions is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hours are in 24-hour format.

> [!NOTE]
> ACR Tasks does not support the `{second}` or `{year}` field in cron expressions. If you copy a cron expression used in another system, be sure to remove those fields, if they are used.

Each field can have one of the following types of values:

|Type  |Example  |When triggered  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|A specific value |<nobr>`"5 * * * *"`</nobr>|every hour at 5 minutes past the hour|
|All values (`*`)|<nobr>`"* 5 * * *"`</nobr>|every minute of the hour beginning 5:00 UTC (60 times a day)|
|A range (`-` operator)|<nobr>`"0 1-3 * * *"`</nobr>|3 times per day, at 1:00, 2:00, and 3:00 UTC|
|A set of values (`,` operator)|<nobr>`"20,30,40 * * * *"`</nobr>|3 times per hour, at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 40 minutes past the hour|
|An interval value (`/` operator)|<nobr>`"*/10 * * * *"`</nobr>|6 times per hour, at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and so on, past the hour

[!INCLUDE [functions-cron-expressions-months-days](../../includes/functions-cron-expressions-months-days.md)]

### Cron examples

|Example|When triggered  |
|---------|---------|
|`"*/5 * * * *"`|once every five minutes|
|`"0 * * * *"`|once at the top of every hour|
|`"0 */2 * * *"`|once every two hours|
|`"0 9-17 * * *"`|once every hour from 9:00 to 17:00 UTC|
|`"30 9 * * *"`|at 9:30 UTC every day|
|`"30 9 * * 1-5"`|at 9:30 UTC every weekday|
|`"30 9 * Jan Mon"`|at 9:30 UTC every Monday in January|

## Clean up resources

To remove all resources you've created in this tutorial series, including the container registry or registries, container instance, key vault, and service principal, issue the following commands:

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group $RES_GROUP
az ad sp delete --id http://$ACR_NAME-pull
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to create Azure Container Registry tasks that are automatically triggered by a timer. 

For an example of using a scheduled task to clean up repositories in a registry, see [Automatically purge images from an Azure container registry](container-registry-auto-purge.md).

For examples of tasks triggered by source code commits or base image updates, see other articles in the [ACR Tasks tutorial series](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md).
