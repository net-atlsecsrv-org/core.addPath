# Run an ACR task on a dedicated agent pool

Set up an Azure-managed VM pool (*agent pool*) to enable running your [Azure Container Registry tasks][acr-tasks] in a dedicated compute environment. After you've configured one or more pools in your registry, you can choose a pool to run a task in place of the service's default compute environment.

An agent pool provides:

- **Virtual network support** - Assign an agent pool to an Azure VNet, providing access to resources in the VNet such as a container registry, key vault, or storage.
- **Scale as needed** - Increase the number of instances in an agent pool for compute-intensive tasks, or scale to zero. Billing is based on pool allocation. For details, see [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/).
- **Flexible options** - Choose from different [pool tiers](#pool-tiers) and scale options to meet your task workload needs.
- **Azure management** - Task pools are patched and maintained by Azure, providing reserved allocation without the need to maintain the individual VMs.

This feature is available in the **Premium** container registry service tier. For information about registry service tiers and limits, see [Azure Container Registry SKUs][acr-tiers].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in preview, and some [limitations apply](#preview-limitations). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).
>

## Preview limitations

- Task agent pools currently support Linux nodes. Windows nodes aren't currently supported.
- Task agent pools are available in preview in the following regions: West US 2, South Central US, East US 2, East US, Central US, USGov Arizona, USGov Texas, and USGov Virginia.
- For each registry, the default total vCPU (core) quota is 16 for all standard agent pools and is 0 for isolated agent pools. Open a [support request][open-support-ticket] for additional allocation.
- You can't currently cancel a task run on an agent pool.

## Prerequisites

* To use the Azure CLI steps in this article, Azure CLI version 2.3.1 or later is required. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli]. Or run in [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/quickstart.md).
* If you don't already have a container registry, [create one][create-reg-cli] (Premium tier required) in a preview region.

## Pool tiers

Agent pool tiers provide the following resources per instance in the pool.

|Tier    | Type  |  CPU  |Memory (GB)  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|S1     |  standard    | 2       |    3     |
|S2     |  standard    | 4       |    8     |
|S3     |  standard    | 8       |   16     |
|I6     |  isolated    | 64     |   216     |


## Create and manage a task agent pool

### Set default registry (optional)

To simplify Azure CLI commands that follow, set the default registry by running the [az configure][az-configure] command:

```azurecli
az configure --defaults acr=<registryName>
```

The following examples assume that you've set the default registry. If not, pass a `--registry <registryName>` parameter in each `az acr` command.

### Create agent pool

Create an agent pool by using the [az acr agentpool create][az-acr-agentpool-create] command. The following example creates a tier S2 pool (4 CPU/instance). By default, the pool contains 1 instance.

```azurecli
az acr agentpool create \
    --name myagentpool \
    --tier S2
```

> [!NOTE]
> Creating an agent pool and other pool management operations take several minutes to complete.

### Scale pool

Scale the pool size up or down with the [az acr agentpool update][az-acr-agentpool-update] command. The following example scales the pool to 2 instances. You can scale to 0 instances.

```azurecli
az acr agentpool update \
    --name myagentpool \
    --count 2
```

## Create pool in a virtual network

### Add firewall rules

Task agent pools require access to the following Azure services. The following firewall rules must be added to any existing network security groups or user-defined routes.

| Direction | Protocol | Source         | Source Port | Destination          | Dest Port | Used    |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|---------|
| Outbound  | TCP      | VirtualNetwork | Any         | AzureKeyVault        | 443       | Default |
| Outbound  | TCP      | VirtualNetwork | Any         | Storage              | 443       | Default |
| Outbound  | TCP      | VirtualNetwork | Any         | EventHub             | 443       | Default |
| Outbound  | TCP      | VirtualNetwork | Any         | AzureActiveDirectory | 443       | Default |
| Outbound  | TCP      | VirtualNetwork | Any         | AzureMonitor         | 443       | Default |

> [!NOTE]
> If your tasks require additional resources from the public internet, add the corresponding rules. For example, additional rules are needed to run a docker build task that pulls the base images from Docker Hub, or restores a NuGet package.

### Create pool in VNet

The following example creates an agent pool in the *mysubnet* subnet of network *myvnet*:

```azurecli
# Get the subnet ID
subnetId=$(az network vnet subnet show \
        --resource-grop myresourcegroup \
        --vnet-name myvnet \
        --name mysubnetname \
        --query id --output tsv)

az acr agentpool create \
    --name myagentpool \
    --tier S2 \
    --subnet-id $subnetId
```

## Run task on agent pool

The following examples show how to specify an agent pool when queuing a task.

> [!NOTE]
> To use an agent pool in an ACR task, ensure that the pool contains at least 1 instance.
>

### Quick task

Queue a quick task on the agent pool by using the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command and pass the `--agent-pool` parameter:

```azurecli
az acr build \
    --agent-pool myagentpool \
    --image myimage:mytag \
    --file Dockerfile \
    https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node.git
```

### Automatically triggered task

For example, create a scheduled task on the agent pool with [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create], passing the `--agent-pool` parameter.

```azurecli
az acr task create \
    --name mytask \
    --agent-pool myagentpool \
    --image myimage:mytag \
    --schedule "0 21 * * *" \
    --file Dockerfile \
    --context https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node.git \
    --commit-trigger-enabled false
```

To verify task setup, run [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run]:

```azurecli
az acr task run \
    --name mytask
```

### Query pool status

To find the number of runs currently scheduled on the agent pool, run [az acr agentpool show][az-acr-agentpool-show].

```azurecli
az acr agentpool show \
    --name myagentpool \
    --queue-count
```
