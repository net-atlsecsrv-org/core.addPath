# View and manage task run logs

Each task run in [Azure Container Registry tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md) generates log output that you can inspect to determine whether the task steps ran successfully. 

This article explains how to view and manage task run logs.

## View streamed logs

When you trigger a task manually, log output is streamed directly to the console. For example, when you trigger a task manually by using the [az acr build](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-build), [az acr run](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-run), or [az acr task run](/cli/azure/acr/task#az-acr-task-run) command, you see log output streamed to the console. 

The following sample [az acr run](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-run) command manually triggers a task that runs a container pulled from the same registry:

```azurecli
az acr run --registry mycontainerregistry1220 \
  --cmd '$Registry/samples/hello-world:v1' /dev/null
```

Streamed log:

## View stored logs 

Azure Container Registry stores run logs for all tasks. You can view stored run logs in the Azure portal. Or, use the [az acr task logs](/cli/azure/acr/task#az-acr-task-logs) command to view a selected log. By default, logs are retained for 30 days.

If a task is automatically triggered, for example by a source code update, accessing the stored logs is the *only* way to view the run logs. Automatic task triggers include source code commits or pull requests, base image updates, and timer triggers.

To view run logs in the portal:

1. Navigate to your container registry.
1. In **Services**, select **Tasks** > **Runs**.
1. Select a **Run Id** to view the run status and run logs. The log contains the same information as a streamed log, if one is generated.

To view a log using the Azure CLI, run [az acr task logs](/cli/azure/acr/task#az-acr-task-logs) and specify a run ID, a task name, or a specific image create by a build task. If a task name is specified, the command shows the log for the last created run.

The following example outputs the log for the run with ID *cf4*:

```azurecli
az acr task logs --registry mycontainerregistry1220 \
  --run-id cf4
```

## Alternative log storage

You might want to store task run logs on a local file system or use an alternative archiving solution such as Azure Storage.

For example, create a local *tasklogs* directory, and redirect the output of [az acr task logs](/cli/azure/acr/task#az-acr-task-logs) to a local file:

```azurecli
mkdir ~/tasklogs

az acr task logs --registry mycontainerregistry1220 \
  --run-id cf4 > ~/tasklogs/cf4.log
```

You can also save local log files to Azure Storage. For example, use the [Azure CLI](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md), the [Azure portal](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md), or other methods to upload files to a storage account.
