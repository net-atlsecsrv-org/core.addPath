# Tutorial: Automate container image builds in the cloud when you commit source code

In addition to a [quick task](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md), ACR Tasks supports automated Docker container image builds in the cloud when you commit source code to a Git repository. Supported Git contexts for ACR Tasks include public or private GitHub or Azure Repos.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, ACR Tasks doesn't support commit or pull request triggers in GitHub Enterprise repos.

In this tutorial, your ACR task builds and pushes a single container image specified in a Dockerfile when you commit source code to a Git repo. To create a [multi-step task](container-registry-tasks-multi-step.md) that uses a YAML file to define steps to build, push, and optionally test multiple containers on code commit, see [Tutorial: Run a multi-step container workflow in the cloud when you commit source code](container-registry-tutorial-multistep-task.md). For an overview of ACR Tasks, see [Automate OS and framework patching with ACR Tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md)

This tutorial assumes you've already completed the steps in the [previous tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md). If you haven't already done so, complete the steps in the [Prerequisites](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md#prerequisites) section of the previous tutorial before proceeding.

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-task-tutorial-prereq.md](../../includes/container-registry-task-tutorial-prereq.md)]
[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md)]

## Create the build task

Now that you've completed the steps required to enable ACR Tasks to read commit status and create webhooks in a repository, you can create a task that triggers a container image build on commits to the repo.

First, populate these shell environment variables with values appropriate for your environment. This step isn't strictly required, but makes executing the multiline Azure CLI commands in this tutorial a bit easier. If you don't populate these environment variables, you must manually replace each value wherever it appears in the example commands.

```console
ACR_NAME=<registry-name>        # The name of your Azure container registry
GIT_USER=<github-username>      # Your GitHub user account name
GIT_PAT=<personal-access-token> # The PAT you generated in the previous section
```

Now, create the task by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command:

```azurecli
az acr task create \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --name taskhelloworld \
    --image helloworld:{{.Run.ID}} \
    --context https://github.com/$GIT_USER/acr-build-helloworld-node.git \
    --file Dockerfile \
    --git-access-token $GIT_PAT
```


This task specifies that any time code is committed to the *main* branch in the repository specified by `--context`, ACR Tasks will build the container image from the code in that branch. The Dockerfile specified by `--file` from the repository root is used to build the image. The `--image` argument specifies a parameterized value of `{{.Run.ID}}` for the version portion of the image's tag, ensuring the built image correlates to a specific build, and is tagged uniquely.

Output from a successful [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command is similar to the following:

```output
{
  "agentConfiguration": {
    "cpu": 2
  },
  "creationDate": "2010-11-19T22:42:32.972298+00:00",

        "sourceRepository": {
          "branch": "main",

          "sourceControlAuthProperties": null,

        },
        "sourceTriggerEvents": [

        ],
        "status": "Enabled"
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/tasks"
}
```

## Test the build task

You now have a task that defines your build. To test the build pipeline, trigger a build manually by executing the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command:

```azurecli
az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name taskhelloworld
```

By default, the `az acr task run` command streams the log output to your console when you execute the command. The output is condensed to show key steps.

```output

```

## Trigger a build with a commit

Now that you've tested the task by manually running it, trigger it automatically with a source code change.

First, ensure you're in the directory containing your local clone of the [repository][sample-repo]:

```console
cd acr-build-helloworld-node
```

Next, execute the following commands to create, commit, and push a new file to your fork of the repo on GitHub:

```console
echo "Hello World!" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Testing ACR Tasks"
git push origin main
```

You may be asked to provide your GitHub credentials when you execute the `git push` command. Provide your GitHub username, and enter the personal access token (PAT) that you created earlier for the password.

```azurecli
Username for 'https://github.com': <github-username>
Password for 'https://githubuser@github.com': <personal-access-token>
```

Once you've pushed a commit to your repository, the webhook created by ACR Tasks fires and kicks off a build in Azure Container Registry. Display the logs for the currently running task to verify and monitor the build progress:

```azurecli
az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
```

Output is similar to the following, showing the currently executing (or last-executed) task:

```output
Showing logs of the last created run.
Run ID: ca7

[...]

Run ID: ca7 was successful after 38s
```

## List builds

To see a list of the task runs that ACR Tasks has completed for your registry, run the [az acr task list-runs][az-acr-task-list-runs] command:

```azurecli
az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
```

Output from the command should appear similar to the following. The runs that ACR Tasks has executed are displayed, and "Git Commit" appears in the TRIGGER column for the most recent task:

```output
RUN ID    TASK            PLATFORM    STATUS     TRIGGER    STARTED               DURATION
--------  --------------  ----------  ---------  ---------  --------------------  ----------

ca6       taskhelloworld  linux       Succeeded  Manual     2020-11-19T22:51:47Z  00:00:24
ca5                       linux       Succeeded  Manual     2020-11-19T22:23:42Z  00:00:23
```

## Next steps
