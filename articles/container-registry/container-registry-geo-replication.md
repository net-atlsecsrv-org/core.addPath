# Geo-replication in Azure Container Registry

Companies that want a local presence, or a hot backup, choose to run services from multiple Azure regions. As a best practice, placing a container registry in each region where images are run allows network-close operations, enabling fast, reliable image layer transfers. Geo-replication enables an Azure container registry to function as a single registry, serving multiple regions with multi-master regional registries. 

A geo-replicated registry provides the following benefits:

* Single registry/image/tag names can be used across multiple regions
* Network-close registry access from regional deployments
* No additional egress fees, as images are pulled from a local, replicated registry in the same region as your container host
* Single management of a registry across multiple regions

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to maintain copies of container images in more than one Azure container registry, Azure Container Registry also supports [image import](container-registry-import-images.md). For example, in a DevOps workflow, you can import an image from a development registry to a production registry, without needing to use Docker commands.

## Example use case
Contoso runs a public presence website located across the US, Canada, and Europe. To serve these markets with local and network-close content, Contoso runs [Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/) (AKS) clusters in West US, East US, Canada Central, and West Europe. The website application, deployed as a Docker image, utilizes the same code and image across all regions. Content, local to that region, is retrieved from a database, which is provisioned uniquely in each region. Each regional deployment has its unique configuration for resources like the local database.

The development team is located in Seattle WA, utilizing the West US data center.

Prior to using the geo-replication features, Contoso had a US-based registry in West US, with an additional registry in West Europe. To serve these different regions, the development team pushed images to two different registries.

```bash
docker push contoso.azurecr.io/public/products/web:1.2
docker push contosowesteu.azurecr.io/public/products/web:1.2
```

Typical challenges of multiple registries include:

* The East US, West US, and Canada Central clusters all pull from the West US registry, incurring egress fees as each of these remote container hosts pull images from West US data centers.
* The development team must push images to West US and West Europe registries.
* The development team must configure and maintain each regional deployment with image names referencing the local registry.
* Registry access must be configured for each region.

## Benefits of geo-replication

Using the geo-replication feature of Azure Container Registry, these benefits are realized:

* Manage a single registry across all regions: `contoso.azurecr.io`
* Manage a single configuration of image deployments as all regions used the same image URL: `contoso.azurecr.io/public/products/web:1.2`
* Push to a single registry, while ACR manages the geo-replication. You can configure regional [webhooks](container-registry-webhook.md) to notify you of events in specific replicas.

## Configure geo-replication

Configuring geo-replication is as easy as clicking regions on a map. You can also manage geo-replication using tools including the [az acr replication](/cli/azure/acr/replication) commands in the Azure CLI.

Geo-replication is a feature of [Premium registries](container-registry-skus.md) only. If your registry isn't yet Premium, you can change from Basic and Standard to Premium in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

![Switching SKUs in the Azure portal](media/container-registry-skus/update-registry-sku.png)

To configure geo-replication for your Premium registry, log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

Navigate to your Azure Container Registry, and select **Replications**:

![Replications in the Azure portal container registry UI](media/container-registry-geo-replication/registry-services.png)

A map is displayed showing all current Azure Regions:

 ![Region map in the Azure portal](media/container-registry-geo-replication/registry-geo-map.png)

* Blue hexagons represent current replicas
* Green hexagons represent possible replica regions
* Gray hexagons represent Azure regions not yet available for replication

To configure a replica, select a green hexagon, then select **Create**:

 ![Create replication UI in the Azure portal](media/container-registry-geo-replication/create-replication.png)

To configure additional replicas, select the green hexagons for other regions, then click **Create**.

ACR begins syncing images across the configured replicas. Once complete, the portal reflects *Ready*. The replica status in the portal doesn't automatically update. Use the refresh button to see the updated status.

## Considerations for using a geo-replicated registry

* Each region in a geo-replicated registry is independent once set up. Azure Container Registry SLAs apply to each geo-replicated region.
* When you push or pull images from a geo-replicated registry, Azure Traffic Manager in the background sends the request to the registry located in the region closest to you.
* After you push an image or tag update to the closest region, it takes some time for Azure Container Registry to replicate the manifests and layers to the remaining regions you opted into. Larger images take longer to replicate than smaller ones. Images and tags are synchronized across the replication regions with an eventual consistency model.
* To manage workflows that depend on push updates to a geo-replicated registry, we recommend that you configure [webhooks](container-registry-webhook.md) to respond to the push events. You can set up regional webhooks within a geo-replicated registry to track push events as they complete across the geo-replicated regions.


## Geo-replication pricing

Geo-replication is a feature of the [Premium SKU](container-registry-skus.md) of Azure Container Registry. When you replicate a registry to your desired regions, you incur Premium registry fees for each region.

In the preceding example, Contoso consolidated two registries down to one, adding replicas to East US, Canada Central, and West Europe. Contoso would pay four times Premium per month, with no additional configuration or management. Each region now pulls their images locally, improving performance, reliability without network egress fees from West US to Canada and East US.

Check out the three-part tutorial series, [Geo-replication in Azure Container Registry](container-registry-tutorial-prepare-registry.md). Walk through creating a geo-replicated registry, building a container, and then deploying it with a single `docker push` command to multiple regional Web Apps for Containers instances.
