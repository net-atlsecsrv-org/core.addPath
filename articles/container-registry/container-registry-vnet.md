# Restrict access to a container registry using a service endpoint in an Azure virtual network

[Azure Virtual Network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) provides secure, private networking for your Azure and on-premises resources. A [service endpoint](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) allows you to secure your container registry's public IP address to only your virtual network. This endpoint gives traffic an optimal route to the resource over the Azure backbone network. The identities of the virtual network and the subnet are also transmitted with each request.

This article shows how to configure a container registry service endpoint (preview) in a virtual network. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Container Registry now supports [Azure Private Link](container-registry-private-link.md), enabling private endpoints from a virtual network to be placed on a registry. Private endpoints are accessible from within the virtual network, using private IP addresses. We recommend using private endpoints instead of service endpoints in most network scenarios.

Configuring a registry service endpoint is available in the **Premium** container registry service tier. For information about registry service tiers and limits, see [Azure Container Registry service tiers](container-registry-skus.md).

## Preview limitations

* Future development of service endpoints for Azure Container Registry isn't currently planned. We recommend using [private endpoints](container-registry-private-link.md) instead.
* You can't use the Azure portal to configure service endpoints on a registry.
* Only an [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks/intro-kubernetes.md) cluster or Azure [virtual machine](../virtual-machines/linux/overview.md) can be used as a host to access a container registry using a service endpoint. *Other Azure services including Azure Container Instances aren't supported.*
* Each registry supports a maximum of 100 network access rules.
* Service endpoints for Azure Container Registry aren't supported in the Azure US Government cloud or Azure China cloud.

## Prerequisites

* To use the Azure CLI steps in this article, Azure CLI version 2.0.58 or later is required. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

* If you don't already have a container registry, create one (Premium tier required) and push a sample image such as `hello-world` from Docker Hub. For example, use the [Azure portal][quickstart-portal] or the [Azure CLI][quickstart-cli] to create a registry. 

* If you want to restrict registry access using a service endpoint in a different Azure subscription, register the resource provider for Azure Container Registry in that subscription. For example:

  ```azurecli
  az account set --subscription <Name or ID of subscription of virtual network>

  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
  ```

## Configure network access for registry

In this section, configure your container registry to allow access from a subnet in an Azure virtual network. Equivalent steps using the Azure CLI and Azure portal are provided.

### Allow access from a virtual network - CLI

#### Add a service endpoint to a subnet

When you create a VM, Azure by default creates a virtual network in the same resource group. The name of the virtual network is based on the name of the virtual machine. For example, if you name your virtual machine *myDockerVM*, the default virtual network name is *myDockerVMVNET*, with a subnet named *myDockerVMSubnet*. Verify this in the Azure portal or by using the [az network vnet list][az-network-vnet-list] command:

```azurecli
az network vnet list \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --query "[].{Name: name, Subnet: subnets[0].name}"
```

Output:

```console
[
  {
    "Name": "myDockerVMVNET",
    "Subnet": "myDockerVMSubnet"
  }
]
```

Use the [az network vnet subnet update][az-network-vnet-subnet-update] command to add a **Microsoft.ContainerRegistry** service endpoint to your subnet. Substitute the names of your virtual network and subnet in the following command:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet update \
  --name myDockerVMSubnet \
  --vnet-name myDockerVMVNET \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
```

Use the [az network vnet subnet show][az-network-vnet-subnet-show] command to retrieve the resource ID of the subnet. You need this in a later step to configure a network access rule.

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet show \
  --name myDockerVMSubnet \
  --vnet-name myDockerVMVNET \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --query "id"
  --output tsv
``` 

Output:

```
/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myDockerVMVNET/subnets/myDockerVMSubnet
```

#### Change default network access to registry

By default, an Azure container registry allows connections from hosts on any network. To limit access to a selected network, change the default action to deny access. Substitute the name of your registry in the following [az acr update][az-acr-update] command:

```azurecli
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --default-action Deny
```

#### Add network rule to registry

Use the [az acr network-rule add][az-acr-network-rule-add] command to add a network rule to your registry that allows access from the VM's subnet. Substitute the container registry's name and the resource ID of the subnet in the following command: 

 ```azurecli
az acr network-rule add \
  --name mycontainerregistry \
  --subnet <subnet-resource-id>
```

## Verify access to the registry

After waiting a few minutes for the configuration to update, verify that the VM can access the container registry. Make an SSH connection to your VM, and run the [az acr login][az-acr-login] command to login to your registry. 

```bash
az acr login --name mycontainerregistry
```

You can perform registry operations such as run `docker pull` to pull a sample image from the registry. Substitute an image and tag value appropriate for your registry, prefixed with the registry login server name (all lowercase):

```bash
docker pull mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1
``` 

Docker successfully pulls the image to the VM.

This example demonstrates that you can access the private container registry through the network access rule. However, the registry can't be accessed from a login host that doesn't have a network access rule configured. If you attempt to login from another host using the `az acr login` command or `docker login` command, output is similar to the following:

```Console
Error response from daemon: login attempt to https://xxxxxxx.azurecr.io/v2/ failed with status: 403 Forbidden
```

## Restore default registry access

To restore the registry to allow access by default, remove any network rules that are configured. Then set the default action to allow access. Equivalent steps using the Azure CLI and Azure portal are provided.

### Restore default registry access - CLI

#### Remove network rules

To see a list of network rules configured for your registry, run the following [az acr network-rule list][az-acr-network-rule-list] command:

```azurecli
az acr network-rule list --name mycontainerregistry 
```

For each rule that is configured, run the [az acr network-rule remove][az-acr-network-rule-remove] command to remove it. For example:

```azurecli
# Remove a rule that allows access for a subnet. Substitute the subnet resource ID.

az acr network-rule remove \
  --name mycontainerregistry \
  --subnet /subscriptions/ \
  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myDockerVMVNET/subnets/myDockerVMSubnet
```

#### Allow access

Substitute the name of your registry in the following [az acr update][az-acr-update] command:
```azurecli
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --default-action Allow
```

## Clean up resources

If you created all the Azure resources in the same resource group and no longer need them, you can optionally delete the resources by using a single [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) command:

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

To clean up your resources in the portal, navigate to the myResourceGroup resource group. Once the resource group is loaded, click on **Delete resource group** to remove the resource group and the resources stored there.

## Next steps

* To restrict access to a registry using a private endpoint in a virtual network, see [Configure Azure Private Link for an Azure container registry](container-registry-private-link.md).
* If you need to set up registry access rules from behind a client firewall, see [Configure rules to access an Azure container registry behind a firewall](container-registry-firewall-access-rules.md).
