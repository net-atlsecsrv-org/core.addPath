# External authentication in an ACR task using an Azure-managed identity 

In an [ACR task](container-registry-tasks-overview.md), you can [enable a managed identity for Azure resources](container-registry-tasks-authentication-managed-identity.md). The task can use the identity to access other Azure resources, without needing to provide or manage credentials. 

In this article, you learn how to enable a managed identity in a task that accesses secrets stored in an Azure key vault. 

To create the Azure resources, this article requires that you run the Azure CLI version 2.0.68 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

## Scenario overview

The example task reads Docker Hub credentials stored in an Azure key vault. The credentials are for a Docker Hub account with write (push) permissions to a private repository in Docker Hub. To read the credentials, you configure the task with a managed identity and assign appropriate permissions to it. The task associated with the identity builds an image, and signs into Docker Hub to push the image to the private repo. 

This example shows steps using either a user-assigned or system-assigned managed identity. Your choice of identity depends on your organization's needs.

In a real-world scenario, a company might publish images to a private repo in Docker Hub as part of a build process. 

## Prerequisites

You need an Azure container registry in which you run the task. In this article, this registry is named *myregistry*. Replace with your own registry name in later steps.

If you don't already have an Azure container registry, see [Quickstart: Create a private container registry using the Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md). You don't need to push images to the registry yet.

You also need a private repository in Docker Hub, and a Docker Hub account with permissions to write to the repo. In this example, this repo is named *hubuser/hubrepo*. 

## Create a key vault and store secrets

First, if you need to, create a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location with the following [az group create][az-group-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Use the [az keyvault create][az-keyvault-create] command to create a key vault. Be sure to specify a unique key vault name. 

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault create --name mykeyvault --resource-group myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Store the required Docker Hub credentials in the key vault using the [az keyvault secret set][az-keyvault-secret-set] command. In these commands, the values are passed in environment variables:

```azurecli
# Store Docker Hub user name
az keyvault secret set \
  --name UserName \
  --value $USERNAME \
  --vault-name mykeyvault

# Store Docker Hub password
az keyvault secret set \
  --name Password \
  --value $PASSWORD \
  --vault-name mykeyvault
```

In a real-world scenario, secrets would likely be set and maintained in a separate process.

## Define task steps in YAML file

The steps for this example task are defined in a [YAML file](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md). Create a file named `dockerhubtask.yaml` in a local working directory and paste the following contents. Be sure to replace the key vault name in the file with the name of your key vault.

```yml
version: v1.0.0
# Replace mykeyvault with the name of your key vault
secrets:
  - id: username
    keyvault: https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/UserName
  - id: password
    keyvault: https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/Password
steps:
# Log in to Docker Hub
  - cmd: docker login --username '{{.Secrets.username}}' --password '{{.Secrets.password}}'
# Build image
  - build: -t {{.Values.PrivateRepo}}:{{.Run.ID}} https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git -f hello-world.dockerfile
# Push image to private repo in Docker Hub
  - push:
    - {{.Values.PrivateRepo}}:{{.Run.ID}}
```

The task steps do the following:

* Manage secret credentials to authenticate with Docker Hub.
* Authenticate with Docker Hub by passing the secrets to the `docker login` command.
* Build an image using a sample Dockerfile in the [Azure-Samples/acr-tasks](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git) repo.
* Push the image to the private Docker Hub repository.

## Option 1: Create task with user-assigned identity

The steps in this section create a task and enable a user-assigned identity. If you want to enable a system-assigned identity instead, see [Option 2: Create task with system-assigned identity](#option-2-create-task-with-system-assigned-identity). 

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-tasks-user-assigned-id](../../includes/container-registry-tasks-user-assigned-id.md)]

### Create task

Create the task *dockerhubtask* by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. The task runs without a source code context, and the command references the file `dockerhubtask.yaml` in the working directory. The `--assign-identity` parameter passes the resource ID of the user-assigned identity. 

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --name dockerhubtask \
  --registry myregistry \
  --context /dev/null \
  --file dockerhubtask.yaml \
  --assign-identity $resourceID
```

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-tasks-user-id-properties](../../includes/container-registry-tasks-user-id-properties.md)]

## Option 2: Create task with system-assigned identity

The steps in this section create a task and enable a system-assigned identity. If you want to enable a user-assigned identity instead, see [Option 1: Create task with user-assigned identity](#option-1-create-task-with-user-assigned-identity). 

### Create task

Create the task *dockerhubtask* by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. The task runs without a source code context, and the command references the file `dockerhubtask.yaml` in the working directory. The `--assign-identity` parameter with no value enables the system-assigned identity on the task.  

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --name dockerhubtask \
  --registry myregistry \
  --context /dev/null \
  --file dockerhubtask.yaml \
  --assign-identity 
```

[!INCLUDE [container-registry-tasks-system-id-properties](../../includes/container-registry-tasks-system-id-properties.md)]

## Grant identity access to key vault

Run the following [az keyvault set-policy][az-keyvault-set-policy] command to set an access policy on the key vault. The following example allows the identity to read secrets from the key vault. 

```azurecli
az keyvault set-policy --name mykeyvault --resource-group myResourceGroup --object-id $principalID --secret-permissions get
```

## Manually run the task

To verify that the task in which you enabled a managed identity runs successfully, manually trigger the task with the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command. The `--set` parameter is used to pass the private repo name to the task. In this example, the placeholder repo name is *hubuser/hubrepo*.

```azurecli
az acr task run --name dockerhubtask --registry myregistry --set PrivateRepo=hubuser/hubrepo 
```

When the task runs successfully, output shows successful authentication to Docker Hub, and the image is successfully built and pushed to the private repo:
