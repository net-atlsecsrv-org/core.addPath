# Persist files in Azure Cloud Shell
Cloud Shell utilizes Azure File storage to persist files across sessions. On initial start, Cloud Shell prompts you to associate a new or existing file share to persist files across sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> Bash and PowerShell share the same file share. Only one file share can be associated with automatic mounting in Cloud Shell.

## Create new storage

When you use basic settings and select only a subscription, Cloud Shell creates three resources on your behalf in the supported region that's nearest to you:
* Resource group: `cloud-shell-storage-<region>`
* Storage account: `cs<uniqueGuid>`
* File share: `cs-<user>-<domain>-com-<uniqueGuid>`

![The Subscription setting](media/persisting-shell-storage/basic-storage.png)

The file share mounts as `clouddrive` in your `$Home` directory. This is a one-time action, and the file share mounts automatically in subsequent sessions. 

The file share also contains a 5-GB image that is created for you which automatically persists data in your `$Home` directory. This applies for both Bash and PowerShell.

## Use existing resources

By using the advanced option, you can associate existing resources. When selecting a Cloud Shell region you must select a backing storage account co-located in the same region. For example, if your assigned region is West US then you must associate a file share that resides within West US as well.

When the storage setup prompt appears, select **Show advanced settings** to view additional options. The populated storage options filter for locally redundant storage (LRS),  geo-redundant storage (GRS), and zone-redundant storage (ZRS) accounts. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using GRS or ZRS storage accounts are recommended for additional resiliency for your backing file share. Which type of redundancy depends on your goals and price preference.

## Securing storage access
For security, each user should provision their own storage account.  For role-based access control (RBAC), users must have contributor access or above at the storage account level.

Cloud Shell uses an Azure File Share in a storage account, inside a specified subscription. Due to inherited permissions, users with sufficient access rights to the subscription will be able to access all the storage accounts, and file shares contained in the subscription.

Users should lock down access to their files by setting the permissions at the storage account or the subscription level.

## Supported storage regions
Associated Azure storage accounts must reside in the same region as the Cloud Shell machine that you're mounting them to. To find your current region you may run `env` in Bash and locate the variable `ACC_LOCATION`. File shares receive a 5-GB image created for you to persist your `$Home` directory.

Cloud Shell machines exist in the following regions:

|Area|Region|
|---|---|
|Americas|East US, South Central US, West US|
|Europe|North Europe, West Europe|
|Asia Pacific|India Central, Southeast Asia|

## Restrict resource creation with an Azure resource policy
Storage accounts that you create in Cloud Shell are tagged with `ms-resource-usage:azure-cloud-shell`. If you want to disallow users from creating storage accounts in Cloud Shell, create an [Azure resource policy for tags](../azure-policy/json-samples.md) that are triggered by this specific tag.

## How Cloud Shell storage works 
Cloud Shell persists files through both of the following methods: 
* Creating a disk image of your `$Home` directory to persist all contents within the directory. The disk image is saved in your specified file share as `acc_<User>.img` at `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare/.cloudconsole/acc_<User>.img`, and it automatically syncs changes. 
* Mounting your specified file share as `clouddrive` in your `$Home` directory for direct file-share interaction. `/Home/<User>/clouddrive` is mapped to `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare`.
 
> [!NOTE]
> All files in your `$Home` directory, such as SSH keys, are persisted in your user disk image, which is stored in your mounted file share. Apply best practices when you persist information in your `$Home` directory and mounted file share.

## clouddrive commands

### Use the `clouddrive` command
In Cloud Shell, you can run a command called `clouddrive`, which enables you to manually update the file share that is mounted to Cloud Shell.
![Running the "clouddrive" command](media/persisting-shell-storage/clouddrive-h.png)

### List `clouddrive`
To discover which file share is mounted as `clouddrive`, run the `df` command. 

The file path to clouddrive shows your storage account name and file share in the URL. For example, `//storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename`

```
justin@Azure:~$ df
Filesystem                                          1K-blocks   Used  Available Use% Mounted on

```

### Mount a new clouddrive

#### Prerequisites for manual mounting
You can update the file share that's associated with Cloud Shell by using the `clouddrive mount` command.

If you mount an existing file share, the storage accounts must be located in your select Cloud Shell region. Retrieve the location by running `env` and checking the `ACC_LOCATION`.

#### The `clouddrive mount` command

> [!NOTE]
> If you're mounting a new file share, a new user image is created for your `$Home` directory. Your previous `$Home` image is kept in your previous file share.

Run the `clouddrive mount` command with the following parameters:

```
clouddrive mount -s mySubscription -g myRG -n storageAccountName -f fileShareName
```

To view more details, run `clouddrive mount -h`, as shown here:

![Running the `clouddrive mount`command](media/persisting-shell-storage/mount-h.png)

### Unmount clouddrive
You can unmount a file share that's mounted to Cloud Shell at any time. Since Cloud Shell requires a mounted file share to be used, you will be prompted to create and mount another file share on the next session.

1. Run `clouddrive unmount`.
2. Acknowledge and confirm prompts.

Your file share will continue to exist unless you delete it manually. Cloud Shell will no longer search for this file share on subsequent sessions. To view more details, run `clouddrive unmount -h`, as shown here:

![Running the `clouddrive unmount`command](media/persisting-shell-storage/unmount-h.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Although running this command will not delete any resources, manually deleting a resource group, storage account, or file share that's mapped to Cloud Shell erases your `$Home` directory disk image and any files in your file share. This action cannot be undone.
## PowerShell-specific commands

### List `clouddrive` Azure file shares
The `Get-CloudDrive` cmdlet retrieves the Azure file share information currently mounted by the `clouddrive` in the Cloud Shell. <br>
![Running Get-CloudDrive](media/persisting-shell-storage-powershell/Get-Clouddrive.png)

### Unmount `clouddrive`
You can unmount an Azure file share that's mounted to Cloud Shell at any time. If the Azure file share has been removed, you will be prompted to create and mount a new Azure file share at the next session.

The `Dismount-CloudDrive` cmdlet unmounts an Azure file share from the current storage account. Dismounting the `clouddrive` terminates the current session. The user will be prompted to create and mount a new Azure file share during the next session.

[!INCLUDE [PersistingStorage-endblock](../../includes/cloud-shell-persisting-shell-storage-endblock.md)]

Note: If you need to define a function in a file and call it from the PowerShell cmdlets, then the dot operator must be included. 
For example: . .\MyFunctions.ps1
