# Pricing
Bash in Cloud Shell and PowerShell in Cloud Shell are subject to information below.

## Compute Cost
Azure Cloud Shell runs on a machine provided for free by Azure, but requires an Azure file share to use. 

## Storage Cost
Cloud Shell requires a new or existing Azure Files share to be mounted to persist files across sessions. Storage incurs regular costs.

Check [here for details on Azure Files costs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/files/).
