# Azure security baseline for Cloud Shell

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Cloud Shell. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Cloud Shell. **Controls** not applicable to Cloud Shell have been excluded.

 
To see how Cloud Shell completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Cloud Shell security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Customers may deploy Azure Cloud Shell into a customer owned Virtual Network.

When you deploy Azure Cloud Shell into a customer owned Virtual Network, you must create or use an existing virtual network. Ensure that the chosen virtual network has a network security group applied to its subnets and network access controls configured specific to your application's trusted ports and sources.

## Incident response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: 
Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: 
Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytically used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.
Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: 
Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.
