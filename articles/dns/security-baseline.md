# Azure security baseline for Azure DNS

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Microsoft Azure DNS. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure DNS. **Controls** not applicable to Azure DNS have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure DNS completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure DNS security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: The Activity Log is a platform log that Azure that provides to give insight into subscription-level events. Send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Activity Log provides insight into the operations that were performed on your Azure DNS resources at the control plane level. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your DNS zones.

Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. Alternatively, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party system information and event management solution.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allows you to manage access to Azure resources through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals, and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

In Azure DNS, there exists the DNS Zone Contributor role, as well as zone level and record set level Azure RBAC. It is also possible to build your own custom Azure roles to provide finer-grained control. Note, the private DNS zone resources use a different role name, Private DNS Zone Contributor.

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity &amp; Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you can use recommendations from Azure Security Center, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

You can also enable just-in-time access to administrative accounts using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management and Azure Resource Manager.
