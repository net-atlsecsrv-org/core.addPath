# Tutorial: Create an Azure DNS private zone using Azure PowerShell

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create your first private DNS zone and record using Azure PowerShell.

A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for a particular domain. To start hosting your domain in Azure DNS, you need to create a DNS zone for that domain name. Each DNS record for your domain is then created inside this DNS zone. To publish a private DNS zone to your virtual network, you specify the list of virtual networks that are allowed to resolve records within the zone.  These are called *resolution virtual networks*. You may also specify a virtual network for which Azure DNS maintains hostname records whenever a VM is created, changes IP, or is deleted.  This is called a *registration virtual network*.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Test the private zone

If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

If you prefer, you can complete this tutorial using [Azure CLI](private-dns-getstarted-cli.md).

<!--- ## Get the Preview PowerShell modules
These instructions assume you have already installed and signed in to Azure PowerShell, including ensuring you have the required modules for the Private Zone feature. -->

## Create the resource group

First, create a resource group to contain the DNS zone: 

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroup -name MyAzureResourceGroup -location "eastus"
```

## Create a DNS private zone

A DNS zone is created by using the `New-AzDnsZone` cmdlet with a value of *Private* for the **ZoneType** parameter. The following example creates a DNS zone called **private.contoso.com** in the resource group called **MyAzureResourceGroup** and makes the DNS zone available to the virtual network called **MyAzureVnet**.

If the **ZoneType** parameter is omitted, the zone is created as a public zone, so it is required to create a private zone. 

```azurepowershell
$backendSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name backendSubnet -AddressPrefix "10.2.0.0/24"
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myAzureVNet `
  -AddressPrefix 10.2.0.0/16 `
  -Subnet $backendSubnet

New-AzDnsZone -Name private.contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup `
   -ZoneType Private `
   -RegistrationVirtualNetworkId @($vnet.Id)
```

If you wanted to create a zone just for name resolution (no automatic hostname creation), you could use the *ResolutionVirtualNetworkId* parameter instead of the *RegistrationVirtualNetworkId* parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> You won't be able to see the automatically created hostname records. But later, you will test to ensure they exist.

### List DNS private zones

By omitting the zone name from `Get-AzDnsZone`, you can enumerate all zones in a resource group. This operation returns an array of zone objects.

```azurepowershell
Get-AzDnsZone -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
```

By omitting both the zone name and the resource group name from `Get-AzDnsZone`, you can enumerate all zones in the Azure subscription.

```azurepowershell
Get-AzDnsZone
```

## Create the test virtual machines

Now, create two virtual machines so you can test your private DNS zone:

```azurepowershell
New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "myAzureResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myVM01" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -subnetname backendSubnet `
    -VirtualNetworkName "myAzureVnet" `
    -addressprefix 10.2.0.0/24 `
    -OpenPorts 3389

New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "myAzureResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myVM02" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -subnetname backendSubnet `
    -VirtualNetworkName "myAzureVnet" `
    -addressprefix 10.2.0.0/24 `
    -OpenPorts 3389
```

This will take a few minutes to complete.

## Create an additional DNS record

You create record sets by using the `New-AzDnsRecordSet` cmdlet. The following example creates a record with the relative name **db** in the DNS Zone **private.contoso.com**, in resource group **MyAzureResourceGroup**. The fully-qualified name of the record set is **db.private.contoso.com**. The record type is "A", with IP address "10.2.0.4", and the TTL is 3600 seconds.

```azurepowershell
New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name db -RecordType A -ZoneName private.contoso.com `
   -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup -Ttl 3600 `
   -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address "10.2.0.4")
```

### View DNS records

To list the DNS records in your zone, run:

```azurepowershell
Get-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName private.contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
```
Remember, you won't see the automatically created A records for your two test virtual machines.

## Test the private zone

Now you can test the name resolution for your **private.contoso.com** private zone.

### Configure VMs to allow inbound ICMP

You can use the ping command to test name resolution. So, configure the firewall on both virtual machines to allow inbound ICMP packets.

1. Connect to myVM01, and open a Windows PowerShell window with administrator privileges.
2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule –DisplayName “Allow ICMPv4-In” –Protocol ICMPv4
   ```

Repeat for myVM02.

### Ping the VMs by name

1. From the myVM02 Windows PowerShell command prompt, ping myVM01 using the automatically registered host name:
   ```
   ping myVM01.private.contoso.com
   ```
   You should see output that looks similar to this:
   ```
   PS C:\> ping myvm01.private.contoso.com

   Pinging myvm01.private.contoso.com [10.2.0.4] with 32 bytes of data:
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

   Ping statistics for 10.2.0.4:
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
   Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
       Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 0ms
   PS C:\>
   ```
2. Now ping the **db** name you created previously:
   ```
   ping db.private.contoso.com
   ```
   You should see output that looks similar to this:
   ```
   PS C:\> ping db.private.contoso.com

   Pinging db.private.contoso.com [10.2.0.4] with 32 bytes of data:
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.2.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

   Ping statistics for 10.2.0.4:
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
   Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
       Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms
   PS C:\>
   ```

## Delete all resources

When no longer needed, delete the **MyAzureResourceGroup** resource group to delete the resources created in this tutorial.

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name MyAzureResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you deployed a private DNS zone, created a DNS record, and tested the zone.
Next, you can learn more about private DNS zones.
