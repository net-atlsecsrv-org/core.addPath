# Tutorial: Configure an alias record to refer to an Azure public IP address 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a network infrastructure.
> * Create a web server virtual machine.
> * Create an alias record.
> * Test the alias record.


If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites
You must have a domain name available that you can host in Azure DNS to test with. You must have full control of this domain. Full control includes the ability to set the name server (NS) records for the domain.

For instructions to host your domain in Azure DNS, see [Tutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS](dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md).

The example domain used for this tutorial is contoso.com, but use your own domain name.

## Create the network infrastructure
First, create a virtual network and a subnet to place your web servers in.
1. Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.
2. In the upper left in the portal, select **Create a resource**. Enter *resource group* in the search box, and create a resource group named **RG-DNS-Alias-pip**.
3. Select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Virtual network**.
4. Create a virtual network named **VNet-Server**. Place it in the **RG-DNS-Alias-pip** resource group, and name the subnet **SN-Web**.

## Create a web server virtual machine
1. Select **Create a resource** > **Windows Server 2016 VM**.
2. Enter **Web-01** for the name, and place the VM in the **RG-DNS-Alias-TM** resource group. Enter a username and password, and select **OK**.
3. For **Size**, select an SKU with 8-GB RAM.
4. For **Settings**, select the **VNet-Servers** virtual network and the **SN-Web** subnet. For public inbound ports, select **HTTP** > **HTTPS** > **RDP (3389)**, and then select **OK**.
5. On the **Summary** page, select **Create**.

This procedure takes a few minutes to finish.

### Install IIS

Install IIS on **Web-01**.

1. Connect to **Web-01**, and sign in.
2. On the **Server Manager** dashboard, select **Add roles and features**.
3. Select **Next** three times. On the **Server Roles** page, select **Web Server (IIS)**.
4. Select **Add Features**, and then select **Next**.
5. Select **Next** four times, and then select **Install**. This procedure takes a few minutes to finish.
6. After the installation finishes, select **Close**.
7. Open a web browser. Browse to **localhost** to verify that the default IIS web page appears.

## Create an alias record

Create an alias record that points to the public IP address.

1. Select your Azure DNS zone to open the zone.
2. Select **Record set**.
3. In the **Name** text box, select **web01**.
4. Leave the **Type** as an **A** record.
5. Select the **Alias Record Set** check box.
6. Select **Choose Azure service**, and then select the **Web-01-ip** public IP address.

## Test the alias record

1. In the **RG-DNS-Alias-pip** resource group, select the **Web-01** virtual machine. Note the public IP address.
1. From a web browser, browse to the fully qualified domain name for the Web01-01 virtual machine. An example is **web01.contoso.com**. You now see the IIS default web page.
2. Close the web browser.
3. Stop the **Web-01** virtual machine, and then restart it.
4. After the virtual machine restarts, note the new public IP address for the virtual machine.
5. Open a new browser. Browse again to the fully qualified domain name for the Web01-01 virtual machine. An example is **web01.contoso.com**.

This procedure succeeds because you used an alias record to point to the public IP address resource, not a standard A record.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources created for this tutorial, delete the **RG-DNS-Alias-pip** resource group.


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an alias record to refer to an Azure public IP address. To learn about Azure DNS and web apps, continue with the tutorial for web apps.
