# Delegate an Azure DNS subdomain using Azure PowerShell

You can use Azure PowerShell to delegate a DNS subdomain. For example, if you own the contoso.com domain, you can delegate a subdomain called *engineering* to another, separate zone that you can administer separately from the contoso.com zone.

If you prefer, you can delegate a subdomain using the [Azure Portal](delegate-subdomain.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Contoso.com is used as an example throughout this article. Substitute your own domain name for contoso.com.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To delegate an Azure DNS subdomain, you must first delegate your public domain to Azure DNS. See [Delegate a domain to Azure DNS](./dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md) for instructions on how to configure your name servers for delegation. Once your domain is delegated to your Azure DNS zone, you can delegate your subdomain.

## Create a zone for your subdomain

First, create the zone for the **engineering** subdomain.

`New-AzDnsZone -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Name engineering.contoso.com`

## Note the name servers

Next, note the four name servers for the engineering subdomain.

`Get-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName engineering.contoso.com -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -RecordType NS`

## Create a test record

Create an **A** record in the engineering zone to use for testing.

   `New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName engineering.contoso.com -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Name www -RecordType A -ttl 3600 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address 10.10.10.10)`.

## Create an NS record

Next, create a name server (NS) record  for the **engineering** zone in the contoso.com zone.

```azurepowershell
$Records = @()
$Records += New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Nsdname <name server 1 noted previously>
$Records += New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Nsdname <name server 2 noted previously>
$Records += New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Nsdname <name server 3 noted previously>
$Records += New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Nsdname <name server 4 noted previously>
$RecordSet = New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name engineering -RecordType NS -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -TTL 3600 -ZoneName contoso.com -DnsRecords $Records
```

## Test the delegation

Use nslookup to test the delegation.

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. At command prompt, type `nslookup www.engineering.contoso.com.`
3. You should receive a non-authoritative answer showing the address **10.10.10.10**.
