# How to manage DNS Zones in the Azure portal

This article shows you how to manage your DNS zones by using the Azure portal. You can also manage your DNS zones using the cross-platform [Azure CLI](dns-operations-dnszones-cli.md) or the Azure [PowerShell](dns-operations-dnszones.md).

## Create a DNS zone

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, select **Create a resource** and search for **DNS zone**. Then select **Create**.

1. On the **Create DNS zone** page enter the following values, then select **Create**:

    | Setting | Details |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Subscription** | Select a subscription to create the DNS zone in.|
    | **Resource group** | Select or create a new resource group. To learn more about resource groups, read the [Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fdns%2ftoc.json#resource-groups) overview article.|
    | **Name** | Enter a name for the DNS zone. For example: **contoso.com**. |
    | **Location** | Select the location for the resource group. The location will already be selected if you're using a previously created resource group.  |

> [!NOTE]
> The resource group refers to the location of the resource group, and has no impact on the DNS zone. The DNS zone location is always "global", and is not shown.

## List DNS zones

In the search resources at the top of the Azure portal, search for **DNS zones**. Each DNS zone is its own resource. Information such as number of record-sets and name servers are viewable from this page. The column **Name servers** isn't in the default view. To add it, select **Managed view > Edit columns > + Add Column**, then from the drop-down select **Name servers**. Select **Save** to apply the new column.

## Delete a DNS zone

Navigate to a DNS zone in the portal. On the selected **DNS zone** overview page, select **Delete zone**. You're then prompted to confirm that you want to delete the DNS zone. Deleting a DNS zone also deletes all records that are contained in the zone.
