# Quickstart: Azure Key Vault client library for Node.js (v4)

Get started with the Azure Key Vault client library for Node.js. Follow the steps below to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

Azure Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. Use the Key Vault client library for Node.js to:

- Increase security and control over keys and passwords.
- Create and import encryption keys in minutes.
- Reduce latency with cloud scale and global redundancy.
- Simplify and automate tasks for TLS/SSL certificates.
- Use FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.

[API reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/key-vault?view=azure-node-latest) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/keyvault) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/keyvault-secrets)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Current [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for your operating system.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview)

This quickstart assumes you are running [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) in a Linux terminal window.

## Setting up

### Install the package

From the console window, install the Azure Key Vault secrets library for Node.js.

```console
npm install @azure/keyvault-secrets
```

For this quickstart, you will need to install the azure.identity package as well:

```console
npm install @azure/identity
```

### Create a resource group and key vault

This quickstart uses a pre-created Azure key vault. You can create a key vault by following the steps in the [Azure CLI quickstart](quick-create-cli.md), [Azure PowerShell quickstart](quick-create-powershell.md), or [Azure portal quickstart](quick-create-portal.md). Alternatively, you can simply run the Azure CLI commands below.

> [!Important]
> Each key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.

```azurecli
az group create --name "myResourceGroup" -l "EastUS"

az keyvault create --name <your-unique-keyvault-name> -g "myResourceGroup"
```

### Create a service principal

The simplest way to authenticate an cloud-based application is with a managed identity; see [Use an App Service managed identity to access Azure Key Vault](../general/managed-identity.md) for details. For the sake of simplicity however, this quickstarts creates a console application. Authenticating a desktop application with Azure requires the use of a service principal and an access control policy.

Create a service principle using the Azure CLI [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command:

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://mySP" --sdk-auth
```

This operation will return a series of key / value pairs. 

```azurecli
{
  "clientId": "7da18cae-779c-41fc-992e-0527854c6583",
  "clientSecret": "b421b443-1669-4cd7-b5b1-394d5c945002",
  "subscriptionId": "443e30da-feca-47c4-b68f-1636b75e16b3",
  "tenantId": "35ad10f1-7799-4766-9acf-f2d946161b77",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

Take note of the clientId and clientSecret, as we will use them in the [Set environmental variable](#set-environmental-variables) step below.

#### Give the service principal access to your key vault

Create an access policy for your key vault that grants permission to your service principal by passing the clientId to the [az keyvault set-policy](/cli/azure/keyvault?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-set-policy) command. Give the service principal get, list, and set permissions for both keys and secrets.

```azurecli
az keyvault set-policy -n <your-unique-keyvault-name> --spn <clientId-of-your-service-principal> --secret-permissions delete get list set --key-permissions create decrypt delete encrypt get list unwrapKey wrapKey
```

#### Set environmental variables

The DefaultAzureCredential method in our application relies on three environmental variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`. Set these variables to the clientId, clientSecret, and tenantId values you noted in the [Create a service principal](#create-a-service-principal) step using the `export VARNAME=VALUE` format. (This only sets the variables for your current shell and processes created from the shell; to permanently add these variables to your environment, edit your `/etc/environment ` file.) 

You will also need to save your key vault name as an environment variable called `KEY_VAULT_NAME`.

```console
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-clientID>

export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-clientSecret>

export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenantId>

export KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
````

## Object model

The Azure Key Vault client library for Node.js allows you to manage keys and related assets such as certificates and secrets. The code samples below will show you how to create a client, set a secret, retrieve a secret, and delete a secret.

The entire console app is available at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/key-vault-dotnet-core-quickstart/tree/master/key-vault-console-app.

## Code examples

### Add directives

Add the following directives to the top of your code:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");
```

### Authenticate and create a client

Authenticating to your key vault and creating a key vault client depends on the environmental variables from the [Set environmental variables](#set-environmental-variables) step above, and the [SecretClient constructor](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?view=azure-node-latest#secretclient-string--tokencredential--pipelineoptions-). 

The name of your key vault is expanded to the key vault URI, in the format `https://<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net`. 

```javascript
const keyVaultName = process.env["KEY_VAULT_NAME"];
const KVUri = "https://" + keyVaultName + ".vault.azure.net";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const client = new SecretClient(KVUri, credential);
```

### Save a secret

Now that your application is authenticated, you can put a secret into your keyvault using the [client.setSecret method](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?view=azure-node-latest#setsecret-string--string--setsecretoptions-) This requires a name for the secret -- we're using "mySecret" in this sample.  

```javascript
await client.setSecret(secretName, secretValue);
```

You can verify that the secret has been set with the [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-secret-show) command:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <your-unique-keyvault-name> --name mySecret
```

### Retrieve a secret

You can now retrieve the previously set value with the [client.getSecret method](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?view=azure-node-latest#getsecret-string--getsecretoptions-).

```javascript
const retrievedSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName);
 ```

Your secret is now saved as `retrievedSecret.value`.

### Delete a secret

Finally, let's delete the secret from your key vault with the [client.beginDeleteSecret method](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?view=azure-node-latest#begindeletesecret-string--begindeletesecretoptions-).

```javascript
await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName)
```

You can verify that the secret is gone with the [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-secret-show) command:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <your-unique-keyvault-name> --name mySecret
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to remove your key vault and the corresponding  resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete -g "myResourceGroup"
```

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
```

## Sample code

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const readline = require('readline');

function askQuestion(query) {
    const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout,
    });

    return new Promise(resolve => rl.question(query, ans => {
        rl.close();
        resolve(ans);
    }))
}

async function main() {

  const keyVaultName = process.env["KEY_VAULT_NAME"];
  const KVUri = "https://" + keyVaultName + ".vault.azure.net";

  const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
  const client = new SecretClient(KVUri, credential);

  const secretName = "mySecret";
  var secretValue = await askQuestion("Input the value of your secret > ");

  console.log("Creating a secret in " + keyVaultName + " called '" + secretName + "' with the value '" + secretValue + "` ...");
  await client.setSecret(secretName, secretValue);

  console.log("Done.");

  console.log("Forgetting your secret.");
  secretValue = "";
  console.log("Your secret is '" + secretValue + "'.");

  console.log("Retrieving your secret from " + keyVaultName + ".");

  const retrievedSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName);

  console.log("Your secret is '" + retrievedSecret.value + "'.");
  console.log("Deleting your secret from " + keyVaultName + " ...");

  await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);

  console.log("Done.");

}

main()

```
