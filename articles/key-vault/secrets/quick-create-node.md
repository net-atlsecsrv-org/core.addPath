# Quickstart: Azure Key Vault client library for JavaScript (v4)

Get started with the Azure Key Vault secret client library for JavaScript. Follow the steps below to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

[API reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/key-vault-index) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/keyvault) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/keyvault-secrets)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Current [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for your operating system.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

This quickstart assumes you are running [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) in a Linux terminal window.

## Setting up
This quickstart is using Azure Identity library with Azure CLI to authenticate user to Azure Services. Developers can also use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to authenticate their calls, for more information, see [Authenticate the client with Azure Identity client library](/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

### Sign in to Azure

1. Run the `login` command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    ```

    If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.

    Otherwise, open a browser page at [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter the
    authorization code displayed in your terminal.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

### Install the package

From the console window, install the Azure Key Vault secrets library for Node.js.

```console
npm install @azure/keyvault-secrets
```

For this quickstart, you will need to install the azure.identity package as well:

```console
npm install @azure/identity
```

### Create a resource group and key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group and key vault](../../../includes/key-vault-rg-kv-creation.md)]

#### Grant access to your key vault

Create an access policy for your key vault that grants secret permission to your user account.

```console
az keyvault set-policy --name <YourKeyVaultName> --upn user@domain.com --secret-permissions delete get list set
```

#### Set environment variables

This application is using key vault name as an environment variable called `KEY_VAULT_NAME`.

Windows
```cmd
set KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
````
Windows PowerShell
```powershell
$Env:KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
```

macOS or Linux
```cmd
export KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
```

## Object model

The Azure Key Vault secret client library for JavaScript allows you to manage secrets. The code samples below will show you how to create a client, set a secret, retrieve a secret, and delete a secret.

## Code examples

### Add directives

Add the following directives to the top of your code:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");
```

### Authenticate and create a client

In this quickstart, logged in user is used to authenticate to key vault, which is preferred method for local development. For applications deployed to Azure, managed identity should be assigned to App Service or Virtual Machine, for more information, see [Managed Identity Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

In below example, the name of your key vault is expanded to the key vault URI, in the format "https://\<your-key-vault-name\>.vault.azure.net". This example is using  ['DefaultAzureCredential()'](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/identity/defaultazurecredential) class, which allows to use the same code across different environments with different options to provide identity. For more information, see [Default Azure Credential Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme). 

```javascript
const keyVaultName = process.env["KEY_VAULT_NAME"];
const KVUri = "https://" + keyVaultName + ".vault.azure.net";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const client = new SecretClient(KVUri, credential);
```

### Save a secret

Now that your application is authenticated, you can put a secret into your keyvault using the [client.setSecret method](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?#setsecret-string--string--setsecretoptions-) This requires a name for the secret - we're using "mySecret" in this sample.  

```javascript
await client.setSecret(secretName, secretValue);
```

You can verify that the secret has been set with the [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?#az-keyvault-secret-show) command:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <your-unique-keyvault-name> --name mySecret
```

### Retrieve a secret

You can now retrieve the previously set value with the [client.getSecret method](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?#getsecret-string--getsecretoptions-).

```javascript
const retrievedSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName);
 ```

Your secret is now saved as `retrievedSecret.value`.

### Delete a secret

Finally, let's delete the secret from your key vault with the [client.beginDeleteSecret method](/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-secrets/secretclient?#begindeletesecret-string--begindeletesecretoptions-).

```javascript
await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName)
```

You can verify that the secret is gone with the [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?#az-keyvault-secret-show) command:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <your-unique-keyvault-name> --name mySecret
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to remove your key vault and the corresponding  resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete -g "myResourceGroup"
```

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
```

## Sample code

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const readline = require('readline');

function askQuestion(query) {
    const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout,
    });

    return new Promise(resolve => rl.question(query, ans => {
        rl.close();
        resolve(ans);
    }))
}

async function main() {

  const keyVaultName = process.env["KEY_VAULT_NAME"];
  const KVUri = "https://" + keyVaultName + ".vault.azure.net";

  const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
  const client = new SecretClient(KVUri, credential);

  const secretName = "mySecret";
  var secretValue = await askQuestion("Input the value of your secret > ");

  console.log("Creating a secret in " + keyVaultName + " called '" + secretName + "' with the value '" + secretValue + "` ...");
  await client.setSecret(secretName, secretValue);

  console.log("Done.");

  console.log("Forgetting your secret.");
  secretValue = "";
  console.log("Your secret is '" + secretValue + "'.");

  console.log("Retrieving your secret from " + keyVaultName + ".");

  const retrievedSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName);

  console.log("Your secret is '" + retrievedSecret.value + "'.");
  console.log("Deleting your secret from " + keyVaultName + " ...");

  await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);

  console.log("Done.");

}

main()

```
