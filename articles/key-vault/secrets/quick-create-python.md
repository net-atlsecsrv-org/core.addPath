# Quickstart: Azure Key Vault secrets client library for Python

Get started with the Azure Key Vault client library for Python. Follow the steps below to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

Azure Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. Use the Key Vault client library for Python to:

- Increase security and control over keys and passwords.
- Create and import encryption keys in minutes.
- Reduce latency with cloud scale and global redundancy.
- Simplify and automate tasks for TLS/SSL certificates.
- Use FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.

[API reference documentation](/python/api/overview/azure/keyvault-secrets-readme?view=azure-python) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/keyvault) | [Package (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault/)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Python 2.7, 3.5.3, or later
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/)

This quickstart assumes you are running [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) in a Linux terminal window.

## Setting up

### Install the package

From the console window, install the Azure Key Vault secrets library for Python.

```console
pip install azure-keyvault-secrets
```

For this quickstart, you will need to install the azure.identity package as well:

```console
pip install azure.identity
```

### Create a resource group and key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group and key vault](../../../includes/key-vault-rg-kv-creation.md)]

### Create a service principal

[!INCLUDE [Create a service principal](../../../includes/key-vault-sp-creation.md)]

#### Give the service principal access to your key vault

[!INCLUDE [Give the service principal access to your key vault](../../../includes/key-vault-sp-kv-access.md)]

#### Set environmental variables

[!INCLUDE [Set environmental variables](../../../includes/key-vault-set-environmental-variables.md)]

## Object model

The Azure Key Vault client library for Python allows you to manage keys and related assets such as certificates and secrets. The code samples below will show you how to create a client, set a secret, retrieve a secret, and delete a secret.

The entire console app is available at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/key-vault-dotnet-core-quickstart/tree/master/key-vault-console-app.

## Code examples

### Add directives

Add the following directives to the top of your code:

```python
import os
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
```

### Authenticate and create a client

Authenticating to your key vault and creating a key vault client depends on the environmental variables in the [Set environmental variables](#set-environmental-variables) step above. The name of your key vault is expanded to the key vault URI, in the format "https://<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net".

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = SecretClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)
```

### Save a secret

Now that your application is authenticated, you can put a secret into your keyvault using the client.SetSecret method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.keyvault.keyvaultclientextensions.setsecretasync) This requires a name for the secret -- we're using "mySecret" in this sample.  

```python
client.set_secret(secretName, secretValue)
```

You can verify that the secret has been set with the [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-secret-show) command:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <your-unique-keyvault-name> --name mySecret
```

### Retrieve a secret

You can now retrieve the previously set value with the [client.GetSecret method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.keyvault.keyvaultclientextensions.getsecretasync).

```python
retrieved_secret = client.get_secret(secretName)
 ```

Your secret is now saved as `retrieved_secret.value`.

### Delete a secret

Finally, let's delete the secret from your key vault with the [client.DeleteSecret method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.keyvault.keyvaultclientextensions.getsecretasync).

```python
client.delete_secret(secretName)
```

You can verify that the secret is gone with the [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-secret-show) command:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <your-unique-keyvault-name> --name mySecret
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to remove your key vault and the corresponding  resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete -g "myResourceGroup"
```

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
```

## Sample code

```python
import os
import cmd
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

keyVaultName = os.environ["KEY_VAULT_NAME"]
KVUri = f"https://{keyVaultName}.vault.azure.net"

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)

secretName = "mySecret"

print("Input the value of your secret > ")
secretValue = raw_input()

print(f"Creating a secret in {keyVaultName} called '{secretName}' with the value '{secretValue}` ...")

client.set_secret(secretName, secretValue)

print(" done.")

print("Forgetting your secret.")
secretValue = ""
print(f"Your secret is {secretValue}.")

print(f"Retrieving your secret from {keyVaultName}.")

retrieved_secret = client.get_secret(secretName)

print(f"Your secret is '{retrieved_secret.value}'.")
print(f"Deleting your secret from {keyVaultName} ...")

client.delete_secret(secretName)

print(" done.")
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart you created a key vault, stored a secret, and retrieved that secret. To learn more about Key Vault and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to the articles below.
