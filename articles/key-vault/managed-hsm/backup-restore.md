# Full backup and restore

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available for resource type managed HSM.

Managed HSM supports creating a full backup of the entire contents of the HSM including all keys, versions, attributes, tags, and role assignments. The backup is encrypted with cryptographic keys associated with the HSM's security domain.

Backup is a data plane operation. The caller initiating the backup operation must have permission to perform dataAction **Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/backup/start/action**.

Only following built-in roles have permission to perform full backup:
- Managed HSM Administrator
- Managed HSM Backup

You must provide following information to execute a full backup:
- HSM name or URL
- Storage account name
- Storage account blob storage container
- Storage container SAS token with permissions `crdw`

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Full backup

Backup is a long running operation but will immediately return a Job ID. You can check the status of backup process using this Job ID. The backup process creates a folder inside the designated container with a following naming pattern **`mhsm-{HSM_NAME}-{YYYY}{MM}{DD}{HH}{mm}{SS}`**, where HSM_NAME is the name of managed HSM being backed up and YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, mm, SS are the year, month, date, hour, minutes, and seconds of date/time in UTC when the backup command was received.

While the backup is in progress, the HSM may not operate at full throughput as some HSM partitions will be busy performing the backup operation.

```azurecli-interactive
# time for 30 minutes later for SAS token expiry

end=$(date -u -d "30 minutes" '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ')

# Get storage account key

skey=$(az storage account keys list --query '[0].value' -o tsv --account-name mhsmdemobackup --subscription a1ba9aaa-b7f6-4a33-b038-6e64553a6c7b)

# Create a container

az storage container create --account-name  mhsmdemobackup --name mhsmdemobackupcontainer  --account-key $skey

# Generate a container sas token

sas=$(az storage container generate-sas -n mhsmdemobackupcontainer --account-name mhsmdemobackup --permissions crdw --expiry $end --account-key $skey -o tsv --subscription a1ba9aaa-b7f6-4a33-b038-6e64553a6c7b)

# Backup HSM

az keyvault backup start --hsm-name mhsmdemo2 --storage-account-name mhsmdemobackup --blob-container-name mhsmdemobackupcontainer --storage-container-SAS-token $sas --subscription 361da5d4-a47a-4c79-afdd-d66f684f4070
```

## Full restore

Full restore allows you to completely restore the contents of the HSM with a previous backup, including all keys, versions, attributes, tags, and role assignments. Everything currently stored in the HSM will be wiped out, and it will return to the same state it was in when the source backup was created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Full restore is a very destructive and disruptive operation. Therefore it is mandatory to have completed a full backup within last 30 minutes before a `restore` operation can be performed.

Restore is a data plane operation. The caller starting the restore operation must have permission to perform dataAction **Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/restore/start/action**. The source HSM where the backup was created and the destination HSM where the restore will be performed **must** have the same Security Domain. See more [about Managed HSM Security Domain](security-domain.md).

You must provide the following information to execute a full restore:
- HSM name or URL
- Storage account name
- Storage account blob container
- Storage container SAS token with permissions `rl`
- Storage container folder name where the source backup is store

Restore is a long running operation but will immediately return a Job ID. You can check the status of the restore process using this Job ID. When the restore process is in progress, the HSM enters a restore mode and all data plane command (except check restore status) are disabled.

```azurecli-interactive
#### time for 30 minutes later for SAS token expiry

end=$(date -u -d "30 minutes" '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ')

# Get storage account key

skey=$(az storage account keys list --query '[0].value' -o tsv --account-name mhsmdemobackup --subscription a1ba9aaa-b7f6-4a33-b038-6e64553a6c7b)

# Generate a container sas token

sas=$(az storage container generate-sas -n mhsmdemobackupcontainer --account-name mhsmdemobackup --permissions rl --expiry $end --account-key $skey -o tsv --subscription a1ba9aaa-b7f6-4a33-b038-6e64553a6c7b)
```

## Backup HSM

```
az keyvault restore start --hsm-name mhsmdemo2 --storage-account-name mhsmdemobackup --blob-container-name mhsmdemobackupcontainer --storage-container-SAS-token $sas --backup-folder mhsm-mhsmdemo-2020083120161860
```
