# Managed HSM local RBAC built-in roles

Managed HSM local RBAC has several built-in roles that you can assign to users, service principals, groups, and managed identities. To allow a principal to perform an operation you must assign them a role that grants them permission to perform that operations. All these roles and operations only allow you to manage permission for data plane operations. To manage control plane permissions for the Managed HSM resource (such as create a new managed HSM or update, move, delete an existing one), you must use [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md).

## Permitted operations
> [!NOTE]  
> - An 'X' indicates that a role is allowed to perform the data action. Empty cell indicates the role does not have pemission to perform that data action.
> - All the data action names have a 'Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm' prefix, which is omitted in the tables below for brevity.
> - All role names have a prefix "Managed HSM" which is omitted in the below table for brevity.
