# Export certificates from Azure Key Vault

Learn how to export certificates from Azure Key Vault. You can export certificates by using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal. You can also use the Azure portal to export Azure App Service certificates.

## About Azure Key Vault certificates

Azure Key Vault allows you to easily provision, manage, and deploy digital certificates for your network. It also enables secure communications for applications. See [Azure Key Vault certificates](./about-certificates.md) for more information.

### Composition of a certificate

When a Key Vault certificate is created, an addressable *key* and *secret* are created that have the same name. The Key Vault key allows key operations. The Key Vault secret allows retrieval of the certificate value as a secret. A Key Vault certificate also contains public x509 certificate metadata. Go to [Composition of a certificate](./about-certificates.md#composition-of-a-certificate) for more information.

### Exportable and non-exportable keys

After a Key Vault certificate is created, you can retrieve it from the addressable secret with the private key. Retrieve the certificate in PFX or PEM format.

- **Exportable**: The policy used to create the certificate indicates the key is exportable.
- **Non-exportable**: The policy used to create the certificate indicates the key is non-exportable. In this case, the private key isn't part of the value when it's retrieved as a secret.

Supported keytypes: RSA, RSA-HSM, EC, EC-HSM, oct (listed [here](/rest/api/keyvault/createcertificate/createcertificate#jsonwebkeytype))
Exportable is only allowed with RSA, EC. HSM keys would be non-exportable.

See [About Azure Key Vault certificates](./about-certificates.md#exportable-or-non-exportable-key) for more information.

## Export stored certificates

You can export stored certificates in Azure Key Vault by using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Only require a certificate password when you import the certificate in the key vault. Key Vault doesn't save the associated password. When you export the certificate, the password is blank.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the following command in the Azure CLI to download the **public portion** of a Key Vault certificate.

```azurecli
az keyvault certificate download --file
                                 [--encoding {DER, PEM}]
                                 [--id]
                                 [--name]
                                 [--subscription]
                                 [--vault-name]
                                 [--version]
```

View [examples and parameter definitions](/cli/azure/keyvault/certificate?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-certificate-download) for more information.

Downloading as certificate means getting the public portion. If you want both the private key and public metadata then you can download it as secret.

```azurecli
az keyvault secret download -â€“file {nameofcert.pfx}
                            [--encoding {ascii, base64, hex, utf-16be, utf-16le, utf-8}]
                            [--id]
                            [--name]
                            [--subscription]
                            [--vault-name]
                            [--version]
```

For more information, see [parameter definitions](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-secret-download).

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use this command in Azure PowerShell to get the certificate named **TestCert01** from the key vault named **ContosoKV01**. To download the certificate as a PFX file, run following command. These commands access **SecretId**, and then save the content as a PFX file.

```azurepowershell
$cert = Get-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName "ContosoKV01" -Name "TestCert01"
$secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName "ContosoKV01" -Name $cert.Name
$secretValueText = '';
$ssPtr = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($secret.SecretValue)
try {
    $secretValueText = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringBSTR($ssPtr)
} finally {
    [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ZeroFreeBSTR($ssPtr)
}
$secretByte = [Convert]::FromBase64String($secretValueText)
$x509Cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
$x509Cert.Import($secretByte, "", "Exportable,PersistKeySet")
$type = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ContentType]::Pfx
$pfxFileByte = $x509Cert.Export($type, $password)

# Write to a file
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("KeyVault.pfx", $pfxFileByte)
```

This command exports the entire chain of certificates with private key. The certificate is password protected.
For more information on the **Get-AzKeyVaultCertificate** command and parameters, see [Get-AzKeyVaultCertificate - Example 2](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/Get-AzKeyVaultCertificate?view=azps-4.4.0).

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

On the Azure portal, after you create/import a certificate on the **Certificate** blade, you get a notification that the certificate is successfully created. Select the certificate and the current version to see the option to download.

To download the certificate, select **Download in CER format** or **Download in PFX/PEM format**.

**Export Azure App Service certificates**

Azure App Service certificates are a convenient way to purchase SSL certificates. You can assign them to Azure Apps from within the portal. You can also export these certificates from the portal as PFX files to be used elsewhere. After you import them, the App Service certificates are located under **secrets**.

For more information, see the steps to [export Azure App Service certificates](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/37431.exporting-azure-app-service-certificates.aspx).
