# Azure Key Vault Developer's Guide

Key Vault allows you to securely access sensitive information from within your applications:

- Keys and secrets are protected without having to write the code yourself and you are easily able to use them from your applications.
- You are able to have your customers own and manage their own keys so you can concentrate on providing the core software features. In this way, your applications will not own the responsibility or potential liability for your customers' tenant keys and secrets.
- Your application can use keys for signing and encryption yet keeps the key management external from your application, allowing your solution to be suitable as a geographically distributed app.
- Manage Key Vault certificates. For more information, see [About keys, secrets, and certificates](about-keys-secrets-and-certificates.md).

For more general information on Azure Key Vault, see [What is Key Vault](key-vault-overview.md).

## Public Previews

Periodically, we release a public preview of a new Key Vault feature. Try out these and let us know what you think via azurekeyvault@microsoft.com, our feedback email address.

## Creating and Managing Key Vaults

Azure Key Vault provides a way to securely store credentials and other keys and secrets, but your code needs to authenticate to Key Vault to retrieve them. Managed identities for Azure resources makes solving this problem simpler by giving Azure services an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without having any credentials in your code. 

For more information on managed identities for Azure resources, see [the managed identities overview](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). For more information on working with AAD, see [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications.md).

Before working with keys, secrets or certificates in your key vault, you'll create and manage your key vault through CLI, PowerShell, Resource Manager Templates or REST, as described in the following articles:

- [Create and manage Key Vaults with CLI](quick-create-cli.md)

## Coding with Key Vault

The Key Vault management system for programmers consists of several interfaces. This section contains links to all of the languages as well as some code examples. 

### Supported programming and scripting languages

#### REST

All of your Key Vault resources are accessible through the REST interface; vaults, keys, secrets, etc. 

[Key Vault REST API Reference](/rest/api/keyvault/).

#### .NET

[.NET API reference for Key Vault](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/key-vault?view=azure-dotnet).

For more information on the 2.x version of the .NET SDK, see the [Release notes](key-vault-dotnet2api-release-notes.md).

#### Java

## How-tos

The following articles and scenarios provide task-specific guidance for working with Azure Key Vault:

- [Change key vault tenant ID after subscription move](key-vault-subscription-move-fix.md) - When you move your Azure subscription from tenant A to tenant B, your existing key vaults are inaccessible by the principals (users and applications) in tenant B. Fix this using this guide.
- [Accessing Key Vault behind firewall](key-vault-access-behind-firewall.md) - To access a key vault your key vault client application needs to be able to access multiple end-points for various functionalities.
- [How to Generate and Transfer HSM-Protected Keys for Azure Key Vault](key-vault-hsm-protected-keys.md) - This will help you plan for, generate and then transfer your own HSM-protected keys to use with Azure Key Vault.
- [How to pass secure values (such as passwords) during deployment](../azure-resource-manager/templates/key-vault-parameter.md) - When you need to pass a secure value (like a password) as a parameter during deployment, you can store that value as a secret in an Azure Key Vault and reference the value in other Resource Manager templates.
- [How to use Key Vault for extensible key management with SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn198405.aspx) - The SQL Server Connector for Azure Key Vault enables SQL Server and SQL-in-a-VM to leverage the Azure Key Vault service as an Extensible Key Management (EKM) provider to protect its encryption keys for applications link; Transparent Data Encryption, Backup Encryption, and Column Level Encryption.

## Integrated with Key Vault

These articles are about other scenarios and services that use or integrate with Key Vault.

- [Azure Disk Encryption](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md) leverages the industry standard [BitLocker](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc732774.aspx) feature of Windows and the [DM-Crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt) feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and the data disks. The solution is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets in your key vault subscription, while ensuring that all data in the virtual machine disks are encrypted at rest in your Azure storage.
- [Azure Data Lake Store](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal.md) provides option for encryption of data that is stored in the account. For key management, Data Lake Store provides two modes for managing your master encryption keys (MEKs), which are required for decrypting any data that is stored in the Data Lake Store. You can either let Data Lake Store manage the MEKs for you, or choose to retain ownership of the MEKs using your Azure Key Vault account. You specify the mode of key management while creating a Data Lake Store account.
- [Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/plan-implement-tenant-key) allows you to manager your own tenant key. For example, instead of Microsoft managing your tenant key (the default), you can manage your own tenant key to comply with specific regulations that apply to your organization. Managing your own tenant key is also referred to as bring your own key, or BYOK.
