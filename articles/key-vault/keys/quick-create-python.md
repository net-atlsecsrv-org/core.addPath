# Quickstart: Azure Key Vault keys client library for Python

Get started with the Azure Key Vault client library for Python. Follow the steps below to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks. By using Key Vault to store cryptographic keys, you avoid storing such keys in your code, which increases the security of your app.

[API reference documentation](/python/api/overview/azure/keyvault-keys-readme) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys) | [Package (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-keys/)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python 2.7+ or 3.5.3+](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment)
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

This quickstart assumes you are running [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) in a Linux terminal window.

## Set up your local environment

This quickstart is using Azure Identity library with Azure CLI to authenticate user to Azure Services. Developers can also use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to authenticate their calls, for more information, see [Authenticate the client with Azure Identity client library](/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

### Sign in to Azure

1. Run the `login` command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    ```

    If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.

    Otherwise, open a browser page at [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter the
    authorization code displayed in your terminal.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

### Install the packages

1. In a terminal or command prompt, create a suitable project folder, and then create and activate a Python virtual environment as described on [Use Python virtual environments](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment?tabs=cmd#use-python-virtual-environments).

1. Install the Azure Active Directory identity library:

    ```terminal
    pip install azure.identity
    ```


1. Install the Key Vault key client library:

    ```terminal
    pip install azure-keyvault-keys
    ```

### Create a resource group and key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group and key vault](../../../includes/key-vault-python-qs-rg-kv-creation.md)]

### Grant access to your key vault

Create an access policy for your key vault that grants secret permission to your user account.

```console
az keyvault set-policy --name <YourKeyVaultName> --upn user@domain.com --secret-permissions delete get list set
```

#### Set environment variables

This application is using key vault name as an environment variable called `KEY_VAULT_NAME`.

Windows
```cmd
set KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
````
Windows PowerShell
```powershell
$Env:KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
```

macOS or Linux
```cmd
export KEY_VAULT_NAME=<your-key-vault-name>
```

## Create the sample code

The Azure Key Vault key client library for Python allows you to manage cryptographic keys. The following code sample demonstrates how to create a client, set a key, retrieve a key, and delete a key.

Create a file named *kv_keys.py* that contains this code.

```python
import os
from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

keyVaultName = os.environ["KEY_VAULT_NAME"]
KVUri = "https://" + keyVaultName + ".vault.azure.net"

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)

keyName = input("Input a name for your key > ")

print(f"Creating a key in {keyVaultName} called '{keyName}' ...")

rsa_key = client.create_rsa_key(keyName, size=2048)

print(" done.")

print(f"Retrieving your key from {keyVaultName}.")

retrieved_key = client.get_key(keyName)

print(f"Key with name '{retrieved_key.name}' was found.")
print(f"Deleting your key from {keyVaultName} ...")

poller = client.begin_delete_key(keyName)
deleted_key = poller.result()

print(" done.")
```

## Run the code

Make sure the code in the previous section is in a file named *kv_keys.py*. Then run the code with the following command:

```terminal
python kv_keys.py
```

- If you encounter permissions errors, make sure you ran the [`az keyvault set-policy` command](#grant-access-to-your-key-vault).
- Re-running the code with the same key name may produce the error, "(Conflict) Key <name> is currently in a deleted but recoverable state." Use a different key name.

## Code details

### Authenticate and create a client

In this quickstart, logged in user is used to authenticate to key vault, which is preferred method for local development. For applications deployed to Azure, managed identity should be assigned to App Service or Virtual Machine, for more information, see [Managed Identity Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

In below example, the name of your key vault is expanded to the key vault URI, in the format "https://\<your-key-vault-name\>.vault.azure.net". This example is using  ['DefaultAzureCredential()'](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) class, which allows to use the same code across different environments with different options to provide identity. For more information, see [Default Azure Credential Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme). 


```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)
```

## Save a key

Once you've obtained the client object for the key vault, you can store a key using the [create_rsa_key](/python/api/azure-keyvault-keys/azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient?#create-rsa-key-name----kwargs-) method: 

```python
rsa_key = client.create_rsa_key(keyName, size=2048)
```

You can also use [create_key](/python/api/azure-keyvault-keys/azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient?#create-key-name--key-type----kwargs-) or [create_ec_key](/python/api/azure-keyvault-keys/azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient?#create-ec-key-name----kwargs-).

Calling a `create` method generates a call to the Azure REST API for the key vault.

When handling the request, Azure authenticates the caller's identity (the service principal) using the credential object you provided to the client.

## Retrieve a key

To read a key from Key Vault, use the [get_key](/python/api/azure-keyvault-keys/azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient?#get-key-name--version-none----kwargs-) method:

```python
retrieved_key = client.get_key(keyName)
 ```

You can also verify that the key has been set with the Azure CLI command [az keyvault key show](/cli/azure/keyvault/key?#az-keyvault-key-show).

### Delete a key

To delete a key, use the [begin_delete_key](/python/api/azure-keyvault-keys/azure.keyvault.keys.keyclient?#begin-delete-key-name----kwargs-) method:

```python
poller = client.begin_delete_key(keyName)
deleted_key = poller.result()
```

The `begin_delete_key` method is asynchronous and returns a poller object. Calling the poller's `result` method waits for its completion.

You can verify that the key is deleted with the Azure CLI command [az keyvault key show](/cli/azure/keyvault/key?#az-keyvault-key-show).

Once deleted, a key remains in a deleted but recoverable state for a time. If you run the code again, use a different key name.

## Clean up resources

If you want to also experiment with [certificates](../certificates/quick-create-python.md) and [secrets](../secrets/quick-create-python.md), you can reuse the Key Vault created in this article.

Otherwise, when you're finished with the resources created in this article, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources:

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group KeyVault-PythonQS-rg
```
