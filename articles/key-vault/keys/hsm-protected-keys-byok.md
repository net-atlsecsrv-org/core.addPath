# Import HSM-protected keys to Key Vault (BYOK)

For added assurance when you use Azure Key Vault, you can import or generate a key in a hardware security module (HSM); the key will  never leave the HSM boundary. This scenario often is referred to as *bring your own key* (BYOK). Key Vault uses the nCipher nShield family of HSMs (FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated) to protect your keys.

Use the information in this article to help you plan for, generate, and transfer your own HSM-protected keys to use with Azure Key Vault.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is not available for Azure China 21Vianet. 
> 
> This import method is available only for [supported HSMs](#supported-hsms). 

For more information, and for a tutorial to get started using Key Vault (including how to create a key vault for HSM-protected keys), see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../general/overview.md).

## Overview

Here's an overview of the process. Specific steps to complete are described later in the article.

* In Key Vault, generate a key (referred to as a *Key Exchange Key* (KEK)). The KEK must be an RSA-HSM key that has only the `import` key operation. Only Key Vault Premium SKU supports RSA-HSM keys.
* Download the KEK public key as a .pem file.
* Transfer the KEK public key to an offline computer that is connected to an on-premises HSM.
* In the offline computer, use the BYOK tool provided by your HSM vendor to create a BYOK file. 
* The target key is encrypted with a KEK, which stays encrypted until it is transferred to the Key Vault HSM. Only the encrypted version of your key leaves the on-premises HSM.
* A KEK that's generated inside a Key Vault HSM is not exportable. HSMs enforce the rule that no clear version of a KEK exists outside a Key Vault HSM.
* The KEK must be in the same key vault where the target key will be imported.
* When the BYOK file is uploaded to Key Vault, a Key Vault HSM uses the KEK private key to decrypt the target key material and import it as an HSM key. This operation happens entirely inside a Key Vault HSM. The target key always remains in the HSM protection boundary.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|Key Exchange Key (KEK)|RSA| 2,048-bit<br />3,072-bit<br />4,096-bit|Azure Key Vault HSM|An HSM-backed RSA key pair generated in Azure Key Vault|

## Generate and transfer your key to the Key Vault HSM

To generate and transfer your key to a Key Vault HSM:

* [Step 1: Generate a KEK](#step-1-generate-a-kek)
* [Step 2: Download the KEK public key](#step-2-download-the-kek-public-key)
* [Step 3: Generate and prepare your key for transfer](#step-3-generate-and-prepare-your-key-for-transfer)
* [Step 4: Transfer your key to Azure Key Vault](#step-4-transfer-your-key-to-azure-key-vault)

### Step 1: Generate a KEK

A KEK is an RSA key that's generated in a Key Vault HSM. The KEK is used to encrypt the key you want to import (the *target* key).

The KEK must be:
- An RSA-HSM key (2,048-bit; 3,072-bit; or 4,096-bit)
- Generated in the same key vault where you intend to import the target key
- Created with allowed key operations set to `import`

> [!NOTE]
> The KEK must have 'import' as the only allowed key operation. 'import' is mutually exclusive with all other key operations.

Use the [az keyvault key create](/cli/azure/keyvault/key?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-key-create) command to create a KEK that has key operations set to `import`. Record the key identifier (`kid`) that's returned from the following command. (You will use the `kid` value in [Step 3](#step-3-generate-and-prepare-your-key-for-transfer).)

```azurecli
az keyvault key create --kty RSA-HSM --size 4096 --name KEKforBYOK --ops import --vault-name ContosoKeyVaultHSM
```

### Step 2: Download the KEK public key

Use [az keyvault key download](/cli/azure/keyvault/key?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-key-download) to download the KEK public key to a .pem file. The target key you import is encrypted by using the KEK public key.

```azurecli
az keyvault key download --name KEKforBYOK --vault-name ContosoKeyVaultHSM --file KEKforBYOK.publickey.pem
```

Transfer the KEKforBYOK.publickey.pem file to your offline computer. You will need this file in the next step.

### Step 3: Generate and prepare your key for transfer

Refer to your HSM vendor's documentation to download and install the BYOK tool. Follow instructions from your HSM vendor to generate a target key, and then create a key transfer package (a BYOK file). The BYOK tool will use the `kid` from [Step 1](#step-1-generate-a-kek) and the KEKforBYOK.publickey.pem file you downloaded in [Step 2](#step-2-download-the-kek-public-key) to generate an encrypted target key in a BYOK file.

Transfer the BYOK file to your connected computer.

> [!NOTE] 
> Importing RSA 1,024-bit keys is not supported. Currently, importing an Elliptic Curve (EC) key is not supported.
> 
> **Known issue**: Importing an RSA 4K target key from SafeNet Luna HSMs is only supported with firmware 7.4.0 or newer.

### Step 4: Transfer your key to Azure Key Vault

To complete the key import, transfer the key transfer package (a BYOK file) from your disconnected computer to the internet-connected computer. Use the [az keyvault key import](/cli/azure/keyvault/key?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-key-import) command to upload the BYOK file to the Key Vault HSM.

```azurecli
az keyvault key import --vault-name ContosoKeyVaultHSM --name ContosoFirstHSMkey --byok-file KeyTransferPackage-ContosoFirstHSMkey.byok
```

If the upload is successful, Azure CLI displays the properties of the imported key.

## Next steps

You can now use this HSM-protected key in your key vault. For more information, see [this price and feature comparison](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/).
