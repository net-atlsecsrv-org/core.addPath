# About Azure Key Vault keys

Azure Key Vault enables Microsoft Azure applications and users to store and use keys. It supports multiple key types and algorithms, and enables the use of Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for high value keys. 

For more general information about Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview)

## Azure Key Vault

The following sections offer general information applicable across the implementation of the Key Vault service.

### Supporting standards

The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) specifications are important background information.  

-   [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41)  
-   [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-40)  
-   [JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-40)  
-   [JSON Web Signature (JWS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-41)  

### Data types

Refer to the JOSE specifications for relevant data types for keys, encryption, and signing.  

-   **algorithm** - a supported algorithm for a key operation, for example, RSA1_5  
-   **ciphertext-value** - cipher text octets, encoded using Base64URL  
-   **digest-value** - the output of a hash algorithm, encoded using Base64URL  
-   **key-type** - one of the supported key types, for example RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).  
-   **plaintext-value** - plaintext octets, encoded using Base64URL  
-   **signature-value** - output of a signature algorithm, encoded using Base64URL  
-   **base64URL** - a Base64URL [RFC4648] encoded binary value  
-   **boolean** - either true or false  
-   **Identity** - an identity from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).  
-   **IntDate** - a JSON decimal value representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time. See RFC3339 for details regarding date/times, in general and UTC in particular.  

### Objects, identifiers, and versioning

Objects stored in Key Vault are versioned whenever a new instance of an object is created. Each version is assigned a unique identifier and URL. When an object is first created, it's given a unique version identifier and marked as the current version of the object. Creation of a new instance with the same object name gives the new object a unique version identifier, causing it to become the current version.  

Objects in Key Vault can be addressed using the current identifier or a version-specific identifier. For example, given a Key with the name `MasterKey`, performing operations with the current identifier causes the system to use the latest available version. Performing operations with the version-specific identifier causes the system to use that specific version of the object.  

Objects are uniquely identified within Key Vault using a URL. No two objects in the system have the same URL, regardless of geo-location. The complete URL to an object is called the Object Identifier. The URL consists of a prefix that identifies the Key Vault, object type, user provided Object Name, and an Object Version. The Object Name is case-insensitive and immutable. Identifiers that don't include the Object Version are referred to as Base Identifiers.  

For more information, see [Authentication, requests, and responses](../general/authentication-requests-and-responses.md)

An object identifier has the following general format:  

`https://{keyvault-name}.vault.azure.net/{object-type}/{object-name}/{object-version}`  

Where:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|`keyvault-name`|The name for a key vault in the Microsoft Azure Key Vault service.<br /><br /> Key Vault names are selected by the user and are globally unique.<br /><br /> Key Vault name must be a 3-24 character string, containing only 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and -.|  
|`object-type`|The type of the object, either "keys" or "secrets".|  
|`object-name`|An `object-name` is a user provided name for and must be unique within a Key Vault. The name must be a 1-127 character string, containing only 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and -.|  
|`object-version`|An `object-version` is a system-generated, 32 character string identifier that is optionally used to address a unique version of an object.|  

## Key Vault keys

### Keys and key types

Cryptographic keys in Key Vault are represented as JSON Web Key [JWK] objects. The base JWK/JWA specifications are also extended to enable key types unique to the Key Vault implementation. For example, importing keys using  HSM vendor-specific packaging, enables secure transportation of keys that may only be used in Key Vault HSMs.  

- **"Soft" keys**: A key processed in software by Key Vault, but is encrypted at rest using a system key that is in an HSM. Clients may import an existing RSA or EC (Elliptic Curve) key, or request that Key Vault generate one.
- **"Hard" keys**: A key processed in an HSM (Hardware Security Module). These keys are protected in one of the Key Vault HSM Security Worlds (there's one Security World per geography to maintain isolation). Clients may import an RSA or EC key, in soft form or by exporting from a compatible HSM device. Clients may also request Key Vault to generate a key. This key type adds the key_hsm attribute to the JWK obtain to carry the HSM key material.

     For more information on geographical boundaries, see [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/privacy/)  

Key Vault supports RSA and Elliptic Curve keys only. 

-   **EC**: "Soft" Elliptic Curve key.
-   **EC-HSM**: "Hard" Elliptic Curve key.
-   **RSA**: "Soft" RSA key.
-   **RSA-HSM**: "Hard" RSA key.

Key Vault supports RSA keys of sizes 2048, 3072 and 4096. Key Vault supports Elliptic Curve key types P-256, P-384, P-521, and P-256K (SECP256K1).

### Cryptographic protection

The cryptographic modules that Key Vault uses, whether HSM or software, are FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) validated. You don't need to do anything special to run in FIPS mode. Keys **created** or **imported** as HSM-protected are  processed inside an HSM, validated to FIPS 140-2 Level 2. Keys **created** or **imported** as software-protected, are processed inside cryptographic modules validated to FIPS 140-2 Level 1. For more information, see [Keys and key types](#keys-and-key-types).

###  EC algorithms
 The following algorithm identifiers are supported with EC and EC-HSM keys in Key Vault. 

#### Curve Types

-   **P-256** - The NIST curve P-256, defined at [DSS FIPS PUB 186-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf).
-   **P-256K** - The SEC curve SECP256K1, defined at [SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters](https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf).
-   **P-384** - The NIST curve P-384, defined at [DSS FIPS PUB 186-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf).
-   **P-521** - The NIST curve P-521, defined at [DSS FIPS PUB 186-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf).

#### SIGN/VERIFY

-   **ES256** - ECDSA for SHA-256 digests and keys created with curve P-256. This algorithm is described at [RFC7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
-   **ES256K** - ECDSA for SHA-256 digests and keys created with curve P-256K. This algorithm is pending standardization.
-   **ES384** - ECDSA for SHA-384 digests and keys created with curve P-384. This algorithm is described at [RFC7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
-   **ES512** - ECDSA for SHA-512 digests and keys created with curve P-521. This algorithm is described at [RFC7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).


###  RSA algorithms  
 The following algorithm identifiers are supported with RSA and RSA-HSM keys in Key Vault.  

#### WRAPKEY/UNWRAPKEY, ENCRYPT/DECRYPT

-   **RSA1_5** - RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 [RFC3447] key encryption  
-   **RSA-OAEP** - RSAES using Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) [RFC3447], with the default parameters specified by RFC 3447 in Section A.2.1. Those default parameters are using a hash function of SHA-1 and a mask generation function of MGF1 with SHA-1.  

#### SIGN/VERIFY

-   **PS256** - RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256, as described in [RFC7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
-   **PS384** - RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384, as described in [RFC7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
-   **PS512** - RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512, as described in [RFC7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
-   **RS256** - RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-256. The application supplied digest value must be computed using SHA-256 and must be 32 bytes in length.  
-   **RS384** - RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-384. The application supplied digest value must be computed using SHA-384 and must be 48 bytes in length.  
-   **RS512** - RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-512. The application supplied digest value must be computed using SHA-512 and must be 64 bytes in length.  
-   **RSNULL** - See [RFC2437], a specialized use-case to enable certain TLS scenarios.  

###  Key operations

Key Vault supports the following operations on key objects:  

-   **Create**: Allows a client to create a key in Key Vault. The value of the key is generated by Key Vault and stored, and isn't released to the client. Asymmetric keys may be created in Key Vault.  
-   **Import**: Allows a client to import an existing key to Key Vault. Asymmetric keys may be imported to Key Vault using a number of different packaging methods within a JWK construct. 
-   **Update**: Allows a client with sufficient permissions to modify the metadata (key attributes) associated with a key previously stored within Key Vault.  
-   **Delete**: Allows a client with sufficient permissions to delete a key from Key Vault.  
-   **List**: Allows a client to list all keys in a given Key Vault.  
-   **List versions**: Allows a client to list all versions of a given key in a given Key Vault.  
-   **Get**: Allows a client to retrieve the public parts of a given key in a Key Vault.  
-   **Backup**: Exports a key in a protected form.  
-   **Restore**: Imports a previously backed up key.  

For more information, see [Key operations in the Key Vault REST API reference](/rest/api/keyvault).  

Once a key has been created in Key Vault, the following cryptographic operations may be performed using the key:  

-   **Sign and Verify**: Strictly, this operation is "sign hash" or "verify hash", as Key Vault doesn't support hashing of content as part of signature creation. Applications should hash the data to be signed locally, then request that Key Vault sign the hash. 
Verification of signed hashes is supported as a convenience operation for applications that may not have access to [public] key material. For best application performance, verify that operations are performed locally.  
-   **Key Encryption / Wrapping**: A key stored in Key Vault may be used to protect another key, typically a symmetric content encryption key (CEK). When the key in Key Vault is asymmetric, key encryption is used. For example, RSA-OAEP and the WRAPKEY/UNWRAPKEY operations are equivalent to ENCRYPT/DECRYPT. When the key in Key Vault is symmetric, key wrapping is used. For example, AES-KW. The WRAPKEY operation is supported as a convenience for applications that may not have access to [public] key material. For best application performance, WRAPKEY operations should be performed locally.  
-   **Encrypt and Decrypt**: A key stored in Key Vault may be used to encrypt or decrypt a single block of data. The size of the block is determined by the key type and selected encryption algorithm. The Encrypt operation is provided for convenience, for applications that may not have access to [public] key material. For best application performance, encrypt operations should be performed locally.  

While WRAPKEY/UNWRAPKEY using asymmetric keys may seem superfluous (as the operation is equivalent to ENCRYPT/DECRYPT), the use of distinct operations is important. The distinction provides semantic and authorization separation of these operations, and consistency when other key types are supported by the service.  

Key Vault doesn't support EXPORT operations. Once a key is provisioned in the system, it cannot be extracted or its key material modified. However, users of Key Vault may require their key for other use cases, such as after it has been deleted. In this case, they may use the BACKUP and RESTORE operations to export/import the key in a protected form. Keys created by the BACKUP operation are not usable outside Key Vault. Alternatively, the IMPORT operation may be used against multiple Key Vault instances.  

Users may restrict any of the cryptographic operations that Key Vault supports on a per-key basis using the key_ops property of the JWK object.  

For more information on JWK objects, see [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41).  

###  Key attributes

In addition to the key material, the following attributes may be specified. In a JSON Request, the attributes keyword and braces, '{' '}', are required even if there are no attributes specified.  

- *enabled*: boolean, optional, default is **true**. Specifies whether the key is enabled and useable for cryptographic operations. The *enabled* attribute is used in conjunction with *nbf* and *exp*. When an operation occurs between *nbf* and *exp*, it will only be permitted if *enabled* is set to **true**. Operations outside the *nbf* / *exp* window are automatically disallowed, except for certain operation types under [particular conditions](#date-time-controlled-operations).
- *nbf*: IntDate, optional, default is now. The *nbf* (not before) attribute identifies the time before which the key MUST NOT be used for cryptographic operations, except for certain operation types under [particular conditions](#date-time-controlled-operations). The processing of the *nbf* attribute requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed in the *nbf* attribute. Key Vault MAY provide for some small leeway, normally no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  
- *exp*: IntDate, optional, default is "forever". The *exp* (expiration time) attribute identifies the expiration time on or after which the key MUST NOT be used for cryptographic operation, except for certain operation types under [particular conditions](#date-time-controlled-operations). The processing of the *exp* attribute requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the *exp* attribute. Key Vault MAY provide for some small leeway, typically no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  

There are additional read-only attributes that are included in any response that includes key attributes:  

- *created*: IntDate, optional. The *created* attribute indicates when this version of the key was created. The value is null for keys created prior to the addition of this attribute. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  
- *updated*: IntDate, optional. The *updated* attribute indicates when this version of the key was updated. The value is null for keys that were last updated prior to the addition of this attribute. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  

For more information on IntDate and other data types, see [Data types](#data-types)  

#### Date-time controlled operations

Not-yet-valid and expired keys, outside the *nbf* / *exp* window, will work for **decrypt**, **unwrap**, and **verify** operations (won't return 403, Forbidden). The rationale for using the not-yet-valid state is to allow a key to be tested before production use. The rationale for using the expired state is to allow recovery operations on data that was created when the key was valid. Also, you can disable access to a key using Key Vault policies, or by updating the *enabled* key attribute to **false**.

For more information on data types, see [Data types](#data-types).

For more information on other possible attributes, see the [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41).

### Key tags

You can specify additional application-specific metadata in the form of tags. Key Vault supports up to 15 tags, each of which can have a 256 character name and a 256 character value.  

>[!Note]
>Tags are readable by a caller if they have the *list* or *get* permission to that object type (keys, secrets, or certificates).

###  Key access control

Access control for keys managed by Key Vault is provided at the level of a Key Vault that acts as the container of keys. The access control policy for keys is distinct from the access control policy for secrets in the same Key Vault. Users may create one or more vaults to hold keys, and are required to maintain scenario appropriate segmentation and management of keys. Access control for keys is independent of access control for secrets.  

The following permissions can be granted, on a per user / service principal basis, in the keys access control entry on a vault. These permissions closely mirror the operations allowed on a key object.  Granting access to an service principal in key vault is a onetime operation, and it will remain same for all Azure subscriptions. You can use it to deploy as many certificates as you want.
