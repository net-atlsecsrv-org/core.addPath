# Key types, algorithms, and operations

Key Vault supports two resource types: vaults and managed HSMs. Both resources types support various encryption keys. To see a summary of supported key types, protection types by each resource type, please see [About keys](about-keys.md).

Following table shows a summary of key types and supported algorithms.

##  Key operations

Managed HSM supports the following operations on key objects:  

-   **Create**: Allows a client to create a key in Key Vault. The value of the key is generated by Key Vault and stored, and isn't released to the client. Asymmetric keys may be created in Key Vault.  
-   **Import**: Allows a client to import an existing key to Key Vault. Asymmetric keys may be imported to Key Vault using a number of different packaging methods within a JWK construct. 
-   **Update**: Allows a client with sufficient permissions to modify the metadata (key attributes) associated with a key previously stored within Key Vault.  
-   **Delete**: Allows a client with sufficient permissions to delete a key from Key Vault.  
-   **List**: Allows a client to list all keys in a given Key Vault.  
-   **List versions**: Allows a client to list all versions of a given key in a given Key Vault.  
-   **Get**: Allows a client to retrieve the public parts of a given key in a Key Vault.  
-   **Backup**: Exports a key in a protected form.  
-   **Restore**: Imports a previously backed up key.  

For more information, see [Key operations in the Key Vault REST API reference](/rest/api/keyvault).  

Once a key has been created in Key Vault, the following cryptographic operations may be performed using the key:  

-   **Sign and Verify**: Strictly, this operation is "sign hash" or "verify hash", as Key Vault doesn't support hashing of content as part of signature creation. Applications should hash the data to be signed locally, then request that Key Vault sign the hash. 
Verification of signed hashes is supported as a convenience operation for applications that may not have access to [public] key material. For best application performance, VERIFY operations should be performed locally.  
-   **Key Encryption / Wrapping**: A key stored in Key Vault may be used to protect another key, typically a symmetric content encryption key (CEK). When the key in Key Vault is asymmetric, key encryption is used. For example, RSA-OAEP and the WRAPKEY/UNWRAPKEY operations are equivalent to ENCRYPT/DECRYPT. When the key in Key Vault is symmetric, key wrapping is used. For example, AES-KW. The WRAPKEY operation is supported as a convenience for applications that may not have access to [public] key material. For best application performance, WRAPKEY operations should be performed locally.  
-   **Encrypt and Decrypt**: A key stored in Key Vault may be used to encrypt or decrypt a single block of data. The size of the block is determined by the key type and selected encryption algorithm. The Encrypt operation is provided for convenience, for applications that may not have access to [public] key material. For best application performance, ENCRYPT operations should be performed locally.  

While WRAPKEY/UNWRAPKEY using asymmetric keys may seem superfluous (as the operation is equivalent to ENCRYPT/DECRYPT), the use of distinct operations is important. The distinction provides semantic and authorization separation of these operations, and consistency when other key types are supported by the service.  

Key Vault doesn't support EXPORT operations. Once a key is provisioned in the system, it cannot be extracted or its key material modified. However, users of Key Vault may require their key for other use cases, such as after it has been deleted. In this case, they may use the BACKUP and RESTORE operations to export/import the key in a protected form. Keys created by the BACKUP operation are not usable outside Key Vault. Alternatively, the IMPORT operation may be used against multiple Key Vault instances.  

Users may restrict any of the cryptographic operations that Key Vault supports on a per-key basis using the key_ops property of the JWK object.  

For more information on JWK objects, see [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41).  

## Key attributes

In addition to the key material, the following attributes may be specified. In a JSON Request, the attributes keyword and braces, '{' '}', are required even if there are no attributes specified.  

- *enabled*: boolean, optional, default is **true**. Specifies whether the key is enabled and useable for cryptographic operations. The *enabled* attribute is used in conjunction with *nbf* and *exp*. When an operation occurs between *nbf* and *exp*, it will only be permitted if *enabled* is set to **true**. Operations outside the *nbf* / *exp* window are automatically disallowed, except for certain operation types under [particular conditions](#date-time-controlled-operations).
- *nbf*: IntDate, optional, default is now. The *nbf* (not before) attribute identifies the time before which the key MUST NOT be used for cryptographic operations, except for certain operation types under [particular conditions](#date-time-controlled-operations). The processing of the *nbf* attribute requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed in the *nbf* attribute. Key Vault MAY provide for some small leeway, normally no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  
- *exp*: IntDate, optional, default is "forever". The *exp* (expiration time) attribute identifies the expiration time on or after which the key MUST NOT be used for cryptographic operation, except for certain operation types under [particular conditions](#date-time-controlled-operations). The processing of the *exp* attribute requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the *exp* attribute. Key Vault MAY provide for some small leeway, typically no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  

There are additional read-only attributes that are included in any response that includes key attributes:  

- *created*: IntDate, optional. The *created* attribute indicates when this version of the key was created. The value is null for keys created prior to the addition of this attribute. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  
- *updated*: IntDate, optional. The *updated* attribute indicates when this version of the key was updated. The value is null for keys that were last updated prior to the addition of this attribute. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.  

For more information on IntDate and other data types, see [About keys, secrets, and certificates: [Data types](../general/about-keys-secrets-certificates.md#data-types).

### Date-time controlled operations

Not-yet-valid and expired keys, outside the *nbf* / *exp* window, will work for **decrypt**, **unwrap**, and **verify** operations (won't return 403, Forbidden). The rationale for using the not-yet-valid state is to allow a key to be tested before production use. The rationale for using the expired state is to allow recovery operations on data that was created when the key was valid. Also, you can disable access to a key using Key Vault policies, or by updating the *enabled* key attribute to **false**.

For more information on data types, see [Data types](../general/about-keys-secrets-certificates.md#data-types).

For more information on other possible attributes, see the [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41).

## Key tags

You can specify additional application-specific metadata in the form of tags. Key Vault supports up to 15 tags, each of which can have a 256 character name and a 256 character value.  

> [!NOTE] 
> Tags are readable by a caller if they have the *list* or *get* permission to that key.

##  Key access control

Access control for keys managed by Key Vault is provided at the level of a Key Vault that acts as the container of keys. The access control policy for keys is distinct from the access control policy for secrets in the same Key Vault. Users may create one or more vaults to hold keys, and are required to maintain scenario appropriate segmentation and management of keys. Access control for keys is independent of access control for secrets.  

The following permissions can be granted, on a per user / service principal basis, in the keys access control entry on a vault. These permissions closely mirror the operations allowed on a key object.  Granting access to a service principal in key vault is a onetime operation, and it will remain same for all Azure subscriptions. You can use it to deploy as many certificates as you want.
