# Azure security baseline for Key Vault

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Key Vault. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Key Vault. **Controls** not applicable to Key Vault, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Key Vault completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Key Vault security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Integrate Azure Key Vault with Azure Private Link. Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure Services (for example, Azure Key Vault) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network.

An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: The [Azure Security Benchmark](/azure/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark) is the default policy initiative for Security Center and is the foundation for [Security Center's recommendations](/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations). The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/azure/security-center/azure-defender) plan for the related services.

**Azure Policy built-in definitions - Microsoft.KeyVault**:

[!INCLUDE [Resource Policy for Microsoft.KeyVault 1.1](../../../includes/policy/standards/asb/rp-controls/microsoft.keyvault-1-1.md)]

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your Key Vault-configured resources in Azure.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: This requirement can be met by configuring advanced threat protection (ATP) for Azure Key Vault. ATP provides an additional layer of security intelligence. This tool detects potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Azure Key Vault accounts.

When Azure Security Center detects anomalous activity, it displays alerts. It also emails the subscription administrator with details of the suspicious activity and recommendations for how to investigate and remediate the identified threats.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: For resources that need access to your Azure Key Vault instances, use Azure service tags for the Azure Key Vault to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review. These processes should have a focus on protecting sensitive systems, such as those using Key Vault secrets.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the metric used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data such as Azure Key Vault secrets.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party.  Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure Key Vault-enabled resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.  You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
