# Quickstart: Create a key vault using PowerShell

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for [keys](../keys/index.yml), [secrets](../secrets/index.yml), and [certificates](../certificates/index.yml). For more information on Key Vault, see [About Azure Key Vault](overview.md); for more information on what can be stored in a key vault, see [About keys, secrets, and certificates](about-keys-secrets-certificates.md).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

In this quickstart, you create a key vault with [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/). If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires Azure PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later. Type `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Login-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Login-AzAccount
```

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
```

## Create a key vault

Create a Key Vault in the resource group from the previous step. You will need to provide some information:

- Key vault name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)

  > [!Important]
  > Each key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.

- Resource group name: **myResourceGroup**.
- The location: **EastUS**.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzKeyVault -Name "<your-unique-key-vault-name>" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "East US"
```

The output of this cmdlet shows properties of the newly created key vault. Take note of the two properties listed below:

- **Vault Name**: The name you provided to the --name parameter above.
- **Vault URI**: In the example, this is https://<your-unique-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/. Applications that use your vault through its REST API must use this URI.

At this point, your Azure account is the only one authorized to perform any operations on this new vault.

## Clean up resources

Other quickstarts and tutorials in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with other quickstarts and tutorials, you may want to leave these resources in place.

When no longer needed, you can use the Azure PowerShell [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) command to remove the resource group and all related resources.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart you created a Key Vault and stored a secret in it. To learn more about Key Vault and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to the articles below.
