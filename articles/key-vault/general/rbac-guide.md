# Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based access control (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Key Vault resource provider supports two resource types: **vaults** and **managed HSMs**. Access control described in this article only applies to **vaults**. To learn more about access control for managed HSM, see [Managed HSM access control](../managed-hsm/access-control.md).

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system built on [Azure Resource
Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md)
that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.

Azure RBAC allows users to manage Key, Secrets, and Certificates permissions. It provides one place to manage all permissions across all key vaults. 

The Azure RBAC model provides the ability to set permissions on different scope levels: management group, subscription, resource group, or individual resources.  Azure RBAC for key vault also provides the ability to have separate permissions on individual keys, secrets, and certificates

For more information, see [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md).

## Best Practices for individual keys, secrets, and certificates

Our recommendation is to use a vault per application per environment
(Development, Pre-Production, and Production).

Individual keys, secrets, and certificates permissions should be used
only for specific scenarios:

-   Multi-layer applications that need to separate access control
    between layers

-   Sharing individual secret between multiple applications

More about Azure Key Vault management guidelines, see:

- [Azure Key Vault best practices](best-practices.md)
- [Azure Key Vault service limits](service-limits.md)

## Using Azure RBAC secret, key, and certificate permissions with Key Vault

The new Azure RBAC permission model for key vault provides alternative to the vault access policy permissions model. 

### Prerequisites

To add role assignments, you must have:

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` and `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete` permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner)

### Enable Azure RBAC permissions on Key Vault

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting Azure RBAC permission model invalidates all access policies permissions. It can cause outages when equivalent Azure roles aren't assigned.

1.  Enable Azure RBAC permissions on new key vault:

    ![Enable Azure RBAC permissions - new vault](../media/rbac/image-1.png)

2.  Enable Azure RBAC permissions on existing key vault:

    ![Enable Azure RBAC permissions - existing vault](../media/rbac/image-2.png)

### Assign role

> [!Note]
> It's recommended to use the unique role ID instead of the role name in scripts. Therefore, if a role is renamed, your scripts would continue to work. During preview every role would have "(preview)" suffix, which would be removed later. In this document role name is used only for readability.

Azure CLI command to create a role assignment:

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role <role_name_or_id> --assignee <assignee> --scope <scope>
```

In the Azure portal, the Azure role assignments screen is available for all resources on the Access control (IAM) tab.

![Role assignment - (IAM) tab](../media/rbac/image-3.png)

### Resource group scope role assignment

1.  Go to key vault Resource Group.
    ![Role assignment - resource group](../media/rbac/image-4.png)

2.  Click Access control (IAM) \> Add-role assignment\>Add

3.  Create Key Vault Reader role "Key Vault Reader (preview)" for current user

    ![Add role - resource group](../media/rbac/image-5.png)

Azure CLI:
```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Reader (preview)" --assignee {i.e user@microsoft.com} --scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionid}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}
```

Above role assignment provides ability to list key vault objects in key vault.

### Key Vault scope role assignment

1. Go to Key Vault \> Access control (IAM) tab

2. Click Add-role assignment\>Add

3. Create Key Secrets Officer role "Key Vault Secrets Officer (preview)" for current user.

    ![Role assignment - key vault](../media/rbac/image-6.png)

 Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets Officer (preview)" --assignee {i.e jalichwa@microsoft.com} --scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionid}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/{key-vault-name}
```

After creating above role assignment you can create/update/delete secrets.

4. Create new secret ( Secrets \> +Generate/Import) for testing secret level role assignment.

    ![Add role - key vault](../media/rbac/image-7.png)

### Secret scope role assignment

1. Open one of previously created secrets, notice Overview and Access control (IAM) (preview)

2. Click Access control(IAM)(preview) tab

    ![Role assignment - secret](../media/rbac/image-8.png)

3. Create Key Secrets Officer role "Key Vault Secrets Officer (preview)" for current user, same like it was done above for the Key Vault.

Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets Officer (preview)" --assignee {i.e user@microsoft.com} --scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionid}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/{key-vault-name}/secrets/RBACSecret
```

### Test and verify

> [!NOTE]
> Browsers use caching and page refresh is required after removing role assignments.<br>
> Allow several minutes for role assignments to refresh

1. Validate adding new secret without "Key Vault Secrets Officer" role on key vault level.

Go to key vault Access control (IAM) tab and remove "Key Vault Secrets Officer (preview)" role assignment for this resource.

![Remove assignment - key vault](../media/rbac/image-9.png)

Navigate to previously created secret. You can see all secret properties.

![Secret view with access](../media/rbac/image-10.png)

Create new secret ( Secrets \> +Generate/Import) should show below error:

   ![Create new secret](../media/rbac/image-11.png)

2.  Validate secret editing without "Key Vault Secret Officer" role on secret level.

-   Go to previously created secret Access Control (IAM) (preview) tab
    and remove "Key Vault Secrets Officer (preview)" role assignment for
    this resource.

-   Navigate to previously created secret. You can see secret properties.

   ![Secret view without access](../media/rbac/image-12.png)

3. Validate secrets read without reader role on key vault level.

-   Go to key vault resource group Access control (IAM) tab and remove "Key Vault Reader (preview)" role assignment.

-   Navigating to key vault's Secrets tab should show below error:

   ![Secret tab - error](../media/rbac/image-13.png)

### Creating custom roles 

[az role definition create command](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-create)

**(CLI bash script)</br>**
```azurecli
az role definition create --role-definition '{ \
   "Name": "Backup Keys Operator", \
   "Description": "Perform key backup/restore operations", \
    "Actions": [ 
    ], \
    "DataActions": [ \
        "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/keys/read ", \
        "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/keys/backup/action", \
         "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/keys/restore/action" \
    ], \
    "NotDataActions": [ 
   ], \
    "AssignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}"] \
}'
```

[Azure custom roles](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md)

## Known limits and performance

-   2000 Azure role assignments per subscription

-   Role assignments latency: at current expected performance, it will take up to 10 minutes (600 seconds) after role assignments is changed for role to be applied
