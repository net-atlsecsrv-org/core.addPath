# Security controls for Azure Key Vault

This article documents the security controls built into Azure Key Vault. 

[!INCLUDE [Security controls Header](../../includes/security-controls-header.md)]

## Network

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Service endpoint support| Yes | Using Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints. |
| VNet injection support| No |  |
| Network isolation and firewalling support| Yes | Using VNet firewall rules. |
| Forced tunneling support| No |  |

## Monitoring & logging

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Azure monitoring support (Log analytics, App insights, etc.)| Yes | Using Log Analytics. |
| Control/Management plane Logging and Audit| Yes | Using Log Analytics. |
| Data plane logging and audit| Yes | Using Log Analytics. |

## Identity

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Authentication| Yes | Authentication is through Azure Active Directory. |
| Authorization| Yes | Using Key Vault Access Policy. |

## Data protection

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Server-side encryption at rest: Microsoft-managed keys | Yes | All objects are encrypted. |
| Server-side encryption at rest: customer-managed keys (BYOK) | Yes | The customer controls all keys in their Key Vault. When hardware security module (HSM) backed keys are specified, a FIPS Level 2 HSM protects the key, certificate, or secret. |
| Column level encryption (Azure Data Services)| N/A |  |
| Encryption in transit (such as ExpressRoute encryption, in VNet encryption, and VNet-VNet encryption)| Yes | All communication is via encrypted API calls |
| API calls encrypted| Yes | Using HTTPS. |

## Access controls

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Control/Management plane access controls | Yes | Azure Resource Manager Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) |
| Data plane access controls (At every service level) | Yes | Key Vault Access Policy |
