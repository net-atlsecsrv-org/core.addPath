# Configure Blockchain Data Manager using the Azure portal

Configure Blockchain Data Manager for Azure Blockchain Service to capture blockchain data and send it to an Azure Event Grid Topic.

To configure a Blockchain Data Manager instance, you:

* Create a Blockchain Data Manager instance for an Azure Blockchain Service transaction node
* Add your blockchain applications

## Prerequisites

* Complete [Quickstart: Create a blockchain member using the Azure portal](create-member.md) or [Quickstart: Create an Azure Blockchain Service blockchain member using Azure CLI](create-member-cli.md)
* Create an [Event Grid Topic](../../event-grid/custom-event-quickstart-portal.md#create-a-custom-topic)
* Learn about [Event handlers in Azure Event Grid](../../event-grid/event-handlers.md)

## Create instance

A Blockchain Data Manager instance connects and monitors an Azure Blockchain Service transaction node. Only users with access to the transaction node can create a connection. An instance captures all raw block and raw transaction data from the transaction node.

An outbound connection sends blockchain data to Azure Event Grid. You configure a single outbound connection when you create the instance. Blockchain Data Manager supports multiple Event Grid Topic outbound connections for any given Blockchain Data Manager instance. You can send blockchain data to a single destination or send blockchain data to multiple destinations. To add another destination, just add additional outbound connections to the instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Go to the Azure Blockchain Service member you want to connect to Blockchain Data Manager. Select **Blockchain Data Manager**.
1. Select **Add**.

    ![Add Blockchain Data Manager](./media/data-manager-portal/add-instance.png)

    Enter the following details:

    Setting | Description
    --------|------------
    Name | Enter a unique name for a connected Blockchain Data Manager. The Blockchain Data Manager name can contain lower case letters and numbers and has a maximum length of 20 characters.
    Transaction node | Choose a transaction node. Only transaction nodes you have read access are listed.
    Connection name | Enter a unique name of the outbound connection where blockchain transaction data is sent.
    Event grid endpoint | Choose an event grid topic in the same subscription as the Blockchain Data Manager instance.

1. Select **OK**.

    It takes less than a minute to create a Blockchain Data Manager instance. After the instance is deployed, it is automatically started. A running Blockchain Data Manager instance captures blockchain events from the transaction node and sends data to the outbound connections.

    The new instance appears in the list of Blockchain Data Manager instances for the Azure Blockchain Service member.

    ![List of Blockchain Data Member instances](./media/data-manager-portal/instance-list.png)

## Add blockchain application

If you add a blockchain application, Blockchain Data Manager decodes event and property state for the application. Otherwise, only raw block and raw transaction data is sent. Blockchain Data Manager also discovers contract addresses when the contract is deployed. You can add multiple blockchain applications to a Blockchain Data Manager instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, blockchain applications that declare Solidity [array types](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.12/types.html#arrays) or [mapping types](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.12/types.html#mapping-types) are not fully supported. Properties declared as array or mapping types will not be decoded in *ContractPropertiesMsg* or *DecodedContractEventsMsg* messages.

Blockchain Data Manager requires a smart contract ABI and deployed bytecode file to add the application.

### Get Contract ABI and bytecode

The contract ABI defines the smart contract interfaces. It describes how to interact with the smart contract. You can use the [Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzBlockchain.azure-blockchain) to copy the contract ABI to the clipboard.

1. In the Visual Studio Code explorer pane, expand the **build/contracts** folder of your Solidity project.
1. Right-click the contract metadata JSON file. The file name is the smart contract name followed by the **.json** extension.
1. Select **Copy Contract ABI**.

    ![Visual Studio Code pane with the Copy Contract ABI selection](./media/data-manager-portal/abi-devkit.png)

    The contract ABI is copied to the clipboard.

1. Save the **abi** array as a JSON file. For example, *abi.json*. You use the file in a later step.

Blockchain Data Manager requires the deployed bytecode for the smart contract. The deployed bytecode is different than the smart contract bytecode. You can get the deployed bytecode from the compiled contract metadata file.

1. Open the contract metadata file contained in the **build/contracts** folder of your Solidity project. The file name is the smart contract name followed by the **.json** extension.
1. Find the **deployedBytecode** element in the JSON file.
1. Copy the hexadecimal value without the quotes.

    ![Visual Studio Code pane with bytecode in the metadata](./media/data-manager-portal/bytecode-metadata.png)

1. Save the **bytecode** value as a JSON file. For example, *bytecode.json*. You use the file in a later step.

The following example shows *abi.json* and *bytecode.json* files open in the VS Code editor. Your files should look similar.

![Example of abi.json and bytecode.json files](./media/data-manager-portal/contract-files.png)

### Create contract ABI and bytecode URL

Blockchain Data Manager requires the contract ABI and bytecode files to be accessible by a URL when adding an application. You can use an Azure Storage account to provide a privately accessible URL.

#### Create storage account

[!INCLUDE [storage-create-account-portal-include](../../../includes/storage-create-account-portal-include.md)]

#### Upload contract files

1. Create a new container for the storage account. Select **Containers > Container**.

    ![Create a storage account container](./media/data-manager-portal/create-container.png)

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Name  | Name the container. For example, *smartcontract* |
    | Public access level | Choose *Private (no anonymous access)* |

1. Select **OK** to create the container.
1. Select the container then select **Upload**.
1. Choose both JSON files you created in the [Get Contract ABI and bytecode](#get-contract-abi-and-bytecode) section.

    ![Upload blob](./media/data-manager-portal/upload-blobs.png)

    Select **Upload**.

#### Generate URL

For each blob, generate a shared access signature.

1. Select the ABI JSON blob.
1. Select **Generate SAS**
1. Set desired access signature expiration then select **Generate blob SAS token and URL**.

    ![Generate SAS token](./media/data-manager-portal/generate-sas.png)

1. Copy the **Blob SAS URL** and save it for the next section.
1. Repeat the [Generate URL](#generate-url) steps for the bytecode JSON blob.

### Add application to instance

1. Select your Blockchain Data Manager instance from the instance list.
1. Select **Blockchain applications**.
1. Select **Add**.

    ![Add a blockchain application](./media/data-manager-portal/add-application.png)

    Enter the name of the blockchain application and the smart contract ABI and bytecode URLs.

    Setting | Description
    --------|------------
    Name | Enter a unique name for the blockchain application to track.
    Contract ABI | URL path to the Contract ABI file. For more information, see [Create contract ABI and bytecode URL](#create-contract-abi-and-bytecode-url).
    Contract Bytecode | URL path to bytecode file. For more information, see [Create contract ABI and bytecode URL](#create-contract-abi-and-bytecode-url).

1. Select **OK**.

    Once the application is created, the application appears in the list of blockchain applications.

    ![Blockchain application list](./media/data-manager-portal/artifact-list.png)

You can delete the Azure Storage account or use it to configure more blockchain applications. If you wish to delete the Azure Storage account, you can delete the resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes the associated storage account, and any other resources associated with the resource group.

## Stop instance

Stop the Blockchain Manager instance when you want to stop capturing blockchain events and sending data to the outbound connections. When the instance is stopped, no charges are incurred for Blockchain Data Manager. For more information, see [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/blockchain-service).

1. Go to **Overview** and select **Stop**.
