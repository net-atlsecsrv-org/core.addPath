# Quickstart: Use MetaMask to connect and deploy a smart contract

In this quickstart you'll use MetaMask to connect to an Azure Blockchain Service network and use Remix to deploy a smart contract. Metamask is a browser extension to manage an Ether wallet and perform smart contract actions.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Complete [Quickstart: Create a blockchain member using the Azure portal](create-member.md) or [Quickstart: Create an Azure Blockchain Service blockchain member using Azure CLI](create-member-cli.md)
* Install [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io)
* Generate a MetaMask [wallet](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488971-New-to-MetaMask-Learn-How-to-Setup-MetaMask-the-First-Time)

## Get endpoint address

You need the Azure Blockchain Service endpoint address to connect to the blockchain network. The endpoint address and access keys are in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to your Azure Blockchain Service member.
1. Select **Transaction nodes** and the default transaction node link.

    ![Select default transaction node](./media/connect-metamask/transaction-nodes.png)

1. Select **Connection strings > Access keys**.
1. Copy the endpoint address from **HTTPS (Access key 1)**.

    ![Connection string](./media/connect-metamask/connection-string.png)

## Connect MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask browser extension and sign in.
1. In the network dropdown, select  **Custom RPC**.

    ![Custom RPC](./media/connect-metamask/custom-rpc.png)

1. In **New Network > New RPC URL**, paste the endpoint address you copied above.
1. Select **Save**.

    If connection was successful, the private network displays in the network drop-down.

## Deploy smart contract

Remix is a browser-based Solidity development environment. Using MetaMask and Remix together, you can deploy and take actions on smart contracts.

1. In your browser, navigate to `https://remix.ethereum.org`.
1. Select **New file** in the **Home** tab under **File**.

    Name the new file `simple.sol`.

    ![Create file](./media/connect-metamask/create-file.png)

    Select **OK**.
1. In the Remix editor, paste in the following **simple smart contract** code.

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
             
    contract simple {
        uint balance;
                 
        constructor() public{
            balance = 0;
        }
                 
        function add(uint _num) public {
            balance += _num;
        }
                 
        function get() public view returns (uint){
            return balance;
        }
    }
    ```

    The **simple contract** declares a state variable named **balance**. There are two functions defined. The **add** function adds a number to **balance**. The **get** function returns the value of **balance**.
1. To compile the contract, first select the Solidity compiler pane then select the  **Compile simple.sol**.

    ![Screen capture shows a contract being compiled.](./media/connect-metamask/compile.png)

1. Select the **Deploy & Run** pane then set the **Environment** to **Injected Web3** to connect through MetaMask to your blockchain member.

    ![Run tab](./media/connect-metamask/injected-web3.png)

1. Select the **simple** contract, then **Deploy**.

    ![Screen capture shows deploy and run transactions with a contract selected and Deploy selected.](./media/connect-metamask/deploy.png)


1. A MetaMask notification alerts you of insufficient funds to perform the transaction.

    For a public blockchain network, you would need Ether to pay for the transaction cost. Since this is a private network in a consortium, you can set gas price to zero.

1.  Select **Gas Fee > Edit > Advanced**,  set the **Gas Price** to 0.

    ![Gas price](./media/connect-metamask/gas-price.png)

    Select **Save**.

1. Select **Confirm** to deploy the smart contract to the blockchain.
1. In the **Deployed Contracts** section, expand the **simple** contract.

    ![Deployed contract](./media/connect-metamask/deployed-contract.png)

    Two actions, **add** and **get**, map to the functions defined in the contract.

1. To perform an **add** transaction on the blockchain, enter a number to add, then select **add**. You may get a gas estimation failure message from Remix: "You are sending the transaction to a private blockchain that does not require gas." Select **Send Transaction** to force the transaction.
1. Similar to when you deployed the contract, a MetaMask notification alerts you of insufficient funds to perform the transaction.

    Since this is a private network in a consortium, we can set gas price to zero.

1. Select **Gas Fee > Edit > Advanced**, set the **Gas Price** to 0, and select **Save**.
1. Select **Confirm** to send the transaction to the blockchain.
1. Select **get** action. This is a call to query node data. A transaction isn't needed.

The debug pane of Remix shows details about the transactions on the blockchain:

![Debug history](./media/connect-metamask/debug.png)

You can see the **simple** contract creation, transaction for **simple.add**, and call to **simple.get**.

To see transaction history in MetaMask, open the MetaMask browser extension and look in the **History** section for a log of the deployed contract and transactions.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used the MetaMask browser extension to connect to an Azure Blockchain Service transaction node, deploy a smart contract, and send a transaction to the blockchain. Try the next tutorial to use Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum and Truffle to create, build, deploy, and execute a smart contract function via a transaction.
