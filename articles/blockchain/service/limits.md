# Limits in Azure Blockchain Service

Azure Blockchain Service has service and functional limits such as the number of nodes a member can have, consortium restrictions, and storage amounts.

## Pricing tier

Maximum limits on transactions and validator nodes depend on whether you provision Azure Blockchain Service at Basic or Standard pricing tiers.

| Pricing tier | Max transaction nodes | Max validator nodes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Basic | 10 | 1 |
| Standard | 10 | 2 |

Changing the pricing tier between Basic and Standard after member creation is not supported.

## Storage capacity

The maximum amount of storage that can be used per node for ledger data and logs is 1.8 terabytes.

Decreasing ledger and log storage size is not supported.

## Consortium limits

* **Consortium and member names must be unique** from other consortium and member names in the Azure Blockchain Service.

* **Member and consortium names cannot be changed**

* **All members in a consortium must be in the same pricing tier**

* **All members that participate in a consortium must reside in the same region**

    The first member created in a consortium dictates the region. Invited members to the consortium must reside in the same region as the first member. Limiting all members to the same region helps ensure network consensus is not negatively impacted.

* **A consortium must have at least one administrator**

    If there is only one administrator in a consortium, they cannot remove themselves from the consortium or delete their member until another administrator is added or promoted in the consortium.

* **Members removed from the consortium cannot be added again**

    Rather, they must be reinvited to join the consortium and create a new member. Their existing member resource are not deleted to preserve historical transactions.

* **All members in a consortium must be using the same ledger version**
