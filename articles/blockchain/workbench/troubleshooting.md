# Azure Blockchain Workbench Preview troubleshooting

A PowerShell script is available to assist with developer debugging or support. The script generates a summary and collects detailed logs for troubleshooting. Collected logs include:

* Blockchain network, such as Ethereum
* Blockchain Workbench microservices
* Application Insights
* Azure Monitoring (Azure Monitor logs)

You can use the information to determine next steps and determine root cause of issues.

[!INCLUDE [Preview note](./includes/preview.md)]

## Troubleshooting script

The PowerShell troubleshooting script is available on GitHub. [Download a zip file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blockchain/archive/master.zip) or clone the sample from GitHub.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blockchain.git
```

## Run the script
[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install.md)]

Run the `collectBlockchainWorkbenchTroubleshooting.ps1` script to collect logs and create a ZIP file containing a folder of troubleshooting information. For example:

``` powershell
collectBlockchainWorkbenchTroubleshooting.ps1 -SubscriptionID "<subscription_id>" -ResourceGroupName "workbench-resource-group-name"
```
The script accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Description | Required |
|---------|---------|----|
| SubscriptionID | SubscriptionID to create or locate all resources. | Yes |
| ResourceGroupName | Name of the Azure Resource Group where Blockchain Workbench has been deployed. | Yes |
| OutputDirectory | Path to create the output .ZIP file. If not specified, defaults to the current directory. | No |
| LookbackHours | Number of hours to use when pulling telemetry. Default value is 24 hours. Maximum value is 90 hours | No |
| OmsSubscriptionId | The subscription ID where Azure Monitor logs is deployed. Only pass this parameter if the Azure Monitor logs for the blockchain network is deployed outside of Blockchain Workbench's resource group.| No |
| OmsResourceGroup |The resource group where Azure Monitor logs is deployed. Only pass this parameter if the Azure Monitor logs for the blockchain network is deployed outside of Blockchain Workbench's resource group.| No |
| OmsWorkspaceName | The Log Analytics workspace name. Only pass this parameter if the Azure Monitor logs for the blockchain network is deployed outside of Blockchain Workbench's resource group | No |

## What is collected?

The output ZIP file contains the following folder structure:

| Folder or File | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| \Summary.txt | Summary of the system |
| \Metrics\blockchain | Metrics about the blockchain |
| \Metrics\Workbench | Metrics about the workbench |
| \Details\Blockchain | Detailed logs about the blockchain |
| \Details\Workbench | Detailed logs about the workbench |

The summary file gives you a snapshot of the overall state of the application and health of the application. The summary provides recommended actions, highlights top errors, and metadata about running services.

The **Metrics** folder contains metrics of various system components over time. For example, the output file `\Details\Workbench\apiMetrics.txt` contains a summary of different response codes, and response times throughout the collection period. 
The **Details** folder contains detailed logs for troubleshooting specific issues with Workbench or the underlying blockchain network. For example, `\Details\Workbench\Exceptions.csv` contains a list of the most recent exceptions that have occurred in the system, which is useful for troubleshooting errors with smart contracts or interactions with the blockchain.
