# Quickstart: Create and provision a simulated X.509 device using Python device SDK for IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-x509](../../includes/iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-x509.md)]

In this quickstart, you provision a development machine as a Python X.509 device. You use sample device code from the [Azure IoT Python SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python) to connect the device to your IoT hub. An individual enrollment is used with the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) in this example.

## Prerequisites

- Familiar with [provisioning](about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) concepts.
- Completion of [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md).
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- [Python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/).


[!INCLUDE [IoT Device Provisioning Service basic](../../includes/iot-dps-basic.md)]

## Prepare the environment 

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

2. Open a Git Bash prompt. Clone the GitHub repo for [Azure IoT Python SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python).
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git --recursive
    ```


## Create a self-signed X.509 device certificate 

In this section, you will create a self-signed X.509 certificate. It is important to keep in mind the following points:

* Self-signed certificates are for testing only, and should not be used in production.
* The default expiration date for a self-signed certificate is one year.

If you don't already have your device certificates to authenticate a device, you can create a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL for testing with this article.  OpenSSL is included with the Git installation. 

1. Run the following command in the Git Bash prompt.

    # [Windows](#tab/windows)
    
    ```bash
    winpty openssl req -outform PEM -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./python-device.key.pem -out ./python-device.pem -days 365 -extensions usr_cert -subj "//CN=Python-device-01"
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=Python-device-01`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms. 

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)
    
    ```bash
    openssl req -outform PEM -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./python-device.key.pem -out ./python-device.pem -days 365 -extensions usr_cert -subj "/CN=Python-device-01"
    ```
    
    ---
    
2. When asked to **Enter PEM pass phrase:**, use the pass phrase `1234` for testing with this article.    

3. When asked again **Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:**, use the pass phrase `1234` again.    

A test certificate file (*python-device.pem*) and private key file (*python-device.key.pem*) are generated in the directory where you ran the `openssl` command.


## Create an individual enrollment entry in DPS


The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments:

- [Enrollment groups](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group): Used to enroll multiple related devices.
- [Individual enrollments](concepts-service.md#individual-enrollment): Used to enroll a single device.

This article demonstrates an individual enrollment for a single device to be provisioned with an IoT hub.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your provisioning service.

2. From the Device Provisioning Service menu, select **Manage enrollments**. Select **Individual Enrollments** tab and select the **Add individual enrollment** button at the top. 

3. In the **Add Enrollment** panel, enter the following information:
   - Select **X.509** as the identity attestation *Mechanism*.
   - Under the *Primary certificate .pem or .cer file*, choose *Select a file* to select the certificate file **python-device.pem** if you are using the test certificate created earlier.
   - Optionally, you may provide the following information:
     - Select an IoT hub linked with your provisioning service.
     - Update the **Initial device twin state** with the desired initial configuration for the device.
   - Once complete, press the **Save** button. 

     [![Add individual enrollment for X.509 attestation in the portal](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device-x509/device-enrollment.png)](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device-x509/device-enrollment.png#lightbox)

   Upon successful enrollment, your X.509 device appears as **Python-device-01** under the *Registration ID* column in the *Individual Enrollments* tab. This registration value comes from the subject name on the device certificate. 

## Simulate the device

The Python provisioning sample, [provision_x509.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py) is located in the `azure-iot-sdk-python/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios` directory. This sample uses six environment variables to authenticate and provision an IoT device using DPS. These environment variables are:

| Variable name              | Description                                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `PROVISIONING_HOST`        |  This value is the global endpoint used for connecting to your DPS resource |    
| `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE`     |  This value is the ID Scope for your DPS resource |    
| `DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID` |  This value is the ID for your device. It must also match the subject name on the device certificate |    
| `X509_CERT_FILE`           |  Your device certificate filename |    
| `X509_KEY_FILE`            |  The private key filename for your device certificate |
| `PASS_PHRASE`              |  The pass phrase you used to encrypt the certificate and private key file (`1234`). |    

1. From the Device Provisioning Service menu, select **Overview**. Note your _ID Scope_ and _Global device endpoint_.

    ![Service information](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device-x509/extract-dps-endpoints.png)

2. In your Git Bash prompt, use the following commands add the environment variables for the global device endpoint and ID Scope.

    ```bash
    $export PROVISIONING_HOST=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    $export PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE=<ID scope for your DPS resource>
    ```

3. The registration ID for the IoT device must match subject name on its device certificate. If you generated a self-signed test certificate, `Python-device-01` is the subject name and registration ID for the device. 

    If you already have a device certificate, you can use `certutil` to verify the subject common name used for your device as shown below for a self-signed test certificate:

    ```bash
    $ certutil python-device.pem
    X509 Certificate:
    Version: 3
    Serial Number: fa33152fe1140dc8
    Signature Algorithm:
        Algorithm ObjectId: 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11 sha256RSA
        Algorithm Parameters:
        05 00
    Issuer:
        CN=Python-device-01
      Name Hash(sha1): 1dd88de40e9501fb64892b698afe12d027011000
      Name Hash(md5): a62c784820daa931b9d3977739b30d12
    
     NotBefore: 1/29/2021 7:05 PM
     NotAfter: 1/29/2022 7:05 PM
    
    Subject:

      Name Hash(sha1): 1dd88de40e9501fb64892b698afe12d027011000
      Name Hash(md5): a62c784820daa931b9d3977739b30d12
    ```

    In the Git Bash prompt, set the environment variable for the registration ID as follows:

    ```bash
    $export DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID=Python-device-01
    ```

4. In the Git Bash prompt, set the environment variables for the certificate file, private key file, and pass phrase.

    ```bash
    $export X509_CERT_FILE=./python-device.pem
    $export X509_KEY_FILE=./python-device.key.pem
    $export PASS_PHRASE=1234
    ```

5. Review the code for [provision_x509.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py) If your not using **Python version 3.7** or later, make the [code change mentioned here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/master/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios#advanced-iot-hub-scenario-samples-for-the-azure-iot-hub-device-sdk) to replace `asyncio.run(main())` and save your change. 

6. Run the sample. The sample will connect, provision the device to a hub, and send some test messages to the hub.

    ```bash
    $ winpty python azure-iot-sdk-python/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py
    RegistrationStage(RequestAndResponseOperation): Op will transition into polling after interval 2.  Setting timer.
    The complete registration result is

    done sending message #9
    done sending message #1
    done sending message #6
    done sending message #10
    done sending message #3
    ```

7. In the portal, navigate to the IoT hub linked to your provisioning service and open the **IoT devices** blade located under the **Explorers** section in the left menu. On successful provisioning of the simulated X.509 device to the hub, its device ID appears on the **Device Explorer** blade, with *STATUS* as **enabled**. You might need to press the **Refresh** button at the top if you already opened the blade prior to running the sample device application.
