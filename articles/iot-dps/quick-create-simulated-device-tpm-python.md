# Quickstart: Create and provision a simulated TPM device using Python device SDK for IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-tpm](../../includes/iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-tpm.md)]

In this quickstart, you create a simulated IoT device on a Windows computer. The simulated device includes a TPM simulator as a Hardware Security Module (HSM). You use device sample Python code to connect this simulated device with your IoT hub using an individual enrollment with the Device Provisioning Service (DPS).

## Prerequisites

- Familiar with [provisioning](about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) concepts.
- Completion of [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md).
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- [Visual Studio 2015+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with Desktop development with C++.
- [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article only applies to the deprecated V1 Python SDK. Device and service clients for the Iot Hub Device Provisioning Service are not yet available in V2. The team is currently hard at work to bring V2 to feature parity.

[!INCLUDE [IoT Device Provisioning Service basic](../../includes/iot-dps-basic.md)]

## Prepare the environment 

1. Make sure you have installed either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2015 or later, with the 'Desktop development with C++' workload enabled for your Visual Studio installation.

1. Download and install the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

1. Open a command prompt or Git Bash. Clone the GitHub repo for device simulation code sample:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone --single-branch --branch v1-deprecated https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git --recursive
    ```

1. Create a folder in your local copy of this GitHub repo for CMake build process. 

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-python/c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

1. The code sample uses a Windows TPM simulator. Run the following command to enable the SAS token authentication. It also generates a Visual Studio solution for the simulated device.

    ```cmd/sh
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=ON ..
    ```

1. In a separate command prompt, navigate to the TPM simulator folder and run the [TPM](/windows/device-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) simulator to be the [HSM](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-iot-supports-new-security-hardware-to-strengthen-iot-security/) for the simulated device. Click **Allow Access**. It listens over a socket on ports 2321 and 2322. Do not close this command window; you will need to keep this simulator running until the end of this quickstart guide. 

    ```cmd/sh
    .\azure-iot-sdk-python\c\provisioning_client\deps\utpm\tools\tpm_simulator\Simulator.exe
    ```

## Create a device enrollment entry

The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments:

- [Enrollment groups](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group): Used to enroll multiple related devices.
- [Individual enrollments](concepts-service.md#individual-enrollment): Used to enroll a single device.

This article demonstrates individual enrollments.

1. Open the solution generated in the *cmake* folder named `azure_iot_sdks.sln`, and build it in Visual Studio.

1. Right-click the **tpm_device_provision** project and select **Set as Startup Project**. Run the solution. The output window displays the **_Endorsement key_** and the **_Registration ID_** needed for device enrollment. Note down these values. 

    ![TPM setup](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/tpm-setup.png)

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your Device Provisioning service.

1. From the Device Provisioning Service menu, select **Manage enrollments**. Select **Individual Enrollments** tab and select the **Add individual enrollment** button at the top. 

1. In the **Add Enrollment** panel, enter the following information:
   - Select **TPM** as the identity attestation *Mechanism*.
   - Enter the *Registration ID* and *Endorsement key* for your TPM device from the values you noted previously.
   - Select an IoT hub linked with your provisioning service.
   - Optionally, you may provide the following information:
       - Enter a unique *Device ID*. Make sure to avoid sensitive data while naming your device. If you choose not to provide one, the registration ID will be used to identify the device instead.
       - Update the **Initial device twin state** with the desired initial configuration for the device.
   - Once complete, press the **Save** button. 

     ![Enter device enrollment information in the portal blade](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/enterdevice-enrollment.png)  

   On successful enrollment, the *Registration ID* of your device will appear in the list under the *Individual Enrollments* tab. 


## Simulate the device

1. Download and install [Python 2.x or 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variables.
    - If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/v1-deprecated/doc/python-devbox-setup.md) to build the Python packages.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If running the `build_client.cmd` make sure to use the `--use-tpm-simulator` flag.
   > 
   > [!NOTE]
   > If using `pip` make sure to also install the `azure-iot-provisioning-device-client` package. Note that the released PIP packages are using the real TPM, not the simulator. To use the simulator you need to compile from the source using the `--use-tpm-simulator` flag.

1. Navigate to the samples folder.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-python/provisioning_device_client/samples
    ```

1. Using your Python IDE, edit the python script named **provisioning\_device\_client\_sample.py**. Modify the *GLOBAL\_PROV\_URI* and  *ID\_SCOPE* variables to the values noted previously. Also make sure *SECURITY\_DEVICE\_TYPE* is set to `ProvisioningSecurityDeviceType.TPM`

    ```python
    GLOBAL_PROV_URI = "{globalServiceEndpoint}"
    ID_SCOPE = "{idScope}"
    SECURITY_DEVICE_TYPE = ProvisioningSecurityDeviceType.TPM
    PROTOCOL = ProvisioningTransportProvider.HTTP
    ```

    ![Service information](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/extract-dps-endpoints.png)

1. Run the sample. 

    ```cmd/sh
    python provisioning_device_client_sample.py
    ```

1. Notice the messages that simulate the device booting and connecting to the Device Provisioning Service to get your IoT hub information. 

    ![Successful registration](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/registration-success.png)

1. On successful provisioning of your simulated device to the IoT hub linked with your provisioning service, the device ID appears on the hub's **IoT devices** blade.

    ![Device is registered with the IoT hub](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/hubregistration.png) 

    If you changed the *initial device twin state* from the default value in the enrollment entry for your device, it can pull the desired twin state from the hub and act accordingly. For more information, see [Understand and use device twins in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md)
