# Create and provision a simulated TPM device using Python device SDK for IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-tpm](../../includes/iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-tpm.md)]

These steps show how to create a simulated device on your development machine running Windows OS, run the Windows TPM simulator as the [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-iot-supports-new-security-hardware-to-strengthen-iot-security/) of the device, and use the Python code sample to connect this simulated device with the Device Provisioning Service and your IoT hub. 

If you're unfamiliar with the process of autoprovisioning, be sure to also review [Auto-provisioning concepts](concepts-auto-provisioning.md). Also make sure you've completed the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before continuing. 

The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments:
- [Enrollment groups](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group): Used to enroll multiple related devices.
- [Individual Enrollments](concepts-service.md#individual-enrollment): Used to enroll a single device.

This article will demonstrate individual enrollments.

[!INCLUDE [IoT Device Provisioning Service basic](../../includes/iot-dps-basic.md)]

## Prepare the environment 

1. Make sure you have installed either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2015 or later, with the 'Desktop development with C++' workload enabled for your Visual Studio installation.

1. Download and install the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

1. Open a command prompt or Git Bash. Clone the GitHub repo for device simulation code sample:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git --recursive
    ```

1. Create a folder in your local copy of this GitHub repo for CMake build process. 

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-python/c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

1. The code sample uses a Windows TPM simulator. Run the following command to enable the SAS token authentication. It also generates a Visual Studio solution for the simulated device.

    ```cmd/sh
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=ON ..
    ```

1. In a separate command prompt, navigate to the TPM simulator folder and run the [TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/device-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) simulator. Click **Allow Access**. It listens over a socket on ports 2321 and 2322. Do not close this command window; you will need to keep this simulator running until the end of this Quickstart guide. 

    ```cmd/sh
    .\azure-iot-sdk-python\c\provisioning_client\deps\utpm\tools\tpm_simulator\Simulator.exe
    ```

## Create a device enrollment entry

1. Open the solution generated in the *cmake* folder named `azure_iot_sdks.sln`, and build it in Visual Studio.

1. Right-click the **tpm_device_provision** project and select **Set as Startup Project**. Run the solution. The output window displays the **_Endorsement Key_** and the **_Registration ID_** needed for device enrollment. Note down these values.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, click on the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your Device Provisioning service.

1. On the Device Provisioning Service summary blade, select **Manage enrollments**. Select **Individual Enrollments** tab and click the **Add individual enrollment** button at the top. 

1. Under the **Add Enrollment**, enter the following information:
   - Select **TPM** as the identity attestation *Mechanism*.
   - Enter the *Registration ID* and *Endorsement key* for your TPM device. 
   - Select an IoT hub linked with your provisioning service.
   - Enter a unique device ID. Make sure to avoid sensitive data while naming your device.
   - Update the **Initial device twin state** with the desired initial configuration for the device.
   - Once complete, click the **Save** button. 

     ![Enter device enrollment information in the portal blade](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/enterdevice-enrollment.png)  

   On successful enrollment, the *Registration ID* of your device will appear in the list under the *Individual Enrollments* tab. 


## Simulate the device

1. Download and install [Python 2.x or 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variables.
    - If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48145) to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/doc/python-devbox-setup.md) to build the Python packages.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If running the `build_client.cmd` make sure to use the `--use-tpm-simulator` flag.
   > 
   > [!NOTE]
   > If using `pip` make sure to also install the `azure-iot-provisioning-device-client` package. Note that the released PIP packages are using the real TPM, not the simulator. To use the simulator you need to compile from the source using the `--use-tpm-simulator` flag.

1. Navigate to the samples folder.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-python/provisioning_device_client/samples
    ```

1. Using your Python IDE, edit the python script named **provisioning\_device\_client\_sample.py**. Modify the *GLOBAL\_PROV\_URI* and  *ID\_SCOPE* variables to the values noted previously. Also make sure *SECURITY\_DEVICE\_TYPE* is set to `ProvisioningSecurityDeviceType.TPM`

    ```python
    GLOBAL_PROV_URI = "{globalServiceEndpoint}"
    ID_SCOPE = "{idScope}"
    SECURITY_DEVICE_TYPE = ProvisioningSecurityDeviceType.TPM
    PROTOCOL = ProvisioningTransportProvider.HTTP
    ```

    ![Service information](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/extract-dps-endpoints.png)

1. Run the sample. 

    ```cmd/sh
    python provisioning_device_client_sample.py
    ```

1. Notice the messages that simulate the device booting and connecting to the Device Provisioning Service to get your IoT hub information. 

    ![Successful registration](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/registration-success.png)

1. On successful provisioning of your simulated device to the IoT hub linked with your provisioning service, the device ID appears on the hub's **Device Explorer** blade.

    ![Device is registered with the IoT hub](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/hubregistration.png) 

    If you changed the *initial device twin state* from the default value in the enrollment entry for your device, it can pull the desired twin state from the hub and act accordingly. For more information, see [Understand and use device twins in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md)


## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working on and exploring the device client sample, do not clean up the resources created in this Quickstart. If you do not plan to continue, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this Quickstart.

1. Close the device client sample output window on your machine.
1. Close the TPM simulator window on your machine.
1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your Device Provisioning service. Open the **Manage Enrollments** blade for your service, and then click the **Individual Enrollments** tab. Select the *REGISTRATION ID* of the device you enrolled in this Quickstart, and click the **Delete** button at the top. 
1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your IoT hub. Open the **IoT Devices** blade for your hub, select the *DEVICE ID* of the device you registered in this Quickstart, and then click **Delete** button at the top.

## Next steps

In this Quickstart, youâ€™ve created a TPM simulated device on your machine and provisioned it to your IoT hub using the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. To learn how to enroll your TPM device programmatically, continue to the Quickstart for programmatic enrollment of a TPM device.
