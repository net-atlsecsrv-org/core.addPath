# Quickstart: Provision a Python device with symmetric keys

In this quickstart, you will learn how to provision a Windows development machine as a device to an IoT hub using Python. This device will use a symmetric key and an individual enrollment to authenticate with a Device Provisioning Service (DPS) instance in order to be assigned to an IoT hub. Sample code from the [Azure IoT Python SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python) will be used to provision the device. 

Although this article demonstrates provisioning with an individual enrollment, you can also use enrollment groups. There are some differences when using enrollment groups. For example, you must use a derived device key with a unique registration ID for the device. Although symmetric key enrollment groups are not limited to legacy devices, [How to provision legacy devices using Symmetric key attestation](how-to-legacy-device-symm-key.md) provides an enrollment group example. For more information, see [Group Enrollments for Symmetric Key Attestation](concepts-symmetric-key-attestation.md#group-enrollments).

If you're unfamiliar with the process of auto-provisioning, review the [provisioning](about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) overview. 

Also, make sure you've completed the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before continuing with this quickstart. This quickstart requires you to have already created your Device Provisioning Service instance.

This article is oriented toward a Windows-based workstation. However, you can perform the procedures on Linux. For a Linux example, see [How to provision for multitenancy](how-to-provision-multitenant.md).

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you have [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed on your Windows-based machine. You can check your version of Python by running `python --version`.

* Latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) installed.

## Prepare the Python SDK environment 

1. Make sure Git is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

2. Open a command prompt. Clone the GitHub repo for the Azure IoT Python SDK:
    
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git --recursive
    ```
3. Navigate to the `azure-iot-sdk-python\azure-iot-device\samples\async-hub-scenarios` directory where the sample file, _provision_symmetric_key.py_, is located.
   
   ```console
   cd azure-iot-sdk-python\azure-iot-device\samples\async-hub-scenarios
   ```
4. Install the _azure-iot-device_ library by running the following command.

    ```console
    pip install azure-iot-device
    ```


## Create a device enrollment

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your Device Provisioning service (DPS) instance.

2. Select the **Manage enrollments** tab, and then select the **Add individual enrollment** button at the top. 

3. In the **Add Enrollment** panel, enter the following information, and press the **Save** button.

   - **Mechanism**: Select **Symmetric Key** as the identity attestation *Mechanism*.

   - **Auto-generate keys**: Check this box.

   - **Registration ID**: Enter a registration ID to identify the enrollment. Use only lowercase alphanumeric and dash ('-') characters. For example, **symm-key-python-device-008**.

   - **IoT Hub Device ID:** Enter a device identifier. For example, **python-device-008**.

     ![Add individual enrollment for symmetric key attestation in the portal](./media/quick-create-device-symm-key-python/create-individual-enrollment-python.png)

4. Once you have saved your enrollment, the **Primary Key** and **Secondary Key** will be generated and added to the enrollment entry. Your symmetric key device enrollment appears as **symm-key-python-device-008** under the *Registration ID* column in the *Individual Enrollments* tab. 

5. Open the enrollment and copy the value of your generated **Primary Key**. You will use this key value and the **Registration ID** later when you add environment variables for use with the device provisioning sample code.

## Prepare the device provisioning code

In this section, you will add the following four environment variables that will be used as parameters for the device provisioning sample code for your symmetric key device. 

* `PROVISIONING_HOST`
* `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE`
* `PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID`
* `PROVISIONING_SYMMETRIC_KEY`

The provisioning code will contact the DPS instance based on these variables in order to authenticate your device. The device will then be assigned to an IoT hub already linked to the DPS instance based on the individual enrollment configuration. Once provisioned, the sample code will send some test telemetry to the IoT hub.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on your Device Provisioning Service menu, select **Overview** and copy your _Service Endpoint_ and _ID Scope_. You will use these values for the `PROVISIONING_HOST` and `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE` environment variables.

    ![Service information](./media/quick-create-device-symm-key-python/extract-dps-endpoints.png)

2. In your Python command prompt, add the environment variables using the values you copied. 

    The following commands are examples to show command syntax. Make sure to use your correct values.

    ```console
    set PROVISIONING_HOST=test-dps-docs.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    ```

    ```console
    set PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE=0ne00000A0A
    ```

3. In your Python command prompt, add the environment variables for the registration ID and symmetric key you copied from the individual enrollment in the previous section. 

    The following commands are examples to show command syntax. Make sure to use your correct values.

    ```console
    set PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID=symm-key-python-device-008
    ```

    ```console
    set PROVISIONING_SYMMETRIC_KEY=sbDDeEzRuEuGKag+kQKV+T1QGakRtHpsERLP0yPjwR93TrpEgEh/Y07CXstfha6dhIPWvdD1nRxK5T0KGKA+nQ==
    ```

4. Run the python sample code in _provision_symmetric_key.py_.

    ```console
    D:\azure-iot-sdk-python\azure-iot-device\samples\async-hub-scenarios>python provision_symmetric_key.py
    ```

5. The expected output should look similar to the following which shows the linked IoT hub that the device was assigned to based on the individual enrollment settings. Some example wind speed telemetry messages are also sent to the hub as a test:

    ```output
    D:\azure-iot-sdk-python\azure-iot-device\samples\async-hub-scenarios>python provision_symmetric_key.py
    RegistrationStage(RequestAndResponseOperation): Op will transition into polling after interval 2.  Setting timer.
    The complete registration result is
    python-device-008
    docs-test-iot-hub.azure-devices.net
    initialAssignment
    null
    Will send telemetry from the provisioned device

    sending message #9
    sending message #3
    sending message #10
    sending message #4
    sending message #2
    sending message #6
    sending message #7
    sending message #1
    sending message #5
    done sending message #8
    done sending message #9
    done sending message #3
    done sending message #10
    done sending message #4
    done sending message #2
    done sending message #6
    done sending message #7
    done sending message #1
    done sending message #5
    ```
    
6. In the Azure portal, navigate to the IoT hub linked to your provisioning service and open the **IoT devices** blade. After successfully provisioning the symmetric key device to the hub, the device ID is shown with *STATUS* as **enabled**. You might need to press the **Refresh** button at the top if you already opened the blade prior to running the device sample code.
