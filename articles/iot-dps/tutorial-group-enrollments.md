# Tutorial: Create and provision a simulated X.509 device using Java device and service SDK and group enrollments for IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

These steps show how to simulate an X.509 device on your development machine running Windows OS, and use a code sample to connect this simulated device with the Device Provisioning Service and your IoT hub using enrollment groups. 

Make sure to complete the steps in the [Setup IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before you proceed.


## Prepare the environment 

1. Make sure you have [Java SE Development Kit 8](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks) installed on your machine.

1. Download and install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

1. Use the following [Certificate Overview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md) to create your test certificates.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This step requires [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), which can either be built and installed from source or downloaded and installed from a [3rd-party](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) such as [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openssl/). If you have already created your _root_, _intermediate_ and _device_ certificates you may skip this step.
    >

    1. Run through the first two steps to create your _root_ and _intermediate_ certificates.

    1. Sign in to the Azure portal, click on the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your provisioning service.

        1. On the Device Provisioning Service summary blade, select **Certificates** and click the **Add** button at the top.

        1. Under the **Add Certificate**, enter the following information:
            - Enter a unique certificate name.
            - Select the **_RootCA.pem_** file you created.
            - Once complete, click the **Save** button.

           ![Add certificate](./media/tutorial-group-enrollments/add-certificate.png)

        1. Select the newly created certificate:
            - Click **Generate Verification Code**. Copy the code generated.
            - Run the verification step. Enter the _verification code_ or right-click to paste in your running PowerShell window.  Press **Enter**.
            - Select the newly created **_verifyCert4.pem_** file in the Azure portal. Click **Verify**.

              ![Validate certificate](./media/tutorial-group-enrollments/validate-certificate.png)

    1. Finish by running the steps to create your device certificates and clean-up resources.

       > [!NOTE]
       > When creating device certificates be sure to use only lower-case alphanumerics and hyphens in your device name.
       >


## Create a device enrollment entry

1. Open a command prompt. Clone the GitHub repo for Java SDK code samples:

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git --recursive
    ```

1. In the downloaded source code, navigate to the sample folder **_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/service-enrollment-group-sample_**. Open the file **_/src/main/java/samples/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_** in an editor of your choice, and add the following details:

    1. Add the `[Provisioning Connection String]` for your provisioning service, from the portal as following:

        1. Navigate to your provisioning service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

        1. Open the **Shared access policies**, and select a policy that has the *EnrollmentWrite* permission.

        1. Copy the **Primary key connection string**.

            ![Get the provisioning connection string from portal](./media/tutorial-group-enrollments/provisioning-string.png)  

        1. In the sample code file **_ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_**, replace the `[Provisioning Connection String]` with the **Primary key connection string**.

            ```java
            private static final String PROVISIONING_CONNECTION_STRING = "[Provisioning Connection String]";
            ```

    1. Open your intermediate signing certificate file in a text editor. Update the `PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING` value with the value of your intermediate signing certificate.

        If you generated your device certificates with Bash shell, *./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem* contains the intermediate certificate key. If your certs were generated with PowerShell, *./Intermediate1.pem* will be your intermediate certificate file.

        ```java
        private static final String PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING =
                "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
        ```

    1. Navigate to the IoT hub linked to your provisioning service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Open the **Overview** tab for the hub, and copy the **Hostname**. Assign this **Hostname** to the *IOTHUB_HOST_NAME* parameter.

        ```java
        private static final String IOTHUB_HOST_NAME = "[Host name].azure-devices.net";
        ```

    1. Study the sample code. It creates, updates, queries, and deletes a group enrollment for X.509 devices. To verify successful enrollment in portal, temporarily comment out the following lines of code at the end of the _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_ file:

        ```java
        // ************************************** Delete info of enrollmentGroup ***************************************
        System.out.println("\nDelete the enrollmentGroup...");
        provisioningServiceClient.deleteEnrollmentGroup(enrollmentGroupId);
        ```

    1. Save the file _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_.

1. Open a command window, and navigate to the folder **_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/service-enrollment-group-sample_**.

1. Build the sample code by using this command:

    ```cmd\sh
    mvn install -DskipTests
    ```

1. Run the sample by using these commands at the command window:

    ```cmd\sh
    cd target
    java -jar ./service-enrollment-group-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

1. Observe the output window for successful enrollment.

    ![Successful enrollment](./media/tutorial-group-enrollments/enrollment.png) 

1. Navigate to your provisioning service in the Azure portal. Click **Manage enrollments**. Notice that your group of X.509 devices appears under the **Enrollment Groups** tab, with an auto-generated *GROUP NAME*.

## Simulate the device

1. On the Device Provisioning Service summary blade, select **Overview** and note your _ID Scope_ and _Provisioning Service Global Endpoint_.

    ![Service information](./media/tutorial-group-enrollments/extract-dps-endpoints.png)

1. Open a command prompt. Navigate to the sample project folder.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/provisioning-X509-sample
    ```

1. Edit `/src/main/java/samples/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/ProvisioningX509Sample.java` to include your _ID Scope_ and _Provisioning Service Global Endpoint_ that you noted previously.

    ```java
    private static final String idScope = "[Your ID scope here]";
    private static final String globalEndpoint = "[Your Provisioning Service Global Endpoint here]";
    private static final ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol PROVISIONING_DEVICE_CLIENT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL = ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol.HTTPS;
    private static final int MAX_TIME_TO_WAIT_FOR_REGISTRATION = 10000; // in milli seconds
    private static final String leafPublicPem = "<Your Public PEM Certificate here>";
    private static final String leafPrivateKey = "<Your Private PEM Key here>";
    ```

1. Update the `leafPublicPem` and `leafPrivateKey` variables with your public and private device certificates.

    If you generated your device certificates with PowerShell, the files mydevice* contain the public key, private key, and PFX for the device.

    If you generated your device certificates with Bash shell, ./certs/new-device.cert.pem contains the public key. The device's private key will be in the ./private/new-device.key.pem file.

    Open your public key file and update the `leafPublicPem` variable with that value. Copy the text from _-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----_ to _-----END PRIVATE KEY-----_.

    ```java
    private static final String leafPublicPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
    ```

    Open your private key file and update the `leafPrivatePem` variable with that value. Copy the text from _-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----_ to _-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----_.

    ```java
    private static final String leafPrivateKey = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n";
    ```

1. Add a new variable just below `leafPrivateKey` for your intermediate certificate. Name this new variable `intermediateKey`. Give it the value of your intermediate signing certificate.

    If you generated your device certificates with Bash shell, *./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem* contains the intermediate certificate key. If your certs were generated with PowerShell, *./Intermediate1.pem* will be your intermediate certificate file.

    ```java
    private static final String intermediateKey = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
    ```

1. In the `main` function, add the `intermediateKey` to the `signerCertificates` collection before the initialization of `securityProviderX509`.

    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
    {
        ...

        try
        {
            ProvisioningStatus provisioningStatus = new ProvisioningStatus();

            // Add intermediate certificate as part of the certificate key chain.
            signerCertificates.add(intermediateKey);

            SecurityProvider securityProviderX509 = new SecurityProviderX509Cert(leafPublicPem, leafPrivateKey, signerCertificates);
    ```

1. Save your changes and build the sample. Navigate to the target folder and execute the created jar file.

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean install
    cd target
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

    ![Successful registration](./media/tutorial-group-enrollments/registration.png)

1. In the portal, navigate to the IoT hub linked to your provisioning service and open the **Device Explorer** blade. On successful provisioning of the simulated X.509 device to the hub, its device ID appears on the **Device Explorer** blade, with *STATUS* as **enabled**. Note that you might need to click the **Refresh** button at the top if you already opened the blade prior to running the sample device application.
