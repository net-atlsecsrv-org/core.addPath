# Tutorial: Configure cloud resources for device provisioning with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

This tutorial shows how to set up the cloud for automatic device provisioning using the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use the Azure portal to create an IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and get the ID scope
> * Create an IoT hub
> * Link the IoT hub to the Device Provisioning Service
> * Set the allocation policy on the Device Provisioning Service

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a Device Provisioning Service instance and get the ID scope

Follow these steps to create a new Device Provisioning Service instance.

1. In the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal, click **Create a resource**.

2. In the Search box, type **device provisioning**. 

3. Click **IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service**.

4. Fill out the **IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service** form with the following information:
	
   | Setting       | Suggested value | Description | 
   | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
   | **Name** | Any unique name | -- | 
   | **Subscription** | Your subscription  | For details about your subscriptions, see [Subscriptions](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). |
   | **Resource group** | myResourceGroup | For valid resource group names, see [Naming rules and restrictions](/azure/architecture/best-practices/resource-naming). |
   | **Location** | Any valid location | For information about regions, see [Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/). |   

   ![Enter basic information about your Device Provisioning service in the portal](./media/tutorial-set-up-cloud/create-iot-dps-portal.png)

5. Click **Create**. After a few moments, the Device Provisioning Service instance is created and the **Overview** page is displayed.

6. On the **Overview** page for the new service instance, copy the value for the **ID scope** for use later. That value is used to identify registration IDs, and provides a guarantee that the registration ID is unique.

7. Also, copy the **Service endpoint** value for later use. 

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

### Retrieve connection string for IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-connection-string.md)]

You have now created your IoT hub, and you have the host name and IoT Hub connection string that you need to complete the rest of this tutorial.

## Link the Device Provisioning Service to an IoT hub

The next step is to link the Device Provisioning Service and IoT hub so that the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service can register devices to that hub. The service can only provision devices to IoT hubs that have been linked to the Device Provisioning Service. Follow these steps.

1. In the **All resources** page, click the Device Provisioning Service instance you created previously.

2. In the Device Provisioning Service page, click **Linked IoT hubs**.

3. Click **Add**.

4. In the **Add link to IoT hub** page, provide the following information, and click **Save**:

    * **Subscription:** Make sure the subscription that contains the IoT hub is selected. You can link to IoT hub that resides in a different subscription.

    * **IoT hub:** Choose the name of the IoT hub that you want to link with this Device Provisioning Service instance.

    * **Access Policy:** Select **iothubowner** as the credentials to use for establishing the link to the IoT hub.

## Set the allocation policy on the Device Provisioning Service

The allocation policy is an IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service setting that determines how devices are assigned to an IoT hub. There are three supported allocation policies: 

1. **Lowest latency**: Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub based on the hub with the lowest latency to the device.

2. **Evenly weighted distribution** (default): Linked IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned to them. This setting is the default. If you are provisioning devices to only one IoT hub, you can keep this setting. 

3. **Static configuration via the enrollment list**: Specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list takes priority over the Device Provisioning Service-level allocation policy.

To set the allocation policy, in the Device Provisioning Service page click **Manage allocation policy**. Make sure the allocation policy is set to **Evenly weighted distribution** (the default). If you make any changes, click **Save** when you are done.

## Clean up resources

Other tutorials in this collection build upon this tutorial. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quick starts or with the tutorials, do not clean up the resources created in this tutorial. If you do not plan to continue, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this tutorial in the Azure portal.

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service instance. At the top of the **All resources** page, click **Delete**.  

2. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your IoT hub. At the top of the **All resources** page, click **Delete**.
