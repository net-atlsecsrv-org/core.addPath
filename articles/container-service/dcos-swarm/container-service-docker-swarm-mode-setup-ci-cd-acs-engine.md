# (DEPRECATED) Full CI/CD pipeline to deploy a multi-container application on Azure Container Service with ACS Engine and Docker Swarm Mode using Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [ACS deprecation](../../../includes/container-service-deprecation.md)]

*This article is based on 
[Full CI/CD pipeline to deploy a multi-container application on Azure Container Service with Docker Swarm using Azure DevOps](container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd.md) documentation*

Nowadays, One of the biggest challenges when developing modern applications for the cloud is being able to deliver these applications continuously. In this article, you learn how to implement a full continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using: 
* Azure Container Service Engine with Docker Swarm Mode
* Azure Container Registry
* Azure DevOps

This article is based on a simple application, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jcorioland/MyShop/tree/docker-linux), developed with ASP.NET Core. The application is composed of four different services: three web APIs and one web front end:

![MyShop sample application](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/myshop-application.png)

The objective is to deliver this application continuously in a Docker Swarm Mode cluster, using Azure DevOps. The following figure details this continuous delivery pipeline:

![MyShop sample application](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/full-ci-cd-pipeline.png)

Here is a brief explanation of the steps:

1. Code changes are committed to the source code repository (here, GitHub) 
2. GitHub triggers a build in Azure DevOps 
3. Azure DevOps gets the latest version of the sources and builds all the images that compose the application 
4. Azure DevOps pushes each image to a Docker registry created using the Azure Container Registry service 
5. Azure DevOps triggers a new release 
6. The release runs some commands using SSH on the Azure container service cluster master node 
7. Docker Swarm Mode on the cluster pulls the latest version of the images 
8. The new version of the application is deployed using Docker Stack 

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you need to complete the following tasks:

- [Create a Swarm Mode cluster in Azure Container Service with ACS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-acsengine-swarmmode)
- [Connect with the Swarm cluster in Azure Container Service](../container-service-connect.md)
- [Create an Azure container registry](../../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal.md)
- [Have an Azure DevOps organization and project created](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization-msa-or-work-student)
- [Fork the GitHub repository to your GitHub account](https://github.com/jcorioland/MyShop/tree/docker-linux)

>[!NOTE]
> The Docker Swarm orchestrator in Azure Container Service uses legacy standalone Swarm. Currently, the integrated [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) (in Docker 1.12 and higher) is not a supported orchestrator in Azure Container Service. For this reason, we are using [ACS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/swarmmode.md), a community-contributed [quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-acsengine-swarmmode/), or a Docker solution in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).

## Step 1: Configure your Azure DevOps organization 

In this section, you configure your Azure DevOps organization. To configure Azure DevOps Services Endpoints, in your Azure DevOps project, click the **Settings** icon in the toolbar, and select **Services**.

![Open Services Endpoint](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/services-vsts.PNG)

### Connect Azure DevOps and Azure account

Set up a connection between your Azure DevOps project and your Azure account.

1. On the left, click **New Service Endpoint** > **Azure Resource Manager**.
2. To authorize Azure DevOps to work with your Azure account, select your **Subscription** and click **OK**.

    ![Azure DevOps - Authorize Azure](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-azure.PNG)

### Connect Azure DevOps and GitHub

Set up a connection between your Azure DevOps project and your GitHub account.

1. On the left, click **New Service Endpoint** > **GitHub**.
2. To authorize Azure DevOps to work with your GitHub account, click **Authorize** and follow the procedure in the window that opens.

    ![Azure DevOps - Authorize GitHub](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-github.png)

### Connect Azure DevOps to your Azure Container Service cluster

The last steps before getting into the CI/CD pipeline are to configure external connections to your Docker Swarm cluster in Azure. 

1. For the Docker Swarm cluster, add an endpoint of type **SSH**. Then enter the SSH connection information of your Swarm cluster (master node).

    ![Azure DevOps - SSH](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-ssh.png)

All the configuration is done now. In the next steps, you create the CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys the application to the Docker Swarm cluster. 

## Step 2: Create the build pipeline

In this step, you set up a build pipeline for your Azure DevOps project and define the build workflow for your container images

### Initial pipeline setup

1. To create a build pipeline, connect to your Azure DevOps project and click **Build & Release**. In the **Build definitions** section, click **+ New**. 

    ![Azure DevOps - New Build Pipeline](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/create-build-vsts.PNG)

2. Select the **Empty process**.

    ![Azure DevOps - New Empty Build Pipeline](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/create-empty-build-vsts.PNG)

4. Then, click the **Variables** tab and create two new variables: **RegistryURL** and **AgentURL**. Paste the values of your Registry and Cluster Agents DNS.

    ![Azure DevOps - Build Variables Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-variables.png)

5. On the **Build Definitions** page, open the **Triggers** tab and configure the build to use continuous integration with the fork of the MyShop project that you created in the prerequisites. Then, select **Batch changes**. Make sure that you select *docker-linux* as the **Branch specification**.

    ![Azure DevOps - Build Repository Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-github-repo-conf.PNG)


6. Finally, click the **Options** tab and configure the Default agent queue to **Hosted Linux Preview**.

    ![Azure DevOps - Host Agent Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-agent.png)

### Define the build workflow
The next steps define the build workflow. First, you need to configure the source of the code. To do it, select **GitHub** and your **repository** and **branch** (docker-linux).

![Azure DevOps - Configure code source](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-source-code.png)

There are five container images to build for the *MyShop* application. Each image is built using the Dockerfile located in the project folders:

* ProductsApi
* Proxy
* RatingsApi
* RecommendationsApi
* ShopFront

You need two Docker steps for each image, one to build the image, and one to push the image in the Azure container registry. 

1. To add a step in the build workflow, click **+ Add build step** and select **Docker**.

    ![Azure DevOps - Add Build Steps](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-add-task.png)

2. For each image, configure one step that uses the `docker build` command.

    ![Azure DevOps - Docker Build](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-docker-build.png)

    For the build operation, select your Azure Container Registry, the **Build an image** action, and the Dockerfile that defines each image. Set the **Working Directory** as the Dockerfile root directory, define the **Image Name**, and select **Include Latest Tag**.
    
    The Image Name has to be in this format: ```$(RegistryURL)/[NAME]:$(Build.BuildId)```. Replace **[NAME]** with the image name:
    - ```proxy```
    - ```products-api```
    - ```ratings-api```
    - ```recommendations-api```
    - ```shopfront```

3. For each image, configure a second step that uses the `docker push` command.

    ![Azure DevOps - Docker Push](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-docker-push.png)

    For the push operation, select your Azure container registry, the **Push an image** action, enter the **Image Name** that is built in the previous step and select **Include Latest Tag**.

4. After you configure the build and push steps for each of the five images, add three more steps in the build workflow.

   ![Azure DevOps - Add Command-Line Task](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-command-task.png)

   1. A command-line task that uses a bash script to replace the *RegistryURL* occurrence in the docker-compose.yml file with the RegistryURL variable. 
    
       ```-c "sed -i 's/RegistryUrl/$(RegistryURL)/g' src/docker-compose-v3.yml"```

       ![Azure DevOps - Update Compose file with Registry URL](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-replace-registry.png)

   2. A command-line task that uses a bash script to replace the *AgentURL* occurrence in the docker-compose.yml file with the AgentURL variable.
  
       ```-c "sed -i 's/AgentUrl/$(AgentURL)/g' src/docker-compose-v3.yml"```

      1. A task that drops the updated Compose file as a build artifact so it can be used in the release. See the following screen for details.

      ![Azure DevOps - Publish Artifact](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-publish.png) 

      ![Azure DevOps - Publish Compose file](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-publish-compose.png) 

5. Click **Save & queue** to test your build pipeline.

   ![Azure DevOps - Save and queue](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-save.png) 

   ![Azure DevOps - New Queue](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-queue.png) 

6. If the **Build** is correct, you have to see this screen:

   ![Azure DevOps - Build succeeded](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-succeeded.png) 

## Step 3: Create the release pipeline

Azure DevOps allows you to [manage releases across environments](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/release-management/). You can enable continuous deployment to make sure that your application is deployed on your different environments (such as dev, test, pre-production, and production) in a smooth way. You can create an environment that represents your Azure Container Service Docker Swarm Mode cluster.

![Azure DevOps - Release to ACS](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-acs.png) 

### Initial release setup

1. To create a release pipeline, click **Releases** > **+ Release**

2. To configure the artifact source, Click **Artifacts** > **Link an artifact source**. Here, link this new release pipeline to the build that you defined in the previous step. After that, the docker-compose.yml file is available in the release process.

    ![Azure DevOps - Release Artifacts](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-artefacts.png) 

3. To configure the release trigger, click **Triggers** and select **Continuous Deployment**. Set the trigger on the same artifact source. This setting ensures that a new release starts when the build completes successfully.

    ![Azure DevOps - Release Triggers](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-trigger.png) 

4. To configure the release variables, click **Variables** and select **+Variable** to create three new variables with the info of the registry: **docker.username**, **docker.password**, and **docker.registry**. Paste the values of your Registry and Cluster Agents DNS.

    ![Azure DevOps - Build Repository Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-variables.png)

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > As shown on the previous screen, click the **Lock** checkbox in docker.password. This setting is important to restrict the password.
    >

### Define the release workflow

The release workflow is composed of two tasks that you add.

1. Configure a task to securely copy the compose file to a *deploy* folder on the Docker Swarm master node, using the SSH connection you configured previously. See the following screen for details.
    
    Source folder: ```$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyShop-CI/drop```

    ![Azure DevOps - Release SCP](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-scp.png)

2. Configure a second task to execute a bash command to run `docker` and `docker stack deploy` commands on the master node. See the following screen for details.

    ```
    docker login -u $(docker.username) -p $(docker.password) $(docker.registry) && export DOCKER_HOST=:2375 && cd deploy && docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose-v3.yml myshop --with-registry-auth
    ```

    ![Azure DevOps - Release Bash](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-bash.png)

    The command executed on the master uses the Docker CLI and the Docker-Compose CLI to do the following tasks:

   - Log in to the Azure container registry (it uses three build variables that are defined in the **Variables** tab)
   - Define the **DOCKER_HOST** variable to work with the Swarm endpoint (:2375)
   - Navigate to the *deploy* folder that was created by the preceding secure copy task and that contains the docker-compose.yml file 
   - Execute `docker stack deploy` commands that pull the new images and create the containers.

     >[!IMPORTANT]
     > As shown on the previous screen, leave the **Fail on STDERR** checkbox unchecked. This setting allows us to complete the release process due to `docker-compose` prints several diagnostic messages, such as containers are stopping or being deleted, on the standard error output. If you check the checkbox, Azure DevOps reports that errors occurred during the release, even if all goes well.
     >
3. Save this new release pipeline.

## Step 4: Test the CI/CD pipeline

Now that you are done with the configuration, it's time to test this new CI/CD pipeline. The easiest way to test it is to update the source code and commit the changes into your GitHub repository. A few seconds after you push the code, you will see a new build running in Azure DevOps. Once completed successfully, a new release is triggered and deployed the new version of the application on the Azure Container Service cluster.
