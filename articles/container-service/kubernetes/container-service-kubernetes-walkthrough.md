# (DEPRECATED) Deploy Kubernetes cluster for Linux containers

> [!TIP]
> For the updated version this quickstart that uses Azure Kubernetes Service, see [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](../../aks/kubernetes-walkthrough.md).

[!INCLUDE [ACS deprecation](../../../includes/container-service-kubernetes-deprecation.md)]

In this quickstart, a Kubernetes cluster is deployed using the Azure CLI. A multi-container application consisting of web front end and a Redis instance is then deployed and run on the cluster. Once completed, the application is accessible over the internet. 

The example application used in this document is written in Python. The concepts and steps detailed here can be used to deploy any container image into a Kubernetes cluster. The code, Dockerfile, and pre-created Kubernetes manifest files related to this project are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis.git).

This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts, for detailed information on Kubernetes see the [Kubernetes documentation]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *westeurope* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westeurope
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup",
  "location": "westeurope",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "myResourceGroup",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}
```

## Create Kubernetes cluster

Create a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Service with the [az acs create](/cli/azure/acs#az-acs-create) command. The following example creates a cluster named *myK8sCluster* with one Linux master node and three Linux agent nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
az acs create --orchestrator-type kubernetes --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myK8sCluster --generate-ssh-keys
```

In some cases, such as with a limited trial, an Azure subscription has limited access to Azure resources. If the deployment fails due to limited available cores, reduce the default agent count by adding `--agent-count 1` to the [az acs create](/cli/azure/acs#az-acs-create) command. 

After several minutes, the command completes and returns json formatted information about the cluster. 

## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. 

If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, kubectl is already installed. If you want to install it locally, you can use the [az acs kubernetes install-cli](/cli/azure/acs/kubernetes) command.

To configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, run the [az acs kubernetes get-credentials](/cli/azure/acs/kubernetes) command. This step downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

```azurecli-interactive
az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=myResourceGroup --name=myK8sCluster
```

To verify the connection to your cluster, use the [kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command to return a list of the cluster nodes.

```console
kubectl get nodes
```

Output:

```output
NAME                    STATUS                     AGE       VERSION
k8s-agent-14ad53a1-0    Ready                      10m       v1.6.6
k8s-agent-14ad53a1-1    Ready                      10m       v1.6.6
k8s-agent-14ad53a1-2    Ready                      10m       v1.6.6
k8s-master-14ad53a1-0   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   10m       v1.6.6
```

## Run the application

A Kubernetes manifest file defines a desired state for the cluster, including what container images should be running. For this example, a manifest is used to create all objects needed to run the Azure Vote application. 

Create a file named `azure-vote.yml` and copy into it the following YAML. If you are working in Azure Cloud Shell, this file can be created using vi or Nano as if working on a virtual or physical system.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-back
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-back
        image: redis
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
          name: redis
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-back
---
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-front
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: microsoft/azure-vote-front:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-front
```

Use the [kubectl create](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#create) command to run the application.

```console
kubectl create -f azure-vote.yml
```

Output:

```output
deployment "azure-vote-back" created
service "azure-vote-back" created
deployment "azure-vote-front" created
service "azure-vote-front" created
```

## Test the application

As the application is run, a [Kubernetes service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) is created that exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete. 

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command with the `--watch` argument.

```console
kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
```

Initially the **EXTERNAL-IP** for the *azure-vote-front* service appears as *pending*. Once the EXTERNAL-IP address has changed from *pending* to an *IP address*, use `CTRL-C` to stop the kubectl watch process. 
  
```output
azure-vote-front   10.0.34.242   <pending>     80:30676/TCP   7s
azure-vote-front   10.0.34.242   52.179.23.131   80:30676/TCP   2m
```

You can now browse to the external IP address to see the Azure Vote App.

## Delete cluster
When the cluster is no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```

## Get the code

In this quickstart, pre-created container images have been used to create a Kubernetes deployment. The related application code, Dockerfile, and Kubernetes manifest file are available on GitHub.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and deployed a multi-container application to it.
