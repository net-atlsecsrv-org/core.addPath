# View and configure DDoS protection telemetry

Azure DDoS Protection standard provides detailed attack insights and visualization with DDoS Attack Analytics. Customers protecting their virtual networks against DDoS attacks have detailed visibility into attack traffic and actions taken to mitigate the attack via attack mitigation reports & mitigation flow logs. Rich telemetry is exposed via Azure Monitor including detailed metrics during the duration of a DDoS attack. Alerting can be configured for any of the Azure Monitor metrics exposed by DDoS Protection. Logging can be further integrated with [Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/connect-azure-ddos-protection.md), Splunk (Azure Event Hubs), OMS Log Analytics, and Azure Storage for advanced analysis via the Azure Monitor Diagnostics interface.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

### Metrics

> [!NOTE]
> While multiple options for **Aggregation** are displayed on Azure portal, only the aggregation types listed in the table below are supported for each metric. We apologize for this confusion and we are working to resolve it.

The following [metrics](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftnetworkpublicipaddresses) are available for Azure DDoS Protection Standard. These metrics are also exportable via diagnostic settings (see [View and configure DDoS diagnostic logging](diagnostic-logging.md)).

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Before you can complete the steps in this tutorial, you must first create a [Azure DDoS Standard protection plan](manage-ddos-protection.md) and DDoS Protection Standard must be enabled on a virtual network.
- DDoS monitors public IP addresses assigned to resources within a virtual network. If you don't have any resources with public IP addresses in the virtual network, you must first create a resource with a public IP address. You can monitor the public IP address of all resources deployed through Resource Manager (not classic) listed in [Virtual network for Azure services](../virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services.md#services-that-can-be-deployed-into-a-virtual-network) (including Azure Load Balancers where the backend virtual machines are in the virtual network), except for Azure App Service Environments. To continue with this tutorial, you can quickly create a [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) virtual machine.  

## View DDoS protection telemetry

Telemetry for an attack is provided through Azure Monitor in real time. Telemetry is available only when a public IP address has been under mitigation. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and browse to your DDoS Protection Plan.
2. Under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics**.
3. Select **Scope**. Select the **Subscription** that contains the public IP address you want to log, select **Public IP Address** for **Resource type**, then select the specific public IP address you want to log metrics for, and then select **Apply**.
4. Select the **Aggregation** type as **Max**.

The metric names present different packet types, and bytes vs. packets, with a basic construct of tag names on each metric as follows:

- **Dropped tag name** (for example, **Inbound Packets Dropped DDoS**): The number of packets dropped/scrubbed by the DDoS protection system.
- **Forwarded tag name** (for example **Inbound Packets Forwarded DDoS**): The number of packets forwarded by the DDoS system to the destination VIP – traffic that was not filtered.
- **No tag name** (for example **Inbound Packets DDoS**): The total number of packets that came into the scrubbing system – representing the sum of the packets dropped and forwarded.

## View DDoS mitigation policies

DDoS Protection Standard applies three auto-tuned mitigation policies (TCP SYN, TCP & UDP) for each public IP address of the protected resource, in the virtual network that has DDoS enabled. You can view the policy thresholds by selecting the  **Inbound TCP packets to trigger DDoS mitigation** and **Inbound UDP packets to trigger DDoS mitigation** metrics with **aggregation** type as 'Max', as shown in the following picture:

![View mitigation policies](./media/manage-ddos-protection/view-mitigation-policies.png)

Policy thresholds are auto-configured via Azure machine learning-based network traffic profiling. Only when the policy threshold is breached does DDoS mitigation occur for the IP address under attack.

## Validate and test

To simulate a DDoS attack to validate DDoS protection telemetry, see [Validate DDoS detection](test-through-simulations.md).

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

- Configure alerts for DDoS protection metrics
- View DDoS protection telemetry
- View DDoS mitigation policies
- Validate and test DDoS protection telemetry

To learn how to configure attack mitigation reports and flow logs, continue to the next tutorial.
