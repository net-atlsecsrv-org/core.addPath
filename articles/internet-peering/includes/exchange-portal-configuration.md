1. On the **Create a Peering** page, on the **Configuration** tab, fill in the boxes as shown.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Create a Peering page Exchange peering type](../media/setup-exchange-conf-tab.png)

    * For **Peering type**, select **Exchange**.
    * Select **SKU** as **Basic Free**.
    * Select the **Metro** location where you want to set up peering.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you already have peering connections with Microsoft in the selected **Metro** location and you're using the portal for the first time to set up peering in that location, your existing peering connections will be listed in the **Peering connections** section as shown. Microsoft will automatically convert these peering connections to an Azure resource so that you can manage them all along with the new connections in one place. For more information, see [Convert a legacy Exchange peering to an Azure resource by using the portal](../howto-legacy-exchange-portal.md).

        1. Enter the number of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes you'll advertise in the **Maximum advertised IPv4 addresses** and **Maximum advertised IPv6 addresses** boxes, respectively.
        1. Select **OK** to save your connection settings.
