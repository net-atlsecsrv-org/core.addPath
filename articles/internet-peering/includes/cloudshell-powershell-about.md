To run the cmdlets, you can use Azure Cloud Shell, a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Select **Copy** to copy the code, and paste it into Cloud Shell. Then select **Enter** to run it. There are a few ways to launch Cloud Shell:


| Launch Method | Screenshot  |
|-----------------------------------------------|---|
| Open Cloud Shell in your browser. | [![https://shell.azure.com/powershell](../media/launchcloudshell.png)](https://shell.azure.com/powershell) |
| Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the toolbar in the upper right of the Azure portal. | [![Cloud Shell in the portal](../media/cloud-shell-menu.png)](https://portal.azure.com) |

If you don't want to use Azure Cloud Shell, you can install PowerShell locally instead. If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, be sure to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. You typically need to update your PowerShell cmdlets to get the latest feature functionality. If you don't, you might encounter issues.

To find the version of PowerShell that you're running locally, use the **'Get-Module -ListAvailable Az'** cmdlet. To update, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/azurerm/install-azurerm-ps). For more information, see [how to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/azurerm/overview).

If you use PowerShell on macOS, follow the steps in [Installing PowerShell on macOS.](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-6)
