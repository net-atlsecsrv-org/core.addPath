PowerShell cmdlet **Get-AzPeeringLocation** returns a list of peering locations with the mandatory parameter `Kind`, which you'll use in later steps:

```powershell
Get-AzPeeringLocation -Kind "Exchange"
```

Exchange peering Locations contain the following fields:
* ExchangeName
* PeeringLocation
* Country
* PeeringDBFacilityId
* PeeringDBFacilityLink
* MicrosoftIPv4Address
* MicrosoftIPv6Address

Validate that you are present at the desired peering facility by referring to [PeeringDB](https://wwww.peeringdb.com).

Below is an example that shows how to use Seattle as the peering location to create a peering:

```powershell
$exchangeLocations = Get-AzPeeringLocation -Kind Exchange
$exchangeLocation = $exchangeLocations | where {$_.PeeringLocation -eq "Seattle"}

#check the location metadata
$exchangeLocation

ExchangeName          : Columbia IX
PeeringLocation       : Seattle
Country               : US
PeeringDBFacilityId   : 99999
PeeringDBFacilityLink : https://www.peeringdb.com/ix/99999
MicrosoftIPv4Address  : 10.12.97.129
MicrosoftIPv6Address  :

ExchangeName          : Equinix Seattle
PeeringLocation       : Seattle
Country               : US
PeeringDBFacilityId   : 11
PeeringDBFacilityLink : https://www.peeringdb.com/ix/11
MicrosoftIPv4Address  : 198.32.134.152
MicrosoftIPv6Address  : 2001:504:12::15
