# Associate peer ASN to Azure subscription using PowerShell

Before you submit a peering request, you should first associate your ASN with Azure subscription using the steps below.

If you prefer, you can complete this guide using the [portal](howto-subscription-association-portal.md).

### Working with Azure PowerShell
[!INCLUDE [CloudShell](./includes/cloudshell-powershell-about.md)]

## Create PeerASN to associate your ASN with Azure Subscription

### Sign in to your Azure account and select your subscription
[!INCLUDE [Account](./includes/account-powershell.md)]

### Register for peering resource provider
Register for peering resource provider in your subscription using the command below. If you do not execute this, then Azure resources required to set up peering are not accessible.

```powershell
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Peering
```

You can check the registration status using the commands below:
```powershell
Get-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Peering
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wait for *RegistrationState* to turn "Registered" before proceeding. It may take 5 to 30 minutes after you execute the command.

### Update the peer information associated with this subscription

Below is an example to update peer information.

```powershell
New-AzPeerAsn `
    -Name "Contoso_1234" `
    -PeerName "Contoso" `
    -PeerAsn 1234 `
    -Email noc@contoso.com, support@contoso.com `
    -Phone "+1 (555) 555-5555"
```

> [!NOTE]
> -Name corresponds to resource name and can be anything you choose. However, -peerName corresponds to your company's name and needs to be as close as possible to your PeeringDB profile. Note that value for -peerName supports only characters a-z, A-Z, and space.

A subscription can have multiple ASNs. Update the peering information for each ASN. Ensure that "name" is unique for each ASN.

Peers are expected to have a complete and up-to-date profile on [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com). We use this information during registration to validate the peer's details such as NOC information, technical contact information, and their presence at the peering facilities etc.

Note that in place of **{subscriptionId}** in the output above, actual subscription ID will be displayed.

## View status of a PeerASN

Check for ASN Validation state using the command below:

```powershell
Get-AzPeerAsn
```

Below is an example response:
```powershell
PeerContactInfo : Microsoft.Azure.PowerShell.Cmdlets.Peering.Models.PSContactInfo
PeerName        : Contoso
ValidationState : Approved
PeerAsnProperty : 1234
Name            : Contoso_1234
Id              : /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Peering/peerAsns/Contoso_1234
Type            : Microsoft.Peering/peerAsns
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wait for the ValidationState to turn "Approved" before submitting a peering request. It may take up to 12 hours for this approval.

## Modify PeerAsn
You may modify NOC contact information anytime.

Below is an example:

```powershell
Set-PeerAsn -Name Contoso_1234 -Email "newemail@test.com" -Phone "1800-000-0000"
```

## Delete PeerAsn
Deleting a PeerASN is not currently supported. If you need to delete PeerASN, contact [Microsoft peering](mailto:peering@microsoft.com).
