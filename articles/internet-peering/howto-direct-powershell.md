# Create or modify a Direct peering by using PowerShell

This article describes how to create a Microsoft Direct peering by using PowerShell cmdlets and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. This article also shows you how to check the status of the resource, update it, or delete and deprovision it.

If you prefer, you can complete this guide by using the Azure [portal](howto-direct-portal.md).

## Before you begin
* Review the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) and the [Direct peering walkthrough](walkthrough-direct-all.md) before you begin configuration.
* If you already have Direct peering connections with Microsoft that aren't converted to Azure resources, see [Convert a legacy Direct peering to an Azure resource by using PowerShell](howto-legacy-direct-powershell.md).

### Work with Azure PowerShell
