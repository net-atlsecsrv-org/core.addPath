# Azure security baseline for VPN Gateway

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to VPN Gateway. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to VPN Gateway. **Controls** not applicable to VPN Gateway have been excluded.

To see how VPN Gateway completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full VPN Gateway security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
