# Generate and export certificates

Point-to-Site connections use certificates to authenticate. This article shows you how to create a self-signed root certificate and generate client certificates using the Linux CLI and strongSwan. If you are looking for different certificate instructions, see the [Powershell](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md) or [MakeCert](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site-makecert.md) articles. For information about how to install strongSwan using the GUI instead of CLI, see the steps in the [Client configuration](point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert.md#install) article.

## Install strongSwan

[!INCLUDE [strongSwan Install](../../includes/vpn-gateway-strongswan-install-include.md)]

## Generate and export certificates

[!INCLUDE [strongSwan certificates](../../includes/vpn-gateway-strongswan-certificates-include.md)]

## Next steps

Continue with your Point-to-Site configuration to [Create and install VPN client configuration files](point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert.md#linuxinstallcli).
