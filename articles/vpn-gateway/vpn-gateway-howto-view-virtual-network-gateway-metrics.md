# View VPN Gateway metrics

You can monitor Azure VPN gateways using Azure Monitor. This article discusses metrics that are available through the portal. Metrics are lightweight and can support near real-time scenarios, making them useful for alerting and fast issue detection.


|**Metric**   | **Unit** | **Granularity** | **Description** | 
|---       | ---        | ---       | ---            | ---       |
|**AverageBandwidth**| Bytes/s  | 5 minutes| Average combined bandwidth utilization of all site-to-site connections on the gateway.     |
|**P2SBandwidth**| Bytes/s  | 1 minute  | Average combined bandwidth utilization of all point-to-site connections on the gateway.    |
|**P2SConnectionCount**| Count  | 1 minute  | Count of point-to-site connections on the gateway.   |
|**TunnelAverageBandwidth** | Bytes/s    | 5 minutes  | Average bandwidth utilization of tunnels created on the gateway. |
|**TunnelEgressBytes** | Bytes | 5 minutes | Outgoing traffic on tunnels created on the gateway.   |
|**TunnelEgressPackets** | Count | 5 minutes | Count of outgoing packets on tunnels created on the gateway.   |
|**TunnelEgressPacketDropTSMismatch** | Count | 5 minutes | Count of outgoing packets dropped on tunnels caused by traffic-selector mismatch. |
|**TunnelIngressBytes** | Bytes | 5 minutes | Incoming traffic on tunnels created on the gateway.   |
|**TunnelIngressPackets** | Count | 5 minutes | Count of incoming packets on tunnels created on the gateway.   |
|**TunnelIngressPacketDropTSMismatch** | Count | 5 minutes | Count of incoming packets dropped on tunnels caused by traffic-selector mismatch. |

## The following steps help you locate and view metrics:

1. Navigate to the virtual network gateway resource in the Portal
2. Select **Overview** to see the Total tunnel ingress and egress metrics.
