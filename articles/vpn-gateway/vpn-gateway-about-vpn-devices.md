# About VPN devices and IPsec/IKE parameters for Site-to-Site VPN Gateway connections

A VPN device is required to configure a Site-to-Site (S2S) cross-premises VPN connection using a VPN gateway. Site-to-Site connections can be used to create a hybrid solution, or whenever you want secure connections between your on-premises networks and your virtual networks. This article provides a list of validated VPN devices and a list of IPsec/IKE parameters for VPN gateways.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are experiencing connectivity issues between your on-premises VPN devices and VPN gateways, refer to [Known device compatibility issues](#known).
>

### Items to note when viewing the tables:

* There has been a terminology change for Azure VPN gateways. Only the names have changed. There is no functionality change.
  * Static Routing = PolicyBased
  * Dynamic Routing = RouteBased
* Specifications for HighPerformance VPN gateway and RouteBased VPN gateway are the same, unless otherwise noted. For example, the validated VPN devices that are compatible with RouteBased VPN gateways are also compatible with the HighPerformance VPN gateway.

## <a name="devicetable"></a>Validated VPN devices and device configuration guides

In partnership with device vendors, we have validated a set of standard VPN devices. All of the devices in the device families in the following list should work with VPN gateways. See [About VPN Gateway Settings](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md#vpntype) to understand the VPN type use (PolicyBased or RouteBased) for the VPN Gateway solution you want to configure.

To help configure your VPN device, refer to the links that correspond to the appropriate device family. The links to configuration instructions are provided on a best-effort basis. For VPN device support, contact your device manufacturer.

## <a name="configscripts"></a>Download VPN device configuration scripts from Azure

For certain devices, you can download configuration scripts directly from Azure. For more information and download instructions, see [Download VPN device configuration scripts](vpn-gateway-download-vpndevicescript.md).

### Devices with available configuration scripts

[!INCLUDE [scripts](../../includes/vpn-gateway-device-configuration-scripts.md)]

## <a name="additionaldevices"></a>Non-validated VPN devices

If you don’t see your device listed in the Validated VPN devices table, your device still may work with a Site-to-Site connection. Contact your device manufacturer for additional support and configuration instructions.

## <a name="editing"></a>Editing device configuration samples

After you download the provided VPN device configuration sample, you’ll need to replace some of the values to reflect the settings for your environment.

### To edit a sample:

1. Open the sample using Notepad.
2. Search and replace all <*text*> strings with the values that pertain to your environment. Be sure to include < and >. When a name is specified, the name you select should be unique. If a command does not work, consult your device manufacturer documentation.

| **Sample text** | **Change to** |
| --- | --- |
| &lt;RP_OnPremisesNetwork&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myOnPremisesNetwork |
| &lt;RP_AzureNetwork&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myAzureNetwork |
| &lt;RP_AccessList&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myAzureAccessList |
| &lt;RP_IPSecTransformSet&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myIPSecTransformSet |
| &lt;RP_IPSecCryptoMap&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myIPSecCryptoMap |
| &lt;SP_AzureNetworkIpRange&gt; |Specify range. Example: 192.168.0.0 |
| &lt;SP_AzureNetworkSubnetMask&gt; |Specify subnet mask. Example: 255.255.0.0 |
| &lt;SP_OnPremisesNetworkIpRange&gt; |Specify on-premises range. Example: 10.2.1.0 |
| &lt;SP_OnPremisesNetworkSubnetMask&gt; |Specify on-premises subnet mask. Example: 255.255.255.0 |
| &lt;SP_AzureGatewayIpAddress&gt; |This information specific to your virtual network and is located in the Management Portal as **Gateway IP address**. |
| &lt;SP_PresharedKey&gt; |This information is specific to your virtual network and is located in the Management Portal as Manage Key. |

## <a name="ipsec"></a>IPsec/IKE parameters

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. The tables below contain the combinations of algorithms and parameters Azure VPN gateways use in default configuration. For route-based VPN gateways created using the Azure Resource Management deployment model, you can specify a custom policy on each individual connection. Please refer to [Configure IPsec/IKE policy](vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell.md) for detailed instructions.
>
> 2. In addition, you must clamp TCP **MSS** at **1350**. Or if your VPN devices do not support MSS clamping, you can alternatively set the **MTU** on the tunnel interface to **1400** bytes instead.

* SA = Security Association
* IKE Phase 1 is also called "Main Mode"
* IKE Phase 2 is also called "Quick Mode"

* You can specify IPsec ESP NULL encryption with RouteBased and HighPerformance VPN gateways. Null based encryption does not provide protection to data in transit, and should only be used when maximum throughput and minimum latency is required. Clients may choose to use this in VNet-to-VNet communication scenarios, or when encryption is being applied elsewhere in the solution.
* For cross-premises connectivity through the Internet, use the default Azure VPN gateway settings with encryption and hashing algorithms listed in the tables above to ensure security of your critical communication.

### Feb. 16, 2017

**Palo Alto Networks devices with version prior to 7.1.4** for Azure route-based VPN: If you are using VPN devices from Palo Alto Networks with PAN-OS version prior to 7.1.4 and are experiencing connectivity issues to Azure route-based VPN gateways, perform the following steps:

1. Check the firmware version of your Palo Alto Networks device. If your PAN-OS version is older than 7.1.4, upgrade to 7.1.4.
2. On the Palo Alto Networks device, change the Phase 2 SA (or Quick Mode SA) lifetime to 28,800 seconds (8 hours) when connecting to the Azure VPN gateway.
3. If you are still experiencing connectivity issues, open a support request from the Azure portal.
