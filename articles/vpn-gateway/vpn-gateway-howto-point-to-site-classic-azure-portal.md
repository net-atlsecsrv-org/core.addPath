# Configure a Point-to-Site connection by using certificate authentication (classic)

[!INCLUDE [deployment models](../../includes/vpn-gateway-classic-deployment-model-include.md)]

This article shows you how to create a VNet with a Point-to-Site connection. You create this Vnet with the classic deployment model by using the Azure portal. This configuration uses certificates to authenticate the connecting client, either self-signed or CA issued. 
You can also create this configuration with a different deployment tool or model by using options that are described in the following articles:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Azure portal](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md)
> * [PowerShell](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps.md)
> * [Azure portal (classic)](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal.md)
>

You use a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateway to create a secure connection to your virtual network from an individual client computer. Point-to-Site VPN connections are useful when you want to connect to your VNet from a remote location. When you have only a few clients that need to connect to a VNet, a P2S VPN is a useful solution to use instead of a Site-to-Site VPN. A P2S VPN connection is established by starting it from the client computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The classic deployment model supports Windows VPN clients only and uses the Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), an SSL-based VPN protocol. To support non-Windows VPN clients, you must create your VNet with the Resource Manager deployment model. The Resource Manager deployment model supports IKEv2 VPN in addition to SSTP. For more information, see [About P2S connections](point-to-site-about.md).

## Prerequisites

Point-to-Site certificate authentication connections require the following prerequisites:

* A Dynamic VPN gateway.
* The public key (.cer file) for a root certificate, which is uploaded to Azure. This key is considered a trusted certificate and is used for authentication.
* A client certificate generated from the root certificate, and installed on each client computer that will connect. This certificate is used for client authentication.
* A VPN client configuration package must be generated and installed on every client computer that connects. The client configuration package configures the native VPN client that's already on the operating system with the necessary information to connect to the VNet.

Point-to-Site connections don't require a VPN device or an on-premises public-facing IP address. The VPN connection is created over SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol). On the server side, we support SSTP versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. The client decides which version to use. For Windows 8.1 and above, SSTP uses 1.2 by default. 

For more information about Point-to-Site connections, see [Point-to-Site FAQ](#point-to-site-faq).

### Example settings

## Create a virtual network and a VPN gateway

Before you begin, verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).

### Part 1: Create a virtual network

If you don't already have a virtual network (VNet), create one. Screenshots are provided as examples. Be sure to replace the values with your own. To create a VNet by using the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. On the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**. The **New** page opens.

2. In the **Search the marketplace** field, enter *virtual network* and select **Virtual network** from the returned list. The **Virtual network** page opens.

3. From the **Select a deployment model** list, select **Classic**, and then select **Create**. The **Create virtual network** page opens.

4. On the **Create virtual network** page, configure the VNet settings. On this page, you add your first address space and a single subnet address range. After you finish creating the VNet, you can go back and add additional subnets and address spaces.

   ![Create virtual network page](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/vnet125.png)

5. Select the **Subscription** you want to use from the drop-down list.

6. Select an existing **Resource Group**. Or, create a new resource group by selecting **Create new** and entering a name. If you're creating a new resource group, name the resource group according to your planned configuration values. For more information about resource groups, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md#resource-groups).

7. Select a **Location** for your VNet. This setting determines the geographical location of the resources that you deploy to this VNet.

8. Select **Create** to create the VNet. From the **Notifications** page, you'll see a **Deployment in progress** message.

8. After your virtual network has been created, the message on the **Notifications** page changes to **Deployment succeeded**. Select **Pin to dashboard** if you want to easily find your VNet on the dashboard. 

10. Add a DNS server (optional). After you create your virtual network, you can add the IP address of a DNS server for name resolution. The DNS server IP address that you specify should be the address of a DNS server that can resolve the names for the resources in your VNet.

    To add a DNS server, select **DNS servers** from your VNet page. Then, enter the IP address of the DNS server that you want to use and select **Save**.

### Part 2: Create a gateway subnet and a dynamic routing gateway

In this step, you create a gateway subnet and a dynamic routing gateway. In the Azure portal for the classic deployment model, you create the gateway subnet and the gateway through the same configuration pages. Use the gateway subnet for the gateway services only. Never deploy anything directly to the gateway subnet (such as VMs or other services).

1. In the Azure portal, go to the virtual network for which you want to create a gateway.

2. On the page for your virtual network, select **Overview**, and in the **VPN connections** section, select **Gateway**.

   ![Select to create a gateway](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/beforegw125.png)
3. On the **New VPN Connection** page, select **Point-to-site**.

   ![Point-to-Site connection type](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/newvpnconnect.png)
4. For **Client Address Space**, add the IP address range from which the VPN clients receive an IP address when connecting. Use a private IP address range that doesn't overlap with the on-premises location that you connect from, or with the VNet that you connect to. You can overwrite the autofilled range with the private IP address range that you want to use. This example shows the autofilled range. 

   ![Client address space](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/clientaddress.png)
5. Select **Create gateway immediately**, and then select **Optional gateway configuration** to open the **Gateway configuration** page.

   ![Select optional gateway configuration](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/optsubnet125.png)

6. From the **Gateway configuration** page, select **Subnet** to add the gateway subnet. It's possible to create a gateway subnet as small as /29. However, we recommend that you create a larger subnet that includes more addresses by selecting at least /28 or /27. Doing so will allow for enough addresses to accommodate possible additional configurations that you may want in the future. When working with gateway subnets, avoid associating a network security group (NSG) to the gateway subnet. Associating a network security group to this subnet may cause your VPN gateway to not function as expected. Select **OK** to save this setting.

   ![Add GatewaySubnet](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/gwsubnet125.png)
7. Select the gateway **Size**. The size is the gateway SKU for your virtual network gateway. In the Azure portal, the default SKU is **Default**. For more information about gateway SKUs, see [About VPN gateway settings](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md#gwsku).

   ![Gateway size](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/gwsize125.png)
8. Select the **Routing Type** for your gateway. P2S configurations require a **Dynamic** routing type. Select **OK** when you've finished configuring this page.

   ![Configure routing type](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/routingtype125.png)

9. On the **New VPN Connection** page, select **OK** at the bottom of the page to begin creating your virtual network gateway. A VPN gateway can take up to 45 minutes to complete, depending on the gateway SKU that you select.
 
## <a name="generatecerts"></a>Create certificates

Azure uses certificates to authenticate VPN clients for Point-to-Site VPNs. You upload the public key information of the root certificate to Azure. The public key is then considered *trusted*. Client certificates must be generated from the trusted root certificate, and then installed on each client computer in the Certificates-Current User\Personal\Certificates certificate store. The certificate is used to authenticate the client when it connects to the VNet. 

If you use self-signed certificates, they must be created by using specific parameters. You can create a self-signed certificate by using the instructions for [PowerShell and Windows 10](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md), or [MakeCert](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site-makecert.md). It's important to follow the steps in these instructions when you use self-signed root certificates and generate client certificates from the self-signed root certificate. Otherwise, the certificates you create won't be compatible with P2S connections and you'll receive a connection error.

### Acquire the public key (.cer) for the root certificate

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-p2s-rootcert-include.md)]

### Generate a client certificate

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-p2s-clientcert-include.md)]

## Upload the root certificate .cer file

After the gateway has been created, upload the .cer file (which contains the public key information) for a trusted root certificate to the Azure server. Don't upload the private key for the root certificate. After you upload the certificate, Azure uses it to authenticate clients that have installed a client certificate generated from the trusted root certificate. You can later upload additional trusted root certificate files (up to 20), if needed.  

1. On the **VPN connections** section of the page for your VNet, select the clients graphic to open the **Point-to-site VPN connection** page.

   ![Clients](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/clients125.png)

2. On the **Point-to-site VPN connection** page, select **Manage certificate** to open the **Certificates** page.

   ![Certificates page](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/ptsmanage.png)

1. On the **Certificates** page, select **Upload** to open the **Upload certificate** page.

    ![Upload certificates page](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/uploadcerts.png)

4. Select the folder graphic to browse for the .cer file. Select the file, then select **OK**. The uploaded certificate appears on the **Certificates** page.

   ![Upload certificate](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/upload.png)


## Configure the client

To connect to a VNet by using a Point-to-Site VPN, each client must install a package to configure the native Windows VPN client. The configuration package configures the native Windows VPN client with the settings necessary to connect to the virtual network.

You can use the same VPN client configuration package on each client computer, as long as the version matches the architecture for the client. For the list of client operating systems that are supported, see the [Point-to-Site connections FAQ](#point-to-site-faq).

### Generate and install a VPN client configuration package

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Overview** page for your VNet, in **VPN connections**, select the client graphic to open the **Point-to-site VPN connection** page.

2. From the **Point-to-site VPN connection** page, select the download package that corresponds to the client operating system where it's installed:

   * For 64-bit clients, select **VPN Client (64-bit)**.
   * For 32-bit clients, select **VPN Client (32-bit)**.

   ![Download VPN client configuration package](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/dlclient.png)

3. After the package generates, download it and then install it on your client computer. If you see a SmartScreen popup, select **More info**, then select **Run anyway**. You can also save the package to install on other client computers.

### Install a client certificate

To create a P2S connection from a different client computer than the one used to generate the client certificates, install a client certificate. When you install a client certificate, you need the password that was created when the client certificate was exported. Typically, you can install the certificate by just double-clicking it. For more information, see [Install an exported client certificate](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md#install).


## Connect to your VNet

>[!NOTE]
>You must have Administrator rights on the client computer from which you are connecting.
>
>

1. To connect to your VNet, on the client computer, go to **VPN connections** in the Azure portal and locate the VPN connection that you created. The VPN connection has the same name as your virtual network. Select **Connect**. If a pop-up message about the certificate appears, select **Continue** to use elevated privileges.

2. On the **Connection** status page, select **Connect** to start the connection. If you see the **Select Certificate** screen, verify that the displayed client certificate is the correct one. If not, select the correct certificate from the drop-down list, and then select **OK**.

3. If your connection succeeds, you'll see a **Connected** notification.


### Troubleshooting P2S connections

[!INCLUDE [verify-client-certificates](../../includes/vpn-gateway-certificates-verify-client-cert-include.md)]

## Verify the VPN connection

1. Verify that your VPN connection is active. Open an elevated command prompt on your client computer, and run **ipconfig/all**.
2. View the results. Notice that the IP address you received is one of the addresses within the Point-to-Site connectivity address range that you specified when you created your VNet. The results should be similar to this example:

   ```
    PPP adapter VNet1:
        Connection-specific DNS Suffix .:
        Description.....................: VNet1
        Physical Address................:
        DHCP Enabled....................: No
        Autoconfiguration Enabled.......: Yes
        IPv4 Address....................: 192.168.130.2(Preferred)
        Subnet Mask.....................: 255.255.255.255
        Default Gateway.................:
        NetBIOS over Tcpip..............: Enabled
   ```

## Connect to a virtual machine

[!INCLUDE [Connect to a VM](../../includes/vpn-gateway-connect-vm-p2s-classic-include.md)]

## Add or remove trusted root certificates

You can add and remove trusted root certificates from Azure. When you remove a root certificate, clients that have a certificate generated from that root can no longer authenticate and connect. For those clients to authenticate and connect again, you must install a new client certificate generated from a root certificate that's trusted by Azure.

### To add a trusted root certificate

You can add up to 20 trusted root certificate .cer files to Azure. For instructions, see Upload the root certificate .cer file.

### To remove a trusted root certificate

1. On the **VPN connections** section of the page for your VNet, select the clients graphic to open the **Point-to-site VPN connection** page.

   ![Clients](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/clients125.png)

2. On the **Point-to-site VPN connection** page, select **Manage certificate** to open the **Certificates** page.

   ![Certificates page](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/ptsmanage.png)

3. On the **Certificates** page, select the ellipsis next to the certificate that you want to remove, then select **Delete**.

   ![Delete root certificate](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal/deleteroot.png)

## Revoke a client certificate

If necessary, you can revoke a client certificate. The certificate revocation list allows you to selectively deny Point-to-Site connectivity based on individual client certificates. This method differs from removing a trusted root certificate. If you remove a trusted root certificate .cer from Azure, it revokes the access for all client certificates generated/signed by the revoked root certificate. Revoking a client certificate, rather than the root certificate, allows the other certificates that were generated from the root certificate to continue to be used for authentication for the Point-to-Site connection.

The common practice is to use the root certificate to manage access at team or organization levels, while using revoked client certificates for fine-grained access control on individual users.

### To revoke a client certificate

You can revoke a client certificate by adding the thumbprint to the revocation list.

1. Retrieve the client certificate thumbprint. For more information, see [How to: Retrieve the Thumbprint of a Certificate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms734695.aspx).
2. Copy the information to a text editor and remove its spaces so that it's a continuous string.
3. Go to the classic virtual network. Select **Point-to-site VPN connection**, then select **Manage certificate** to open the **Certificates** page.
4. Select **Revocation list** to open the **Revocation list** page. 
5. Select **Add certificate** to open the **Add certificate to revocation list** page.
6. In **Thumbprint**, paste the certificate thumbprint as one continuous line of text, with no spaces. Select **OK** to finish.

After updating has completed, the certificate can no longer be used to connect. Clients that try to connect by using this certificate receive a message saying that the certificate is no longer valid.
