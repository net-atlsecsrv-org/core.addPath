# About Point-to-Site VPN routing

This article helps you understand how Azure Point-to-Site VPN routing behaves. P2S VPN routing behavior is dependent on the client OS, the protocol used for the VPN connection, and how the virtual networks (VNets) are connected to each other.

Azure currently supports two protocols for remote access, IKEv2 and SSTP. IKEv2 is supported on many client operating systems including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and iOS. SSTP is only supported on Windows. If you make a change to the topology of your network and have Windows VPN clients, the VPN client package for Windows clients must be downloaded and installed again in order for the changes to be applied to the client.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to IKEv2 only.

## <a name="diagrams"></a>About the diagrams

There are a number of different diagrams in this article. Each section shows a different topology or configuration. For the purposes of this article, Site-to-Site (S2S) and VNet-to-VNet connections function the same way, as both are IPsec tunnels. All VPN gateways in this article are route-based.

## <a name="isolatedvnet"></a>One isolated VNet

The Point-to-Site VPN gateway connection in this example is for a VNet that is not connected or peered with any other virtual network (VNet1). In this example, clients can access VNet1.

![isolated VNet routing](./media/vpn-gateway-about-point-to-site-routing/1.jpg "isolated VNet routing")

### Address space

* VNet1: 10.1.0.0/16

### Routes added

* Routes added to Windows clients: 10.1.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24

* Routes added to non-Windows clients: 10.1.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24

### Access

* Windows clients can access VNet1

* Non-Windows clients can access VNet1

## <a name="multipeered"></a>Multiple peered VNets

In this example, the Point-to-Site VPN gateway connection is for VNet1. VNet1 is peered with VNet2. VNet 2 is peered with VNet3. VNet1 is peered with VNet4. There is no direct peering between VNet1 and VNet3. VNet1 has “Allow gateway transit” and VNet2 has “Use remote gateways” enabled.

Clients using Windows can access directly peered VNets, but the VPN client must be downloaded again if any changes are made to VNet peering or the network topology. Non-Windows clients can access directly peered VNets. Access is not transitive and is limited to only directly peered VNets.

### Address space:

* VNet1: 10.1.0.0/16

* VNet2: 10.2.0.0/16

* VNet3: 10.3.0.0/16

* VNet4: 10.4.0.0/16

### Routes added

* Routes added to Windows clients: 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16, 10.4.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24

* Routes added to non-Windows clients: 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16, 10.4.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24

### Access

* Windows clients can access VNet1, VNet2, and VNet4, but the VPN client must be downloaded again for any topology changes to take effect.

* Non-Windows clients can access VNet1, VNet2, and VNet4

## <a name="multis2s"></a>Multiple VNets connected using an S2S VPN

In this example, the Point-to-Site VPN gateway connection is for VNet1. VNet1 is connected to VNet2 using a Site-to-Site VPN connection. VNet2 is connected to VNet3 using a Site-to-Site VPN connection. There is no direct peering or Site-to-Site VPN connection between VNet1 and VNet3. All Site-to-Site connections are not running BGP for routing.

Clients using Windows, or another supported OS, can only access VNet1. To access additional VNets, BGP must be used.

### Address space

* VNet1: 10.1.0.0/16

* VNet2: 10.2.0.0/16

* VNet3: 10.3.0.0/16

### Routes added

* Routes added to Windows clients: 10.1.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24

* Routes added to Non-Windows clients: 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24

### Access

## <a name="multis2sbgp"></a>Multiple VNets connected using an S2S VPN (BGP)

In this example, the Point-to-Site VPN gateway connection is for VNet1. VNet1 is connected to VNet2 using a Site-to-Site VPN connection. VNet2 is connected to VNet3 using a Site-to-Site VPN connection. There is no direct peering or Site-to-Site VPN connection between VNet1 and VNet3. All Site-to-Site connections are running BGP for routing.

Clients using Windows, or another supported OS, can access all VNets that are connected using a Site-to-Site VPN connection, but routes to connected VNets have to be manually added to the Windows clients.
