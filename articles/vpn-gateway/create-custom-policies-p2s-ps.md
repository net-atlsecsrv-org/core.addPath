# Create and set custom IPsec policies for Point-to-Site

If your environment requires a custom IPsec policy for encryption, you can easily configure a policy object with the required settings. This article helps you create a custom policy object, and then set it using PowerShell.

## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

Verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:

* You have a functioning point-to-site VPN already configured. If you don't, configure one using the steps the **Create a point-to-site VPN**  article using either [PowerShell](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps.md), or the [Azure portal](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md).

### Working with Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [PowerShell](../../includes/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

## <a name="signin"></a>1. Set variables

Declare the variables that you want to use. Use the following sample, replacing the values for your own when necessary. If you close your PowerShell/Cloud Shell session at any point during the exercise, just copy and paste the values again to redeclare the variables.

  ```azurepowershell-interactive
  $RG = "TestRG"
  $GWName = "VNet1GW"
  ```

## <a name="create"></a>2. Create policy object

Create a custom IPsec policy object. You can adjust the values to meet the criteria you require.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$vpnclientipsecpolicy = New-AzVpnClientIpsecPolicy -IpsecEncryption AES256 -IpsecIntegrity SHA256 -SALifeTime 86471 -SADataSize 429496 -IkeEncryption AES256 -IkeIntegrity SHA384 -DhGroup DHGroup2 -PfsGroup PFS2
```

## <a name="update"></a>3. Update gateway and set policy

In this step, update your existing P2S VPN gateway and set the IPsec policy.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$gateway = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName $RG -name $GWName
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $gateway -VpnClientIpsecPolicy $vpnclientipsecpolicy
```
