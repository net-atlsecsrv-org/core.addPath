# Set up alerts on diagnostic log events from VPN Gateway

This article helps you set up alerts based on diagnostic log events from Azure VPN Gateway using Azure Log Analytics. 

The following logs are available in Azure:

|***Name*** | ***Description*** |
|---		| ---				|
|GatewayDiagnosticLog | Contains diagnostic logs for gateway configuration events, primary changes and maintenance events |
|TunnelDiagnosticLog | Contains tunnel state change events. Tunnel connect/disconnect events have a summarized reason for the state change if applicable |
|RouteDiagnosticLog | Logs changes to static routes and BGP events that occur on the gateway |
|IKEDiagnosticLog | Logs IKE control messages and events on the gateway |
|P2SDiagnosticLog | Logs point-to-site control messages and events on the gateway |

10. Enter the following query in the **Search query** text box. Replace the values in <> and TimeGenerated as appropriate.

    ```
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "TunnelDiagnosticLog"
    | where _ResourceId == tolower("<RESOURCEID OF GATEWAY>")
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(5m) 
    | where remoteIP_s == "<REMOTE IP OF TUNNEL>"
    | where status_s == "Disconnected"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, instance_s, Resource, ResourceGroup, _ResourceId 
    | sort by TimeGenerated asc
    ```

    Set the threshold value to 0 and select **Done**.
