# Configure a Point-to-Site connection to a VNet using native Azure certificate authentication: PowerShell

This article helps you securely connect individual clients running Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X to an Azure VNet. Point-to-Site VPN connections are useful when you want to connect to your VNet from a remote location, such when you are telecommuting from home or a conference. You can also use P2S instead of a Site-to-Site VPN when you have only a few clients that need to connect to a VNet. Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address. P2S creates the VPN connection over either SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol), or IKEv2. For more information about Point-to-Site VPN, see [About Point-to-Site VPN](point-to-site-about.md).

![Connect a computer to an Azure VNet - Point-to-Site connection diagram](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/p2snativeportal.png)

## Architecture

Point-to-Site native Azure certificate authentication connections use the following items, which you configure in this exercise:

* A RouteBased VPN gateway.
* The public key (.cer file) for a root certificate, which is uploaded to Azure. Once the certificate is uploaded, it is considered a trusted certificate and is used for authentication.
* A client certificate that is generated from the root certificate. The client certificate installed on each client computer that will connect to the VNet. This certificate is used for client authentication.
* A VPN client configuration. The VPN client configuration files contain the necessary information for the client to connect to the VNet. The files configure the existing VPN client that is native to the operating system. Each client that connects must be configured using the settings in the configuration files.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

Verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).

[!INCLUDE [powershell](../../includes/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-powershell-about.md)]

Most of the steps in this article can use Cloud Shell. However, to upload the root certificate public key, you must either use PowerShell locally, or the Azure portal.

### <a name="example"></a>Example values

You can use the example values to create a test environment, or refer to these values to better understand the examples in this article. The variables are set in section [1](#declare) of the article. You can either use the steps as a walk-through and use the values without changing them, or change them to reflect your environment.

* **Name: VNet1**
* **Address space: 192.168.0.0/16** and **10.254.0.0/16**<br>This example uses more than one address space to illustrate that this configuration works with multiple address spaces. However, multiple address spaces are not required for this configuration.
* **Subnet name: FrontEnd**
  * **Subnet address range: 192.168.1.0/24**
* **Subnet name: BackEnd**
  * **Subnet address range: 10.254.1.0/24**
* **Subnet name: GatewaySubnet**<br>The Subnet name *GatewaySubnet* is mandatory for the VPN gateway to work.
  * **GatewaySubnet address range: 192.168.200.0/24** 
* **VPN client address pool: 172.16.201.0/24**<br>VPN clients that connect to the VNet using this Point-to-Site connection receive an IP address from the VPN client address pool.
* **Subscription:** If you have more than one subscription, verify that you are using the correct one.
* **Resource Group: TestRG**
* **Location: East US**
* **DNS Server: IP address** of the DNS server that you want to use for name resolution. (optional)
* **GW Name: Vnet1GW**
* **Public IP name: VNet1GWPIP**
* **VpnType: RouteBased** 

## <a name="declare"></a>1. Sign in and set variables

In this section, you sign in and declare the values used for this configuration. The declared values are used in the sample scripts. Change the values to reflect your own environment. Or, you can use the declared values and go through the steps as an exercise.

### Sign in

[!INCLUDE [sign in](../../includes/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-ps-login.md)]

### Declare variables

Declare the variables that you want to use. Use the following sample, substituting the values for your own when necessary. If you close your PowerShell/Cloud Shell session at any point during the exercise, just copy and paste the values again to re-declare the variables.

  ```azurepowershell-interactive
  $VNetName  = "VNet1"
  $FESubName = "FrontEnd"
  $BESubName = "Backend"
  $GWSubName = "GatewaySubnet"
  $VNetPrefix1 = "192.168.0.0/16"
  $VNetPrefix2 = "10.254.0.0/16"
  $FESubPrefix = "192.168.1.0/24"
  $BESubPrefix = "10.254.1.0/24"
  $GWSubPrefix = "192.168.200.0/26"
  $VPNClientAddressPool = "172.16.201.0/24"
  $RG = "TestRG"
  $Location = "East US"
  $GWName = "VNet1GW"
  $GWIPName = "VNet1GWPIP"
  $GWIPconfName = "gwipconf"
  ```

## <a name="ConfigureVNet"></a>2. Configure a VNet

1. Create a resource group.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $RG -Location $Location
   ```
2. Create the subnet configurations for the virtual network, naming them *FrontEnd*, *BackEnd*, and *GatewaySubnet*. These prefixes must be part of the VNet address space that you declared.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $fesub = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $FESubName -AddressPrefix $FESubPrefix
   $besub = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $BESubName -AddressPrefix $BESubPrefix
   $gwsub = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $GWSubName -AddressPrefix $GWSubPrefix
   ```
3. Create the virtual network.

   In this example, the -DnsServer server parameter is optional. Specifying a value does not create a new DNS server. The DNS server IP address that you specify should be a DNS server that can resolve the names for the resources you are connecting to from your VNet. This example uses a private IP address, but it is likely that this is not the IP address of your DNS server. Be sure to use your own values. The value you specify is used by the resources that you deploy to the VNet, not by the P2S connection or the VPN client.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $VNetName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Location $Location -AddressPrefix $VNetPrefix1,$VNetPrefix2 -Subnet $fesub, $besub, $gwsub -DnsServer 10.2.1.3
   ```
4. Specify the variables for the virtual network you created.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $VNetName -ResourceGroupName $RG
   $subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "GatewaySubnet" -VirtualNetwork $vnet
   ```
5. A VPN gateway must have a Public IP address. You first request the IP address resource, and then refer to it when creating your virtual network gateway. The IP address is dynamically assigned to the resource when the VPN gateway is created. VPN Gateway currently only supports *Dynamic* Public IP address allocation. You cannot request a Static Public IP address assignment. However, it doesn't mean that the IP address changes after it has been assigned to your VPN gateway. The only time the Public IP address changes is when the gateway is deleted and re-created. It doesn't change across resizing, resetting, or other internal maintenance/upgrades of your VPN gateway.

   Request a dynamically assigned public IP address.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $GWIPName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Location $Location -AllocationMethod Dynamic
   $ipconf = New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name $GWIPconfName -Subnet $subnet -PublicIpAddress $pip
   ```

## <a name="creategateway"></a>3. Create the VPN gateway

Configure and create the virtual network gateway for your VNet.

* The -GatewayType must be **Vpn** and the -VpnType must be **RouteBased**.
* The -VpnClientProtocol is used to specify the types of tunnels that you would like to enable. The  tunnel options are **OpenVPN, SSTP** and **IKEv2**. You can choose to enable one of them or any supported combination. If you want to enable multiple types, then specify the names separated by a comma. OpenVPN and SSTP cannot be enabled together. The strongSwan client on Android and Linux and the native IKEv2 VPN client on iOS and OSX will use only the IKEv2 tunnel to connect. Windows clients try IKEv2 first and if that doesnâ€™t connect, they fall back to SSTP. You can use the OpenVPN client to connect to OpenVPN tunnel type.
* The virtual network gateway 'Basic' SKU does not support IKEv2, OpenVPN or RADIUS authentication. If you are planning on having Mac clients connect to your virtual network, do not use the Basic SKU.
* A VPN gateway can take up to 45 minutes to complete, depending on the [gateway sku](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md) you select. This example uses IKEv2.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG `
-Location $Location -IpConfigurations $ipconf -GatewayType Vpn `
-VpnType RouteBased -EnableBgp $false -GatewaySku VpnGw1 -VpnClientProtocol "IKEv2"
```

## <a name="addresspool"></a>4. Add the VPN client address pool

After the VPN gateway finishes creating, you can add the VPN client address pool. The VPN client address pool is the range from which the VPN clients receive an IP address when connecting. Use a private IP address range that does not overlap with the on-premises location that you connect from, or with the VNet that you want to connect to. In this example, the VPN client address pool is declared as a [variable](#declare) in Step 1.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$Gateway = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName $RG -Name $GWName
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $Gateway -VpnClientAddressPool $VPNClientAddressPool
```

## <a name="Certificates"></a>5. Generate certificates

Certificates are used by Azure to authenticate VPN clients for Point-to-Site VPNs. You upload the public key information of the root certificate to Azure. The public key is then considered 'trusted'. Client certificates must be generated from the trusted root certificate, and then installed on each client computer in the Certificates-Current User/Personal certificate store. The certificate is used to authenticate the client when it initiates a connection to the VNet. 

If you use self-signed certificates, they must be created using specific parameters. You can create a self-signed certificate using the instructions for [PowerShell and Windows 10](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md), or, if you don't have Windows 10, you can use [MakeCert](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site-makecert.md). It's important that you follow the steps in the instructions when generating self-signed root certificates and client certificates. Otherwise, the certificates you generate will not be compatible with P2S connections and you receive a connection error.

### <a name="cer"></a>1. Obtain the .cer file for the root certificate

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-p2s-rootcert-include.md)]


### <a name="generate"></a>2. Generate a client certificate

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-p2s-clientcert-include.md)]

## <a name="upload"></a>6. Upload the root certificate public key information

Verify that your VPN gateway has finished creating. Once it has completed, you can upload the .cer file (which contains the public key information) for a trusted root certificate to Azure. Once a.cer file is uploaded, Azure can use it to authenticate clients that have installed a client certificate generated from the trusted root certificate. You can upload additional trusted root certificate files - up to a total of 20 - later, if needed.

You can't upload this information using Azure Cloud Shell. You can either use PowerShell locally on your computer, the [Azure portal steps](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md#uploadfile).

1. Declare the variable for your certificate name, replacing the value with your own.

   ```azurepowershell
   $P2SRootCertName = "P2SRootCert.cer"
   ```
2. Replace the file path with your own, and then run the cmdlets.

   ```azurepowershell
   $filePathForCert = "C:\cert\P2SRootCert.cer"
   $cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filePathForCert)
   $CertBase64 = [system.convert]::ToBase64String($cert.RawData)
   $p2srootcert = New-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -Name $P2SRootCertName -PublicCertData $CertBase64
   ```
3. Upload the public key information to Azure. Once the certificate information is uploaded, Azure considers it to be a trusted root certificate.

   ```azurepowershell
   Add-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName -VirtualNetworkGatewayname "VNet1GW" -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" -PublicCertData $CertBase64
   ```

## <a name="clientcertificate"></a>7. Install an exported client certificate

If you want to create a P2S connection from a client computer other than the one you used to generate the client certificates, you need to install a client certificate. When installing a client certificate, you need the password that was created when the client certificate was exported.

Make sure the client certificate was exported as a .pfx along with the entire certificate chain (which is the default). Otherwise, the root certificate information isn't present on the client computer and the client won't be able to authenticate properly. 

For install steps, see [Install a client certificate](point-to-site-how-to-vpn-client-install-azure-cert.md).

## <a name="clientconfig"></a>8. Configure the native VPN client

The VPN client configuration files contain settings to configure devices to connect to a VNet over a P2S connection. For instructions to generate and install VPN client configuration files, see [Create and install VPN client configuration files for native Azure certificate authentication P2S configurations](point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert.md).

## <a name="connect"></a>9. Connect to Azure

### To connect from a Windows VPN client

>[!NOTE]
>You must have Administrator rights on the Windows client computer from which you are connecting.
>
>

1. To connect to your VNet, on the client computer, navigate to VPN connections and locate the VPN connection that you created. It is named the same name as your virtual network. Click **Connect**. A pop-up message may appear that refers to using the certificate. Click **Continue** to use elevated privileges. 
2. On the **Connection** status page, click **Connect** to start the connection. If you see a **Select Certificate** screen, verify that the client certificate showing is the one that you want to use to connect. If it is not, use the drop-down arrow to select the correct certificate, and then click **OK**.

3. Your connection is established.

   ![Connection established](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps/connected.png)

#### Troubleshooting Windows client P2S connections

[!INCLUDE [client certificates](../../includes/vpn-gateway-certificates-verify-client-cert-include.md)]

### To connect from a Mac VPN client

From the Network dialog box, locate the client profile that you want to use, then click **Connect**.
Check [Install - Mac (OS X)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert#installmac) for detailed instructions. If you are having trouble connecting, verify that the virtual network gateway is not using a Basic SKU. Basic SKU is not supported for Mac clients.

  ![Mac connection](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps/applyconnect.png)

## <a name="verify"></a>To verify your connection

These instructions apply to Windows clients.

1. To verify that your VPN connection is active, open an elevated command prompt, and run *ipconfig/all*.
2. View the results. Notice that the IP address you received is one of the addresses within the Point-to-Site VPN Client Address Pool that you specified in your configuration. The results are similar to this example:

   ```
   PPP adapter VNet1:
      Connection-specific DNS Suffix .:
      Description.....................: VNet1
      Physical Address................:
      DHCP Enabled....................: No
      Autoconfiguration Enabled.......: Yes
      IPv4 Address....................: 172.16.201.3(Preferred)
      Subnet Mask.....................: 255.255.255.255
      Default Gateway.................:
      NetBIOS over Tcpip..............: Enabled
   ```

## <a name="connectVM"></a>To connect to a virtual machine

These instructions apply to Windows clients.

[!INCLUDE [Connect to a VM](../../includes/vpn-gateway-connect-vm-p2s-include.md)]

## <a name="addremovecert"></a>To add or remove a root certificate

You can add and remove trusted root certificates from Azure. When you remove a root certificate, clients that have a certificate generated from the root certificate can't authenticate and won't be able to connect. If you want a client to authenticate and connect, you need to install a new client certificate generated from a root certificate that is trusted (uploaded) to Azure.

### <a name="addtrustedroot"></a>To add a trusted root certificate

You can add up to 20 root certificate .cer files to Azure. The following steps help you add a root certificate:

#### <a name="certmethod1"></a>Method 1


This method is the most efficient way to upload a root certificate. It requires Azure PowerShell cmdlets installed locally on your computer (not Azure Cloud Shell).

1. Prepare the .cer file to upload:

   ```azurepowershell
   $filePathForCert = "C:\cert\P2SRootCert3.cer"
   $cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filePathForCert)
   $CertBase64_3 = [system.convert]::ToBase64String($cert.RawData)
   $p2srootcert = New-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -Name $P2SRootCertName -PublicCertData $CertBase64_3
   ```
2. Upload the file. You can only upload one file at a time.

   ```azurepowershell
   Add-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName -VirtualNetworkGatewayname "VNet1GW" -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" -PublicCertData $CertBase64_3
   ```

3. To verify that the certificate file uploaded:

   ```azurepowershell
   Get-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" `
   -VirtualNetworkGatewayName "VNet1GW"
   ```

#### <a name="certmethod2"></a>Method 2 - Azure portal

This method has more steps than Method 1, but has the same result. It is included in case you need to view the certificate data. It requires Azure PowerShell cmdlets installed locally on your computer (not Azure Cloud Shell).

1. Create and prepare the new root certificate to add to Azure. Export the public key as a Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) and open it with a text editor. Copy the values, as shown in the following example:

   ![certificate](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps/copycert.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > When copying the certificate data, make sure that you copy the text as one continuous line without carriage returns or line feeds. You may need to modify your view in the text editor to 'Show Symbol/Show all characters' to see the carriage returns and line feeds.
   >
   >

2. Specify the certificate name and key information as a variable. Replace the information with your own, as shown in the following example:

   ```azurepowershell
   $P2SRootCertName2 = "ARMP2SRootCert2.cer"
   $MyP2SCertPubKeyBase64_2 = "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"
   ```
3. Add the new root certificate. You can only add one certificate at a time.

   ```azurepowershell
   Add-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName2 -VirtualNetworkGatewayname "VNet1GW" -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" -PublicCertData $MyP2SCertPubKeyBase64_2
   ```
4. You can verify that the new certificate was added correctly by using the following example:

   ```azurepowershell
   Get-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" `
   -VirtualNetworkGatewayName "VNet1GW"
   ```

### <a name="removerootcert"></a>To remove a root certificate

1. Declare the variables.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $GWName = "Name_of_virtual_network_gateway"
   $RG = "Name_of_resource_group"
   $P2SRootCertName2 = "ARMP2SRootCert2.cer"
   $MyP2SCertPubKeyBase64_2 = "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"
   ```
2. Remove the certificate.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Remove-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName2 -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG -PublicCertData $MyP2SCertPubKeyBase64_2
   ```
3. Use the following example to verify that the certificate was removed successfully.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Get-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" `
   -VirtualNetworkGatewayName "VNet1GW"
   ```

## <a name="revoke"></a>To revoke a client certificate

You can revoke client certificates. The certificate revocation list allows you to selectively deny Point-to-Site connectivity based on individual client certificates. This is different than removing a trusted root certificate. If you remove a trusted root certificate .cer from Azure, it revokes the access for all client certificates generated/signed by the revoked root certificate. Revoking a client certificate, rather than the root certificate, allows the other certificates that were generated from the root certificate to continue to be used for authentication.

The common practice is to use the root certificate to manage access at team or organization levels, while using revoked client certificates for fine-grained access control on individual users.

### <a name="revokeclientcert"></a>Revoke a client certificate

1. Retrieve the client certificate thumbprint. For more information, see [How to retrieve the Thumbprint of a Certificate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms734695.aspx).
2. Copy the information to a text editor and remove all spaces so that it is a continuous string. This string is declared as a variable in the next step.
3. Declare the variables. Make sure to declare the thumbprint you retrieved in the previous step.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $RevokedClientCert1 = "NameofCertificate"
   $RevokedThumbprint1 = "â€Ž51ab1edd8da4cfed77e20061c5eb6d2ef2f778c7"
   $GWName = "Name_of_virtual_network_gateway"
   $RG = "Name_of_resource_group"
   ```
4. Add the thumbprint to the list of revoked certificates. You see "Succeeded" when the thumbprint has been added.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Add-AzVpnClientRevokedCertificate -VpnClientRevokedCertificateName $RevokedClientCert1 `
   -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG `
   -Thumbprint $RevokedThumbprint1
   ```
5. Verify that the thumbprint was added to the certificate revocation list.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Get-AzVpnClientRevokedCertificate -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG
   ```
6. After the thumbprint has been added, the certificate can no longer be used to connect. Clients that try to connect using this certificate receive a message saying that the certificate is no longer valid.

### <a name="reinstateclientcert"></a>To reinstate a client certificate

You can reinstate a client certificate by removing the thumbprint from the list of revoked client certificates.

1. Declare the variables. Make sure you declare the correct thumbprint for the certificate that you want to reinstate.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $RevokedClientCert1 = "NameofCertificate"
   $RevokedThumbprint1 = "â€Ž51ab1edd8da4cfed77e20061c5eb6d2ef2f778c7"
   $GWName = "Name_of_virtual_network_gateway"
   $RG = "Name_of_resource_group"
   ```
