# Create an Azure Active Directory tenant for P2S OpenVPN protocol connections

When connecting to your VNet, you can use certificate-based authentication or RADIUS authentication. However, when you use the Open VPN protocol, you can also use Azure Active Directory authentication. This article helps you set up an Azure AD tenant for P2S Open VPN authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD authentication is supported only for OpenVPN® protocol connections.
>


## <a name="tenant"></a>1. Verify Azure AD tenant

Verify that you have an Azure AD tenant. If you don't have an Azure AD tenant, you can create one using the steps in the [Create a new tenant](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) article:

* Organizational name
* Initial domain name

Example:

   ![New Azure AD tenant](./media/openvpn-create-azure-ad-tenant/newtenant.png)

## <a name="users"></a>2. Create Azure AD tenant users

Your Azure AD tenant needs the following accounts: a Global Admin account and a master user account. The master user account is used as your master embedding account (service account). When you create an Azure AD tenant user account, you adjust the Directory role for the type of user that you want to create.

Use the steps in [this article](../active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory.md) to create at least two users for your Azure AD tenant. Be sure to change the **Directory Role** to create the account types:

* Global Admin
* User

## <a name="enable-authentication"></a>3. Enable Azure AD authentication on the VPN gateway

1. Locate the Directory ID of the directory that you want to use for authentication. It is listed in the properties section of the Active Directory page.

2. Copy the Directory ID.

3. Sign in to the Azure portal as a user that is assigned the **Global administrator** role.

4. Next, give admin consent. Copy and paste the URL that pertains to your deployment location in the address bar of your browser:

    Public

    ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=41b23e61-6c1e-4545-b367-cd054e0ed4b4&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.com&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent
    ````

    Azure Government

    ```
   https://login.microsoftonline.us/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=51bb15d4-3a4f-4ebf-9dca-40096fe32426&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.us&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent
    ````

    Microsoft Cloud Germany

    ```
    https://login-us.microsoftonline.de/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=538ee9e6-310a-468d-afef-ea97365856a9&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.microsoftazure.de&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent
    ````

    Azure China 21Vianet

    ```
    https://login.chinacloudapi.cn/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=49f817b6-84ae-4cc0-928c-73f27289b3aa&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.cn&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent
    ```

5. Select the **Global Admin** account if prompted.

6. Select **Accept** when prompted.

    ![Accept](./media/openvpn-create-azure-ad-tenant/accept.jpg)

7. Under your Azure AD, in **Enterprise applications**, you see **Azure VPN** listed.

    ![Azure VPN](./media/openvpn-create-azure-ad-tenant/azurevpn.png)
    
8. If you don't already have a functioning point-to-site environment, follow the instruction to create one. See [Create a point-to-site VPN](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) to create and configure a point-to-site VPN gateway. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The Basic SKU is not supported for OpenVPN.

9. Enable Azure AD authentication on the VPN gateway by navigating to **Point-to-site configuration** and picking **OpenVPN (SSL)** as the **Tunnel type**. Select **Azure Active Directory** as the **Authentication type** then fill in the information under the **Azure Active Directory** section.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure you include a trailing slash at the end of the `AadIssuerUri` value. Otherwise, the connection may fail.

10. Create and download the profile by clicking on the **Download VPN client** link.

11. Extract the downloaded zip file.

12. Browse to the unzipped “AzureVPN” folder.

13. Make a note of the location of the “azurevpnconfig.xml” file. The azurevpnconfig.xml contains the setting for the VPN connection and can be imported directly into the Azure VPN Client application. You can also distribute this file to all the users that need to connect via e-mail or other means. The user will need valid Azure AD credentials to connect successfully.

## Next steps

In order to connect to your virtual network, you must create and configure a VPN client profile. See [Configure a VPN client for P2S VPN connections](openvpn-azure-ad-client.md).
