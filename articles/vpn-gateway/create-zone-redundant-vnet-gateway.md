# Create a zone-redundant virtual network gateway in Azure Availability Zones

You can deploy VPN and ExpressRoute gateways in Azure Availability Zones. This brings resiliency, scalability, and higher availability to virtual network gateways. Deploying gateways in Azure Availability Zones physically and logically separates gateways within a region, while protecting your on-premises network connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures. For information, see  [About zone-redundant virtual network gateways](about-zone-redundant-vnet-gateways.md) and [About Azure Availability Zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md).

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

You can use either PowerShell installed locally on your computer, or the Azure Cloud Shell. If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this feature requires the latest version of the PowerShell module.

[!INCLUDE [Cloud shell](../../includes/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

### To use PowerShell locally

If you are using PowerShell locally on your computer, rather than using Cloud Shell, you must install PowerShell module 1.0.0 or higher. To check the version of PowerShell that you have installed, use the following command:

```azurepowershell
Get-Module Az -ListAvailable | Select-Object -Property Name,Version,Path
```

If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

[!INCLUDE [PowerShell login](../../includes/vpn-gateway-ps-login-include.md)]

## <a name="variables"></a>1. Declare your variables

The values used for the example steps are listed below. Additionally, some of the examples use declared variables within the steps. If you are using these steps in your own environment, be sure to replace these values with your own. When specifying location, verify that the region you specify is supported. For more information, see the [FAQ](#faq).

```azurepowershell-interactive
$RG1         = "TestRG1"
$VNet1       = "VNet1"
$Location1   = "CentralUS"
$FESubnet1   = "FrontEnd"
$BESubnet1   = "Backend"
$GwSubnet1   = "GatewaySubnet"
$VNet1Prefix = "10.1.0.0/16"
$FEPrefix1   = "10.1.0.0/24"
$BEPrefix1   = "10.1.1.0/24"
$GwPrefix1   = "10.1.255.0/27"
$Gw1         = "VNet1GW"
$GwIP1       = "VNet1GWIP"
$GwIPConf1   = "gwipconf1"
```

## <a name="configure"></a>2. Create the virtual network

Create a resource group.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $RG1 -Location $Location1
```

Create a virtual network.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$fesub1 = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $FESubnet1 -AddressPrefix $FEPrefix1
$besub1 = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $BESubnet1 -AddressPrefix $BEPrefix1
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $VNet1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1 -Location $Location1 -AddressPrefix $VNet1Prefix -Subnet $fesub1,$besub1
```

## <a name="gwsub"></a>3. Add the gateway subnet

The gateway subnet contains the reserved IP addresses that the virtual network gateway services use. Use the following examples to add and set a gateway subnet:

Add the gateway subnet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$getvnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $RG1 -Name VNet1
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.1.255.0/27 -VirtualNetwork $getvnet
```

Set the gateway subnet configuration for the virtual network.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$getvnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```
## <a name="publicip"></a>4. Request a public IP address
 
In this step, choose the instructions that apply to the gateway that you want to create. The selection of zones for deploying the gateways depends on the zones specified for the public IP address.

### <a name="ipzoneredundant"></a>For zone-redundant gateways

Request a public IP address with a **Standard** PublicIpaddress SKU and do not specify any zone. In this case, the Standard public IP address created will be a zone-redundant public IP.   

```azurepowershell-interactive
$pip1 = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroup $RG1 -Location $Location1 -Name $GwIP1 -AllocationMethod Static -Sku Standard
```

### <a name="ipzonalgw"></a>For zonal gateways

Request a public IP address with a **Standard** PublicIpaddress SKU. Specify the zone (1, 2 or 3). All gateway instances will be deployed in this zone.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$pip1 = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroup $RG1 -Location $Location1 -Name $GwIP1 -AllocationMethod Static -Sku Standard -Zone 1
```

### <a name="ipregionalgw"></a>For regional gateways

Request a public IP address with a **Basic** PublicIpaddress SKU. In this case, the gateway is deployed as a regional gateway and does not have any zone-redundancy built into the gateway. The gateway instances are created in any zones, respectively.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$pip1 = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroup $RG1 -Location $Location1 -Name $GwIP1 -AllocationMethod Dynamic -Sku Basic
```
## <a name="gwipconfig"></a>5. Create the IP configuration

```azurepowershell-interactive
$getvnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $RG1 -Name $VNet1
$subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $GwSubnet1 -VirtualNetwork $getvnet
$gwipconf1 = New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name $GwIPConf1 -Subnet $subnet -PublicIpAddress $pip1
```

## <a name="gwconfig"></a>6. Create the gateway

Create the virtual network gateway.

### For ExpressRoute

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroup $RG1 -Location $Location1 -Name $Gw1 -IpConfigurations $GwIPConf1 -GatewayType ExpressRoute -GatewaySku ErGw1AZ
```

### For VPN Gateway

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroup $RG1 -Location $Location1 -Name $Gw1 -IpConfigurations $GwIPConf1 -GatewayType Vpn -VpnType RouteBased -GatewaySku VpnGw1AZ
```

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ

### What will change when I deploy these new SKUs?

From your perspective, you can deploy your gateways with zone-redundancy. This means that all instances of the gateways will be deployed across Azure Availability Zones, and each Availability Zone is a different fault and update domain. This makes your gateways more reliable, available, and resilient to zone failures.

### Can I use the Azure portal?

Yes, you can use the Azure portal to deploy the new SKUs. However, you will see these new SKUs only in those Azure regions that have Azure Availability Zones.

### What regions are available for me to use the new SKUs?

See [Availability Zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md#services-support-by-region) for the latest list of available regions.

### Can I change/migrate/upgrade my existing virtual network gateways to zone-redundant or zonal gateways?

Migrating your existing virtual network gateways to zone-redundant or zonal gateways is currently not supported. You can, however, delete your existing gateway and re-create a zone-redundant or zonal gateway.

### Can I deploy both VPN and Express Route gateways in same virtual network?

Co-existence of both VPN and Express Route gateways in the same virtual network is supported. However, you should reserve a /27 IP address range for the gateway subnet.
