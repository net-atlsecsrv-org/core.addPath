# Configure OpenVPN clients for Azure VPN Gateway

This article helps you configure **OpenVPN ® Protocol** clients.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

Verify that you have completed the steps to configure OpenVPN for your VPN gateway. For details, see [Configure OpenVPN for Azure VPN Gateway](vpn-gateway-howto-openvpn.md).

## <a name="windows"></a>Windows clients

1. Download and install the OpenVPN client (version 2.4 or higher) from the official [OpenVPN website](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html).
2. Download the VPN profile for the gateway. This can be done from the Point-to-site configuration tab in the Azure portal, or 'New-AzVpnClientConfiguration' in PowerShell.
3. Unzip the profile. Next, open the *vpnconfig.ovpn* configuration file from the OpenVPN folder using Notepad.
4. [Export](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md#clientexport) the P2S client certificate you created and uploaded to your P2S configuration on the gateway.
5. Extract the private key and the base64 thumbprint from the *.pfx*. There are multiple ways to do this. Using OpenSSL on your machine is one way. The *profileinfo.txt* file contains the private key and the thumbprint for the CA and the Client certificate. Be sure to use the thumbprint of the client certificate.

   ```
   openssl pkcs12 -in "filename.pfx" -nodes -out "profileinfo.txt"
   ```
6. Open *profileinfo.txt* in Notepad. To get the thumbprint of the client (child) certificate, select the text (including and between)"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" for the child certificate and copy it. You can identify the child certificate by looking at the subject=/ line.
7. Switch to the *vpnconfig.ovpn* file you opened in Notepad from step 3. Find the section shown below and replace everything between "cert" and "/cert".

   ```
   # P2S client certificate
   # please fill this field with a PEM formatted cert
   <cert>
   $CLIENTCERTIFICATE
   </cert>
   ```
8. Open the *profileinfo.txt* in Notepad. To get the private key, select the text (including and between) "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----" and copy it.
9. Go back to the vpnconfig.ovpn file in Notepad and find this section. Paste the private key replacing everything between and "key" and "/key".

   ```
   # P2S client root certificate private key
   # please fill this field with a PEM formatted key
   <key>
   $PRIVATEKEY
   </key>
   ```
10. Do not change any other fields. Use the filled in configuration in client input to connect to the VPN.
11. Copy the vpnconfig.ovpn file to C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config folder.
12. Right-click the OpenVPN icon in the system tray and click connect.

## <a name="mac"></a>Mac clients

1. Download and install an OpenVPN client, such as [TunnelBlick](https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html). 
2. Download the VPN profile for the gateway. This can be done from the point-to-site configuration tab in the Azure portal, or by using 'New-AzVpnClientConfiguration' in PowerShell.
3. Unzip the profile. Open the vpnconfig.ovpn configuration file from the OpenVPN folder in a text editor.
4. Fill in the P2S client certificate section with the P2S client certificate public key in base64. In a PEM formatted certificate, you can simply open the .cer file and copy over the base64 key between the certificate headers. See [Export the public key](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md#cer) for information about how to export a certificate to get the encoded public key.
5. Fill in the private key section with the P2S client certificate private key in base64. See [Export your private key](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/#pki) for information about how to extract a private key.
6. Do not change any other fields. Use the filled in configuration in client input to connect to the VPN.
7. Double-click the profile file to create the profile in Tunnelblick.
8. Launch Tunnelblick from the applications folder.
9. Click on the Tunnelblick icon in the system tray and pick connect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Only iOS 11.0 and above and MacOS 10.13 and above are supported with OpenVPN protocol.

## <a name="iOS"></a>iOS clients

1. Install the OpenVPN client (version 2.4 or higher) from the App store.
2. Download the VPN profile for the gateway. This can be done from the point-to-site configuration tab in the Azure portal, or by using 'New-AzVpnClientConfiguration' in PowerShell.
3. Unzip the profile. Open the vpnconfig.ovpn configuration file from the OpenVPN folder in a text editor.
4. Fill in the P2S client certificate section with the P2S client certificate public key in base64. In a PEM formatted certificate, you can simply open the .cer file and copy over the base64 key between the certificate headers. See [Export the public key](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md#cer) for information about how to export a certificate to get the encoded public key.
5. Fill in the private key section with the P2S client certificate private key in base64. See [Export your private key](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/#pki) for information about how to extract a private key.
6. Do not change any other fields.
7. E-mail the profile file (.ovpn) to your email account that is configured in the mail app on your iPhone. 
8. Open the e-mail in the mail app on the iPhone, and tap the attached file

    ```
   The *profileinfo.txt* file will contain the private key and the thumbprint for the CA, and the Client certificate. Be sure to use the thumbprint of the client certificate.

6. Open *profileinfo.txt* in a text editor. To get the thumbprint of the client (child) certificate, select the text including and between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" for the child certificate and copy it. You can identify the child certificate by looking at the subject=/ line.

7. Open the *vpnconfig.ovpn* file and find the section shown below. Replace everything between the and "cert" and "/cert".

   ```
   # P2S client certificate
   # please fill this field with a PEM formatted cert
   <cert>
   $CLIENTCERTIFICATE
   </cert>
   ```
8. Open the profileinfo.txt in a text editor. To get the private key, select the text including and between "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----" and copy it.

   $PRIVATEKEY
   </key>
   ```

10. Do not change any other fields. Use the filled in configuration in client input to connect to the VPN.
11. To connect using the command line, type the following command:
  
    ```
    sudo openvpn –-config <name and path of your VPN profile file>&
    ```
12. To connect using the GUI, go to system settings.

14. Under **Add VPN**, pick **Import from file…**
15. Browse to the profile file and double-click or pick **Open**.
16. Click **Add** on the **Add VPN** window.
  
    ![Import from file](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-openvpn-clients/importfromfile.png)
17. You can connect by turning the VPN **ON** on the **Network Settings** page, or under the network icon in the system tray.

## Next steps

If you want the VPN clients to be able to access resources in another VNet, then follow the instructions on the [VNet-to-VNet](vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal.md) article to set up a vnet-to-vnet connection. Be sure to enable BGP on the gateways and the connections, otherwise traffic will not flow.
