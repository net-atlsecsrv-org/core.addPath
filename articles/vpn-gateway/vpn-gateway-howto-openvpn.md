# Configure OpenVPN for Azure point-to-site VPN Gateway

This article helps you set up **OpenVPNÂ® Protocol** on Azure VPN Gateway. The article assumes that you already have a working point-to-site environment. If you do not, use the instructions in step 1 to create a point-to-site VPN.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## <a name="vnet"></a>1. Create a point-to-site VPN

If you don't already have a functioning point-to-site environment, follow the instruction to create one. See [Create a point-to-site VPN](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) to create and configure a point-to-site VPN gateway with native Azure certificate authentication. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Basic SKU is not supported for OpenVPN.

## <a name="enable"></a>2. Enable OpenVPN on the gateway

Enable OpenVPN on your gateway. Make sure that the gateway is already configured for point-to-site (IKEv2 or SSTP) before running the following commands:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName $rgname -name $name
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $gw -VpnClientProtocol OpenVPN
```
