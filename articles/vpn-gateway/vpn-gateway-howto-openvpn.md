# Configure OpenVPN for Point-to-Site VPN gateways

This article helps you set up **OpenVPNÂ® Protocol** on Azure VPN Gateway. You can use either the portal, or the PowerShell instructions.

## Prerequisites

* The article assumes that you already have a working point-to-site environment. If you don't, create one using one of the following methods.

  * [Portal - Create point-to-site](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md)

  * [PowerShell - Create point-to-site](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps.md)

* Verify that your VPN gateway does not use the Basic SKU. The Basic SKU is not supported for OpenVPN.

## Portal

1. In the portal, navigate to your **Virtual network gateway -> Point-to-site configuration**.
1. For **Tunnel type**, select **OpenVPN (SSL)** from the dropdown.

   ```
