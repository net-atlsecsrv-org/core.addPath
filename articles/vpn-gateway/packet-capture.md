# Configure packet captures for VPN gateways

Connectivity and performance-related issues are often complex and take significant amount of time and effort just to narrow down the cause of the problem. Ability to packet capture greatly helps reduce time in narrowing down the scope of the problem to certain parts of the network, such as whether the issue is on the customer side of the network, the Azure side of the network, or somewhere in between. Once the issue has been narrowed down, it is much more efficient to debug and take remedial action.

There are some commonly available tools for packet capture. Getting relevant packet captures with these tools can be cumbersome, especially when working with high volume traffic scenarios. Filtering capabilities provided by a VPN gateway packet capture becomes a major differentiator. You may use a VPN gateway packet capture in addition to commonly available packet capture tools.

## VPN gateway packet capture filtering capabilities

VPN gateway packet captures can be run on the gateway or on a specific connection depending on customer needs. You can also run packet captures on multiple tunnels at the same time. You can capture single or bi-direction traffic, IKE and ESP traffic, and inner packets along with filtering on a VPN gateway.

Using a five-tuple filter (source subnet, destination subnet, source port, destination port, protocol) and TCP flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, URG, PSH, RST) is helpful when isolating issues on a high volume traffic.

See below an example of JSON and JSON schema with explanation of each property. Also, note some limitations while running the packet captures:
- In the schema, filter is shown as an array but at present only one filter can be used at a time.
- Multiple gateway-wide packet captures at the same time are not allowed.
- Multiple packet captures on the same connection at the same time are not allowed. You can run packet captures on different connections at the same time.
- A maximum of five packet captures can be run in parallel per gateway. These packet captures can be a combination of gateway-wide packet capture or per connection packet capture.

## Setup packet capture using PowerShell

See the examples below for PowerShell commands to start and stop packet captures. For more information on parameter options, see this PowerShell [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/start-azvirtualnetworkgatewaypacketcapture).

### Start packet capture for a VPN gateway

```azurepowershell-interactive

## Key considerations

- Running packet captures may affect performance. Remember to stop the packet capture when it is not needed.
- Suggested minimum packet capture duration is 600 seconds. Having shorter packet capture duration may not provide complete data due to sync up issues among multiple components on the path.
- Packet capture data files are generated in PCAP format. Use Wireshark or other commonly available applications to open PCAP files.
