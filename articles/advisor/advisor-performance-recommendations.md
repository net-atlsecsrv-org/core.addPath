# Improve the performance of Azure applications by using Azure Advisor

The performance recommendations in Azure Advisor can help improve the speed and responsiveness of your business-critical applications. You can get performance recommendations from Advisor on the **Performance** tab of the Advisor dashboard.

## Reduce DNS time-to-live on your Traffic Manager profile to fail over to healthy endpoints faster

You can use [time-to-live (TTL) settings](../traffic-manager/traffic-manager-performance-considerations.md) on your Azure Traffic Manager profile to specify how quickly to switch endpoints if a given endpoint stops responding to queries. If you reduce the TTL values, clients will be routed to functioning endpoints faster.

Azure Advisor identifies Traffic Manager profiles that have a longer TTL configured. It recommends configuring the TTL to either 20 seconds or 60 seconds, depending on whether the profile is configured for [Fast Failover](https://azure.microsoft.com/roadmap/fast-failover-and-tcp-probing-in-azure-traffic-manager/).

## Improve database performance by using SQL Database Advisor

Azure Advisor provides a consistent, consolidated view of recommendations for all your Azure resources. It integrates with SQL Database Advisor to bring you recommendations for improving the performance of your databases.Â SQL Database Advisor assesses the performance of your databases by analyzing your usage history. It then offers recommendations that are best suited for running the database's typical workload.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can get recommendations, your database needs to be in use for about a week, and within that week there needs to be some consistent activity. SQL Database Advisor can optimize more easily for consistent query patterns than for random bursts of activity.

For more information, see [SQL Database Advisor](../azure-sql/database/database-advisor-implement-performance-recommendations.md).

## Upgrade your Storage client library to the latest version for better reliability and performance

The latest version of the Storage client library SDK contains fixes to problems reported by customers and proactively identified through our QA process. The latest version also carries reliability and performance optimization together with new features that can improve your overall experience with using Azure Storage. Advisor provides recommendations and steps needed to upgrade to the latest version of the SDK if you're using a stale version. The recommendations are for supported languages: C++ and .NET.

## Improve App Service performance and reliability

Azure Advisor integrates recommendations for improving your App Service experience and discovering relevant platform capabilities. Examples of App Service recommendations are:
* Detection of instances where memory or CPU resources are exhausted by app runtimes, with mitigation options.
* Detection of instances where co-locating resources like web apps and databases can improve performance and reduce cost.

For more information, see [Best practices for Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-best-practices.md).

## Use managed disks to prevent disk I/O throttling

Advisor identifies virtual machines that belong to a storage account that's reaching its scalability target. This condition makes those VMs susceptible to I/O throttling. Advisor will recommend that they use managed disks to prevent performance degradation.

## Improve the performance and reliability of virtual machine disks by using Premium Storage

Advisor identifies virtual machines with standard disks that have a high volume of transactions on your storage account. It recommends upgrading to premium disks. 

Azure Premium Storage delivers high-performance, low-latency disk support for virtual machines that run I/O-intensive workloads. Virtual machine disks that use Premium Storage accounts store data on solid-state drives (SSDs). For the best performance for your application, we recommend that you migrate any virtual machine disks that require high IOPS to Premium Storage.

## Remove data skew on your SQL Data Warehouse tables to increase query performance

Data skew can cause unnecessary data movement or resource bottlenecks when you run your workload. Advisor detects distribution data skew of greater than 15%. It recommends that you redistribute your data and revisit your table distribution key selections. To learn more about identifying and removing skew, see [troubleshooting skew](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-distribute.md#how-to-tell-if-your-distribution-column-is-a-good-choice).

## Create or update outdated table statistics in your SQL Data Warehouse tables to increase query performance

Advisor identifies tables that don't have up-to-date [table statistics](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md) and recommends creating or updating the statistics. The query optimizer in Azure SQL Data Warehouse uses up-to-date statistics to estimate the cardinality or number of rows in query results. These estimates enable the query optimizer to create a query plan to provide the fastest performance.

## Improve MySQL connection management

Advisor analysis can indicate that your application connecting to a MySQL server might not be managing connections efficiently. This condition could lead to unnecessary resource consumption and overall higher application latency. To improve connection management, we recommend that you reduce the number of short-lived connections and eliminate unnecessary idle connections. You can make these improvements by configuring a server-side connection pooler, like ProxySQL.


## Scale up to optimize cache utilization on your SQL Data Warehouse tables to increase query performance

Azure Advisor detects whether your SQL Data Warehouse tables have a high cache-used percentage and a low hit percentage. This condition indicates high cache eviction, which can affect the performance of your SQL Data Warehouse instance. Advisor recommends that you scale up your SQL Data Warehouse instance to ensure you allocate enough cache capacity for your workload.

## Convert SQL Data Warehouse tables to replicated tables to increase query performance

Advisor identifies tables that aren't replicated tables but that would benefit from conversion. It suggests that you convert these tables. Recommendations are based on:
- The size of the replicated table. 
- The number of columns. 
- The table distribution type. 
- The number of partitions on the SQL Data Warehouse table. 

Additional heuristics might be provided in the recommendation for context. To learn more about how this recommendation is determined, see [SQL Data Warehouse recommendations](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-concept-recommendations.md#replicate-tables). 

## Migrate your storage account to Azure Resource Manager to get the latest Azure features

Migrate your storage account deployment model to Azure Resource Manager to take advantage of:
- Template deployments.
- Additional security options.
- The ability to upgrade to a GPv2 account so you can use the latest Azure Storage features. 

Advisor identifies any stand-alone storage accounts that are using the classic deployment model and recommends migrating to the Resource Manager deployment model.

> [!NOTE]
> Classic alerts in Azure Monitor were retired in August 2019. We recommended that you upgrade your classic storage account to use Resource Manager to retain alerting functionality with the new platform. For more information, see [classic alerts retirement](../azure-monitor/platform/monitoring-classic-retirement.md#retirement-of-classic-monitoring-and-alerting-platform).

## Design your storage accounts to prevent reaching the maximum subscription limit

An Azure region supports a maximum of 250 storage accounts per subscription. After this limit is reached, you won't be able to create storage accounts in that region/subscription combination. Advisor checks your subscriptions and provides recommendations for you to design for fewer storage accounts for any subscription/region that's close to reaching the maximum limit.

## Consider increasing the size of your VPN Gateway SKU to address high P2S use

Each Azure VPN Gateway SKU can support only a specified number of concurrent P2S connections. If your connection count is close to your gateway limit, additional connection attempts might fail. If you increase the size of your gateway, you'll be able to support more concurrent P2S users. Advisor provides recommendations and instructions for increasing the size of your gateway.

## Consider increasing the size of your VPN Gateway SKU to address high CPU

Under high traffic load, your VPN gateway might drop packets because of high CPU. Consider upgrading your VPN Gateway SKU. Increasing the size of your VPN gateway will ensure that connections aren't dropped because of high CPU. Advisor provides recommendations to proactively address this problem. 

## Increase batch size when loading to maximize load throughput, data compression, and query performance

Advisor detects whether you can increase load performance and throughput by increasing the batch size when loading into your database. You could consider using the COPY statement. If you can't use the COPY statement, consider increasing the batch size when you use loading utilities like the SQLBulkCopy API or BCP. A good general rule is to use a batch size that's between 100 thousand and 1 million rows. Increasing batch size will increase load throughput, data compression, and query performance.

## Co-locate the storage account in the same region to minimize latency when loading

Advisor detects whether you're loading from a region that's different from your SQL pool. Consider loading from a storage account that's in the same region as your SQL pool to minimize latency when loading data. This change will help minimize latency and increase load performance.

## Use a supported Kubernetes version

Advisor detects unsupported versions of Kubernetes.

## Optimize the performance of your Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Database for MariaDB servers

### Fix the CPU pressure of your Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Database for MariaDB servers with CPU bottlenecks
High utilization of the CPU over an extended period can cause slow query performance for your workload. Increasing the CPU size will help to optimize the runtime of the database queries and improve overall performance. Advisor identifies servers with a high CPU utilization that are likely running CPU-constrained workloads and recommends scaling your compute.

### Reduce memory constraints on your Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Database for MariaDB servers, or move to a Memory Optimized SKU
A low cache hit ratio can result in slower query performance and increased IOPS. This condition could be caused by a bad query plan or a memory-intensive workload. Fixing the query plan orÂ [increasing the memory](../postgresql/concepts-pricing-tiers.md) of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for MySQL, or Azure Database for MariaDB server will help optimize the execution of the database workload. Azure Advisor identifies servers affected by this high buffer pool churn. It recommends that you take one of these actions: 
- Fix the query plan
- Move to an SKU that has more memory 
- Increase storage size to get more IOPS.

### Use an Azure Database for MySQL or Azure Database for PostgreSQL read replica to scale out reads for read-intensive workloads
Advisor uses workload-based heuristics like the ratio of reads to writes on the server over the past seven days to identify read-intensive workloads. An Azure Database for PostgreSQL or Azure Database for MySQL resource with a high read/write ratio can result in CPU or memory contentions and lead to slow query performance. Adding aÂ [replica](../postgresql/howto-read-replicas-portal.md) will help to scale out reads to the replica server and prevent CPU or memory constraints on the primary server. Advisor identifies servers with read-intensive workloads and recommends that you add aÂ [read replica](../postgresql/concepts-read-replicas.md)Â to offload some of the read workloads.


### Scale your Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, or Azure Database for MariaDB server to a higher SKU to prevent connection constraints
Each new connection to your database server occupies memory. The database server's performance degrades if connections to your server are failing because of anÂ [upper limit](../postgresql/concepts-limits.md) in memory. Azure Advisor identifies servers running with many connection failures. It recommends upgrading your server's connection limits to provide more memory to your server by taking one of these actions:
- Scale up compute. 
- Use Memory Optimized SKUs, which have more compute per core.

## Scale your cache to a different size or SKU to improve cache and application performance

Cache instances perform best when they're not running under high memory pressure, high server load, or high network bandwidth. These conditions can cause them to become unresponsive, experience data loss, or become unavailable. Advisor identifies cache instances in these conditions. It recommends that you take one of these actions:
- Apply best practices to reduce the memory pressure, server load, or network bandwidth.
- Scale to a different size or SKU that has more capacity.

## Add regions with traffic to your Azure Cosmos DB account

Advisor detects Azure Cosmos DB accounts that have traffic from a region that isn't currently configured. It recommends adding that region. Doing so improves latency for requests coming from that region and ensures availability in case of region outages.

## Configure your Azure Cosmos DB indexing policy by using custom included or excluded paths

Advisor identifies Azure Cosmos DB containers that are using the default indexing policy but could benefit from a custom indexing policy. This determination is based on the workload pattern. The default indexing policy indexes all properties. A custom indexing policy with explicit included or excluded paths used in query filters can reduce the RUs and storage consumed for indexing. [Learn more about modifying index policies.](https://aka.ms/cosmosdb/modify-index-policy)

## Set your Azure Cosmos DB query page size (MaxItemCount) to -1 

Azure Advisor identifies Azure Cosmos DB containers that are using a query page size of 100. It recommends using a page size of -1 for faster scans. [Learn more about MaxItemCount.](https://aka.ms/cosmosdb/sql-api-query-metrics-max-item-count)
