# Configure periodic summary for recommendations

Advisor **recommendation digests** provide an easy and proactive way to stay on top of your active recommendations, across different categories. The feature provides the ability to configure periodic notifications for the summary of all your active recommendations, across different categories. You can choose your desired channel for notifications like email, sms or others, using action groups. 
This article shows you how to set-up a **recommendation digests** for your Advisor recommendations.


## Setting-up your recommendation digest
