# Azure security baseline for Azure Advisor

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Advisor. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Advisor. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Advisor have been excluded.

To see how Azure Advisor completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Advisor security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management.md).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the default identity and access management service. Standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:

- Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machine (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications
- Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources

Ensure securing Azure AD is a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Azure AD also provides an identity secure score to help you assess identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

Note that Azure AD supports external identities, which allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) 

- [Use external identity providers for application](../active-directory/external-identities/identity-providers.md) 

- [What is the identity secure score in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/identity-secure-score.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide identity and access management to Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. 

Use single sign-on to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications, and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility and control.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which supports strong authentication controls through multifactor authentication, and strong passwordless methods.
- Multifactor authentication - Enable Azure AD multifactor authentication and follow Azure Security Center's Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your multifactor authentication setup. Multifactor authentication can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign in conditions and risk factors.
- Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available. They are, Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

- [Introduction to passwordless authentication options for Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in which provides the following data sources:
- Sign in - The sign in report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign in activities.
- Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
- Risky sign in - A risky sign in is an indicator for a sign in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Use these data sources to integrate with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third party SIEM systems. Setup alerts on Azure Security Center for certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

- [Alerts in Azure Security Center's threat intelligence protection module](../security-center/alerts-reference.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-6: Restrict Azure resource access based on conditions

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor supports Azure Active Directory's (Azure AD) conditional access feature for a more granular access control based on user-defined conditions. For example, user logins from certain IP ranges will need to use multi-factor authentication for login. Granular authentication session management policy can also be used for different use cases.

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access.md).*

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged-access to the subscriptions and management groups, they belong to.

Restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

- [Azure subscription administrators](../cost-management-billing/manage/add-change-subscription-administrator.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts to manage its resources, review user accounts and access assignment regularly to ensure the accounts and their access are valid. 
Implement Azure AD access reviews to review group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. Azure AD reporting can provide logs to help discover stale accounts. 

Additionally, use Azure AD's Privileged Identity Management features to create access review report workflow to facilitate the review process. Privileged Identity Management can also be configured to alert when an excessive number of administrator accounts are created, and to identify administrator accounts that are stale or improperly configured.

Note that some Azure services support local users and roles which are not managed through Azure AD. Customers will need to manage these users separately.

- [How to use Azure AD identity and access reviews](/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. 

Use highly secured user workstations and/or Azure Bastion for administrative tasks. Choose Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), including Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. 

Centrally manage the secured workstations to enforce secured configuration including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, restricted logical and network access.

- [Deploy a privileged access workstation](../active-directory/devices/howto-azure-managed-workstation.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor is integrated with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage its resources. Use Azure RBAC to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. 

Assign roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, which can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges assigned to resources through Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management.md).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Note: Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-5: Limit users' ability to interact with Azure Resource Manager

**Guidance**: Azure Advisor uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and authentication, while Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager are used to manage Advisor. 

Use Azure Conditional Access to limit a user's ability to interact with Azure Resources Manager by configuring "Block access" for the "Microsoft Azure Management" App, as required based on business requirements.

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-detection).*

### LT-4: Enable logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Activity logs are automatically available and contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your Azure Advisor resources except read operations (GET). 

Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-5: Centralize security log management and analysis

**Guidance**: Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation. For each log source, ensure you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements.

Ensure you are integrating Azure activity logs into your central logging. Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

In addition, enable and onboard data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM. Many organizations choose to use Azure Sentinel for “hot” data that is used frequently and Azure Storage for “cold” data that is used less frequently.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-incident-response.md).*

### IR-1: Preparation – update incident response process for Azure

**Guidance**: Ensure your organization has processes to respond to security incidents, has updated these processes for Azure, and is regularly exercising them to ensure readiness.

- [Implement security across the enterprise environment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/security/security-top-10#4-process-update-incident-response-ir-processes-for-cloud)

- [Incident response reference guide](/microsoft-365/downloads/IR-Reference-Guide.pdf)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-2: Preparation – setup incident notification

**Guidance**: Set up security incident contact information in Azure Security Center. This contact information is used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. You also have options to customize incident alert and notification in different Azure services based on your incident response needs. 

- [How to set the Azure Security Center security contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

- [How to stream alerts into Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/connect-azure-security-center.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.
