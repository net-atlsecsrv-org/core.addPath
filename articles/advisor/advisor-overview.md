## What is Advisor?
Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps you follow best practices to optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then recommends solutions that can help you improve the cost effectiveness, performance, Reliability (formerly called High availability), and security of your Azure resources.

With Advisor, you can:
* Get proactive, actionable, and personalized best practices recommendations. 
* Improve the performance, security, and reliability of your resources, as you identify opportunities to reduce your overall Azure spend.
* Get recommendations with proposed actions inline.

You can access Advisor through the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard). Sign in to the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate **Advisor** in the navigation menu, or search for it in the **All services** menu.

The Advisor dashboard displays personalized recommendations for all your subscriptions.  You can apply filters to display recommendations for specific subscriptions and resource types.  The recommendations are divided into five categories: 

* **Reliability (formerly called High Availability)**: To ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications. For more information, see [Advisor Reliability recommendations](advisor-high-availability-recommendations.md).
* **Security**: To detect threats and vulnerabilities that might lead to security breaches. For more information, see [Advisor Security recommendations](advisor-security-recommendations.md).
* **Performance**: To improve the speed of your applications. For more information, see [Advisor Performance recommendations](advisor-performance-recommendations.md).
* **Cost**: To optimize and reduce your overall Azure spending. For more information, see [Advisor Cost recommendations](advisor-cost-recommendations.md).
* **Operational Excellence**: To help you achieve process and workflow efficiency, resource manageability and deployment best practices. . For more information, see [Advisor Operational Excellence recommendations](advisor-operational-excellence-recommendations.md).

Select the recommended action for a recommendation to implement the recommendation.  A simple interface will open that enables you to implement the recommendation or refer you to documentation that assists you with implementation.  Once you implement a recommendation, it can take up to a day for Advisor to recognize that.

If you do not intend to take immediate action on a recommendation, you can postpone it for a specified time period or dismiss it.  If you do not want to receive recommendations for a specific subscription or resource group, you can configure Advisor to only generate recommendations for specified subscriptions and resource groups.
