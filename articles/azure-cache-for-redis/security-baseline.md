# Azure Security Baseline for Azure Cache for Redis

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Cache for Redis contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: Deploy your Azure Cache for Redis instance within a virtual network (VNet). A VNet is a private network in the cloud. When an Azure Cache for Redis instance is configured with a VNet, it is not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the VNet.

You may also specify firewall rules with a start and end IP address range. When firewall rules are configured, only client connections from the specified IP address ranges can connect to the cache.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: When Virtual Machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cache for Redis instance, you can use network security groups (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: When using Azure Cache for Redis with your web applications running on Azure App Service or compute instances, deploy all resources within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and secure with an Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Web Application Gateway. Configure the WAF to run in "Prevention Mode". Prevention Mode blocks intrusions and attacks that the rules detect. The attacker receives a "403 unauthorized access" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.

Alternatively, you may select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection and/or anomaly detection capabilities.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

You may also use application security groups (ASG) to help simplify complex security configuration. ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources related to your Azure Cache for Redis instances with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Cache" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Cache for Redis instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions such as:

Only secure connections to your Redis Cache should be enabled

DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

## Data Recovery

*For more information, see [Security Control: Data Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back ups

**Guidance**: Enable Redis persistence. Redis persistence allows you to persist data stored in Redis. You can also take snapshots and back up the data, which you can load in case of a hardware failure. This is a huge advantage over Basic or Standard tier where all the data is stored in memory and there can be potential data loss in case of a failure where Cache nodes are down.

You may also use Azure Cache for Redis Export. Export allows you to export the data stored in Azure Cache for Redis to Redis compatible RDB file(s). You can use this feature to move data from one Azure Cache for Redis instance to another or to another Redis server. During the export process, a temporary file is created on the virtual machine that hosts the Azure Cache for Redis server instance, and the file is uploaded to the designated storage account. When the export operation completes with either a status of success or failure, the temporary file is deleted.

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer managed keys

**Guidance**: Use Azure Cache for Redis Import. Import can be used to bring Redis-compatible RDB files from any Redis server running in any cloud or environment, including Redis running on Linux, Windows, or any cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services and others. Importing data is an easy way to create a cache with pre-populated data. During the import process, Azure Cache for Redis loads the RDB files from Azure storage into memory and then inserts the keys into the cache.

Periodically test data restoration of your Azure Key Vault secrets.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer managed keys

**Guidance**: Azure Cache for Redis backups from Redis Export and Redis persistence are stored within your selected Azure Storage account. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption cannot be disabled. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your storage account, or you can manage encryption with your own keys.
