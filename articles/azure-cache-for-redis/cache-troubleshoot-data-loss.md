# Troubleshoot data loss in Azure Cache for Redis

This article discusses how to diagnose actual or perceived data losses that might occur in Azure Cache for Redis.

> [!NOTE]
> Several of the troubleshooting steps in this guide include instructions to run Redis commands and monitor various performance metrics. For more information and instructions, see the articles in the [Additional information](#additional-information) section.

## Partial loss of keys

Azure Cache for Redis doesn't randomly delete keys after they've been stored in memory. However, it does remove keys in response to expiration or eviction policies and to explicit key-deletion commands. Keys that have been written to the master node in a Premium or Standard Azure Cache for Redis instance also might not be available on a replica right away. Data is replicated from the master to the replica in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner.

If you find that keys have disappeared from your cache, check the following possible causes:

| Cause | Description |
|---|---|
| [Key expiration](#key-expiration) | Keys are removed because of time-outs set on them. |
| [Key eviction](#key-eviction) | Keys are removed under memory pressure. |
| [Key deletion](#key-deletion) | Keys are removed by explicit delete commands. |
| [Async replication](#async-replication) | Keys are not available on a replica because of data-replication delays. |

### Key expiration

Azure Cache for Redis removes a key automatically if the key is assigned a time-out and that period has passed. For more information about Redis key expiration, see the [EXPIRE](http://redis.io/commands/expire) command documentation. Time-out values also can be set by using the [SET](http://redis.io/commands/set), [SETEX](https://redis.io/commands/setex), [GETSET](https://redis.io/commands/getset), and other **\*STORE** commands.

To get stats on how many keys have expired, use the [INFO](http://redis.io/commands/info) command. The `Stats` section shows the total number of expired keys. The `Keyspace` section provides more information about the number of keys with time-outs and the average time-out value.

```
# Stats

expired_keys:46583

# Keyspace

db0:keys=3450,expires=2,avg_ttl=91861015336
```

You can also look at diagnostic metrics for your cache, to see if there's a correlation between when the key went missing and a spike in expired keys. See the Appendix of [Debugging Redis Keyspace Misses](https://gist.github.com/JonCole/4a249477142be839b904f7426ccccf82#appendix) for information about using keyspace notifications or **MONITOR** to debug these types of issues.

### Key eviction

Azure Cache for Redis requires memory space to store data. It purges keys to free up available memory when necessary. When the **used_memory** or **used_memory_rss** values in the [INFO](http://redis.io/commands/info) command approach the configured **maxmemory** setting, Azure Cache for Redis starts evicting keys from memory based on [cache policy](http://redis.io/topics/lru-cache).

You can monitor the number of evicted keys by using the [INFO](http://redis.io/commands/info) command:

```
# Stats

evicted_keys:13224
```

You can also look at diagnostic metrics for your cache, to see if there's a correlation between when the key went missing and a spike in evicted keys. See the Appendix of [Debugging Redis Keyspace Misses](https://gist.github.com/JonCole/4a249477142be839b904f7426ccccf82#appendix) for information about using keyspace notifications or **MONITOR** to debug these types of issues.

### Key deletion

Redis clients can issue the [DEL](http://redis.io/commands/del) or [HDEL](http://redis.io/commands/hdel) command to explicitly remove keys from Azure Cache for Redis. You can track the number of delete operations by using the [INFO](http://redis.io/commands/info) command. If **DEL** or **HDEL** commands have been called, they'll be listed in the `Commandstats` section.

```
# Commandstats

cmdstat_del:calls=2,usec=90,usec_per_call=45.00

cmdstat_hdel:calls=1,usec=47,usec_per_call=47.00
```

### Async replication

Any Azure Cache for Redis instance in the Standard or Premium tier is configured with a master node and at least one replica. Data is copied from the master to a replica asynchronously by using a background process. The [redis.io](http://redis.io/topics/replication) website describes how Redis data replication works in general. For scenarios where clients write to Redis frequently, partial data loss can occur because this replication is guaranteed to be instantaneous. For example, if the master goes down *after* a client writes a key to it, but *before* the background process has a chance to send that key to the replica, the key is lost when the replica takes over as the new master.

## Major or complete loss of keys

If most or all keys have disappeared from your cache, check the following possible causes:

| Cause | Description |
|---|---|
| [Key flushing](#key-flushing) | Keys have been purged manually. |
| [Incorrect database selection](#incorrect-database-selection) | Azure Cache for Redis is set to use a non-default database. |
| [Redis instance failure](#redis-instance-failure) | The Redis server is unavailable. |

### Key flushing

Clients can call the [FLUSHDB](http://redis.io/commands/flushdb) command to remove all keys in a *single* database or [FLUSHALL](http://redis.io/commands/flushall) to remove all keys from *all* databases in a Redis cache. To find out whether keys have been flushed, use the [INFO](http://redis.io/commands/info) command. The `Commandstats` section shows whether either **FLUSH** command has been called:

```
# Commandstats

cmdstat_flushall:calls=2,usec=112,usec_per_call=56.00

cmdstat_flushdb:calls=1,usec=110,usec_per_call=52.00
```

### Incorrect database selection

Azure Cache for Redis uses the **db0** database by default. If you switch to another database (for example, **db1**) and try to read keys from it, Azure Cache for Redis won't find them there. Every database is a logically separate unit and holds a different dataset. Use the [SELECT](http://redis.io/commands/select) command to use other available databases and look for keys in each of them.

### Redis instance failure

Redis is an in-memory data store. Data is kept on the physical or virtual machines that host the Redis cache. An Azure Cache for Redis instance in the Basic tier runs on only a single virtual machine (VM). If that VM is down, all data that you've stored in the cache is lost. 

Caches in the Standard and Premium tiers offer much higher resiliency against data loss by using two VMs in a replicated configuration. When the master node in such a cache fails, the replica node takes over to serve data automatically. These VMs are located on separate domains for faults and updates, to minimize the chance of both becoming unavailable simultaneously. If a major datacenter outage happens, however, the VMs might still go down together. Your data will be lost in these rare cases.

Consider using [Redis data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence) and [geo-replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-geo-replication) to improve protection of your data against these infrastructure failures.
