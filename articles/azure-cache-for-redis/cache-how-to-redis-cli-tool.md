# How to use the Redis command-line tool with Azure Cache for Redis

*redis-cli.exe* is a popular command-line tool for interacting with an Azure Cache for Redis as a client. This tool is also available for use with Azure Cache for Redis.

The tool is available for Windows platforms by downloading the [Redis command-line tools for Windows](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases/). 

If you want to run the command-line tool on another platform, download Azure Cache for Redis from [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download).

## Gather cache access information

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

You can gather the information needed to access the cache using three methods:

1. Azure CLI using [az redis list-keys](/cli/azure/redis?view=azure-cli-latest#az-redis-list-keys)
2. Azure PowerShell using [Get-AzRedisCacheKey](/powershell/module/az.rediscache/Get-AzRedisCacheKey)
3. Using the Azure portal.

In this section, you will retrieve the keys from the Azure portal.

[!INCLUDE [redis-cache-create](../../includes/redis-cache-access-keys.md)]


## Enable access for redis-cli.exe

With Azure Cache for Redis, only the TLS port (6380) is enabled by default. The `redis-cli.exe` command-line tool doesn't support TLS. You have two configuration choices to use it:

1. [Enable the non-TLS port (6379)](cache-configure.md#access-ports) - **This configuration is not recommended** because in this configuration, the access keys are sent via TCP in clear text. This change can compromise access to your cache. The only scenario where you might consider this configuration is when you are just accessing a test cache.

2. Download and install [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/downloads.html).

    Run **stunnel GUI Start** to start the server.

    Right-click the taskbar icon for the stunnel server and click **Show Log Window**.

    On the stunnel Log Window menu, click **Configuration** > **Edit Configuration** to open the current configuration file.

    Add the following entry for *redis-cli.exe* under the **Service definitions** section. Insert your actual cache name in place of `yourcachename`. 

    ```
    [redis-cli]
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:6380
    connect = yourcachename.redis.cache.windows.net:6380
    ```

    Save and close the configuration file. 
  
    On the stunnel Log Window menu, click **Configuration** > **Reload Configuration**.


## Connect using the Redis command-line tool.

When using stunnel, run *redis-cli.exe*, and pass only your *port*, and *access key* (primary or secondary) to connect to the cache.

```
redis-cli.exe -p 6380 -a YourAccessKey
```

If you're using a test cache with the **unsecure** non-TLS port, run `redis-cli.exe` and pass your *host name*, *port*, and *access key* (primary or secondary) to connect to the test cache.

```
redis-cli.exe -h yourcachename.redis.cache.windows.net -p 6379 -a YourAccessKey
```
