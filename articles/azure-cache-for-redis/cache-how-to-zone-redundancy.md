# Enable zone redundancy for Azure Cache for Redis (Preview)
In this article, you'll learn how to configure a zone-redundant Azure Cache instance using the Azure portal.

Azure Cache for Redis Standard and Premium tiers provide built-in redundancy by hosting each cache on two dedicated virtual machines (VMs). Even though these VMs are located in separate [Azure fault and update domains](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability) and highly available, they're susceptible to datacenter level failures. Azure Cache for Redis also supports zone redundancy in its Premium tier. A zone-redundant cache runs on VMs spread across multiple [availability zones](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability#use-availability-zones-to-protect-from-datacenter-level-failures). It provides higher resilience and availability.

## Create a cache
To create a cache, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Create a resource**.
  
1. On the **New** page, select **Databases** and then select **Azure Cache for Redis**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/cache-create/new-cache-menu.png" alt-text="Select Azure Cache for Redis.":::
   
1. On the **New Redis Cache** page, configure the settings for your new cache.
   
    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Description |
    | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | **DNS name** | Enter a globally unique name. | The cache name must be a string between 1 and 63 characters that contains only numbers, letters, or hyphens. The name must start and end with a number or letter, and can't contain consecutive hyphens. Your cache instance's *host name* will be *\<DNS name>.redis.cache.windows.net*. | 
    | **Subscription** | Drop down and select your subscription. | The subscription under which to create this new Azure Cache for Redis instance. | 
    | **Resource group** | Drop down and select a resource group, or select **Create new** and enter a new resource group name. | Name for the resource group in which to create your cache and other resources. By putting all your app resources in one resource group, you can easily manage or delete them together. | 
    | **Location** | Drop down and select a location. | Select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) near other services that will use your cache. |
    | **Pricing tier** | Drop down and select a [Premium tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cache/) cache. |  The pricing tier determines the size, performance, and features that are available for the cache. For more information, see [Azure Cache for Redis Overview](cache-overview.md). |
    | **Replica count** | Slide to choose the number of replicas. | Default is 1. |
    | **Availability zones** | Drop down and select which zones to use. | VMs for your cache will be distributed over the selected zones as evenly as possible. For example, if your cache has three replicas and uses two zones, there will be two VMs in each zone. |
   
1. After you select a Premium tier cache, you'll be asked whether to enable Redis clustering or not. Leave **Clustering** as *Disabled*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Zone redundancy support only works with non-clustered and non-geo-replicated caches currently. In addition, it doesn't support private link, scaling, data persistence, or import/export.
    >

1. Click **Create**. 
   
    :::image type="content" source="media/cache-how-to-zone-redundancy/create-zones.png" alt-text="Create Azure Cache for Redis.":::
   
    It takes a while for the cache to create. You can monitor progress on the Azure Cache for Redis **Overview** page. When **Status** shows as **Running**, the cache is ready to use.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Availability zones can't be changed after a cache is created.
