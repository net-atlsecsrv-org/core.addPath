# Configure active geo-replication for Enterprise Azure Cache for Redis instances (Preview)

In this article, you'll learn how to configure an active geo-replicated Azure Cache using the Azure portal.

Active geo-replication groups two or more Enterprise Azure Cache for Redis instances into a single cache that spans across Azure regions. All instance act as the local primaries. An application decides which instance(s) to use for read and write requests.

## Create or join an active geo-replication group

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Active geo-replication must be enabled at the time an Azure Cache for Redis is created.

1. In the **New Redis Cache** creation UI, click **Configure** to set up **Active geo-replication** in the **Advanced** tab.

1. Repeat the above steps for each additional cache instance in the geo-replication group.

## Remove from an active geo-replication group

To remove a cache instance from an active geo-replication group, simply delete the instance. The remaining instances will reconfigure themselves automatically.
