# Quickstart: Create an Enterprise tier cache (preview)

Azure Cache for Redis' Enterprise tiers provide fully integrated and managed [Redis Enterprise](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/) on Azure. They're currently available as a preview. There are two new tiers in this preview:
* Enterprise, which uses volatile memory (DRAM) on a virtual machine to store data
* Enterprise Flash, which uses both volatile and non-volatile memory (NVMe or SSD) to store data.

## Prerequisites

You'll need an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) first.

## Create a cache
1. To create a cache, sign in to the Azure portal using the link in your preview invitation and select **Create a resource**.

1. On the **New** page, select **Databases** and then select **Azure Cache for Redis**.

1. On the **New Redis Cache** page, configure the settings for your new cache.
   
   | Setting      | Suggested value  | Description |
   | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Subscription** | Drop down and select your subscription. | The subscription under which to create this new Azure Cache for Redis instance. | 
   | **Resource group** | Drop down and select a resource group, or select **Create new** and enter a new resource group name. | Name for the resource group in which to create your cache and other resources. By putting all your app resources in one resource group, you can easily manage or delete them together. | 
   | **DNS name** | Enter a globally unique name. | The cache name must be a string between 1 and 63 characters that contains only numbers, letters, or hyphens. The name must start and end with a number or letter, and can't contain consecutive hyphens. Your cache instance's *host name* will be *\<DNS name>.<Azure region>.redisenterprise.cache.azure.net*. | 
   | **Location** | Drop down and select a location. | Enterprise tiers are available in limited Azure regions during the preview. |
   | **Cache type** | Drop down and select an *Enterprise* or *Enterprise Flash* tier and a size. |  The tier determines the size, performance, and features that are available for the cache. |

   You can keep the default settings or change them as appropriate. When turning on **Allow access only via TLS**, you must use TLS to access the new cache from your application.

   > be sure to choose an Enterprise tier cache.
   >
   
1. Select **Next: Tags** and skip.

1. Select **Next: Review + create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-create/enterprise-tier-summary.png" alt-text="Enterprise tier summary":::

1. Review the settings and click **Create**.
   
   It takes some time for the cache to create. You can monitor progress on the Azure Cache for Redis **Overview** page. When **Status** shows as **Running**, the cache is ready to use.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to create an Enterprise tier instance of Azure Cache for Redis.
