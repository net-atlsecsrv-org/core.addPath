# Quickstart: Create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid mode using the Azure portal (Preview)

Azure Database Migration Service hybrid mode manages database migrations by using a migration worker that is hosted on-premises together with an instance of Azure Database Migration Service running in the cloud. Hybrid mode is especially useful for scenarios in which there's a lack of site-to-site connectivity between the on-premises network and Azure or if there's limited site-to-site connectivity bandwidth.

In this Quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid mode. Afterwards, you download, install, and set up the hybrid worker in your on-premises network. During preview, you can use Azure Database Migration Service hybrid mode to migrate data from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Database Migration Service hybrid installer requires .NET 4.7.2 or later. To find the latest versions of .NET, see the [Download .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) page.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Open your web browser, navigate to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then enter your credentials to sign in to the portal.

The default view is your service dashboard.

## Register the resource provider

Register the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider before you create your first instance of Azure Database Migration Service.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Subscriptions**, select the subscription in which you want to create the instance of Azure Database Migration Service, and then select **Resource providers**.

    ![Search resource provider](media/quickstart-create-data-migration-service-hybrid-portal/dms-portal-search-resource-provider.png)

2. Search for migration, and then to the right of **Microsoft.DataMigration**, select **Register**.

    ![Register resource provider](media/quickstart-create-data-migration-service-hybrid-portal/dms-portal-register-resource-provider.png)

## Create an instance of the service

1. Select +**Create a resource** to create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service.

2. Search the marketplace for "migration", select **Azure Database Migration Service**, and then on the **Azure Database Migration Service** screen, select **Create**.

3. On the **Create Migration Service** screen:

    - Choose a **Service Name** that is memorable and unique to identify your instance of Azure Database Migration Service.
    - Select the Azure **Subscription** in which you want to create the instance.
    - Select an existing **Resource Group** or create a new one.
    - Choose the **Location** that is closest to your source or target server.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > During preview, hybrid mode is supported only in the East US region. Since the hybrid worker is installed in your on-premises network, there is little or no impact on performance even if you are migrating to a target in a different region.

    - For **Service mode**, select **Hybrid (Preview)**.

4. Select **Review + create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, review the Terms, verify the other information provided, and then select **Create**.

    After a few moments, your instance of Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid mode is created and ready to set up. The Azure Database Migration Service instance displays as shown in the following image:

6. After the service created, select **Properties**, and then copy the value displayed in the **Resource Id** box, which you will use to install the Azure Database Migration Service hybrid worker.

## Create Azure App registration ID

You need to create an Azure App registration ID that the on-premises hybrid worker can use to communicate with Azure Database Migration Service in the cloud.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **App registrations**, and then select **New registration**.
2. Specify a name for the application, and then, under **Supported account types**, select the type of accounts to support to specify who can use the application.

3. Use the default values for the **Redirect URI (optional)** fields, and then select **Register**.

4. After App ID registration is completed, make a note of the **Application (client) ID**, which you'll use while installing the hybrid worker.

5. In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Database Migration Service, select **Access control (IAM)**, and then select **Add role assignment** to assign contributor access to the App ID.

6. Select **Contributor** as the role, assign access to **Azure AD user, or service principal**, and then select the App ID name.

7. Select **Save** to save the role assignment for the App ID on the Azure Database Migration Service resource.

## Download and install the hybrid worker

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your instance of Azure Database Migration Service.

2. Under **Settings**, select **Hybrid**, and then select **Installer download** to download the hybrid worker.

3. Extract the ZIP file on the server that will be hosting the Azure Database Migration Service hybrid worker.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The Azure Database Migration Service hybrid installer requires .NET 4.7.2 or later. To find the latest versions of .NET, see the [Download .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) page.

4. In the install folder, locate and open the **dmsSettings.json** file, specify the **ApplicationId** and **resourceId**, and then save the file.

5. Generate a certificate that Azure Database Migration Service can use to authenticate the communication from the hybrid worker by using the following command.

    ```
    <drive>:\<folder>\Install>DMSWorkerBootstrap.exe -a GenerateCert
    ```

    A certificate is generated in the Install folder.

6. In the Azure portal, navigate to the App ID, under **Manage**, select **Certificated & secrets**, and then select **Upload certificate** to select the public certificate you generated.

7. Install the Azure Database Migration Service hybrid worker on your on-premises server by running the following command:

    ```
    <drive>:\<folder>\Install>DMSWorkerBootstrap.exe -a Install -IAcceptDMSLicenseTerms
    ```

8. If the installer runs without error, then the service will show an online status in Azure Database Migration Service and you're ready to migrate your databases.

## Uninstall Azure Database Migration Service hybrid mode

Currently, uninstalling Azure Database Migration Service hybrid mode is supported only via the Azure Database Migration Service hybrid worker installer on your on-premises server, by using the following command:

```
<drive>:\<folder>\Install>DMSWorkerBootstrap.exe -a uninstall
```
