# Azure security baseline for Azure Database Migration Service

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Database Migration Service. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Database Migration Service. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Database Migration Service have been excluded.

To see how Azure Database Migration Service completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Database Migration Service security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

**Guidance**: When you deploy Azure Database Migration Service resources you must create or use an existing virtual network. Ensure that all Azure virtual networks follow an enterprise segmentation principle that aligns to the business risks. Any system that could incur higher risk for the organization should be isolated within its own virtual network and sufficiently secured with either a network security group (NSG) and/or Azure Firewall.

Azure Database Migration Service uses TLS 1.2 by default. If needed for backward compatibility for the data source being migrated, support for TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 can be enabled in the service configuration blade of your Azure Database Migration Service.

Use Azure Sentinel to discover the use of legacy insecure protocols such as SSL/TLSv1, SMBv1, LM/NTLMv1, wDigest, Unsigned LDAP Binds, and weak ciphers in Kerberos.

### NS-2: Connect private networks together

**Guidance**: If your migration use case involves cross network traffic, you have option to use Azure ExpressRoute or Azure virtual private network (VPN) to create private connections between Azure datacenters and on-premises infrastructure in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public internet, and they offer more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections. For point-to-site VPN and site-to-site VPN, you can connect on-premises devices or networks to a virtual network using any combination of these VPN options and Azure ExpressRoute. To connect two or more virtual networks in Azure together, use virtual network peering. Network traffic between peered virtual networks is private and is kept on the Azure backbone network.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-3: Establish private network access to Azure services

**Guidance**: Where applicable, use Azure Private Link to enable private access to source and destination services such as Azure SQL Server, or other required services during migration.  In situations where Azure Private Link is not yet available, use Azure Virtual Network service endpoints.  Both Azure Private Link and service endpoints provide secure access to services via an optimized route over the Azure backbone network without crossing the internet.  

In addition, make sure the prerequisites are fulfilled before provisioning Azure Database Migration Service on your virtual network, including the communication ports that need to be allowed.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the default identity and access management service. You should standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:
Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machine (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.

Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Securing Azure AD should be a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you assess identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

Azure AD supports external identities that allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

- [Tenancy in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps.md) 

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) 

- [Use external identity providers for application](/azure/active-directory/b2b/identity-providers) 

- [What is the identity secure score in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/identity-secure-score.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-2: Manage application identities securely and automatically

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration service requires users to create an Application ID (service principle) and authentication key in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for migrations to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance in 'Online' mode. This Application ID requires either the Contributor role at the subscription level (which is not recommended due to the excessive access permissions Contributor role would be granted) or creation of custom roles with specific permissions that Azure Database Migrations Service requires.

It is recommended to remove this Application ID once the migrations are complete.

- [Custom roles for SQL Server to Azure SQL Managed Instance online migrations](resource-custom-roles-sql-db-managed-instance.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service is integrated with Azure Active Directory for identity and access management to Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. This enables single sign-on (SSO) to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications, and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility and control.

- [Understand Application SSO with Azure AD](../active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Active Directory that supports strong authentication controls through multifactor authentication, and strong passwordless methods.
Multifactor authentication - Enable Azure AD multifactor authentication and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your multifactor authentication setup. Multifactor authentication can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.

Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the strongest level of authentication is used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

- [Eliminate bad passwords using Azure Active Directory Password Protection](../active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service is integrated with Azure Active Directory in which provides the following data sources:
Sign-ins - The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

These data sources can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third-party SIEM systems.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-6: Restrict Azure resource access based on conditions

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure AD for authentication in which conditional access is available for a more granular access control based on user-defined conditions, such as user logins from certain IP ranges will need to use multifactor authentication for login. Granular authentication session management policy can also be used for different use cases.

- [Configure authentication session management with conditional access](../active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-7: Eliminate unintended credential exposure

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service allows customers to deploy/run code or configurations or persisted data potentially with identities/secretes, it is recommended to implement Credential Scanner to identify credentials within code or configurations or persisted data. Credential Scanner will also encourage moving discovered credentials to more secure locations such as Azure Key Vault.

If GitHub is used, you can use native secret scanning feature to identify credentials or other form of secrets within the code.

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration service requires users to create an Application ID (service principle) and authentication key in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for migrations to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance in 'Online' mode. It is recommended to remove this Application ID once the migrations are complete.

- [How Application ID is used in the Online migration mode](tutorial-sql-server-managed-instance-online.md)

- [Custom roles for SQL Server to Azure SQL Managed Instance online migrations](resource-custom-roles-sql-db-managed-instance.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-4: Set up emergency access in Azure AD

**Guidance**: Outside of Azure Database Migration Service, as a general practice to prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-5: Automate entitlement management 

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service is integrated with Azure Active Directory to manage its resources. Use Azure AD entitlement management features to automate access request workflows, including access assignments, reviews, and expiration. Dual or multi-stage approval is also supported.

- [What is Azure AD entitlement management](../active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. Use highly secured user workstations and/or Azure Bastion for administrative tasks. Use Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and/or Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, restricted logical and network access.

- [Deploy a privileged access workstation](../active-directory/devices/howto-azure-managed-workstation.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service is integrated with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-data-protection).*

### DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service encrypts the data in transit from the sources configured by the customer to the database migration service instance by default using TLS 1.2 or later. You can choose to disable this if the source server does not support TLS 1.2 connection, although it is highly recommended not to do so. Transfer of data from database migration service instance to the target instance is always encrypted.  

Outside of the Azure Database Migration Service, you can use access controls, data in transit should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (e.g. traffic capture) using encryption to ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data. Ensure for HTTP traffic, that any clients connecting to your Azure resources can negotiate TLS v1.2 or greater.
For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of unencrypted protocol. Obsoleted SSL/TLS/SSH versions, protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.

At the underlying infrastructure, Azure provides data in transit encryption by default for data traffic between Azure data centers.

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

- [Overview of Azure Management Groups](../governance/management-groups/overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### AM-2: Ensure security team has access to asset inventory and metadata

**Guidance**: Apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production.

Azure Database Migration Service does not allow running an application or installation of software on its resources.

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-detection).*

### LT-2: Enable threat detection for Azure identity and access management

**Guidance**: Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability gives you visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-3: Enable logging for Azure network activities

**Guidance**: Enable and collect network security group (NSG) resource logs, NSG flow logs, Azure Firewall logs, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs for security analysis to support incident investigations, threat hunting, and security alert generation. You can send the flow logs to an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights.

Azure Database Migration Service does not produce or process DNS query logs which would need to be enabled.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-5: Centralize security log management and analysis

**Guidance**: Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation. For each log source, ensure you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements.

Ensure you are integrating Azure activity logs into your central logging. Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

In addition, enable and onboard data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

Many organizations choose to use Azure Sentinel for “hot” data that is used frequently and Azure Storage for “cold” data that is used less frequently.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-incident-response).*

### IR-1: Preparation – update incident response process for Azure

**Guidance**: Ensure your organization has processes to respond to security incidents, has updated these processes for Azure, and is regularly exercising them to ensure readiness.

- [Implement security across the enterprise environment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/security/security-top-10#4-process-update-incident-response-ir-processes-for-cloud) 

- [Incident response reference guide](/microsoft-365/downloads/IR-Reference-Guide.pdf)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-2: Preparation – setup incident notification

**Guidance**: Set up security incident contact information in Azure Security Center. This contact information is used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. You also have options to customize incident alert and notification in different Azure services based on your incident response needs. 

- [How to set the Azure Security Center security contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high-quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High-quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high-quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

- [How to configure export](../security-center/continuous-export.md)

- [How to stream alerts into Azure Sentinel](../sentinel/connect-azure-security-center.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

## Governance and Strategy

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Governance and Strategy](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-governance-strategy).*

### GS-1: Define asset management and data protection strategy 

**Guidance**: Ensure you document and communicate a clear strategy for continuous monitoring and protection of systems and data. Prioritize discovery, assessment, protection, and monitoring of business-critical data and systems. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	Data classification standard in accordance with the business risks

-	Security organization visibility into risks and asset inventory 

-	Security organization approval of Azure services for use 

-	Security of assets through their lifecycle

-	Required access control strategy in accordance with organizational data classification

-	Use of Azure native and third-party data protection capabilities

-	Data encryption requirements for in-transit and at-rest use cases

### GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy 

**Guidance**: Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.

### GS-7: Define logging and threat response strategy

**Guidance**: Establish a logging and threat response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats while meeting compliance requirements. Prioritize providing analysts with high-quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than integration and manual steps. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs

-	Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native Azure capabilities, and other sources 

-	Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest

-	Use of Azure native and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication

-	Processes for handling incidents and post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention
