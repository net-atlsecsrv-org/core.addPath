# Quickstart: Create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service by using the Azure portal
In this Quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.  After you create the service, you can use it to migrate data from SQL Server on-premises to an Azure SQL database.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.

## Log in to the Azure portal
Open your web browser, navigate to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then enter your credentials to sign in to the portal.

The default view is your service dashboard.

## Register the resource provider
Register the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider before you create your first instance of the Database Migration Service.

1. In the Azure portal, select **All services**, and then select **Subscriptions**.

2. Select the subscription in which you want to create the instance of the Azure Database Migration Service, and then select **Resource providers**.

3. Search for migration, and then to the right of **Microsoft.DataMigration**, select **Register**.

## Create an instance of the service
1. Select +**Create a resource** to create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.

2. Search the marketplace for "migration", select **Azure Database Migration Service**, and then on the **Azure Database Migration Service** screen, select **Create**.

3. On the **Create Migration Service** screen: 

    - Choose a **Service Name** that is memorable and unique to identify your instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.
    - Select the Azure **Subscription** in which you want to create the instance.
    - Select an existing **Resource Group** or create a new one.
    - Choose the **Location** that is closest to your source or target server.
    - Select an existing **Virtual network** (VNET) or create one.

        The VNET provides the Azure Database Migration Service with access to the source database and target environment.

        For more information on how to create a VNET in the Azure portal, see the article [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/vnet).

    - Select Basic: 1 vCore for the **Pricing tier**.

4. Select **Create**.

    After a few moments, your instance of the Azure Database Migration service is created and ready to use. The Database Migration Service displays as shown in the following image:

## Clean up resources
You can clean up the resources created in this Quickstart by deleting the [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md). To delete the resource group, navigate to the instance of the Azure Database Migration Service that you created. Select the **Resource group** name, and then select **Delete resource group**. This action deletes all assets in the resource group as well as the group itself.
