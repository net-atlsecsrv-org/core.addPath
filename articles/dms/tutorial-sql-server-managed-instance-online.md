# Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to an Azure SQL Database managed instance online using DMS

You can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the databases from an on-premises SQL Server instance to an [Azure SQL Database managed instance](../sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance.md) with minimal downtime. For additional methods that may require some manual effort, see the article [SQL Server instance migration to Azure SQL Database managed instance](../sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-migrate.md).

In this tutorial, you migrate the **Adventureworks2012** database from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to a SQL Database managed instance with minimal downtime by using Azure Database Migration Service.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service.
> * Create a migration project and start online migration by using Azure Database Migration Service.
> * Monitor the migration.
> * Perform the migration cutover when you are ready.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For online migrations from SQL Server to SQL Database managed instance using Azure Database Migration Service,  you must provide the full database backup and subsequent log backups in the SMB network share that the service can use to migrate your databases. Azure Database Migration Service does not initiate any backups, and instead uses existing backups, which you may already have as part of your disaster recovery plan, for the migration.
> Be sure that you take [backups using the WITH CHECKSUM option](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/enable-or-disable-backup-checksums-during-backup-or-restore-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017). Also, make sure not to append multiple backups (i.e. full and t-log) into a single backup media; take each backup on a separate backup file. Finally, you can use compressed backups to reduce the likelihood of experiencing potential issues associated with migrating large backups.

> [!NOTE]
> Using Azure Database Migration Service to perform an online migration requires creating an instance based on the Premium pricing tier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For an optimal migration experience, Microsoft recommends creating an instance of  Azure Database Migration Service in the same Azure region as the target database. Moving data across regions or geographies can slow down the migration process and introduce errors.

[!INCLUDE [online-offline](../../includes/database-migration-service-offline-online.md)]

This article describes an online migration from SQL Server to a SQL Database managed instance. For an offline migration, see [Migrate SQL Server to a SQL Database managed instance offline using DMS](tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

* Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) for Azure Database Migration Service by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises source servers by using either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). [Learn network topologies for Azure SQL Database managed instance migrations using Azure Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/dmsnetworkformi). For more information about creating a VNet, see the [Virtual Network Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/), and especially the quickstart articles with step-by-step details.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During VNet setup, if you use ExpressRoute with network peering to Microsoft, add the following service [endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) to the subnet in which the service will be provisioned:
    >
    > * Target database endpoint (for example, SQL endpoint, Cosmos DB endpoint, and so on)
    > * Storage endpoint
    > * Service bus endpoint
    >
    > This configuration is necessary because Azure Database Migration Service lacks internet connectivity.
    >
    >If you donâ€™t have site-to-site connectivity between the on-premises network and Azure or if there is limited site-to-site connectivity bandwidth, consider using Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid mode (Preview). Hybrid mode leverages an on-premises migration worker together with an instance of Azure Database Migration Service running in the cloud. To create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid mode, see the article [Create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid mode using the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/dms-hybrid-create).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Regarding the storage account used as part of the migration, you must either:
    > * Choose to allow all network to access the storage account.
    > * Set up ACLs for the VNet. For more information, see the article [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security).

* Ensure that your VNet Network Security Group rules don't block the following inbound communication ports to Azure Database Migration Service: 443, 53, 9354, 445, 12000. For more detail on Azure VNet NSG traffic filtering, see the article [Filter network traffic with network security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg).
* Configure your [Windows Firewall for source database engine access](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).
* Open your Windows Firewall to allow Azure Database Migration Service to access the source SQL Server, which by default is TCP port 1433.
* If you're running multiple named SQL Server instances using dynamic ports, you may wish to enable the SQL Browser Service and allow access to UDP port 1434 through your firewalls so that Azure Database Migration Service can connect to a named instance on your source server.
* If you're using a firewall appliance in front of your source databases, you may need to add firewall rules to allow Azure Database Migration Service to access the source database(s) for migration, as well as files via SMB port 445.
* Create a SQL Database managed instance by following the detail in the article [Create an Azure SQL Database managed instance in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/sqldbmi).
* Ensure that the logins used to connect the source SQL Server and the target managed instance are members of the sysadmin server role.
* Provide an SMB network share that contains all your database full database backup files and subsequent transaction log backup files, which Azure Database Migration Service can use for database migration.
* Ensure that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has write privileges on the network share that you created and that the computer account for the source server has read/write access to the same share.
* Make a note of a Windows user (and password) that has full control privilege on the network share that you previously created. Azure Database Migration Service impersonates the user credential to upload the backup files to Azure storage container for restore operation.
* Create an Azure Active Directory Application ID that generates the Application ID key that Azure Database Migration Service can use to connect to target Azure Database managed instance and Azure Storage Container. For more information, see the article [Use portal to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Azure Database Migration Service requires the Contributor permission on the subscription for the specified Application ID. Alternatively, you can create custom roles that grant the specific permissions that Azure Database Migration Service requires. For step-by-step guidance about using custom roles, see the article [Custom roles for SQL Server to SQL Database managed instance online migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/resource-custom-roles-sql-db-managed-instance).

* Create or make a note of **Standard Performance tier**, Azure Storage Account, that allows DMS service to upload the database backup files to and use for migrating databases.  Make sure to create the Azure Storage Account in the same region as the Azure Database Migration Service instance is created.

    ![Select source databases](media/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance-online/dms-select-source-databases2.png)

2. Select **Save**.

## Configure migration settings

1. On the **Configure migration settings** screen, provide the following detail:

    | | |
    |--------|---------|
    |**SMB Network location share** | The local SMB network share or Azure file share that contains the Full database backup files and transaction log backup files that Azure Database Migration Service can use for migration. The service account running the source SQL Server instance must have read\write privileges on this network share. Provide an FQDN or IP addresses of the server in the network share, for example, '\\\servername.domainname.com\backupfolder' or '\\\IP address\backupfolder'.|
    |**User name** | Make sure that the Windows user has full control privilege on the network share that you provided above. Azure Database Migration Service will impersonate the user credential to upload the backup files to Azure storage container for restore operation. If using Azure File share, use the storage account name pre-pended with AZURE\ as the username. |
    |**Password** | Password for the user. If using Azure file share, use a storage account key as the password. |
    |**Subscription of the Azure Storage Account** | Select the subscription that contains the Azure Storage Account. |
    |**Azure Storage Account** | Select the Azure Storage Account that DMS can upload the backup files from the SMB network share to and use for database migration.  We recommend selecting the Storage Account in the same region as the DMS service for optimal file upload performance. |

    ![Configure Migration Settings](media/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance-online/dms-configure-migration-settings4.png)


> [!NOTE]
  > If Azure Database Migration Service shows error â€˜System Error 53â€™ or â€˜System Error 57â€™, the cause might result frm an inability of Azure Database Migration Service to access Azure file share. If you encounter one of these errors, please grant access to the storage account from the virtual network using the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network).


2. Select **Save**.

## Review the migration summary

1. On the **Migration summary** screen, in the **Activity name** text box, specify a name for the migration activity.

2. Review and verify the details associated with the migration project.

    ![Migration project summary](media/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance-online/dms-project-summary3.png)

## Run and monitor the migration

1. Select **Run migration**.

2. On the migration activity screen, select **Refresh** to update the display.

   ![Migration activity in progress](media/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance-online/dms-monitor-migration2.png)

    You can further expand the databases and logins categories to monitor the migration status of the respective server objects.

   ![Migration activity in progress](media/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance-online/dms-monitor-migration-extend2.png)

## Performing migration cutover

After the full database backup is restored on the target instance of SQL Database managed instance, the database is available for performing a migration cutover.

1. When you're ready to complete the online database migration, select **Start Cutover**.

2. Stop all the incoming traffic to source databases.

3. Take the [tail-log backup], make the backup file available in the SMB network share, and then wait until this final transaction log backup is restored.

    At that point, you'll see **Pending changes** set to 0.

4. Select **Confirm**, and then select **Apply**.

    ![Preparing to complete cutover](media/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance-online/dms-complete-cutover.png)

5. When the database migration status shows **Completed**, connect your applications to the new target instance of  Azure SQL Database managed instance.
