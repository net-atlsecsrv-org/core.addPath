# Status of migration scenarios supported by Azure Database Migration Service

Azure Database Migration Service is designed to support different migration scenarios (source/target pairs) for both offline (one-time) and online (continuous sync) migrations. The scenario coverage provided by Azure Database Migration Service is being extended over time. New scenarios are being added on a regular basis. This article identifies migration scenarios currently supported by Azure Database Migration Service and the status (private preview, public preview, or general availability) for each scenario.

## Offline versus online migrations

With Azure Database Migration Service, you can do an offline or an online migration. With *offline* migrations, application downtime begins at the same time that the migration starts. To limit downtime to the time required to cut over to the new environment when the migration completes, use an *online* migration. It's recommended to test an offline migration to determine whether the downtime is acceptable; if not, do an online migration.

## Migration scenario status

The status of migration scenarios supported by Azure Database Migration Service varies with time. Generally, scenarios are first released in **private preview**. Participating in private preview requires customers to submit a nomination via the [DMS Preview site](https://aka.ms/dms-preview). After private preview, the scenario status changes to **public preview**. Azure Database Migration Service users can try out migration scenarios in public preview directly from the user interface. No sign-up is required.  However, migration scenarios in public preview may not be available in all regions and may undergo additional changes before final release. After public preview, the scenario status changes to **generally availability**. General availability (GA) is the final release status, and the functionality is complete and accessible to all users.

## Migration scenario support

The following tables show which migration scenarios are supported when using Azure Database Migration Service.
