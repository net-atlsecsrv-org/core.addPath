# Managed identities for Azure SignalR Service

This article shows you how to create a managed identity for Azure SignalR Service and how to use it in serverless scenarios.

> [!Important] 
> Azure SignalR Service can support only one managed identity. That means you can add either a system-assigned identity or a user-assigned identity. 

## Add a system-assigned identity

To set up a managed identity in the Azure portal, you'll first create an Azure SignalR Service instance and then enable the feature.

1. Create an Azure SignalR Service instance in the portal as you normally would. Browse to it in the portal.

2. Select **Identity**.

4. On the **System assigned** tab, switch **Status** to **On**. Select **Save**.

## Add a user-assigned identity

Creating an Azure SignalR Service instance with a user-assigned identity requires that you create the identity and then add its resource identifier to your service.

1. Create a user-assigned managed identity resource according to [these instructions](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).

2. Create an Azure SignalR Service instance in the portal as you normally would. Browse to it in the portal.

3. Select **Identity**.

4. On the **User assigned** tab, select **Add**.

5. Search for the identity that you created earlier and selects it. Select **Add**.

## Use a managed identity in serverless scenarios

Azure SignalR Service is a fully managed service, so you can't use a managed identity to get tokens manually. Instead, Azure SignalR Service uses the managed identity that you set to obtain an access token. The service then sets the access token into an `Authorization` header in an upstream request in serverless scenarios.

### Enable managed identity authentication in upstream settings

1. Add a system-assigned identity or user-assigned identity.

2. Add one Upstream Setting and click any asterisk to get into a detailed page as shown below.

    :::image type="content" source="media/signalr-howto-use-managed-identity/msi-settings.png" alt-text="msi-setting":::

3. In the managed identity authentication settings, for **Resource**, you can specify the target resource. The resource will become an `aud` claim in the obtained access token, which can be used as a part of validation in your upstream endpoints. The resource can be one of the following:
    - Empty
    - Application (client) ID of the service principal
    - Application ID URI of the service principal
    - [Resource ID of an Azure service](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-azure-ad-authentication)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you validate an access token by yourself in your service, you can choose any one of the resource formats. Just make sure that the **Resource** value in **Auth** settings and the validation are consistent. If you use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) for a data plane, you must use the resource that the service provider requests.

### Validate access tokens

The token in the `Authorization` header is a [Microsoft identity platform access token](../active-directory/develop/access-tokens.md#validating-tokens).

To validate access tokens, your app should also validate the audience and the signing tokens. These need to be validated against the values in the OpenID discovery document. For example, see the [tenant-independent version of the document](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration).

The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) middleware has built-in capabilities for validating access tokens. You can browse through our [samples](../active-directory/develop/sample-v2-code.md) to find one in the language of your choice.

We provide libraries and code samples that show how to handle token validation. There are also several open-source partner libraries available for JSON Web Token (JWT) validation. There's at least one option for almost every platform and language out there. For more information about Azure AD authentication libraries and code samples, see [Microsoft identity platform authentication libraries](../active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries.md).

#### Authentication in Function App

Setting access token validation in Function App is easy and efficient without code works.

1. In the **Authentication / Authorization** page, switch **App Service Authentication** to **On**.

2. Select **Log in with Azure Active Directory** in **Action to take when request is not authenticated**.

3. In the Authentication Provider, click into **Azure Active Directory**

4. In the new page. Select **Express** and **Create New AD App** and then click **OK**

5. Navigate to SignalR Service and follow [steps](howto-use-managed-identity.md#add-a-system-assigned-identity) to add a system-assigned identity or user-assigned identity.

6. Get into **Upstream settings** in SignalR Service and choose **Use Managed Identity** and **Select from existing Applications**. Select the application you created previously.

After these settings, the Function App will reject requests without an access token in the header.

## Use a managed identity for Key Vault reference

SignalR Service can access Key Vault to get secret using the managed identity.

1. Add a system-assigned identity or user-assigned identity for Azure SignalR Service.

2. Grant secret read permission for the managed identity in the Access policies in the Key Vault. See [Assign a Key Vault access policy using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy-portal)

Currently, this feature can be used in the following scenarios:
