# Upstream settings

Upstream is a preview feature that allows Azure SignalR Service to send messages and connection events to a set of endpoints in serverless mode. You can use upstream to invoke a hub method from clients in serverless mode and let endpoints get notified when client connections are connected or disconnected.

> [!NOTE]
> Only serverless mode can configure upstream settings.

## Details of upstream settings

Upstream settings consist of a list of order-sensitive items. Each item consists of:

* A URL template, which specifies where messages send to.
* A set of rules.
* Authentication configurations. 

When the specified event happens, an item's rules are checked one by one in order. Messages will be sent to the first matching item's upstream URL.

### URL template settings

You can parameterize the URL to support various patterns. There are three predefined parameters:

|Predefined parameter|Description|
|---------|---------|
|{hub}| A hub is a concept of Azure SignalR Service. A hub is a unit of isolation. The scope of users and message delivery is constrained to a hub.|
|{category}| A category can be one of the following values: <ul><li>**connections**: Connection lifetime events. It's fired when a client connection is connected or disconnected. It includes connected and disconnected events.</li><li>**messages**: Fired when clients invoke a hub method. It includes all other events, except those in the **connections** category.</li></ul>|
|{event}| For the **messages** category, an event is the target in an [invocation message](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#invocation-message-encoding) that clients send. For the **connections** category, only *connected* and *disconnected* are used.|

These predefined parameters can be used in the URL pattern. Parameters will be replaced with a specified value when you're evaluating the upstream URL. For example: 
```
http://host.com/{hub}/api/{category}/{event}
```
When a client connection in the "chat" hub is connected, a message will be sent to this URL:
```
http://host.com/chat/api/connections/connected
```
When a client in the "chat" hub invokes the hub method `broadcast`, a message will be sent to this URL:
```
http://host.com/chat/api/messages/broadcast
```

### Key Vault secret reference in URL template settings

The URL of upstream is not encryption at rest. If you have any sensitive information, it's suggested to use Key Vault to save them where access control has better insurance. Basically, you can enable the managed identity of Azure SignalR Service and then grant read permission on a Key Vault instance and use Key Vault reference instead of plaintext in Upstream URL Pattern.

1. Add a system-assigned identity or user-assigned identity. See [How to add managed identity in Azure Portal](./howto-use-managed-identity.md#add-a-system-assigned-identity)

2. Grant secret read permission for the managed identity in the Access policies in the Key Vault. See [Assign a Key Vault access policy using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy-portal)

3. Replace your sensitive text with the syntax `{@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=<secret-identity>)}` in the Upstream URL Pattern.

> [!NOTE]
> The secret content only rereads when you change the Upstream settings or change the managed identity. Make sure you have granted secret read permission to the managed identity before using the Key Vault secret reference.

### Rule settings

You can set rules for *hub rules*, *category rules*, and *event rules* separately. The matching rule supports three formats. Take event rules as an example:
- Use an asterisk(*) to match any events.
- Use a comma (,) to join multiple events. For example, `connected, disconnected` matches the connected and disconnected events.
- Use the full event name to match the event. For example, `connected` matches the connected event.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Azure Functions and [SignalR trigger](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service-trigger.md), SignalR trigger will expose a single endpoint in the following format: `<Function_App_URL>/runtime/webhooks/signalr?code=<API_KEY>`.
> You can just configure **URL template settings** to this url and keep **Rule settings** default. See [SignalR Service integration](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service-trigger.md#signalr-service-integration) for details about how to find `<Function_App_URL>` and `<API_KEY>`.

### Authentication settings

You can configure authentication for each upstream setting item separately. When you configure authentication, a token is set in the `Authentication` header of the upstream message. Currently, Azure SignalR Service supports the following authentication types:
- `None`
- `ManagedIdentity`

When you select `ManagedIdentity`, you must enable a managed identity in Azure SignalR Service in advance and optionally specify a resource. See [Managed identities for Azure SignalR Service](howto-use-managed-identity.md) for details.

## Create upstream settings via the Azure portal

1. Go to Azure SignalR Service.
2. Select **Settings** and switch **Service Mode** to **Serverless**. The upstream settings will appear:

    :::image type="content" source="media/concept-upstream/upstream-portal.png" alt-text="Upstream settings":::

3. Add URLs under **Upstream URL Pattern**. Then settings such as **Hub Rules** will show the default value.
4. To set settings for **Hub Rules**, **Event Rules**, **Category Rules**, and **Upstream Authentication**, select the value of **Hub Rules**. A page that allows you to edit settings appears:

    :::image type="content" source="media/concept-upstream/upstream-detail-portal.png" alt-text="Upstream setting details":::

5. To set **Upstream Authentication**, make sure you've enabled a managed identity first. Then select **Use Managed Identity**. According to your needs, you can choose any options under **Auth Resource ID**. See [Managed identities for Azure SignalR Service](howto-use-managed-identity.md) for details.

## Create upstream settings via Resource Manager template

To create upstream settings by using an [Azure Resource Manager template](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md), set the `upstream` property in the `properties` property. The following snippet shows how to set the `upstream` property for creating and updating upstream settings.

```JSON
{
  "properties": {
    "upstream": {
      "templates": [
        {
          "UrlTemplate": "http://host.com/{hub}/api/{category}/{event}",
          "EventPattern": "*",
          "HubPattern": "*",
          "CategoryPattern": "*",
          "Auth": {
            "Type": "ManagedIdentity",
            "ManagedIdentity": {
              "Resource": "<resource>"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Serverless protocols

Azure SignalR Service sends messages to endpoints that follow the following protocols. You can use [SignalR Service trigger binding](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service-trigger.md) with Function App, which handles these protocols for you.

### Method

POST

### Request header

|Name |Description|
|---------|---------|
|X-ASRS-Connection-Id |The connection ID for the client connection.|
|X-ASRS-Hub |The hub that the client connection belongs to.|
|X-ASRS-Category |The category that the message belongs to.|
|X-ASRS-Event |The event that the message belongs to.|
|X-ASRS-Signature |A hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) that's used for validation. See [Signature](#signature) for details.|
|X-ASRS-User-Claims |A group of claims of the client connection.|
|X-ASRS-User-Id |The user identity of the client that sends the message.|
|X-ASRS-Client-Query |The query of the request when clients connect to the service.|
|Authentication |An optional token when you're using `ManagedIdentity`. |

### Request body

#### Connected

Content-Type: application/json

#### Disconnected

Content-Type: `application/json`

|Name  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Error |string |The error message of a closed connection. Empty when connections close with no error.|

#### Invocation message

Content-Type: `application/json` or `application/x-msgpack`

|Name  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|InvocationId |string | An optional string that represents an invocation message. Find details in [Invocations](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#invocations).|
|Target |string | The same as the event and the same as the target in an [invocation message](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#invocation-message-encoding). |
|Arguments |Array of object |An array that contains arguments to apply to the method referred to in `Target`. |

### Signature

The service will calculate SHA256 code for the `X-ASRS-Connection-Id` value by using both the primary access key and the secondary access key as the `HMAC` key. The service will set it in the `X-ASRS-Signature` header when making HTTP requests to upstream:
```
Hex_encoded(HMAC_SHA256(accessKey, connection-id))
```
