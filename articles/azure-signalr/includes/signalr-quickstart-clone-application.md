## Clone the sample application

While the service is deploying, let's switch to working with code. Clone the [sample app from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat), set the SignalR Service connection string, and run the application locally.

1. Open a git terminal window. Change to a folder where you want to clone the sample project.

1. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat.git
    ```
