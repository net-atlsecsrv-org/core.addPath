# Azure Functions development and configuration with Azure SignalR Service

Azure Functions applications can leverage the [Azure SignalR Service bindings](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md) to add real-time capabilities. Client applications use client SDKs available in several languages to connect to Azure SignalR Service and receive real-time messages.

This article describes the concepts for developing and configuring an Azure Function app that is integrated with SignalR Service.

## SignalR Service configuration

Azure SignalR Service can be configured in different modes. When used with Azure Functions, the service must be configured in *Serverless* mode.

In the Azure portal, locate the *Settings* page of your SignalR Service resource. Set the *Service mode* to *Serverless*.

## Azure Functions development

A serverless real-time application built with Azure Functions and Azure SignalR Service typically requires two Azure Functions:

* A "negotiate" function that the client calls to obtain a valid SignalR Service access token and service endpoint URL
* One or more functions that send messages or manage group membership

### negotiate function

A client application requires a valid access token to connect to Azure SignalR Service. An access token can be anonymous or authenticated to a given user ID. Serverless SignalR Service applications require an HTTP endpoint named "negotiate" to obtain a token and other connection information, such as the SignalR Service endpoint URL.

Use an HTTP triggered Azure Function and the *SignalRConnectionInfo* input binding to generate the connection information object. The function must have an HTTP route that ends in `/negotiate`.

For more information on how to create the negotiate function, see the [*SignalRConnectionInfo* input binding reference](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md#input).

To learn about how to create an authenticated token, refer to [Using App Service Authentication](#using-app-service-authentication).

### Sending messages and managing group membership

Use the *SignalR* output binding to send messages to clients connected to Azure SignalR Service. You can broadcast messages to all clients, or you can send them to a subset of clients that are authenticated with a specific user ID or have been added to a specific group.

Users can be added to one or more groups. You can also use the *SignalR* output binding to add or remove users to/from groups.

For more information, see the [*SignalR* output binding reference](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md#output).

### SignalR Hubs

SignalR has a concept of "hubs". Each client connection and each message sent from Azure Functions is scoped to a specific hub. You can use hubs as a way to separate your connections and messages into logical namespaces.

## Client development

SignalR client applications can leverage the SignalR client SDK in one of several languages to easily connect to and receive messages from Azure SignalR Service.

### Configuring a client connection

To connect to SignalR Service, a client must complete a successful connection negotiation that consists of these steps:

1. Make a request to the *negotiate* HTTP endpoint discussed above to obtain valid connection information
1. Connect to SignalR Service using the service endpoint URL and access token obtained from the *negotiate* endpoint

SignalR client SDKs already contain the logic required to perform the negotiation handshake. Pass the negotiate endpoint's URL, minus the `negotiate` segment, to the SDK's `HubConnectionBuilder`. Here is an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl('https://my-signalr-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api')
  .build()
```

By convention, the SDK automatically appends `/negotiate` to the URL and uses it to begin the negotiation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK in a browser, you need to [enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](#enabling-cors) on your Function App.

For more information on how to use the SignalR client SDK, refer to the documentation for your language:

* [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client)
* [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/javascript-client)
* [Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/java-client)

### Sending messages from a client to the service

Although the SignalR SDK allows client applications to invoke backend logic in a SignalR hub, this functionality is not yet supported when you use SignalR Service with Azure Functions. Use HTTP requests to invoke Azure Functions.

## Azure Functions configuration

Azure Function apps that integrate with Azure SignalR Service can be deployed like any typical Azure Function app, using techniques such as [continuously deployment](../azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment.md), [zip deployment](../azure-functions/deployment-zip-push.md), and [run from package](../azure-functions/run-functions-from-deployment-package.md).

However, there are a couple of special considerations for apps that use the SignalR Service bindings. If the client runs in a browser, CORS must be enabled. And if the app requires authentication, you can integrate the negotiate endpoint with App Service Authentication.

### Enabling CORS

The JavaScript/TypeScript client makes HTTP requests to the negotiate function to initiate the connection negotiation. When the client application is hosted on a different domain than the Azure Function app, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) must be enabled on the Function app or the browser will block the requests.

#### Localhost

When running the Function app on your local computer, you can add a `Host` section to *local.settings.json* to enable CORS. In the `Host` section, add two properties:

* `CORS` - enter the base URL that is the origin the client application
* `CORSCredentials` - set it to `true` to allow "withCredentials" requests

Example:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    // values
  },
  "Host": {
    "CORS": "http://localhost:8080",
    "CORSCredentials": true
  }
}
```

#### Cloud - Azure Functions CORS

To enable CORS on an Azure Function app, go to the CORS configuration screen under the *Platform features* tab of your Function app in the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> CORS configuration is not yet available in Azure Functions Linux Consumption plan. Use [Azure API Management](#cloud---azure-api-management) to enable CORS.

CORS with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials must be enabled for the SignalR client to call the negotiate function. Select the checkbox to enable it.

In the *Allowed origins* section, add an entry with the origin base URL of your web application.

![Configuring CORS](media/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config/cors-settings.png)

#### Cloud - Azure API Management

Azure API Management provides an API gateway that adds capabilities to existing back-end services. You can use it to add CORS to your function app. It offers a consumption tier with pay-per-action pricing and a monthly free grant.

Refer to the API Management documentation for information on how to [import an Azure Function app](../api-management/import-function-app-as-api.md). Once imported, you can add an inbound policy to enable CORS with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials support.

```xml
<cors allow-credentials="true">
  <allowed-origins>
    <origin>https://azure-samples.github.io</origin>
  </allowed-origins>
  <allowed-methods>
    <method>GET</method>
    <method>POST</method>
  </allowed-methods>
  <allowed-headers>
    <header>*</header>
  </allowed-headers>
  <expose-headers>
    <header>*</header>
  </expose-headers>
</cors>
```

Configure your SignalR clients to use the API Management URL.

### Using App Service Authentication

Azure Functions has built-in authentication, supporting popular providers such as Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft Account, Google, and Azure Active Directory. This feature can be integrated with the *SignalRConnectionInfo* binding to create connections to Azure SignalR Service that have been authenticated to a user ID. Your application can send messages using the *SignalR* output binding that are targeted to that user ID.

In the Azure portal, in your Function app's *Platform features* tab, open the *Authentication/authorization* settings window. Follow the documentation for [App Service Authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization.md) to configure authentication using an identity provider of your choice.

Once configured, authenticated HTTP requests will include `x-ms-client-principal-name` and `x-ms-client-principal-id` headers containing the authenticated identity's username and user ID, respectively.

You can use these headers in your *SignalRConnectionInfo* binding configuration to create authenticated connections. Here is an example C# negotiate function that uses the `x-ms-client-principal-id` header.

```csharp
[FunctionName("negotiate")]
public static SignalRConnectionInfo Negotiate(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)]HttpRequest req,
    [SignalRConnectionInfo
        (HubName = "chat", UserId = "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}")]
        SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo)
{
    // connectionInfo contains an access key token with a name identifier claim set to the authenticated user
    return connectionInfo;
}
```

You can then send messages to that user by setting the `UserId` property of a SignalR message.

```csharp
[FunctionName("SendMessage")]
public static Task SendMessage(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post")]object message,
    [SignalR(HubName = "chat")]IAsyncCollector<SignalRMessage> signalRMessages)
{
    return signalRMessages.AddAsync(
        new SignalRMessage
        {
            // the message will only be sent to these user IDs
            UserId = "userId1",
            Target = "newMessage",
            Arguments = new [] { message }
        });
}
```
