# Troubleshoot the Connected Machine agent connection issues

This article provides information on troubleshooting and resolving issues that may occur while attempting to configure the Azure Arc for servers (preview) Connected Machine agent for Windows or Linux. Both the interactive and at-scale installation methods when configuring connection to the service are included. For general information, see [Arc for servers overview](./overview.md).

## Agent verbose log

Before following the troubleshooting steps described later in this article, the minimum information you need is the verbose log. It contains the output of the **azcmagent** tool commands, when the verbose (-v) argument is used. The log files are written to `%ProgramData%\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\Log\azcmagent.log` for Windows, and Linux to `/var/opt/azcmagent/log/azcmagent.log`.

### Windows

The following is an example of the command to enable verbose logging with the Connected Machine agent for Windows when performing an interactive installation.

```
& "$env:ProgramFiles\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\azcmagent.exe" connect --resource-group "resourceGroupName" --tenant-id "tenantID" --location "regionName" --subscription-id "subscriptionID" --verbose
```

The following is an example of the command to enable verbose logging with the Connected Machine agent for Windows when performing an at-scale installation using a service principal.

```
& "$env:ProgramFiles\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\azcmagent.exe" connect `
  --service-principal-id "{serviceprincipalAppID}" `
  --service-principal-secret "{serviceprincipalPassword}" `
  --resource-group "{ResourceGroupName}" `
  --tenant-id "{tenantID}" `
  --location "{resourceLocation}" `
  --subscription-id "{subscriptionID}"
  --verbose
```

### Linux

The following is an example of the command to enable verbose logging with the Connected Machine agent for Linux when performing an interactive installation.

>[!NOTE]
>You must have *root* access permissions on Linux machines to run **azcmagent**.

```
azcmagent connect --resource-group "resourceGroupName" --tenant-id "tenantID" --location "regionName" --subscription-id "subscriptionID" --verbose
```

The following is an example of the command to enable verbose logging with the Connected Machine agent for Linux when performing an at-scale installation using a service principal.

```
azcmagent connect \
  --service-principal-id "{serviceprincipalAppID}" \
  --service-principal-secret "{serviceprincipalPassword}" \
  --resource-group "{ResourceGroupName}" \
  --tenant-id "{tenantID}" \
  --location "{resourceLocation}" \
  --subscription-id "{subscriptionID}"
  --verbose
```

<a name="footnote1"></a><sup>1</sup>If this GPO is enabled and applies to machines with the Connected Machine agent, it deletes the user profile associated with the built-in account specified for the *himds* service. As a result, it also deletes the authentication certificate used to communicate with the service that is cached in the local certificate store for 30 days. Before the 30 day limit, an attempt is made to renew the certificate. To resolve this issue, follow the steps to [unregister the machine](manage-agent.md#unregister-machine) and then re-register it with the service running `azcmagent connect`.
