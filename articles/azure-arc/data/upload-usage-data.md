# Upload usage data to Azure Monitor

Periodically, you can export out usage information. The export and upload of this information creates and updates the data controller, SQL managed instance, and PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group resources in Azure.

> [!NOTE] 
> During the preview period, there is no cost for using Azure Arc enabled data services.

[!INCLUDE [azure-arc-data-preview](../../../includes/azure-arc-data-preview.md)]


> [!NOTE]
> Wait at least 24 hours after creating the Azure Arc data controller before uploading usage data.

## Create service principal and assign roles

Before you proceed, make sure you have created the required service principal and assigned it to an appropriate role. For details, see:
* [Create service principal](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md#create-service-principal).
* [Assign roles to the service principal](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md#assign-roles-to-the-service-principal)

## Upload usage data

Usage information such as inventory and resource usage can be uploaded to Azure in the following two-step way:

1. Log in to the data controller. Enter the values at the prompt. 

   ```console
   azdata login
   ```

1. Export the usage data using `azdata arc dc export` command, as follows:

   ```console
   azdata arc dc export --type usage --path usage.json
   ```
 
   This command creates a `usage.json` file with all the Azure Arc enabled data resources such as SQL managed instances and PostgreSQL Hyperscale instances etc. that are created on the data controller.

2. Upload the usage data using ```azdata upload``` command

   ```console
   azdata arc dc upload --path usage.json
   ```

## Automating uploads (optional)

If you want to upload metrics and logs on a scheduled basis, you can create a script and run it on a timer every few minutes. Below is an example of automating the uploads using a Linux shell script.

In your favorite text/code editor, add the following script to the file and save as a script executable file such as `.sh` (Linux/Mac) or `.cmd`, `.bat`, or `.ps1`.

```console
azdata arc dc export --type metrics --path metrics.json --force
azdata arc dc upload --path metrics.json
```

Make the script file executable

```console
chmod +x myuploadscript.sh
```

Run the script every 20 minutes:

```console
watch -n 1200 ./myuploadscript.sh
```

You could also use a job scheduler like cron or Windows Task Scheduler or an orchestrator like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef.
