# View inventory of your instances in the Azure portal

After you have uploaded your [metrics, logs](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md), or [usage](view-billing-data-in-azure.md), you can view your instance as an Azure resource from the Azure portal. To do so navigate to the special URL [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and follow the screenshots below

1. Go to All services
1. Search for your type of database instances types
1. Add it to your favorites
1. Click on instance type from the left nav
1. View your instances in the same view as your other Azure SQL or Azure PostgreSQL Hyperscale resources (use filters to get a granular view)
