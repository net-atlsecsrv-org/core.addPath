# View inventory of your instances in the Azure portal

After you upload your [metrics, logs](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md), or [usage](view-billing-data-in-azure.md), you can view your instance as an Azure resource from the Azure portal. To view your resource in the Azure portal, go to the special URL [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and complete these steps:

1. Go to **All services**.
1. Search for your database instance type.
1. Add the type to your favorites.
1. In the left menu, select the instance type.
1. View your instances in the same view as your other Azure SQL or Azure PostgreSQL Hyperscale resources (use filters for a granular view).
