# Connect an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster (Preview)

This document covers the process of connecting any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes cluster such as AKS-engine on Azure, AKS-engine on Azure Stack Hub, GKE, EKS and VMware vSphere cluster to Azure Arc.

## Before you begin

Verify you have the following requirements ready:

* A Kubernetes cluster that is up and running. If you do not have an existing Kubernetes cluster, you can use one of the following guides to create a test cluster:
  * Create a Kubernetes cluster using [Kubernetes in Docker (kind)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
  * Create a Kubernetes cluster using Docker for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#kubernetes)
* You'll need a kubeconfig file to access the cluster and cluster-admin role on the cluster for deployment of Arc enabled Kubernetes agents.
* The user or service principal used with `az login` and `az connectedk8s connect` commands must have the 'Read' and 'Write' permissions on the 'Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedclusters' resource type. The "Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding" role has these permissions and can be used for role assignments on the user or service principal.
* Helm 3 is required for the onboarding the cluster using connectedk8s extension. [Install the latest release of Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install) to meet this requirement.
* Azure CLI version 2.3+ is required for installing the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes CLI extensions. [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) or update to the latest version to ensure that you have Azure CLI version 2.3+.
* Install the Arc enabled Kubernetes CLI extensions:
  
  Install the `connectedk8s` extension, which helps you connect Kubernetes clusters to Azure:
  
  ```console
  az extension add --name connectedk8s
  ```
  
  Install the `k8sconfiguration` extension:
  
  ```console
  az extension add --name k8sconfiguration
  ```
  
  If you want to update these extensions later, run the following commands:
  
  ```console
  az extension update --name connectedk8s
  az extension update --name k8sconfiguration
  ```

## Supported regions

* East US
* West Europe

## Network requirements

Azure Arc agents require the following protocols/ports/outbound URLs to function.

* TCP on port 443 --> `https://:443`
* TCP on port 9418 --> `git://:9418`

| Endpoint (DNS)                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                 |

## Register the two providers for Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes:

```console
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```

Registration is an asynchronous process. Registration may take approximately 10 minutes. You can monitor the registration process with the following commands:

```console
az provider show -n Microsoft.Kubernetes -o table
```

```console
az provider show -n Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration -o table
```

## Create a resource group

Use a resource group to store metadata for your cluster.

First, create a resource group to hold the connected cluster resource.

```console
az group create --name AzureArcTest -l EastUS -o table
```

**Output:**

```console
Location    Name
----------  ------------
eastus      AzureArcTest
```

## Connect a cluster

Next, we will connect our Kubernetes cluster to Azure. The workflow for `az connectedk8s connect` is as follows:

1. Verify connectivity to your Kubernetes cluster: via `KUBECONFIG`, `~/.kube/config`, or `--kube-config`
1. Deploy Azure Arc Agents for Kubernetes using Helm 3, into the `azure-arc` namespace

```console
az connectedk8s connect --name AzureArcTest1 --resource-group AzureArcTest
```

**Output:**

```console
Command group 'connectedk8s' is in preview. It may be changed/removed in a future release.
Helm release deployment succeeded

{
  "aadProfile": {
    "clientAppId": "",
    "serverAppId": "",
    "tenantId": ""
  },
  "agentPublicKeyCertificate": "...",
  "agentVersion": "0.1.0",
  "id": "/subscriptions/57ac26cf-a9f0-4908-b300-9a4e9a0fb205/resourceGroups/AzureArcTest/providers/Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/AzureArcTest1",
  "identity": {
    "principalId": null,
    "tenantId": null,
    "type": "None"
  },
  "kubernetesVersion": "v1.15.0",
  "location": "eastus",
  "name": "AzureArcTest1",
  "resourceGroup": "AzureArcTest",
  "tags": {},
  "totalNodeCount": 1,
  "type": "Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters"
}
```

## Verify connected cluster

List your connected clusters:

```console
az connectedk8s list -g AzureArcTest -o table
```

**Output:**

```console
Command group 'connectedk8s' is in preview. It may be changed/removed in a future release.
Name           Location    ResourceGroup
-------------  ----------  ---------------
AzureArcTest1  eastus      AzureArcTest
```

You can also view this resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Once you have the portal open in your browser, navigate to the resource group and the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resource based on the resource name and resource group name inputs used earlier in the `az connectedk8s connect` command.

> [!NOTE]
> After onboarding the cluster, it takes around 5 to 10 minutes for the cluster metadata (cluster version, agent version, number of nodes) to surface on the overview page of the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resource in Azure portal.

## Connect using an outbound proxy server

If your cluster is behind an outbound proxy server, Azure CLI and the Arc enabled Kubernetes agents need to route their requests via the outbound proxy server. The following configuration enables that:

1. Check the version of `connectedk8s` extension installed on your machine by running this command:

    ```console
    az -v
    ```

    You need `connectedk8s` extension version >= 0.2.5 to set up agents with outbound proxy. If you have version < 0.2.3 on your machine, follow the [update steps](#before-you-begin) to get the latest version of extension on your machine.

2. Set the environment variables needed for Azure CLI to use the outbound proxy server:

    * If you are using bash, run the following command with appropriate values:

        ```bash
        export HTTP_PROXY=<proxy-server-ip-address>:<port>
        export HTTPS_PROXY=<proxy-server-ip-address>:<port>
        export NO_PROXY=<cluster-apiserver-ip-address>:<port>
        ```

    * If you are using PowerShell, run the following command with appropriate values:

        ```powershell
        $Env:HTTP_PROXY = "<proxy-server-ip-address>:<port>"
        $Env:HTTPS_PROXY = "<proxy-server-ip-address>:<port>"
        $Env:NO_PROXY = "<cluster-apiserver-ip-address>:<port>"
        ```

3. Run the connect command with proxy parameters specified:

    ```console
    az connectedk8s connect -n <cluster-name> -g <resource-group> --proxy-https https://<proxy-server-ip-address>:<port> --proxy-http http://<proxy-server-ip-address>:<port> --proxy-skip-range <excludedIP>,<excludedCIDR> --proxy-cert <path-to-cert-file>
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Specifying excludedCIDR under --proxy-skip-range is important to ensure in-cluster communication is not broken for the agents.
> 2. While --proxy-http, --proxy-https and --proxy-skip-range are expected for most outbound proxy environments, --proxy-cert is only required if there are trusted certificates from proxy that need to be injected into trusted certificate store of agent pods.
> 3. The above proxy specification is currently applied only for Arc agents and not for the flux pods used in sourceControlConfiguration. The Arc enabled Kubernetes team is actively working on this feature and it will be available soon.

## Azure Arc agents for Kubernetes

Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes deploys a few operators into the `azure-arc` namespace. You can view these deployments and pods here:

```console
kubectl -n azure-arc get deployments,pods
```

**Output:**

```console

```

Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes consists of a few agents (operators) that run in your cluster deployed to the `azure-arc` namespace.

* `deployment.apps/config-agent`: watches the connected cluster for source control configuration resources applied on the cluster and updates compliance state
* `deployment.apps/controller-manager`: is an operator of operators and orchestrates interactions between Azure Arc components
* `deployment.apps/metrics-agent`: collects metrics of other Arc agents to ensure that these agents are exhibiting optimal performance
* `deployment.apps/cluster-metadata-operator`: gathers cluster metadata - cluster version, node count, and Azure Arc agent version
* `deployment.apps/resource-sync-agent`: syncs the above mentioned cluster metadata to Azure
* `deployment.apps/clusteridentityoperator`: Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes currently supports system assigned identity. clusteridentityoperator maintains the managed service identity (MSI) certificate used by other agents for communication with Azure.
* `deployment.apps/flux-logs-agent`: collects logs from the flux operators deployed as a part of source control configuration

## Delete a connected cluster

You can delete a `Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedcluster` resource using the Azure CLI or Azure portal.


* **Deletion using Azure CLI**: The following Azure CLI command can be used to initiate deletion of the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resource.
  ```console
  az connectedk8s delete --name AzureArcTest1 --resource-group AzureArcTest
  ```
  This command removes the `Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedCluster` resource and any associated `sourcecontrolconfiguration` resources in Azure. The Azure CLI uses helm uninstall to remove the agents running on the cluster as well.

* **Deletion on Azure portal**: Deletion of the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resource on Azure portal deletes the `Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedcluster` resource and any associated `sourcecontrolconfiguration` resources in Azure, but it doesn't delete the agents running on the cluster. To delete the agents running on the cluster, run the following command.

  ```console
  az connectedk8s delete --name AzureArcTest1 --resource-group AzureArcTest
  ```
