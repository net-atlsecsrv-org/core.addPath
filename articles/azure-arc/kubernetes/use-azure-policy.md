# Use Azure Policy to apply cluster configurations at scale (Preview)

## Overview

Use Azure Policy to enforce that each `Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedclusters` resource or Git-Ops enabled `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters` resource has specific `Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/sourceControlConfigurations` applied on it. To use Azure Policy you select an existing policy definition and create a policy assignment. When creating the policy assignment you set the scope for the assignment: this will be an Azure resource group or subscription. You also set the parameters for the `sourceControlConfiguration` that will be created. Once the assignment is created the Policy engine will identify all `connectedCluster` or `managedCluster` resources that are located within the scope and will apply the `sourceControlConfiguration` to each one.

If you are using multiple Git repos as the sources of truth for each cluster (for instance, one repo for central IT/cluster operator and other repos for application teams), you can enable this by using multiple policy assignments, each policy assignment configured to use a different Git repo.

## Prerequisite

Ensure that you have `Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write` permissions on the scope (subscription or resource group) where you want to create this policy assignment.

## Create a policy assignment

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to Policy, and in the **Authoring** section of the sidebar, select **Definitions**.
2. Choose the "Deploy GitOps to Kubernetes cluster" built-in policy in the "Kubernetes" category, and click on **Assign**.
3. Set the **Scope** to the management group, subscription, or resource group where the policy assignment will apply.
4. If you want to exclude any resources from the policy scope, then set **Exclusions**.
5. Give the policy assignment a **Name** and **Description** that you can use to identify it easily.
6. Ensure that **Policy enforcement** is set to *Enabled*.
7. Select **Next**.
8. Set parameter values that will be used during the creation of the `sourceControlConfiguration`.
9. Select **Next**.
10. Enable **Create a remediation task**.
11. Assure that **Create a managed identity** is checked, and that the identity will have **Contributor** permissions. See [this doc](../../governance/policy/assign-policy-portal.md) and [the comment in this doc](../../governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources.md) for more information on the permissions you need.
12. Select **Review + create**.

After the policy assignment is created, for any new `connectedCluster` resource (or `managedCluster` resource with the GitOps agents installed) that is located within the scope of the assignment, the `sourceControlConfiguration` will be applied. For existing clusters, you will need to manually run a remediation task. It typically takes from 10-20 minutes for the policy assignment to take effect.

## Verify a policy assignment

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to one of your `connectedCluster` resources, and in the **Settings** section of the sidebar, select **Policies**. (The UX for AKS cluster is not implemented yet, but is coming.)
2. In the list, you should see the policy assignment that you created above, and the **Compliance state** should be *Compliant*.
3. In the **Settings** section of the sidebar, select **Configurations**.
4. In the list, you should see the `sourceControlConfiguration` that the policy assignment created.
5. Use **kubectl** to interrogate the cluster: you should see the namespace and artifacts that were created by the `sourceControlConfiguration`.
6. Within 5 minutes, you should see in the cluster the artifacts that are described in the manifests in the configured Git repo.
