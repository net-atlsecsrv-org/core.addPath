# Install and use the Azure Terraform Visual Studio Code extension

The Microsoft Azure Terraform Visual Studio Code extension is designed to increase developer productivity while authoring, testing, and using Terraform with Azure. The extension provides Terraform command support, resource graph visualization, and CloudShell integration within Visual Studio Code.

In this article, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * use Terraform to automate and simplify the provisioning of Azure services.
> * install and use the Microsoft Terraform Visual Studio Code extension for Azure services.
> * use Visual Studio Code to write, plan, and execute Terraform plans.

## Prerequisites
- **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

- **Terraform**: [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure).

- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) that is appropriate for your environment.

## Prepare your dev environment

### Install Git

To complete the exercises in the article, you need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/).

You can now run all supported Terraform commands in your Cloud Shell environment from within Visual Studio Code.

## Exercise 1: Basic Terraform commands walk-through

In this exercise, you create and execute a basic Terraform configuration file that provisions a new Azure resource group.

### Prepare a test plan file

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **File > New File** from the menu bar.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Terraform azurerm_resource_group page](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/resource_group.html#) and copy the code in the **Example Usage** code block:

    ![Example Usage](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-azurerm-resource-group-example-usage.png)

1. Paste the copied code into the new file you created in Visual Studio Code.

    ![Paste Example Usage code](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-paste-example-usage-code.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >You may change the **name** value of the resource group, but it must be unique to your Azure subscription.

1. From the menu bar, select **File > Save As**.

1. In the **Save As** dialog, navigate to a location of your choice and then select **New folder**. (Change the name of the new folder to something more descriptive than *New folder*.)

    >[!NOTE]
    >In this example, the folder is named TERRAFORM-TEST-PLAN.

1. Make sure your new folder is highlighted (selected) and then select **Open**.

1. In the **Save As** dialog, change the default name of the file to *main.tf*.

    ![Save as main.tf](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-save-as-main.png)

1. Select **Save**.
1. In the menu bar, select **File > Open Folder**. Navigate to and select the new folder you created.

### Run Terraform *init* command

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.

1. From the Visual Studio Code menu bar, select **File > Open Folder...** and locate and select your *main.tf* file.

    ![main.tf file](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-main-tf.png)

1. From the menu bar, select **View > Command Palette... > Azure Terraform: Init**.

1. When the confirmation appears, select **OK**.

    ![Do you want to open Cloud Shell?](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-do-you-want-to-open-cloud-shell.png)

1. The first time you launch Cloud Shell from a new folder, you will be asked to set up the web application. Select **Open**.

    ![First launch of Cloud Shell](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-first-launch-of-cloud-shell.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >In this example, Bash (Linux) was selected.

1. If you have not already set up an Azure storage account, the following screen appears. Select **Create storage**.

    ![You have no storage mounted](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-you-have-no-storage-mounted.png)

1. Azure Cloud Shell launches in the shell you previously selected and displays information for the cloud drive it just created for you.

    ![Your cloud drive has been created](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-your-cloud-drive-has-been-created-in.png)

1. You may now exit the Cloud Shell

1. From the menu bar, select **View** > **Command Palette** > **Azure Terraform: init**.

    ![Terraform has been successfully initialized](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-has-been-successfully-initialized.png)

### Visualize the plan

Earlier in this tutorial, you installed GraphViz. Terraform can use GraphViz to generate a visual representation of either a configuration or execution plan. The Azure Terraform Visual Studio Code extension implements this feature via the *visualize* command.

- From the menu bar, select **View > Command Palette > Azure Terraform: Visualize**.

    ![Visualize the plan](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-graph.png)

### Run Terraform *plan* command

The Terraform *plan* command is used to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes will do what you intended.

>[!NOTE]
>Terraform *plan* does not make any changes to your real Azure resources. To actually make the changes contained in your plan, we use the Terraform *apply* command.

- From the menu bar, select **View** > **Command Palette** > **Azure Terraform: plan**.

    ![Terraform plan](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-plan.png)

### Run Terraform *apply* command

After being satisfied with the results of Terraform *plan*, you can run the *apply* command.

1. From the menu bar, select **View** > **Command Palette** > **Azure Terraform: apply**.

    ![Terraform apply](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-apply.png)

1. Enter `yes`.

    ![Terraform apply yes](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-apply-yes.png)

### Verify your Terraform plan was executed

To see if your new Azure resource group was successfully created:

1. Open the Azure portal.

1. Select **Resource groups** in the left navigation pane.

    ![Verify your new resource](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-verify-resource-group-created.png)

Your new resource group should be listed in the **NAME** column.

>[!NOTE]
>You may leave your Azure Portal window open for now; we will be using it in the next step.

### Run Terraform *destroy* command

1. From the menu bar, select **View** > **Command Palette** > **Azure Terraform: destroy**.

    ![Terraform destroy](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-destroy.png)

1. Enter *yes*.

    ![Terraform destroy yes](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-destroy-yes.png)

### Verify your resource group was destroyed

To confirm that Terraform successfully destroyed your new resource group:

1. Select **Refresh** on the Azure portal **Resource groups** page.

1. Your resource group will no longer be listed.

    ![Verify resource group was destroyed](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-refresh-resource-groups-button.png)

## Exercise 2: Terraform *compute* module

In this exercise, you learn how to load the Terraform *compute* module into the Visual Studio Code environment.

### Clone the terraform-azurerm-compute module

1. Use [this link](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-compute) to access the Terraform Azure Rm Compute module on GitHub.

1. Select **Clone or download**.

    ![Clone or download](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-clone-with-https.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >In this example, our folder was named *terraform-azurerm-compute*.

### Open the folder in Visual Studio Code

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.

1. From the menu bar, select **File > Open Folder** and navigate to and select the folder you created in the previous step.

    ![terraform-azurerm-compute folder](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-azurerm-compute-folder.png)

### Initialize Terraform

Before you can begin using the Terraform commands from within Visual Studio Code, you download the plug-ins for two Azure providers: random and azurerm.

1. In the Terminal pane of the Visual Studio Code IDE, enter `terraform init`.

    ![terraform init command](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-terraform-init-command.png)

1. Enter `az login`, press **<Enter**, and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Module test: *lint*

1. From the menu bar, select **View > Command Palette > Azure Terraform: Execute Test**.

1. From the list of test-type options, select **lint**.

    ![Select type of test](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-select-type-of-test-lint.png)

1. When the confirmation appears, select **OK**, and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ![DO you want to open CloudShell?](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-do-you-want-to-open-cloudshell-small.png)

>[!NOTE]
>When you execute either the **lint** or **end to end** test, Azure uses a container service to provision a test machine to perform the actual test. For this reason, your test results may typically take several minutes to be returned.

After a few moments, you see a listing in the Terminal pane similar to this example:

![Lint test results](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-lint-test-results.png)

### Module test: *end-to-end*

1. From the menu bar, select **View > Command Palette > Azure Terraform: Execute Test**.

1. From the list of test type options, select **end to end**.

    ![Select type of test](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-select-type-of-test-end-to-end.png)

1. When the confirmation appears, select **OK**, and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ![DO you want to open CloudShell?](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-do-you-want-to-open-cloudshell-small.png)

>[!NOTE]
>When you execute either the **lint** or **end to end** test, Azure uses a container service to provision a test machine to perform the actual test. For this reason, your test results may typically take several minutes to be returned.

After a few moments, you see a listing in the Terminal pane similar to this example:

![End-to-end test results](media/terraform-vscode-extension/tf-end-to-end-test-results.png)
