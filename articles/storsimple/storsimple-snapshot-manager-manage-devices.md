## Add or replace a device
Use the following procedure to add or replace a StorSimple device.

#### To add or replace a device
1. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
2. In the **Scope** pane, right-click the **Devices** node, and then click **Configure a device**. The **Configure a Device** dialog box appears.
   
    ![Configure a StorSimple device](./media/storsimple-snapshot-manager-manage-devices/HCS_SSM_config_device.png) 
3. In the **Device** drop-down box, select the IP address of the device or virtual device. 
4. In the **Password** text box, type the StorSimple Snapshot Manager password that you created for the device in the Azure classic portal. Click **OK**. StorSimple Snapshot Manager searches for the device that you identified. 
   
   * If the device is available, StorSimple Snapshot Manager adds a connection.
   * If the device is unavailable for any reason, StorSimple Snapshot Manager returns an error message. Click **OK** to close the error message, and then click **Cancel** to close the **Configure a Device** dialog box.

## Connect a device and verify imports
Use the following procedure to connect a StorSimple device and verify that any existing volume groups that have associated backups are imported.

#### To connect a device and verify imports
1. To connect a device to StorSimple Snapshot Manager, follow the instructions in Add or replace a device. When it connects to a device, StorSimple Snapshot Manager responds as follows:
   
   * If the device is unavailable for any reason, StorSimple Snapshot Manager returns an error message. 
   
   * If the device is available, StorSimple Snapshot Manager adds a connection. When you select the device, it appears in the **Results** pane, and the status field indicates that the device is **Available**. StorSimple Snapshot Manager imports any volume groups configured for the device, provided that the volume groups have associated backups. Backup policies are not imported. Volume groups that do not have associated backups are not imported.
2. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
3. Right-click the top node in the **Scope** pane, and then click **Toggle Imports Display**.
   
    ![Select Toggle Imports Display](./media/storsimple-snapshot-manager-manage-devices/HCS_SSM_Toggle_Imports_Display.png) 
4. The **Toggle Imports Display** dialog box appears, showing the status of the imported volume groups and backups. Click **OK**.

After the volume groups and backups are successfully imported, you can use StorSimple Snapshot Manager to manage them, just as you would manage volume groups and backups that you created and configured with StorSimple Snapshot Manager. 

## Refresh connected devices
Use the following procedure to synchronize the connected StorSimple devices with StorSimple Snapshot Manager.

#### To refresh connected devices
1. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
2. In the **Scope** pane, right-click **Devices**, and then click **Refresh Devices**. This synchronizes the connected devices with StorSimple Snapshot Manager so that you can view the volume groups and backups, including any recent additions. 
   
    ![Refresh the StorSimple devices](./media/storsimple-snapshot-manager-manage-devices/HCS_SSM_Refresh_devices.png)

The **Refresh Devices** action retrieves any new volume groups and any associated backups from connected devices. Unlike the **Rescan volumes** action available for the **Volumes** node, **Refresh Devices** does not restore the backup registry.

## Authenticate a device
Use the following procedure to authenticate a StorSimple device with StorSimple Snapshot Manager.

#### To authenticate a device
1. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
2. In the **Scope** pane, click **Devices**.
3. In the **Results** pane, right-click the name of the device, and then click **Authenticate**.
4. The **Authenticate** dialog box appears. Type the device password, and then click **OK**.
   
    ![Authenticate dialog box](./media/storsimple-snapshot-manager-manage-devices/HCS_SSM_Authenticate.png) 

## View device details
Use the following procedure to view the details of a StorSimple device and, if necessary, resynchronize the device with StorSimple Snapshot Manager.

#### To view and resynchronize device details
1. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
2. In the **Scope** pane, click **Devices**.
3. In the **Results** pane, right-click the name of the device, and then click **Details**.

4.The **Device Details** dialog box appears. This box shows the name, model, version, serial number, status, target iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN), and last synchronization date and time.

## Change an expired device password
You must enter a password to authenticate a StorSimple device with StorSimple Snapshot Manager. You configure this password when you use the Windows PowerShell interface to set up the device. However, the password can expire. If this happens, you can use the Azure classic portal to change the password. Then, because the device was configured in StorSimple Snapshot Manager before the password expired, you must re-authenticate the device in StorSimple Snapshot Manager.

#### To change the expired password
1. In the Azure classic portal, start the StorSimple Manager service.
2. Click **Devices** > **Configure** for the device.
3. Scroll down to the StorSimple Snapshot Manager section. Enter a password that is 14-15 characters. Make sure that the password contains a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
4. Re-enter the password to confirm it.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

#### To re-authenticate the device
1. Start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
2. In the **Scope** pane, click **Devices**. A list of configured devices appears in the **Results** pane.
3. Select the device, right-click, and then click **Authenticate**.
4. In the **Authenticate** window, enter the new password.
5. Select the device, right-click, and select **Refresh device**. This synchronizes the device with StorSimple Snapshot Manager.

## Replace a failed device
If a StorSimple device fails and is replaced by a standby (failover) device, use the following steps to connect to the new device and view the associated backups.

#### To connect to a new device after failover
1. Reconfigure the iSCSI connection to the new device. For instructions, go to "Step 7: Mount, initialize, and format a volume" in [Deploy your on-premises StorSimple device](storsimple-8000-deployment-walkthrough-u2.md).
