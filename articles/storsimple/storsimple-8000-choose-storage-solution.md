[!INCLUDE [storsimple-8000-eol-banner](../../includes/storsimple-8000-eol-banner.md)]
 
This document provides an overview of options for on-premises data transfer to Azure, comparing: Data Box Edge vs. Azure File Sync vs. StorSimple 8000 series.

- **[Data Box Edge](/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-overview)** – Data Box Edge is an on-premises network device that moves data into and out of Azure and has AI-enabled Edge compute to pre-process data during upload. Data Box Gateway is a virtual version of the device with the same data transfer capabilities.
- **[Azure File Sync](/azure/storage/files/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide)** – Azure File Sync can be used to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. General availability of Azure File Sync was announced earlier in 2018.
- **[StorSimple](/azure/storsimple/storsimple-overview)** – StorSimple is a hybrid device that helps enterprises consolidate their storage infrastructure for primary storage, data protection, archiving, and disaster recovery on a single solution by tightly integrating with Azure storage. The product lifecycle for StorSimple can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search?alpha=Azure%20StorSimple%208000%20Series).
