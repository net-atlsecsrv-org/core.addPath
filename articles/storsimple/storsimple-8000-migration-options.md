# Options to migrate data from StorSimple 5000-7000 series 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On July 9, 2019 the StorSimple 5000/7000 series will reach end of support (EOS) status. We recommend that StorSimple 5000/7000 series customers migrate to one of the alternatives described in the document.

StorSimple 5000-7000 series is reaching [end of Support](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search?alpha=StorSimple%205000%2F7000%20Series) in July 2019. The customers who are running StorSimple 5000-7000 series have an option to upgrade to other Azure first party hybrid services. This article describes the Azure hybrid options available to migrate data. 

## Migration options

The customers using StorSimple 5000-7000 series have Azure or third-party options.

### Azure options

#### Upgrade to StorSimple 8000 Series

Upgrade to StorSimple 8000 series and thus continue on the StorSimple platform.  This upgrade path requires customers to replace their 5000-7000 series devices with an 8000 series. The data is migrated from the 5000-7000 series device by using the migration tool. Once the migration is successfully complete, the StorSimple 8000 series devices will continue to tier data to Azure Blob Storage. 

For more information on how to migrate data using a StorSimple 8000 series, go to [Migrate data from StorSimple 5000-7000 series to 8000 series device](storsimple-8000-migrate-from-5000-7000.md).

#### Migrate to Azure File Sync

This brand new migration option enables customers to store their organization’s file shares in the Azure Files. These files shares are then centralized for on-premises access using Azure File Sync (AFS). AFS can be deployed on a Windows Server host. The actual data migration is then performed as a host copy or using the migration tool.

For more information on how to migrate data to Azure File Sync, go to [Migrate data from StorSimple 5000-7000 series to Azure File Sync](../storage/files/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000.md).

### Third-party options

#### Migrate to Panzura Freedom NAS

Panzura Freedom solution provides a NAS solution that spans datacenters, offices, public and private clouds. The solution enables local, hybrid, and in-cloud data workflows for NFS, SMB, and mobile clients.
