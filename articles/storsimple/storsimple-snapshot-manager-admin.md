# Use StorSimple Snapshot Manager to administer your StorSimple solution

## Overview
StorSimple Snapshot Manager is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that simplifies data protection and backup management in a Microsoft Azure StorSimple environment. With StorSimple Snapshot Manager, you can manage Microsoft Azure StorSimple data in the data center and in the cloud as a single integrated storage solution, thus simplifying backup processes and reducing costs.

The StorSimple Snapshot Manager central management console enables you to create consistent, point-in-time backup copies of local and cloud data. For example, you can use the console to:

* Configure, back up, and delete volumes.
* Configure volume groups to ensure that backed up data is application-consistent.
* Manage backup policies so that data is backed up on a predetermined schedule.
* Create independent copies of data, which can be stored in the cloud and used for disaster recovery.

This article provides links to tutorials that describe StorSimple Snapshot Manager and how to use it to complete system administration tasks and workflows.
