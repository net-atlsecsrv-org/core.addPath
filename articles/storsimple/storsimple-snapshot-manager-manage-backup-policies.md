# Use StorSimple Snapshot Manager to create and manage backup policies
## Overview
A backup policy creates a schedule for backing up volume data locally or in the cloud. When you create a backup policy, you can also specify a retention policy. (You can retain a maximum of 64 snapshots.) For more information about backup policies, see [Backup types](storsimple-what-is-snapshot-manager.md#backup-types-and-backup-policies) in [StorSimple 8000 series: a hybrid cloud solution](storsimple-overview.md).

This tutorial explains how to:

* Create a backup policy
* Edit a backup policy
* Delete a backup policy

## Create a backup policy
Use the following procedure to create a new backup policy.

#### To create a backup policy
1. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.
2. In the **Scope** pane, right-click **Backup Policies**, and click **Create Backup Policy**.

    The **Create a Policy** dialog box appears.

3. On the **General** tab, complete the following information:

   1. In the **Name** text box, type a name for the policy.
   2. In the **Volume group** text box, type the name of the volume group associated with the policy.
   3. Select either **Local Snapshot** or **Cloud Snapshot**.
   4. Select the number of snapshots to retain. If you select **All**, 64 snapshots will be retained (the maximum).
4. Click the **Schedule** tab.

5. On the **Schedule** tab, complete the following information:

   2. Under **Settings**, select **One time**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.
   3. In the **Start** text box, click the calendar icon and select a start date.
   4. Under **Advanced Settings**, you can set optional repeat schedules and an end date.
   5. Click **OK**.

After you create a backup policy, the following information appears in the **Results** pane:

* **Name** – the name of backup policy.
* **Type** – local snapshot or cloud snapshot.
* **Volume Group** – the volume group associated with the policy.
* **Retention** – the number of snapshots retained; the maximum is 64.
* **Created** – the date that this policy was created.
* **Enabled** – whether the policy is currently in effect: **True** indicates that it is in effect; **False** indicates that it is not in effect.
