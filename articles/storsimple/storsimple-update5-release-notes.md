# StorSimple 8000 Series Update 5 release notes

## Overview

The following release notes describe the new features and identify the critical open issues for StorSimple 8000 Series Update 5. They also contain a list of the StorSimple software updates included in this release.

Update 5 can be applied to any StorSimple device running Update 0.1 through Update 4. The device version associated with Update 5 is 6.3.9600.17845.

Review the information contained in the release notes before you deploy the update in your StorSimple solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Update 5 is a mandatory update and must be installed immediately. For more information, see how to [Apply Update 5](storsimple-8000-install-update-5.md).
> * Update 5 has device software, disk firmware, OS security, and other OS updates. It takes approximately 4 hours to install this update. Disk firmware update is a disruptive update and results in a downtime for your device. We recommend that you apply Update 5 to keep your device up-to-date.
> * For new releases, you may not see updates immediately because we do a phased rollout of the updates. Wait a few days, and then scan for updates again as these updates will become available soon.

## What's new in Update 5

The following key improvements and bug fixes have been made in Update 5.

* **Use of Azure Active Directory (AAD) to authenticate with StorSimple Device Manager service** â€“ From Update 5 onwards, Azure Active Directory is used to authenticate with the StorSimple Device Manager service. The old authentication mechanism will be deprecated by December 2017. All the users must include the new authentication URLs in their firewall rules. For more information, go to [authentication URLs listed in the networking requirements for your StorSimple device](storsimple-8000-system-requirements.md#url-patterns-for-azure-portal).

    If the authentication URL is not included in the firewall rules, the users will see a critical alert that their StorSimple device could not authenticate with the service. If the users see this alert, they need to include the new authentication URL. For more information, go to [StorSimple networking alerts](storsimple-8000-manage-alerts.md#networking-alerts).

* **New version of StorSimple Snapshot Manager** - A new version of StorSimple Snapshot Manager is released with Update 5 and is compatible with all the StorSimple devices that are running Update 4 or later. We recommend that you update to this version. The previous version of StorSimple Snapshot Manager is used for StorSimple devices that are running Update 3 or earlier. [Download the appropriate version of StorSimple Snapshot Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44220) and refer to [deploy StorSimple Snapshot Manager](storsimple-snapshot-manager-deployment.md).
