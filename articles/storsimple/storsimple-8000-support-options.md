<sup>5</sup> Customers using only StorSimple Virtual Arrays must purchase either StorSimple Standard or Premium support plans. Please contact your Microsoft account/sales team to purchase StorSimple support.

<sup>6</sup> 
To expedite hardware warranty claims, replacement parts are shipped to the customer before receiving defective parts. Customer is responsible for timely return shipment of defective parts. 

If your support contract has expired, be aware, depending on how long the support contract has been expired, it may take up to three weeks after the renewal processing has completed before a part is delivered as the local stocking location for your contract will not be stocked with replacement parts for your device until after your contract is processed.

## Local language support
In addition to English, local language support is provided in the following languages during business hours: Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Traditional Chinese.

## Support scope 
Support for billing and subscription management-related issues is available at all support levels. In order to receive StorSimple support, customer must be actively enrolled for either StorSimple Standard or Premium support plans. StorSimple support team will be responsible for resolving all issues that impact the StorSimple solution. In order to receive support for Azure-related issues that are not directly related to StorSimple, customer needs to be enrolled in an appropriate Azure support plan.

<sup>1 </sup> Microsoft may downgrade the severity level of a Severity A case if the customer is not able to provide adequate resources or responses to enable Microsoft to continue with problem resolution efforts.

<sup>2</sup> Expected response times are based on 24x7 support in English for Severity A and local business hours for Severity B and C, and local business hours support in the remaining local languages: Japanese, Taiwanese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean.

## Cancellation policy
In order to receive StorSimple support, customer must purchase Standard or Premium support plans for the duration of the subscription term. Cancellation does not result in a prorated refund. StorSimple support plans are reduction eligible at EA anniversary. However, Microsoft is unable to provide support to StorSimple customers without valid support contracts.

## Renewal policy


Upon the purchase of StorSimple 8000 Series Storage Arrays, support is provided through the next EA anniversary. Customer must renew StorSimple support at EA anniversary. StorSimple support plan orders are coterminous. Customers are notified via e-mail about impending support expiry for StorSimple 8000 Series Storage Arrays and are expected to follow up with the Microsoft account/sales teams or their Microsoft Licensing Solution Partner (LSP) to renew StorSimple support.


Standard Azure support does not cover StorSimple hardware support. If you are covered under Premier or Unified Microsoft support, you must still purchase Standard StorSimple support renewal. StorSimple support renewal can be aligned with EA anniversary date by acquiring the required support SKU with the license quantity equal to the number of the appliances and the unit quantity ordered being the remaining number of months of support needed until the EA anniversary date if all the units have the same support contract expiration date. If the units have different support contract expiration dates, each appliance must be covered with one support SKU with the unit quantity ordered being the remaining number of months of support needed until the EA anniversary date per each appliance. 

StorSimple 8000 Series Storage Arrays support is provided based on how the StorSimple array was purchased.
