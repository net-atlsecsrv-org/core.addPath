# Use the StorSimple Device Manager service to monitor hardware components and status

## Overview
This article describes the various physical and logical components in your on-premises StorSimple 8000 series device. It also explains how to monitor the device component status by using the **Status and hardware health** blade in the StorSimple Device Manager service.

The **Status and hardware health** blade shows the hardware status of all the StorSimple device components.

Under the list of components for 8100, there are three sections that describe:

* **Shared Components** – These are not part of the controllers, such as disk drives, enclosure, Power and Cooling Module (PCM) components and PCM temperature, line voltage, and line current sensors.
* **Controller 0 Components** – The components that reside on Controller 0, such as controller, SAS expander and connector, controller temperature sensors, and the various network interfaces.
* **Controller 1 Components** – The components that constitute Controller 1, similar to those detailed for Controller 0.

An 8600 device has additional components that correspond to the Extended Bunch of Disks (EBOD) enclosure. Under the list of components, there are five sections. Of these, there are three sections that contain the components in the primary enclosure and are identical to the ones described for 8100. There are two additional sections for the EBOD enclosure that describe:

* **EBOD Controller 0 Components** – The components that reside on EBOD enclosure 0, such as the EBOD controller, SAS expander and connector, and controller temperature sensors.
* **EBOD Controller 1 Components** – The components that constitute EBOD enclosure 1, similar to those detailed for EBOD enclosure 0.
* **EBOD enclosure Shared Components** – The components present in the EBOD enclosure and PCM that are not part of the EBOD controller.

> [!NOTE]
> **The hardware status is not available for a StorSimple Cloud Appliance (8010/8020).**


## Monitor the hardware status
Perform the following steps to view the hardware status of a device component:

1. Navigate to **Devices**, select a specific StorSimple device. Go to **Monitor > Hardware health**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Settings blade of the Device Manager service. Under Monitor, Hardware health is selected.](./media/storsimple-8000-monitor-hardware-status/hw-health1.png)

2. Locate the **Hardware components** section and choose from the available components. Simply click the component label to expand the list and view the status of the various device components. See the [detailed component list for the primary enclosure](#component-list-for-primary-enclosure-of-storsimple-device) and the [detailed component list for the EBOD enclosure](#component-list-for-ebod-enclosure-of-storsimple-device).

    ![Screenshot showing one component selected in the hardware components section. An adjacent blade shows the name and status of that component's parts.](./media/storsimple-8000-monitor-hardware-status/hw-health2.png)

3. Use the following color coding scheme to interpret the  component status:
   
   * **Green check** – Denotes a healthy component with **OK** status.
   * **Yellow** – Denotes a degraded component in **Warning** state.
   * **Red exclamation** – Denotes a failed component that has a **Failure** status.
   * **White with black text** – Denotes a component that is not present.
   
   The following screenshot shows a device that has components in **OK**, **Warning**, and **Failure** state.
       
   ![Screenshot showing three components in the hardware components section: one in an okay state, one in a failed state, and one in a warning state.](./media/storsimple-8000-monitor-hardware-status/hw-health3.png)

   Expanding the **Shared components list**, we can see that the NVRAM and the cluster are degraded.

   ![Screenshot showing the Shared Components item selected. In the adjacent blade, the N V R A M and the cluster are in a warning state.](./media/storsimple-8000-monitor-hardware-status/hw-health5.png)

   Expanding the **Controller 1 components** list, we can see that the cluster node has failed.  

   ![Screenshot showing the Controller 1 Components item selected. In the adjacent blade, the cluster node is in a failed state.](./media/storsimple-8000-monitor-hardware-status/hw-health4.png)  

4. If you encounter a component that is not in a **Healthy** state, contact Microsoft Support. If alerts are enabled on your device, you will receive an email alert. If you need to replace a failed hardware component, see [StorSimple hardware component replacement](storsimple-hardware-component-replacement.md).
