# Options to migrate data from StorSimple 8000 series

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On December 31, 2022 the StorSimple 8000 series will reach end of support (EOS) status. We recommend that StorSimple 8000 series customers migrate to one of the alternatives described in the document.

StorSimple 8000 series is reaching [end of Support](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search?alpha=Azure%20StorSimple%208000%20Series) in December 2022. The customers who are running StorSimple 8000 series have an option to upgrade to other Azure first party hybrid services. This article describes the Azure hybrid options available to migrate data.

## Migration options

The customers using StorSimple 8000 series have Azure or third-party options.

### Azure options

#### Migrate to Azure File Sync

This brand new migration option enables customers to store their organization's file shares in the Azure Files. These files shares are then centralized for on-premises access using Azure File Sync (AFS). AFS can be deployed on a Windows Server host. The actual data migration is then performed as a host copy or using the migration tool.

For more information on how to migrate data to Azure File Sync, go to [StorSimple 8100 and 8600 migration to Azure File Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000).

### Third-party options

#### Migrate to Panzura Freedom NAS

StorSimple 5000-7000 series and StorSimple 8000 series customers can choose to migrate to Panzura Freedom NAS to keep their data in Azure. The Panzura Freedom solution provides a NAS solution that spans datacenters, offices, public and private clouds. The solution enables local, hybrid, and in-cloud data workflows for NFS, SMB, and mobile clients.

This migration is supported by Panzura and customers can get started by requesting migration support from the [Panzura website](https://panzura.com/migrate-storsimple-panzura/).
