# What is StorSimple for Cloud Solutions Providers Program?


## Overview

Microsoft Azure StorSimple is a unique approach to enterprise storage with true hybrid cloud storage capabilities. It empowers the customers to take advantage of economical cloud storage for the inactive data, while keeping their mission-critical data on-premises for the highest levels of performance. 

StorSimple Virtual Array for Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP) enables partners to capitalize on this opportunity. The partners own the end-to-end customer lifecycle with direct provisioning, billing, and support of Microsoftâ€™s cloud services. In short, the partners can now transact the StorSimple along with their services to customers.
