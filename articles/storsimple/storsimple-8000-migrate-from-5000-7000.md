# Migrate data from StorSimple 5000-7000 series to 8000 series device

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - On July 31, 2019 the StorSimple 5000/7000 series will reach end of support (EOS) status. We recommend that StorSimple 5000/7000 series customers migrate to one of the alternatives described in the document.
> - Migration is currently an assisted operation. If you intend to migrate data from your StorSimple 5000-7000 series device to an 8000 series device, you need to schedule migration with Microsoft Support. Microsoft Support will then enable your subscription for migration. For more information, see how to [Open a Support ticket](storsimple-8000-contact-microsoft-support.md).
> - After you file the service request, it may take couple of weeks to execute the migration plan and actually start the migration.
> - Before you contact Microsoft Support, be sure to review and complete the [Migration prerequisites](#migration-prerequisites) indicated in the article.

## Overview

This article introduces the migration feature that allows the StorSimple 5000-7000 series customers to migrate their data to StorSimple 8000 series physical device or an 8010/8020 cloud appliance. This article also links to a downloadable step-by-step walkthrough of the steps required to migrate data from a 5000-7000 series legacy device to an 8000 series physical or cloud appliance.

This article is applicable for both the on-premises 8000 series device as well as the StorSimple Cloud Appliance.


## Migration feature versus host-side migration

You can move your data using the migration feature or by performing a host-side migration. This section describes the specifics of each method including the pros and cons. Use this information to figure out which method you want to pursue to migrate your data.

The migration feature simulates a disaster recovery (DR) process from 7000/5000 series to 8000 series. This feature allows you to migrate the data from 5000/7000 series format to 8000 series format on Azure. The migration process is initiated using the StorSimple Migration tool. The tool starts the download and the conversion of backup metadata on the 8000 series device and then uses the latest backup to expose the volumes on the device.

| Pros                                                                                                                                     |Cons                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The migration process preserves the history of backups that were taken on 5000/7000 series.                                               | When users try to access the data, this migration will download the data from Azure thus incurring data download costs.                                     |
| No data is migrated on the host side.                                                                                                     | The process needs downtime between the start of the backup and latest backup being surfaced on the 8000 series (can be estimated using the migration tool). |
| This process preserves all the policies, bandwidth templates, encryption, and other settings on 8000 series devices.                      | User access will bring back only the data accessed by the users and will not rehydrate the entire dataset.                                                  |
| This process requires additional time to convert all the older backups in Azure which is done asynchronously without impacting production | Migration can only be done at a cloud configuration level.  Individual volumes in a cloud configuration cannot be migrated separately                       |

A host-side migration allows setting up of 8000 series independently and copying the data from 5000/7000 series device to 8000 series device. This is equivalent to migrating data from one storage device to another. A variety of tools such as Diskboss, robocopy are used to copy the data.

| Pros                                                                                                                      |Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Migration can be approached in a phased manner on a volume-by-volume basis.                                               | Previous backups (taken on 5000/7000 series) will not be available on the 8000 series device.                                                                                                       |
| Allows for consolidation of data into one storage account on Azure.                                                       | First backup to the cloud on 8000 series will take a longer time as all the data on 8000 series needs to be backed up to Azure.                                                                     |
| Following a successful migration, all the data is local on the appliance. There are no latencies when accessing the data. | Azure storage consumption will increase until the data is deleted from the 5000/7000 device.                                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                                           | If the 7000/5000 series device has a large amount of data, during migration this data needs to be downloaded from azure which will incur costs and latencies related to downloading data from Azure |

This article focuses only on the migration feature from 5000/7000 to 8000 series device.

## Migration prerequisites

Here are the migration prerequisites for your legacy 5000 or 7000 series device and the 8000 series StorSimple device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review and complete the migration prerequisites before you file a service request with Microsoft Support.

### For the 5000/7000 series device (source)

Before you begin migration, ensure that:

* You have your 5000 or 7000 series source device; the device can be live or down.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > We recommend that you have serial access to this device throughout the migration process. Should there be any device issues, serial access can help with troubleshooting.

* Your 5000 or 7000 series source device is running software version v2.1.1.518 or later. Earlier versions are not supported.
* To verify the version that your 5000 or 7000 series is running, look at the top-right corner of your Web UI. This should display the software version that your device is running. For migration, your 5000 or 7000 series should be running v2.1.1.518.

    ![Check software version on legacy device](media/storsimple-8000-migrate-from-5000-7000/check-version-legacy-device1.png)

    * If your live device is not running v2.1.1.518 or later, please upgrade your system to the required minimal version. You may need to work with Microsoft Support to help you perform the upgrade.
    * If you are running v2.1.1.518, go to web UI to see if there are any notifications for registry restore failures. If registry restore had failed, run registry restore. You may need to work with Microsoft Support to help you restore your registry.
    * If you have a down device that was not running v2.1.1.518, perform a failover to a replacement device that is running v2.1.1.518. For detailed instructions, refer to DR of your 5000/7000 series StorSimple device.
    * Back up the data for your device by taking a cloud snapshot.
    * Check for any other active backup jobs that are running on the source device. This includes the jobs on the StorSimple Data Protection Console host. Wait for the current jobs to complete.
