# Export and view your top-level Subscription information
If you need to view the set of subscription IDs associated with your user credentials, [download a .json file with your subscription information from the Azure Account Center](https://account.azure.com/subscriptions/download).

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-dsr-and-stp-note](../../includes/gdpr-dsr-and-stp-note.md)]

The downloaded .json file provides the following information:
- Email: The email address associated with your account.
- Puid: The unique identifier associated with your billing account.
- SubscriptionIds: A list of subscriptions that belong to your account, enumerated by subscription ID.
