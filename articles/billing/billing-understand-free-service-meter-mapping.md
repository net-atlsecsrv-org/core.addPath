# Understand free service to meter mapping

Every Azure service emits usage against meters, which the Azure billing system utilizes to charge users for services. To better understand the usage of free services, let's look at the service to meter mapping for these services. To learn how to create free services, see [Create free services with Azure free account](billing-create-free-services-included-free-account.md).
