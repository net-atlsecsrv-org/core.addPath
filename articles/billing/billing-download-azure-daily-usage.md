# View and download your Azure usage and charges

You can download a daily breakdown of your Azure usage and charges in the Azure portal. Only certain roles have permission to get Azure usage information, like the Account Administrator or Enterprise Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](billing-manage-access.md).

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), you must be a billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager to view your Azure usage and charges.  If you have a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), only the Global Admin and Admin Agent role in the partner organization Microsoft can view and download Azure usage and charges.
