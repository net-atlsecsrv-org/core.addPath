# View and download your Azure usage and charges

If you're an EA customer or have a [Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement), you can download Azure usage and charges in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). For other subscriptions, go to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions) to download usage.

Only certain roles have permission to get Azure usage information, like the Account Administrator or Enterprise Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](billing-manage-access.md).

If you have a [Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement), you must be a billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager to view your Azure usage and charges. To learn more about billing roles for Microsoft Customer Agreements, see [Billing profile roles and tasks](billing-understand-mca-roles.md#billing-profile-roles-and-tasks).

## Download usage from the Account Center (.csv)

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information.

3. Select **BILLING HISTORY**.
