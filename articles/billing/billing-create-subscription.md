# Create an additional subscription in the Azure portal

You can create additional subscriptions for your account in Azure. You may want an additional subscription to avoid hitting subscription limits, to create separate environments for billing and security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.

If you want to create Azure subscriptions under your organization's Enterprise Agreement, you must have the Account Owner role for your organization.

If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

## Create an additional Azure subscription

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Subscriptions**.

1. Select **Add**.
