# Azure EA agreements and amendments

The article describes how Azure EA agreements and amendments might affect how you access, use, and pay for Azure services.

## Amendment status

Any amendments for Azure customers need to go through their partner or Microsoft account team and get processed through the regional operations center. If you think an amendment wasn't processed, check with your partner, software advisor, or Microsoft account team.

## Enrollment provisioning status

The start date of a new monetary commitment is defined by the date that the regional operations center processed it. The coverage start date on the purchase order at https://www.explore.ms shows the start of the monetary commitment. The coverage start date is when the monetary commitment appears in the Azure EA portal.

## Special pricing and ACD amendments

If you require special pricing and Azure Commitment Discount (ACD) amendments, you need to discuss them with your account team. The Azure Ops team can apply ACD after an amendment has been processed by the Business Desk ​and requested to Azure Ops team. ACD discount is only applied to the current month. Any previous months are compensated by backdated credit. ​

## Commitment not added to enrollment

When a purchase order for a monetary commitment is submitted by your partner and processed by the regional operations center, it should appear on your enrollment. If it doesn't appear on your enrollment in the Azure EA portal, contact Azure support to determine why.

A commitment processed after the second day of the month appears in the Azure EA portal on the first day of the following month.

## Support offer not provisioned

You can order Standard or Pro-Direct support by purchasing support-specific SKUs. The order is similar to a EA Azure Monetary SKU purchase order. For example, 6QK-00001. Support SKU numbers are W6T-00002 (Pro-Direct) and W6T-00003 (Standard). Check the current support offers before you purchase support SKUs.

The enrollment must have at least one active account for the support offer to be provisioned.

 The Azure [Enterprise Agreement Support Plan Offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/enterprise-agreement-support/) is available for some customers.

## Enrollment status

An enrollment has one of the following status values. Each value determines how you can use and access an enrollment. The enrollment status determines at which stage your enrollment is. It tells you if the enrollment needs to be activated before it can be used. Or, if the initial period has expired and you are charged for usage overage.

**Pending** - The enrollment administrator needs to sign in to the Azure EA portal. Once signed in, the enrollment switches to **Active** status.

**Active** - The enrollment is accessible and usable. You can create accounts and subscriptions in the Azure EA portal. The enrollment remains active until the enterprise agreement end date.

**Indefinite Extended Term** - Indefinite extended term status occurs after the enterprise agreement end date is reached. Before the EA enrollment reaches the enterprise agreement end date, the Enrollment Administrator should decide to:

- Renew the enrollment by adding additional Monetary Commitment
- Transfer the existing enrollment to a new enrollment
- Migrate to the Microsoft Online Subscription Program (MOSP)
- Confirm disablement of all services associated with the enrollment

**Expired** - When the EA enrollment reaches the enterprise agreement end date, the enrollment expires. The EA customer is opted out of the extended term and all their services are disabled.

As of August 1, 2019, new opt-out forms aren't accepted for Azure commercial customers. Instead, all enrollments go into indefinite extended term. If you want to stop using Azure services, close your subscription in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Or, your partner can submit a termination request at https://www.explore.ms. There's no change for customers with government agreement types.

**Transferred** - Transferred status is applied to enrollments that have their associated accounts and services transferred to a new enrollment. Enrollments don't automatically transfer if a new enrollment number is generated during renewal. The prior enrollment number must be included in the customer's renewal request for an automatic transfer.

## Price protection and increasing cost

A customer's baseline pricing is the locked-in, guaranteed price. It's protected by the Enterprise Azure Retail Pricing that was published when the Agreement was fully executed. After the initial enrollment term expires, prices revert to pay-as-you-go pricing.

To view your negotiated Price Sheet in the Azure EA portal, go to **Reports** > Click **Price Sheet** > **Download**.

If you're an indirect customer, contact your partner to get their Pricing Sheet and details about pricing.

## Partner markup

In the Azure EA portal, Partner Price Markup helps to enable better cost reporting for customers. The Azure EA portal shows usage and prices configured by partners for their customers.

Markup lets partner administrators add a percentage markup to their indirect enterprise agreements. Percentage markup applies to all Microsoft first party service information in the Azure EA portal. For example, meter rates, monetary commitments, and orders. After the markup is published by the partner, the customer sees Azure costs in the Azure portal. For example, usage summary, price lists, and downloaded usage reports.

Starting in September 2019, partners can apply markup anytime during a term. They don't need to wait until the term next anniversary to apply markup.

## Enrollment not created

An Azure EA enrollment gets provisioned after a monetary commitment is placed. After a monetary commitment purchase order is placed through your partner and processed through the regional operations center, it appears in the Azure EA portal.
