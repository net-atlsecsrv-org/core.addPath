# Understand your Azure external services charges
External services are published by third-party software vendors in the Azure Marketplace. For example, SendGrid is an external service that you can purchase in Azure, but is not published by Microsoft. Some Microsoft products are sold through Azure marketplace, too.

## How external services are billed

- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), your third-party services are billed with the rest of your Azure services. [Check your billing account type](#check-billing-account-type) to see if you have access to an MCA or MPA.
- If you don't have an MCA or MPA, your external services are billed separately from your Azure services.
- Each external service has a different billing model. Some services are billed in a pay-as-you-go fashion while others have fixed monthly charges.
- You can't use monthly free credits for external services. If you're using an Azure subscription that includes [free credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/), they can't be applied to charges from external services. When you provision a new external service or resource, a warning is shown:

<!-- ## View external service spending and history in the Azure portal
You can view a list of the external services that are on each subscription within the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the account administrator.
2. In the Hub menu, select **Subscriptions**.

## View and download invoices for external services

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), your third-party services are billed with the rest of your Azure services. [Check your billing account type](#check-billing-account-type) to see if you have access to an MCA or MPA. If you do, see [View and download invoices in the Azure portal](billing-download-azure-invoice.md) to see your third-party charges.

If you don't have an MCA or MPA, you have separate invoices for third-party charges. You can view and download your Azure Marketplace invoices from the Azure portal by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu, select **Invoices**.

## Manage payment for external services
