# Understand your Azure billing for external service charges
External services are published by third party software vendors in the Azure marketplace. For example, SendGrid is an external services that you can purchase in Azure, but is not published by Microsoft.

When you provision a new external service or resource, a warning is shown:

## How external services are billed
- External services are billed separately. They are treated as individual orders within your Azure subscription. The billing period for each service is set when you purchase the service. Not to be confused with the billing period of the subscription under which you purchased it. You also receive separate bills and your credit card is charged separately.
- Each external service has a different billing model. Some services are billed in a pay-as-you-go fashion while others use a monthly based payment model. You need a credit card for Azure external services, you can't buy external services with invoice pay.
- You can't use monthly free credits for external services. If you are using an Azure subscription that includes [free credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/), they can't be applied to external service bills. Use a credit card to purchase external services.
