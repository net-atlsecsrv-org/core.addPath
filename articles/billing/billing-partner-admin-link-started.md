# Link a partner ID to your Azure accounts

As a partner, you can track your impact across your customer engagements. You can link your partner ID to the accounts that are used to manage a customer's resources.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Get access from your customer

Before you link your partner ID, your customer must give you access to their Azure resources by using one of the following options:

- **Guest user**: Your customer can add you as a guest user and assign any role-based access control (RBAC) roles. For more information, see [Add guest users from another directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b).

- **Directory account**: Your customer can create a user account for you in their own directory and assign any RBAC role.

- **Service principal**: Your customer can add an app or script from your organization in their directory and assign any RBAC role. The identity of the app or script is known as a service principal.

## Link to a partner ID

When you have access to the customer's resources, use the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI to link your Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID) to your user ID or service principal. Link the partner ID in each customer tenant.

### Use the Azure portal to link to a new partner ID

1. Go to [Link to a partner ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/managementpartnerblade) in the Azure portal.

2. Sign in to the Azure portal.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    C:\ az login --tenant <tenant>
    ```
