# View and download your Microsoft Azure invoice

For most subscriptions, you can download your invoice from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) or have it sent in email. If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), you can't download your organization's invoices. Invoices are sent to whoever is set up to receive invoices for the enrollment.

Only certain roles have permission to view invoices. For example, the Account Administrator or Enterprise Administrator. For more information about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](billing-manage-access.md).

If you have a [Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement), you must have one of the following roles to get your invoices:

- Billing profile Owner
- Contributor
- Reader
- Invoice manager

For more information about billing roles for Microsoft Customer Agreements, see [Billing profile roles and tasks](billing-understand-mca-roles.md#billing-profile-roles-and-tasks).

## <a name="noinvoice"></a> Why you might not get an invoice

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.

- Azure bills you at the end of your invoice period. So, an invoice might not have been generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.

- You don't have permission to view invoices. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you must be the billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager. For other subscriptions, you might not see old invoices if you aren't the Account Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](billing-manage-access.md).

- If you have a Free Trial or a monthly credit amount with your subscription, you only get an invoice when you exceed the monthly credit amount. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you always receive an invoice.

## Get your invoice in email (.pdf)

You can opt in and configure additional recipients to receive your Azure invoice in an email. This feature may not be available for certain subscriptions such as support offers, Enterprise Agreements, or Azure in Open. If you have a Microsoft Customer agreement, see the next section, [Get your billing profile invoices in email](#get-your-subscriptions-invoices-in-email).

### Get your subscription's invoices in email

If you don't get an email after following the steps, make sure your email address is correct in the [communication preferences on your profile](https://account.windowsazure.com/profile).

### Opt out of getting your subscription's invoices in email

To opt out of getting your invoice by email, follow the preceding steps and click **Opt out of emailed invoices**. This option removes any email addresses set to receive invoices in email. You can reconfigure recipients if you opt back in.
