# Pay Azure subscription by invoice

If you switch to pay by invoice, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date. To become eligible to pay for your Azure subscription by invoice, submit a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you can switch a subscription to invoice pay in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Invoice pay is only available for business accounts.
> * You must pay all outstanding charges before switching to invoice pay.
> * Once you switch to invoice pay, you can't switch back to credit or debit card payment.
