# View your billing accounts in Azure portal  

A billing account is created for each agreement you sign with Microsoft to use Azure. You use your billing account to manage your invoices and payments methods, and track costs for Azure services. You can have access to multiple billing accounts. For example, you might have signed up for Azure for your personal projects. You could also have access through your organization's Enterprise Agreement or Microsoft Customer Agreement. For each of these scenarios, you would have a separate billing account.

Azure portal currently supports the following type of billing accounts:

- **Microsoft Online Services Program**: A billing account for a Microsoft Online Services Program is created when you sign up for Azure through Azure website. For example, when you sign up for an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/), [Azure pay as you go offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or as a [Visual studio subscriber](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).

- **Enterprise Agreement**: A billing account for an Enterprise Agreement is created when your organization signs an Enterprise Agreement to use Azure. Administrators in the billing account for an Enterprise Agreement use departments and accounts billing scopes to manage and organize billing for their organization.

- **Microsoft Customer Agreement**: A billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement is created when your organization signs a Microsoft Customer Agreement to use Azure. Administrators in the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement use billing profiles and invoice sections billing scopes to manage and organize billing for their organization. For more information, see [Get started with your billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement](billing-mca-overview.md).

## Change billing account view in the Azure portal

A scope is a node within a billing account that users use to view and manage billing. For example, billing accounts for Microsoft Online Services Program has only scope - billing account, while billing accounts for Enterprise Agreement has billing account, department and account scopes. If you have access to multiple billing scopes, by default, one of the scopes is displayed in the Azure Cost Management + Billing page. You can change the scope by following the instructions below:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.
