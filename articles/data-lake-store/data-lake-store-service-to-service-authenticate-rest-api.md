In this article, you learn how to use the REST API to do service-to-service authentication with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. For end-user authentication with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using REST API, see [End-user authentication with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using REST API](data-lake-store-end-user-authenticate-rest-api.md).

## Prerequisites

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* **Create an Azure Active Directory "Web" Application**. You must have completed the steps in [Service-to-service authentication with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using Azure Active Directory](data-lake-store-service-to-service-authenticate-using-active-directory.md).

## Service-to-service authentication

In this scenario, the application provides its own credentials to perform the operations. For this, you must issue a POST request like the one shown in the following snippet:

```console
curl -X POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT-ID>/oauth2/token  \
  -F grant_type=client_credentials \
  -F resource=https://management.core.windows.net/ \
  -F client_id=<CLIENT-ID> \
  -F client_secret=<AUTH-KEY>
```

The output of the request includes an authorization token (denoted by `access-token` in the output below) that you subsequently pass with your REST API calls. Save the authentication token in a text file; you will need it when making REST calls to Data Lake Storage Gen1.

```output
{"token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":"3599","expires_on":"1458245447","not_before":"1458241547","resource":"https://management.core.windows.net/","access_token":"<REDACTED>"}
```

This article uses the **non-interactive** approach. For more information on non-interactive (service-to-service calls), see [Service to service calls using credentials](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn645543.aspx).
