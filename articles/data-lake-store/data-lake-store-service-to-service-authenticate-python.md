In this article, you learn about how to use the Python SDK to do service-to-service authentication with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. For end-user authentication with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using Python, see [End-user authentication with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using Python](data-lake-store-end-user-authenticate-python.md).


## Prerequisites

* **Python**. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This article uses Python 3.6.2.

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* **Create an Azure Active Directory "Web" Application**. You must have completed the steps in [Service-to-service authentication with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using Azure Active Directory](data-lake-store-service-to-service-authenticate-using-active-directory.md).

## Install the modules

To work with Data Lake Storage Gen1 using Python, you need to install three modules.

* The `azure-mgmt-resource` module, which includes Azure modules for Active Directory, etc.
* The `azure-mgmt-datalake-store` module, which includes the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account management operations. For more information on this module, see [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 Management module reference](/python/api/azure-mgmt-datalake-store/).
* The `azure-datalake-store` module, which includes the Data Lake Storage Gen1 filesystem operations. For more information on this module, see [azure-datalake-store Filesystem module reference](https://azure-datalake-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Use the following commands to install the modules.

```
pip install azure-mgmt-resource
pip install azure-mgmt-datalake-store
pip install azure-datalake-store
```

## Create a new Python application

1. In the IDE of your choice create a new Python application, for example, **mysample.py**.

2. Add the following snippet to import the required modules

	```
	## Use this for Azure AD authentication
	from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import AADTokenCredentials

    ## Required for Data Lake Storage Gen1 account management
	from azure.mgmt.datalake.store import DataLakeStoreAccountManagementClient
	from azure.mgmt.datalake.store.models import DataLakeStoreAccount

	## Required for Data Lake Storage Gen1 filesystem management
	from azure.datalake.store import core, lib, multithread

	# Common Azure imports
    import adal
	from azure.mgmt.resource.resources import ResourceManagementClient
	from azure.mgmt.resource.resources.models import ResourceGroup

	## Use these as needed for your application
	import logging, getpass, pprint, uuid, time
	```

3. Save changes to mysample.py.

## Service-to-service authentication with client secret for account management

Use this snippet to authenticate with Azure AD for account management operations on Data Lake Storage Gen1 such as create a Data Lake Storage Gen1 account, delete a Data Lake Storage Gen1 account, etc. The following snippet can be used to authenticate your application non-interactively, using the client secret for an application / service principal of an existing Azure AD "Web App" application.

    authority_host_uri = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com'
    tenant = '<TENANT>'
    authority_uri = authority_host_uri + '/' + tenant
    RESOURCE = 'https://management.core.windows.net/'
    client_id = '<CLIENT_ID>'
    client_secret = '<CLIENT_SECRET>'
    
    context = adal.AuthenticationContext(authority_uri, api_version=None)
    mgmt_token = context.acquire_token_with_client_credentials(RESOURCE, client_id, client_secret)
    armCreds = AADTokenCredentials(mgmt_token, client_id, resource=RESOURCE)

## Service-to-service authentication with client secret for filesystem operations

Use the following snippet to authenticate with Azure AD for filesystem operations on Data Lake Storage Gen1 such as create folder, upload file, etc. The following snippet can be used to authenticate your application non-interactively, using the client secret for an application / service principal. Use this with an existing Azure AD "Web App" application.

    tenant = '<TENANT>'
    RESOURCE = 'https://datalake.azure.net/'
    client_id = '<CLIENT_ID>'
    client_secret = '<CLIENT_SECRET>'
    
    adlCreds = lib.auth(tenant_id = tenant,
                    client_secret = client_secret,
                    client_id = client_id,
                    resource = RESOURCE)

<!-- ## Service-to-service authentication with certificate for account management

Use this snippet to authenticate with Azure AD for account management operations on Data Lake Storage Gen1 such as create a Data Lake Storage Gen1 account, delete a Data Lake Storage Gen1 account, etc. The following snippet can be used to authenticate your application non-interactively, using the certificate of an existing Azure AD "Web App" application. For instructions on how to create an Azure AD application, see [Create service principal with certificates](../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md#create-service-principal-with-self-signed-certificate).

    authority_host_uri = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com'
    tenant = '<TENANT>'
    authority_uri = authority_host_uri + '/' + tenant
    resource_uri = 'https://management.core.windows.net/'
    client_id = '<CLIENT_ID>'
    client_cert = '<CLIENT_CERT>'
    client_cert_thumbprint = '<CLIENT_CERT_THUMBPRINT>'

    context = adal.AuthenticationContext(authority_uri, api_version=None)
    mgmt_token = context.acquire_token_with_client_certificate(resource_uri, client_id, client_cert, client_cert_thumbprint)
    credentials = AADTokenCredentials(mgmt_token, client_id) -->
