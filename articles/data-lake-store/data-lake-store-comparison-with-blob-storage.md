# Comparing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Azure Blob Storage

[!INCLUDE [data-lake-storage-gen1-rename-note.md](../../includes/data-lake-storage-gen1-rename-note.md)] 

The table in this article summarizes the differences between Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Azure Blob Storage along some key aspects of big data processing. Azure Blob Storage is a general purpose, scalable object store that is designed for a wide variety of storage scenarios. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 is a hyper-scale repository that is optimized for big data analytics workloads.

| Category | Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 | Azure Blob Storage |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Purpose |Optimized storage for big data analytics workloads |General purpose object store for a wide variety of storage scenarios, including big data analytics |
| Use Cases |Batch, interactive, streaming analytics and machine learning data such as log files, IoT data, click streams, large datasets |Any type of text or binary data, such as application back end, backup data, media storage for streaming and general purpose data. Additionally, full support for analytics workloads; batch, interactive, streaming analytics and machine learning data such as log files, IoT data, click streams, large datasets |
| Key Concepts |Data Lake Storage Gen1 account contains folders, which in turn contains data stored as files |Storage account has containers, which in turn has data in the form of blobs |
| Structure |Hierarchical file system |Object store with flat namespace |
| API |REST API over HTTPS |REST API over HTTP/HTTPS |
| Server-side API |[WebHDFS-compatible REST API](/rest/api/datalakestore/) |[Azure Blob Storage REST API](/rest/api/storageservices/Blob-Service-REST-API) |
| Hadoop File System Client |Yes |Yes |
| Data Operations - Authentication |Based on [Azure Active Directory Identities](../active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization.md) |Based on shared secrets - [Account Access Keys](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md) and [Shared Access Signature Keys](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md). |
| Data Operations - Authentication Protocol |[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/). Calls must contain a valid JWT (JSON web token) issued by Azure Active Directory.|Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). Calls must contain a Base64-encoded SHA-256 hash over a part of the HTTP request. |
| Data Operations - Authorization |POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs).  ACLs based on Azure Active Directory Identities can be set at the file and folder level. |For account-level authorization â€“ Use [Account Access Keys](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md)<br>For account, container, or blob authorization -  Use [Shared Access Signature Keys](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md) |
| Data Operations - Auditing |Available. See [here](data-lake-store-diagnostic-logs.md) for information. |Available |
