# Run background tasks with WebJobs in Azure App Service

The concept of running [background tasks](./webjobs-create-ieux-conceptual.md) on Azure is provided with Azure App service web jobs. Learn how to deploy <abbr title="A program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app.">WebJobs</abbr> by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to upload an executable or script. 

Three supported WebJobs include:

* **Continuous**: Starts immediately, typically running in an endless loop.
* **Scheduled**: Starts from scheduled trigger
* **Manual**: Starts from manual trigger
