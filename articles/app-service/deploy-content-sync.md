# Sync content from a cloud folder to Azure App Service
This article shows you how to sync your content to [Azure App Service](./overview.md) from Dropbox and OneDrive. 

With the content sync approach, your work with your app code and content in a designated cloud folder to make sure it's in a ready-to-deploy state, and then sync to App Service with the click of a button. 

Because of underlying differences in the APIs, **OneDrive for Business** is not supported at this time.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Development Center (Classic)** page in the Azure portal, which is the old deployment experience, will be deprecated in March, 2021. This change will not affect any existing deployment settings in your app, and you can continue to manage app deployment in the **Deployment Center** page.

## Enable content sync deployment

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the management page for your App Service app.

1. From the left menu, click **Deployment Center** > **Settings**. 

1. In **Source**, select **OneDrive** or **Dropbox**.

1. Click **Authorize** and follow the authorization prompts.

    You only need to authorize with OneDrive or Dropbox once for your Azure account. To authorize a different OneDrive or Dropbox account for an app, click **Change account**.

1. In **Folder**, select the folder to synchronize. This folder is created under the following designated content path in OneDrive or Dropbox. 
   
    * **OneDrive**: `Apps\Azure Web Apps`
    * **Dropbox**: `Apps\Azure`
    
1. Click **Save**.
