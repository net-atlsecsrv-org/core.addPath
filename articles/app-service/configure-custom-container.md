## Supported parent images

For your custom Windows image, you must choose the right [parent image (base image)](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/baseimages/) for the framework you want:

- To deploy .NET Framework apps, use a parent image based on the Windows Server Core [Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19#long-term-servicing-channel-ltsc) release. 
- To deploy .NET Core apps, use a parent image based on the Windows Server Nano [Semi-Annual Servicing Channel (SAC)](/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19#semi-annual-channel) release. 

It takes some time to download a parent image during app start-up. However, you can reduce start-up time by using one of the following parent images that are already cached in Azure App Service:

- [mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore):2004
- [mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore):ltsc2019
- [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework-aspnet/):4.8-windowsservercore-2004
- [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework-aspnet/):4.8-windowsservercore-ltsc2019
- [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-runtime/):3.1-nanoserver-2004
- [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-runtime/):3.1-nanoserver-1909
- [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-runtime/):3.1-nanoserver-1903

## Change the Docker image of a custom container

To change an existing custom container app from the current Docker image to a new image, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config container set --name <app-name> --resource-group <group-name> --docker-custom-image-name <docker-hub-repo>/<image>
```

## Use an image from a private registry

To use an image from a private registry, such as Azure Container Registry, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config container set --name <app-name> --resource-group <group-name> --docker-custom-image-name <image-name> --docker-registry-server-url <private-repo-url> --docker-registry-server-user <username> --docker-registry-server-password <password>
```

For *\<username>* and *\<password>*, supply the login credentials for your private registry account.

## I don't see the updated container

If you change your Docker container settings to point to a new container, it may take a few minutes before the app serves HTTP requests from the new container. While the new container is being pulled and started, App Service continues to serve requests from the old container. Only when the new container is started and ready to receive requests does App Service start sending requests to it.

## How container images are stored

The first time you run a custom Docker image in App Service, App Service does a `docker pull` and pulls all image layers. These layers are stored on disk, like if you were using Docker on-premises. Each time the app restarts, App Service does a `docker pull`, but only pulls layers that have changed. If there have been no changes, App Service uses existing layers on the local disk.

If the app changes compute instances for any reason, such as scaling up and down the pricing tiers, App Service must pull down all layers again. The same is true if you scale out to add additional instances. There are also rare cases where the app instances may change without a scale operation.

## Configure port number

By default, App Service assumes your custom container is listening on port 80. If your container listens to a different port, set the `WEBSITES_PORT` app setting in your App Service app. You can set it via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings WEBSITES_PORT=8000
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"WEBSITES_PORT"="8000"}
```

App Service currently allows your container to expose only one port for HTTP requests. 

## Configure environment variables

Your custom container may use environment variables that need to be supplied externally. You can pass them in via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings DB_HOST="myownserver.mysql.database.azure.com"
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"DB_HOST"="myownserver.mysql.database.azure.com"}
```

When your app runs, the App Service app settings are injected into the process as environment variables automatically. 

::: zone pivot="container-windows"
For IIS or .NET Framework (4.0 or above) based containers, they're injected into `System.ConfigurationManager` as .NET app settings and connection strings automatically by App Service. For all other language or framework, they're provided as environment variables for the process, with one of the following corresponding prefixes:

- `APPSETTING_`
- `SQLCONTR_`
- `MYSQLCONTR_`
- `SQLAZURECOSTR_`
- `POSTGRESQLCONTR_`
- `CUSTOMCONNSTR_`

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

This method works both for single-container apps or multi-container apps, where the environment variables are specified in the *docker-compose.yml* file.

::: zone-end

## Use persistent shared storage

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

You can use the *C:\home* directory in your app's file system to persist files across restarts and share them across instances. The `C:\home` in your app is provided to enable your container app to access persistent storage.

When persistent storage is disabled, writes to the `C:\home` directory aren't persisted. [Docker host logs and container logs](#access-diagnostic-logs) are saved in a default persistent shared storage that is not attached to the container. When persistent storage is enabled, all writes to the `C:\home` directory are persisted and can be accessed by all instances of a scaled-out app, and log are accessible at `C:\home\LogFiles`.

By default, persistent storage is *disabled* and the setting is not exposed in the Application Settings. To enable it, set the `WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE` app setting via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE=true
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE"=true}
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

You can use the */home* directory in your app's file system to persist files across restarts and share them across instances. The `/home` in your app is provided to enable your container app to access persistent storage.

When persistent storage is disabled, then writes to the `/home` directory aren't persisted across app restarts or across multiple instances. The only exception is the `/home/LogFiles` directory, which is used to store the Docker and container logs. When persistent storage is enabled, all writes to the `/home` directory are persisted and can be accessed by all instances of a scaled-out app.

By default, persistent storage is *enabled* and the setting is not exposed in the Application Settings. To disable it, set the `WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE` app setting via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE=false
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE"=false}
```

::: zone-end

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [configure your own persistent storage](configure-connect-to-azure-storage.md).

## Detect HTTPS session

App Service terminates TLS/SSL at the front ends. That means that TLS/SSL requests never get to your app. You don't need to, and shouldn't implement any support for TLS/SSL into your app. 

The front ends are located inside Azure data centers. If you use TLS/SSL with your app, your traffic across the Internet will always be safely encrypted.

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

## Customize ASP.NET machine key injection

 During the container start, automatically generated keys are injected into the container as the machine keys for ASP.NET cryptographic routines. You can [find these keys in your container](#connect-to-the-container) by looking for the following environment variables: `MACHINEKEY_Decryption`, `MACHINEKEY_DecryptionKey`, `MACHINEKEY_ValidationKey`, `MACHINEKEY_Validation`. 

The new keys at each restart may reset ASP.NET forms authentication and view state, if your app depends on them. To prevent the automatic regeneration of keys, [set them manually as App Service app settings](#configure-environment-variables). 

## Connect to the container

You can connect to your Windows container directly for diagnostic tasks by navigating to `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`. Here's how it works:

- The debug console lets you execute interactive commands, such as starting PowerShell sessions, inspecting registry keys, and navigate the entire container file system.
- It functions separately from the graphical browser above it, which only shows the files in your [shared storage](#use-persistent-shared-storage).
- In a scaled-out app, the debug console is connected to one of the container instances. You can select a different instance from the **Instance** dropdown in the top menu.
- Any change you make to the container from within the console does *not* persist when your app is restarted (except for changes in the shared storage), because it's not part of the Docker image. To persist your changes, such as registry settings and software installation, make them part of the Dockerfile.

## Access diagnostic logs

App Service logs actions by the Docker host as well as activities from within the container. Logs from the Docker host (platform logs) are shipped by default, but application logs or web server logs from within the container need to be enabled manually. For more information, see [Enable application logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#enable-application-logging-linuxcontainer) and [Enable web server logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#enable-web-server-logging). 

There are several ways to access Docker logs:

- [In Azure portal](#in-azure-portal)
- [From the Kudu console](#from-the-kudu-console)
- [With the Kudu API](#with-the-kudu-api)
- [Send logs to Azure monitor](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#send-logs-to-azure-monitor-preview)

### In Azure portal

Docker logs are displayed in the portal, in the **Container Settings** page of your app. The logs are truncated, but you can download all the logs clicking **Download**. 

### From the Kudu console

Navigate to `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole` and click the **LogFiles** folder to see the individual log files. To download the entire **LogFiles** directory, click the **Download** icon to the left of the directory name. You can also access this folder using an FTP client.

In the console terminal, you can't access the `C:\home\LogFiles` folder by default because persistent shared storage is not enabled. To enable this behavior in the console terminal, [enable persistent shared storage](#use-persistent-shared-storage).

If you try to download the Docker log that is currently in use using an FTP client, you may get an error because of a file lock.

### With the Kudu API

Navigate directly to `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker` to see metadata for the Docker logs. You may see more than one log file listed, and the `href` property lets you download the log file directly. 

To download all the logs together in one ZIP file, access `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker/zip`.

## Customize container memory

By default all Windows Containers deployed in Azure App Service are limited to 1 GB RAM. You can change this value by providing the `WEBSITE_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` app setting via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings WEBSITE_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=2000
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"WEBSITE_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB"=2000}
```

The value is defined in MB and must be less and equal to the total physical memory of the host. For example, in an App Service plan with 8 GB RAM, the cumulative total of `WEBSITE_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` for all the apps must not exceed 8 GB. Information on how much memory is available for each pricing tier can be found in [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/), in the **Premium Container (Windows) Plan** section.

## Customize the number of compute cores

By default, a Windows container runs with all available cores for your chosen pricing tier. You may want to reduce the number of cores that your staging slot uses, for example. To reduce the number of cores used by a container, set the `WEBSITE_CPU_CORES_LIMIT` app setting to the preferred number of cores. You can set it via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --slot staging --settings WEBSITE_CPU_CORES_LIMIT=1
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"WEBSITE_CPU_CORES_LIMIT"=1}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Updating the app setting triggers automatic restart, causing minimal downtime. For a production app, consider swapping it into a staging slot, change the app setting in the staging slot, and then swap it back into production.

Verify your adjusted number by going to the Kudu Console (`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net`) and typing in the following commands using PowerShell. Each command outputs a number.

```PowerShell
Get-ComputerInfo | ft CsNumberOfLogicalProcessors # Total number of enabled logical processors. Disabled processors are excluded.
Get-ComputerInfo | ft CsNumberOfProcessors # Number of physical processors.
```

The processors may be multicore or hyperthreading processors. Information on how many cores are available for each pricing tier can be found in [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/), in the **Premium Container (Windows) Plan** section.

## Customize health ping behavior

App Service considers a container to be successfully started when the container starts and responds to an HTTP ping. The health ping request containers the header `User-Agent= "App Service Hyper-V Container Availability Check"`. If the container starts but does not respond to a ping after a certain amount of time, App Service logs an event in the Docker log, saying that the container didn't start. 

If your application is resource-intensive, the container might not respond to the HTTP ping in time. To control the actions when HTTP pings fail, set the `CONTAINER_AVAILABILITY_CHECK_MODE` app setting. You can set it via the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). In Bash:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings CONTAINER_AVAILABILITY_CHECK_MODE="ReportOnly"
```

In PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"CONTAINER_AVAILABILITY_CHECK_MODE"="ReportOnly"}
```

The following table shows the possible values:

| Value | Descriptions |
| - | - |
| **Repair** | Restart the container after three consecutive availability checks |
| **ReportOnly** | The default value. Don't restart the container but report in the Docker logs for the container after three consecutive availability checks. |
| **Off** | Don't check for availability. |

## Support for Group Managed Service Accounts

Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) are currently not supported in Windows containers in App Service.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

## Enable SSH

SSH enables secure communication between a container and a client. In order for a custom container to support SSH, you must add it into the Dockerfile itself.

> [!TIP]
> All built-in Linux containers have added the SSH instructions in their image repositories. You can go through the following instructions with the [Node.js 10.14 repository](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/node/blob/master/10.14) to see how it's enabled there.

- Use the [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) instruction to install the SSH server and set the password for the root account to `"Docker!"`. For example, for an image based on [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine), you need the following commands:

    ```Dockerfile
    RUN apk add openssh \
         && echo "root:Docker!" | chpasswd 
    ```

    This configuration doesn't allow external connections to the container. SSH is available only through `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net` and authenticated with the publishing credentials.

- Add [this sshd_config file](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/node/blob/master/10.14/sshd_config) to your image repository, and use the [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) instruction to copy the file to the */etc/ssh/* directory. For more information about *sshd_config* files, see [OpenBSD documentation](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config).

    ```Dockerfile
    COPY sshd_config /etc/ssh/
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The *sshd_config* file must include the following items:
    > - `Ciphers` must include at least one item in this list: `aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,aes256-cbc`.
    > - `MACs` must include at least one item in this list: `hmac-sha1,hmac-sha1-96`.

- Use the [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) instruction to open port 2222 in the container. Although the root password is known, port 2222 is inaccessible from the internet. It's accessible only by containers within the bridge network of a private virtual network.

    ```Dockerfile
    EXPOSE 80 2222
    ```

- In the start-up script for your container, start the SSH server.

    ```bash
    /usr/sbin/sshd
    ```

    For an example, see how the default [Node.js 10.14 container](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/node/blob/master/10.14/startup/init_container.sh) starts the SSH server.

## Configure multi-container apps

- [Use persistent storage in Docker Compose](#use-persistent-storage-in-docker-compose)
- [Preview limitations](#preview-limitations)
- [Docker Compose options](#docker-compose-options)

### Use persistent storage in Docker Compose

Multi-container apps like WordPress need persistent storage to function properly. To enable it, your Docker Compose configuration must point to a storage location *outside* your container. Storage locations inside your container don't persist changes beyond app restart.

Enable persistent storage by setting the `WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE` app setting, using the [az webapp config appsettings set](/cli/azure/webapp/config/appsettings?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-appsettings-set) command in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE=TRUE
```

In your *docker-compose.yml* file, map the `volumes` option to `${WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME}`. 

`WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME` is an environment variable in App Service that is mapped to persistent storage for your app. For example:

```yaml
wordpress:
  image: wordpress:latest
  volumes:
  - ${WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME}/site/wwwroot:/var/www/html
  - ${WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME}/phpmyadmin:/var/www/phpmyadmin
  - ${WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME}/LogFiles:/var/log
```

### Preview limitations

Multi-container is currently in preview. The following App Service platform features are not supported:
