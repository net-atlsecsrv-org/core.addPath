# Quickstart: Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to create and deploy your first ASP.NET Core web app to [Azure App Service](overview.md). 

When you're finished, you'll have an Azure resource group consisting of an App Service hosting plan and an App Service with a deployed web application.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).
- This quickstart deploys an app to App Service on Windows. To deploy to App Service on _Linux_, see [Create a .NET Core web app in App Service](./quickstart-dotnetcore.md).
- Install <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2019</a> with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload.

  If you've installed Visual Studio 2019 already:

  - Install the latest updates in Visual Studio by selecting **Help** > **Check for Updates**.
  - Add the workload by selecting **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features**.


## Create an ASP.NET Core web app

Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Visual Studio by following these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio and select **Create a new project**.

1. In **Create a new project**, select **ASP.NET Core Web Application** and confirm that **C#** is listed in the languages for that choice, then select **Next**.

1. In **Configure your new project**, name your web application project *myFirstAzureWebApp*, and select **Create**.

   ![Configure your web app project](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/configure-web-app-project.png)

1. You can deploy any type of ASP.NET Core web app to Azure, but for this quickstart, choose the **Web Application** template. Make sure **Authentication** is set to **No Authentication**, and that no other option is selected. Then, select **Create**.

   ![Create a new ASP.NET Core web app](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/create-aspnet-core-web-app.png) 
   
1. From the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start Without Debugging** to run your web app locally.

   ![Web app running locally](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/web-app-running-locally.png)

## Publish your web app

To publish your web app, you must first create and configure a new App Service that you can publish your app to. 

As part of setting up the App Service, you'll create:

- A new [resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#terminology) to contain all of the Azure resources for the service.
- A new [Hosting Plan](./overview-hosting-plans.md) that specifies the location, size, and features of the web server farm that hosts your app.

Follow these steps to create your App Service and publish your web app:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **myFirstAzureWebApp** project and select **Publish**. If you haven't already signed-in to your Azure account from Visual Studio, select either **Add an account** or **Sign in**. You can also create a free Azure account.

1. In the **Pick a publish target** dialog box, choose **App Service**, select **Create New**, and then select **Create Profile**.

   ![Pick a publish target](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/pick-publish-target-vs2019.png)

1. In the **App Service: Create new** dialog, provide a globally unique **Name** for your app by either accepting the default name, or entering a new name. Valid characters are: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `-`. This **Name** is used as the URL prefix for your web app in the format `http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`.

1. For **Subscription**, accept the subscription that is listed or select a new one from the drop-down list.

1. In **Resource group**, select **New**. In **New resource group name**, enter *myResourceGroup* and select **OK**. 

1. For **Hosting Plan**, select **New**. 

1. In the **Hosting Plan: Create new** dialog, enter the values specified in the following table:

   | Setting  | Suggested Value | Description |
   | -------- | --------------- | ----------- |
   | **Hosting Plan**  | *myFirstAzureWebAppPlan* | Name of the App Service plan. |
   | **Location**      | *West Europe* | The datacenter where the web app is hosted. |
   | **Size**          | *Free* | [Pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) determines hosting features. |
   
   ![Create new Hosting Plan](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/create-new-hosting-plan-vs2019.png)

1. Leave **Application Insights** set to *None*.

1. In the **App Service: Create new** dialog box, select **Create** to start creating the Azure resources.

   ![Create new app service](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/create-new-app-service-vs2019.png)

1. Once the wizard completes, select **Publish**.

   ![Publish web app to Azure](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/publish-web-app-vs2019.png)

   Visual Studio publishes your ASP.NET Core web app to Azure, and launches the app in your default browser. 

   ![Published ASP.NET web app running in Azure](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/web-app-running-live.png)

**Congratulations!** Your ASP.NET Core web app is running live in Azure App Service.

## Update the app and redeploy

Follow these steps to update and redeploy your web app:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, under your project, open **Pages** > **Index.cshtml**.

1. Replace the entire `<div>` tag with the following code:

   ```html
   <div class="jumbotron">
       <h1>ASP.NET in Azure!</h1>
       <p class="lead">This is a simple app that we've built that demonstrates how to deploy a .NET app to Azure App Service.</p>
   </div>
   ```

1. To redeploy to Azure, right-click the **myFirstAzureWebApp** project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Publish**.

1. In the **Publish** summary page, select **Publish**.

   ![Publish update to web app](./media/quickstart-dotnetcore/publish-update-to-web-app-vs2019.png)

When publishing completes, Visual Studio launches a browser to the URL of the web app.

[App Service on Linux](overview.md#app-service-on-linux) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. This quickstart shows how to create a [.NET Core](/aspnet/core/) app on App Service on Linux. You create the app using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), and you use Git to deploy the .NET Core code to the app.

![Sample app running in Azure](media/quickstart-dotnetcore/dotnet-browse-azure.png)

You can follow the steps in this article using a Mac, Windows, or Linux machine.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart:

* <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Install Git</a>
* <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1" target="_blank">Install the latest .NET Core 3.1 SDK</a>

## Create the app locally

In a terminal window on your machine, create a directory named `hellodotnetcore` and change the current directory to it.

```bash
mkdir hellodotnetcore
cd hellodotnetcore
```

Create a new .NET Core app.

```bash
dotnet new web
```

## Run the app locally

Run the application locally so that you see how it should look when you deploy it to Azure. 

Restore the NuGet packages and run the app.

```bash
dotnet run
```

Open a web browser, and navigate to the app at `http://localhost:5000`.

You see the **Hello World** message from the sample app displayed in the page.
