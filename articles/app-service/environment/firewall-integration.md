# Locking down an App Service Environment

The App Service Environment (ASE) has a number of external dependencies that it requires access to in order to function properly. The ASE lives in the customer Azure Virtual Network (VNet). Customers must allow the ASE dependency traffic, which is a problem for customers that want to lock down all egress from their VNet.

There are a number of inbound dependencies that an ASE has. The inbound management traffic cannot be sent through a firewall device. The source addresses for this traffic are known and are published in the [App Service Environment management addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/management-addresses) document. You can create Network Security Group rules with that information to secure inbound traffic.

The ASE outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which do not have static addresses behind them. The lack of static addresses means that Network Security Groups (NSGs) cannot be used to lock down the outbound traffic from an ASE. The addresses change often enough that one cannot set up rules based on the current resolution and use that to create NSGs. 

The solution to securing outbound addresses lies in use of a firewall device that can control outbound traffic based on domain names. Azure Firewall can restrict outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on the FQDN of the destination.  

## System architecture

Deploying an ASE with outbound traffic going through a firewall device requires changing routes on the ASE subnet. Routes operate at an IP level. If you are not careful in defining your routes, you can force TCP reply traffic to source from another address. This is called asymmetric routing and it will break TCP.

There must be routes defined so that inbound traffic to the ASE can reply back the same way the traffic came in. This is true for inbound management requests and it is true for inbound application requests.

The traffic to and from an ASE must abide by the following conventions

* The traffic to Azure SQL, Storage and Event Hub are not supported with use of a firewall device. This traffic must be sent directly to those services. The way to make that happen is to configure service endpoints for those three services. 
* Route table rules must be defined that send inbound management traffic back from where it came.
* Route table rules must be defined that send inbound application traffic back from where it came. 
* All other traffic leaving the ASE can be sent to your firewall device with a route table rule.

## Configuring Azure Firewall with your ASE 

The steps to lock down egress from your existing ASE with Azure Firewall are:

1. Enable service endpoints to SQL, Storage, and Event Hub on your ASE subnet. To do this, go into the networking portal > subnets and select Microsoft.EventHub, Microsoft.SQL and Microsoft.Storage from the Service endpoints dropdown. When you have service endpoints enabled to Azure SQL, any Azure SQL dependencies that your apps have must be configured with service endpoints as well. 

   ![select service endpoints][2]
  
1. Create a subnet named AzureFirewallSubnet in the VNet where your ASE exists. Follow the directions in the [Azure Firewall documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/) to create your Azure Firewall.
1. From the Azure Firewall UI > Rules > Application rule collection, select Add application rule collection. Provide a name, priority, and set Allow. In the FQDN tags section, provide a name, set the source addresses to * and select the App Service Environment FQDN Tag and the Windows Update. 
   
   ![Add application rule][1]
   
1. From the Azure Firewall UI > Rules > Network rule collection, select Add network rule collection. Provide a name, priority and set Allow. In the Rules section, provide a name, select **Any**, set * to Source and Destination addresses, and set the ports to 123. This rule allows the system to perform clock sync using NTP. Create another rule the same way to port 12000 to help triage any system issues.

   ![Add NTP network rule][3]

1. Create a route table with the management addresses from [App Service Environment management addresses]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/management-addresses) with a next hop of Internet. The route table entries are required to avoid asymmetric routing problems. Add routes for the IP address dependencies noted below in the IP address dependencies with a next hop of Internet. Add a Virtual Appliance route to your route table for 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop being your Azure Firewall private IP address. 

   ![Creating a route table][4]
   
1. Assign the route table you created to your ASE subnet.

#### Deploying your ASE behind a firewall

The steps to deploy your ASE behind a firewall are the same as configuring your existing ASE with an Azure Firewall except you will need to create your ASE subnet and then follow the previous steps. To create your ASE in a pre-existing subnet, you need to use a Resource Manager template as described in the document on [Creating your ASE with a Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/create-from-template).

## Application traffic 

The above steps will allow your ASE to operate without problems. You still need to configure things to accommodate your application needs. There are two problems for applications in an ASE that is configured with Azure Firewall.  

- Application dependencies must be added to the Azure Firewall or the route table. 
- Routes must be created for the application traffic to avoid asymmetric routing issues

If your applications have dependencies, they need to be added to your Azure Firewall. Create Application rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic and Network rules for everything else. 

If you know the address range that your application request traffic will come from, you can add that to the route table that is assigned to your ASE subnet. If the address range is large or unspecified, then you can use a network appliance like the Application Gateway to give you one address to add to your route table. For details on configuring an Application Gateway with your ILB ASE, read [Integrating your ILB ASE with an Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/integrate-with-application-gateway)

This use of the Application Gateway is just one example of how to configure your system. If you did follow this path, then you would need to add a route to the ASE subnet route table so the reply traffic sent to the Application Gateway would go there directly. 

## Logging 

Azure Firewall can send logs to Azure Storage, Event Hub, or Azure Monitor logs. To integrate your app with any supported destination, go to the Azure Firewall portal > Diagnostic Logs and enable the logs for your desired destination. If you integrate with Azure Monitor logs, then you can see logging for any traffic sent to Azure Firewall. To see the traffic that is being denied, open your Log Analytics workspace portal > Logs and enter a query like 

    AzureDiagnostics | where msg_s contains "Deny" | where TimeGenerated >= ago(1h)
 
Integrating your Azure Firewall with Azure Monitor logs is very useful when first getting an application working when you are not aware of all of the application dependencies. You can learn more about Azure Monitor logs from [Analyze log data in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview)
 
## Dependencies

The following information is only required if you wish to configure a firewall appliance other than Azure Firewall. 

- Service Endpoint capable services should be configured with service endpoints.
- IP Address dependencies are for non-HTTP/S traffic (both TCP and UDP traffic)
- FQDN HTTP/HTTPS endpoints can be placed in your firewall device.
- Wildcard HTTP/HTTPS endpoints are dependencies that can vary with your ASE based on a number of qualifiers. 
- Linux dependencies are only a concern if you are deploying Linux apps into your ASE. If you are not deploying Linux apps into your ASE, then these addresses do not need to be added to your firewall.

#### IP Address dependencies

|----------| ----- |
| \*:123 | NTP clock check. Traffic is checked at multiple endpoints on port 123 |
| \*:12000 | This port is used for some system monitoring. If blocked then some issues will be harder to triage but your ASE will continue to operate |
| 40.77.24.27:80 | Needed to monitor and alert on ASE problems |
| 40.77.24.27:443 | Needed to monitor and alert on ASE problems |
| 13.90.249.229:80 | Needed to monitor and alert on ASE problems |
| 13.90.249.229:443 | Needed to monitor and alert on ASE problems |
