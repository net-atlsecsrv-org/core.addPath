# How to configure your App Service application to use Facebook login
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-authentication.md)]

This topic shows you how to configure Azure App Service to use Facebook as an authentication provider.

To complete the procedure in this topic, you must have a Facebook account that has a verified email address and a mobile phone number. To create a new Facebook account, go to [facebook.com].

## <a name="register"> </a>Register your application with Facebook
1. Navigate to the [Facebook Developers] website and sign-in with your Facebook account credentials.
3. (Optional) If you don't have a Facebook for Developers account, click **Get Started** and follow the registration steps.
4. Click **My Apps** > **Add New App**.
5. In **Display Name**, type a unique name for your app. Also provide your **Contact Email**, and then click **Create App ID** and complete the security check. This takes you to the developer dashboard for your new Facebook app.
6. Click **Dashboard** > **Facebook Login** > **Set up** > **Web**.
1. In the left-hand navigation under **Facebook Login**, click **Settings**.
1. In **Valid OAuth redirect URIs**, type `https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/facebook/callback` and replace *\<app-name>* with the name of your Azure App Service app. Click **Save Changes**.
8. In the left-hand navigation, click **Settings** > **Basic**. On the **App Secret** field, click **Show**. Copy the values of **App ID** and **App Secret**. You use these later to configure your App Service app in Azure.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The app secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.
   > 
   > 
9. The Facebook account which was used to register the application is an administrator of the app. At this point, only administrators can sign into this application. To authenticate other Facebook accounts, click **App Review** and enable **Make \<your-app-name> public** to enable general public access using Facebook authentication.

## <a name="secrets"> </a>Add Facebook information to your application
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your App Service app. Click **Settings** > **Authentication / Authorization**, and make sure that **App Service Authentication** is **On**.
2. Click **Facebook**, paste in the App ID and App Secret values which you obtained previously, optionally enable any scopes needed by your application, then click **OK**.
   
    ![][0]
   
    By default, App Service provides authentication but does not restrict authorized access to your site content and APIs. You must authorize users in your app code.
3. (Optional) To restrict access to your site to only users authenticated by Facebook, set **Action to take when request is not authenticated** to **Facebook**. This requires that all requests be authenticated, and all unauthenticated requests are redirected to Facebook for authentication.
 
> [!CAUTION]
> Restricting access in this way applies to all calls to your app, which may not be desirable for apps wanting a publicly available home page, as in many single-page applications. For such applications, **Allow anonymous requests (no action)** may be preferred, with the app manually starting login itself, as described [here](overview-authentication-authorization.md#authentication-flow).

4. When done configuring authentication, click **Save**.

You are now ready to use Facebook for authentication in your app.
