# Run a custom Windows container in Azure (Preview)

[Azure App Service](overview.md) provides pre-defined application stacks on Windows like ASP.NET or Node.js, running on IIS. The preconfigured Windows environment locks down the operating system from administrative access, software installations, changes to the global assembly cache, and so on. For more information, see [Operating system functionality on Azure App Service](operating-system-functionality.md). If your application requires more access than the preconfigured environment allows, you can deploy a custom Windows container instead.

This quickstart shows how to deploy an ASP.NET app, in a Windows image, to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) from Visual Studio. You run the app in a custom container in Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

- <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Sign up for a Docker Hub account</a>
- <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Install Docker for Windows</a>.
- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/quick-start-windows-10" target="_blank">Switch Docker to run Windows containers</a>.
- <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Install Visual Studio 2019</a> with the **ASP.NET and web development** and **Azure development** workloads. If you've installed Visual Studio 2019 already:

    - Install the latest updates in Visual Studio by selecting **Help** > **Check for Updates**.
    - Add the workloads in Visual Studio by selecting **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features**.

## Create an ASP.NET web app

Create an ASP.NET web app by following these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio and then select **Create a new project**.

1. In **Create a new project**, find and choose **ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)** for C#, then select **Next**.

1. In **Configure your new project**, name the application _myFirstAzureWebApp_, and then select **Create**.

   ![Configure your web app project](./media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/configure-web-app-project-container.png)

1. You can deploy any type of ASP.NET web app to Azure. For this quickstart, choose the **MVC** template.

1. Select **Docker support**, and make sure authentication is set to **No Authentication**. Select **Create**.

   ![Create ASP.NET Web Application](./media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/select-mvc-template-for-container.png)

1. If the _Dockerfile_ file isn't opened automatically, open it from the **Solution Explorer**.

1. You need a [supported parent image](#use-a-different-parent-image). Change the parent image by replacing the `FROM` line with the following code and save the file:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.7.2-windowsservercore-ltsc2019
   ```

1. From the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start Without Debugging** to run the web app locally.

   ![Run app locally](./media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/local-web-app.png)

## Publish to Docker Hub

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **myFirstAzureWebApp** project and select **Publish**.

1. Choose **App Service** and then select **Publish**.

1. In Pick a **publish target**, select **Container Registry** and **Docker Hub**, and then click **Publish**.

   ![Publish from project overview page](./media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/publish-to-docker-vs2019.png)

1. Supply your Docker Hub account credentials and select **Save**.

   Wait for the deployment to complete. The **Publish** page now shows the repository name to use later.

   ![Publish from project overview page](./media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/published-docker-repository-vs2019.png)

1. Copy this repository name for later.

## Create a Windows container app

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal]( https://portal.azure.com).

1. Choose **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

1. In the search box above the list of Azure Marketplace resources, search for **Web App for Containers**, and select **Create**.

1. In **Web App Create**, choose your subscription and a **Resource Group**. You can create a new resource group if needed.

1. Provide an app name, such as *win-container-demo* and choose **Windows** for **Operating System**. Select **Next: Docker** to continue.

   ![Create a Web App for Containers](media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/create-web-app-continer.png)

1. For **Image Source**, choose **Docker Hub** and for **Image and tag**, enter the repository name you copied in [Publish to Docker Hub](#publish-to-docker-hub).

   ![Configure your a Web App for Containers](media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/configure-web-app-continer.png)

    If you have a custom image elsewhere for your web application, such as in [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/) or in any other private repository, you can configure it here.

1. Select **Review and Create** and then **Create** and wait for Azure to create the required resources.

## Browse to the container app

When the Azure operation is complete, a notification box is displayed.

![Deployment succeeded](media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/portal-create-finished.png)

1. Click **Go to resource**.

1. In the overview of this resource, follow the link next to **URL**.

A new browser page opens to the following page:

![Windows Container App Starting](media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/app-starting.png)

Wait a few minutes and try again, until you get the default ASP.NET home page:

![Windows Container App running](media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/app-running-vs.png)

**Congratulations!** You're running your first custom Windows container in Azure App Service.

## See container start-up logs

It may take some time for the Windows container to load. To see the progress, navigate to the following URL by replacing *\<app_name>* with the name of your app.
```
https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logstream
```

The streamed logs looks like this:

```
2018-07-27T12:03:11  Welcome, you are now connected to log-streaming service.
27/07/2018 12:04:10.978 INFO - Site: win-container-demo - Start container succeeded. Container: facbf6cb214de86e58557a6d073396f640bbe2fdec88f8368695c8d1331fc94b
27/07/2018 12:04:16.767 INFO - Site: win-container-demo - Container start complete
27/07/2018 12:05:05.017 INFO - Site: win-container-demo - Container start complete
27/07/2018 12:05:05.020 INFO - Site: win-container-demo - Container started successfully
```

## Update locally and redeploy

1. In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, open **Views** > **Home** > **Index.cshtml**.

1. Find the `<div class="jumbotron">` HTML tag near the top, and replace the entire element with the following code:

   ```HTML
   <div class="jumbotron">
       <h1>ASP.NET in Azure!</h1>
       <p class="lead">This is a simple app that weâ€™ve built that demonstrates how to deploy a .NET app to Azure App Service.</p>
   </div>
   ```

1. To redeploy to Azure, right-click the **myFirstAzureWebApp** project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Publish**.

1. On the publish page, select **Publish** and wait for publishing to complete.

1. To tell App Service to pull in the new image from Docker Hub, restart the app. Back in the app page in the portal, click **Restart** > **Yes**.

   ![Restart web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container/portal-restart-app.png)

[Browse to the container app](#browse-to-the-container-app) again. As you refresh the webpage, the app should revert to the "Starting up" page at first, then display the updated webpage again after a few minutes.

## Use a different parent image

You're free to use a different custom Docker image to run your app. However, you must choose the right [parent image](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/baseimages/) for the framework you want:

- To deploy .NET Framework apps, use a parent image based on the Windows Server Core 2019 [Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19#long-term-servicing-channel-ltsc) release. 
- To deploy .NET Core apps, use a parent image based on the Windows Server Nano 1809 [Semi-Annual Servicing Channel (SAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19#semi-annual-channel) release. 

It takes some time to download a parent image during app start-up. However, you can reduce start-up time by using one of the following parent images that are already cached in Azure App Service:

- [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework-aspnet/):4.7.2-windowsservercore-ltsc2019
- [mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-nanoserver/):1809 - this image is the base container used across Microsoft [ASP.NET Core](https://hub.docker.com/_microsoft-dotnet-cores-aspnet) Microsoft Windows Nano Server images.
