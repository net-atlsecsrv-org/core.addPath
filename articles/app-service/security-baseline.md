# Azure security baseline for App Service

The Azure Security Baseline for App Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to App Service. **Controls** not applicable to App Service have been excluded.

To see how App Service completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full App Service security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: 
When using App Service in the Isolated pricing tier, also called an App Service Environment (ASE) you can deploy directly into a subnet within your Azure Virtual Network. Use network security groups to secure your Azure App Service Environment by blocking inbound and outbound traffic to resources in your virtual network, or to restrict access to apps in an App Service Environment.

By default, network security groups include an implicit deny rule at the lowest priority, which requires you to explicitly add allow rules. Add allow rules for your network security group based on a least privileged networking approach. The underlying virtual machines that are used to host the App Service Environment are not directly accessible because they are in a Microsoft-managed subscription.

Protect an App Service Environment by routing traffic through a Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled Azure Application Gateway. Use service endpoints in conjunction with the Application Gateway to secure inbound publishing traffic to your app.  

In the multi-tenant App Service (an app not in Isolated tier), use network security groups to block outbound traffic from your app. Enable your apps to access resources in or through a Virtual Network, with the Virtual Network Integration feature. This feature can also be used to block outbound traffic to public addresses from the app. Virtual Network Integration cannot be used to provide inbound access to an app.  

Secure inbound traffic to your app with:
- Access Restrictions - a series of allow or deny rules that control inbound access
- Service Endpoints - can deny inbound traffic from outside of specified virtual networks or subnets
- Private Endpoints - expose your app to your Virtual Network with a private IP address. With the Private Endpoints enabled on your app, it is no longer internet-accessible

When using Virtual Network Integration feature with virtual networks in the same region, use network security groups and route tables with user-defined routes. User-defined routes can be placed on the integration subnet to send outbound traffic as intended.  

Consider implementing an Azure Firewall to centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across your subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for virtual network resources, which allows outside firewalls to identify traffic that originates from your virtual network.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Implement network protection recommendations from Azure Security Center to secure network resources and configurations related to your App Service apps and APIs.

Use Azure Firewall to send traffic and centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources, which allows outside firewalls to identify traffic that originates from your Virtual Network. The Azure Firewall service is also fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Secure an internet accessible app in an App Service Environment (ASE) by:
- Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Azure Application Gateway in front of an internet facing app
- Use Access Restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway
- Secure the app with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to ensure authentication
- Set the minimum TLS version to 1.2
- Set the app to HTTPS only

Drive all application traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs. 

To secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant App Service, (such as, not in the isolated tier)
- Deploy a Web Application Firewall-enabled device in front of an app
- Use Access Restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the Web Application Firewall (WAF) device
- Secure the app with Azure AD to ensure authentication
- Set the minimum TLS version to 1.2
- Set the app to HTTPS only
- Use Virtual network Integration and the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL to make all outbound traffic subject to network security groups and user-defined routes on the integration subnet.

Similar to the Application Service Environment app, drive all application traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs in the app.

Additionally, review and follow recommendations in the Locking down an App Service Environment document.

- [Track WAF alerts and easily monitor trends with Azure Monitor ](../azure-monitor/overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Secure the App Service Environment as described in the Locking down an App Service Environment documentation. Apply the Integrated Threat Intelligence functionality in Azure Security Center to deny communications with known-malicious or unused public IP addresses. Use Access Restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway. 

Secure the multi-tenant App Service (an app not in an Isolated tier), with a public internet facing endpoint. It allows traffic only from a specific subnet within your Virtual Network and blocks everything else. Use Access Restrictions to configure network Access Control Lists (IP Restrictions) to lock down allowed inbound traffic.

Define priority among the ordered allow or deny list to manage network access to your app. This list can include IP addresses or Virtual Network subnets. An implicit "deny all" rule exists at the end of the list when it contains one or more entries. This capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including, Web Apps, API Apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions. 

Use service endpoints to restrict access to your web app from an Azure Virtual Network. Limit access to a multi-tenant App Service (an app not in an Isolated tier), from selected subnets with service endpoints.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Monitors requests and responses that are sent to and from App Service apps with Security Center. Attacks against a web application can be monitored by using a real-time Application Gateway that has Web Application Firewall, enabled with integrated logging from Azure Monitor to track Web Application Firewall alerts and easily monitor trends.

- [Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Application Gateway](../web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

**Guidance**: Manage traffic for an app in an App Service Environment:

- Secure the App Service Environment as described in Locking down an App Service Environment
- Deploy an Application Gateway that has an Azure Web Application Firewall in front of your internet facing apps
- Set the app to only be accessible over HTTPS

Manage traffic for an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant App Service (not in the isolated tier): 

- Deploy an Application Gateway  that has Azure Web Application Firewall enabled in front of your internet facing apps
- Use access restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the Web Application Firewall. The access restrictions capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including Web Apps, API Apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions.

- Set the app to be accessible only over HTTPS
- Limit access to your App Service app with static IP restrictions so that it only receives traffic from the VIP on an application gateway as the only address with access.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: App Service has a number of endpoints that are used to manage the service. These endpoint addresses are also included in the AppServiceManagement IP service tag. The AppServiceManagement tag is only used with an App Service Environment to allow such traffic. 

You can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service by specifying the service tag name in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule. App Service inbound addresses are tracked in the AppService IP service tag. There is no IP service tag that contains the outbound addresses used by App Service.

Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your App Service apps. 

Maintain security configurations using Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Web" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces. Create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your App Service apps. 

Use built-in policy definitions for App Service, such as:
- The app should use a virtual network service endpoint
- The app should only be accessible over HTTPS
- Set the minimum TLS version to the current version

Review the referenced links for additional information.

- [Secure the ASE as described in Locking down an App Service](/azure/app-service/environment/firewall-integration)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for network security groups and other related resources, including traffic flow in App Service.

Specify business need, duration, and so on, with the "Description" field for any rules, which allow traffic to or from a network for individual network security groups rules.

Apply any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging effects, such as "Require tag and its value", to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of any existing untagged resources. Use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity log to monitor network resource configurations, and detect changes to network settings and to any resources related to App Service. 

Apply one of the several Azure Policy built-in definitions for App Service, such as a policy that audits apps for the use of virtual network endpoint service. Create alerts within Azure Monitor to trigger when changes to critical network settings or resources take place. 

Review detailed security alerts and recommendations in Security Center, at the portal or through programmatic tools. Export this information or send it to other monitoring tools in your environment. Tools are available to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing and continuous fashion. With these tools, you can:
 
- Continuously export to a Log Analytics workspace
- Continuously export to Azure Event Hubs (for integrations with third-party SIEMs)
- Export to a CSV file (one time)

It is recommended that you create a process with automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and quickly detect changes.

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Integrate your App Service Environment (ASE) with Azure Monitor to send logs to Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, or Log Analytics. 
Enable Azure Activity log diagnostic settings for control plane audit logging. Security alerts from Security Center are published to the Azure Activity log. Audit Azure Activity log data, which let’s you determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for Azure App Service and other Azure resources. Save your queries for future use, pin query results to Azure Dashboards, and create log alerts. Also, use the Data Access REST API in Application Insights to access your telemetry programmatically.

Use Microsoft Azure Sentinel, a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) available to connect to various data sources and connectors, based on your business requirements. You can also enable and on-board data to a third-party security information event management (SIEM) system, such as Barracuda in Azure Marketplace.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. It provides control plane access to App Service.

Generally, avoid implementing default passwords for user access when building your own apps. Use one of the identity providers available by default for App Service, such as Azure AD, Microsoft Account, Facebook, Google, or Twitter.

Disable anonymous access, unless you need to support it.

- [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service and Azure Functions](overview-authentication-authorization.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use the Identity and Access Management features in Security Center to monitor and track the number of administrative accounts. 

Use recommendations from Security Center or built-in Azure policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription. 
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

Create a process to monitor network resource configurations, and detect changes to administrative accounts.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Authenticate App Service through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It provides an OAuth 2.0 service for your identity provider and enables authorized access to mobile and web applications. 

App Service apps use federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. These identity providers are available by default:

- Azure AD
- Microsoft Account

- Facebook

- Google

- Twitter

When you enable authentication and authorization with one of these providers, its sign in endpoint is available for user authentication and for validation of authentication tokens from the provider.

## Data protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.1: Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information

**Guidance**: Use tags to assist in tracking App Service resources that store or process sensitive information.

- [How to create and use tags](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: For an App Service Environment, implement separate subscriptions, management groups, or both, for development, test, and production environments. You can Isolate apps that process sensitive information from other apps in the same manner. Deploy your App Service app into a Virtual Network. Use network security groups and subnets for further application isolation. 

There are two deployment types for an App Service environment (ASE). Both let you isolate the traffic based on your business requirements.

- External Application Service Environment - Exposes the  App Service Environment hosted apps on an internet-accessible IP address.

-  internal load balancer (ILB) Application Service Environment - Exposes the App Service Environment hosted apps on an IP address inside your Virtual Network. The internal endpoint is an internal load balancer (ILB), which is why it is called an ILB ASE. 

For the multi-tenant App Service (an app not in the Isolated tier), use Virtual Network Integration for your app's access to resources in your Virtual network.  Use private site access to make an app accessible only from a private network, such as one from within an Azure Virtual network. Virtual Network Integration is used only to make outbound calls from your app into your Virtual Network. The Virtual Network Integration feature behaves differently when it is used with a virtual network in the same region and with virtual networks in other regions.

**Responsibility**: Shared

### 4.4: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: Use the default minimum version of TLS 1.2, configured in TLS/SSL settings, for encrypting all information in transit. Also ensure that all HTTP connection requests are redirected to HTTPS.

- [Understand encryption in transit for Azure App Service web apps](security-recommendations.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.5: Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data

**Guidance**: Currently not available. Data identification, classification, and loss prevention features are not yet available for App Service. 

Tag App Service apps that may be processing sensitive information. Implement third-party solution, if necessary for compliance purposes.

Microsoft manages the underlying platform and treats all customer data as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

**Guidance**: Use role-based access control (Azure RBAC) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to control access to the App Service control plane at the Azure portal.

- [How to configure RBAC in Azure](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Web site content in an App Service app, such as files, are stored in Azure Storage, which automatically encrypts the content at rest. Choose to store application secrets in Key Vault and retrieve them at runtime.

## Data recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

**Guidance**: The Backup and Restore feature in App Service lets you easily create app backups manually or on a schedule. You can configure the backups to be retained up to an indefinite amount of time. You can restore the app to a snapshot of a previous state by overwriting the existing app or restoring to another app.

App Service can back up the following information to an Azure storage account and container, which you have configured your app to use:
- App configuration
- File content
- Database connected to your app

Ensure that regular and automated back-ups are occurring at a frequency as defined by your organizational policies.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: 
Use the backup and restore feature of App Service to backup your applications. The backup features require an Azure Storage Account to store your application's backup information.

- Azure Storage provides encryption at rest - Use system-provided keys or your own, customer-managed keys. This is where your application data is stored when it is not running in a web app in Azure.
- Running from a deployment package is a deployment feature of App Service. It allows you to deploy your site content from an Azure Storage Account using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URL.

- Key Vault references are a security feature of App Service. It allows you to import secrets at runtime as application settings. Use this to encrypt the SAS URL of your Azure Storage Account.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: App Service backups are stored within an Azure Storage account. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption is similar to BitLocker encryption on Windows.

Azure Storage encryption is enabled for all storage accounts, including both Resource Manager and classic storage accounts. Azure Storage encryption cannot be disabled. Because your data is secured by default, you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of Azure Storage encryption.

By default, data in a storage account is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your data, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. Ensure soft delete is enabled in Azure Key Vault.
