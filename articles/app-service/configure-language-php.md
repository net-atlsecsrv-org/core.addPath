# Configure a PHP app for Azure App Service

This guide shows you how to configure your PHP web apps, mobile back ends, and API apps in Azure App Service.

This guide provides key concepts and instructions for PHP developers who deploy apps to App Service. If you've never used Azure App Service, follow the [PHP quickstart](quickstart-php.md) and [PHP with MySQL tutorial](tutorial-php-mysql-app.md) first.

## Show PHP version

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

To show the current PHP version, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query phpVersion
```

To show all supported PHP versions, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp list-runtimes | grep php
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

To show the current PHP version, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query linuxFxVersion
```

To show all supported PHP versions, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp list-runtimes --linux | grep PHP
```

::: zone-end

## Set PHP version

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

Run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to set the PHP version to 7.4:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --php-version 7.4
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

Run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to set the PHP version to 7.2:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --linux-fx-version "PHP|7.2"
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

## Run Composer

If you want App Service to run [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) at deployment time, the easiest way is to include the Composer in your repository.

From a local terminal window, change directory to your repository root, and follow the instructions at [download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to download *composer.phar* to the directory root.

Run the following commands (you need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed):

```bash
npm install kuduscript -g
kuduscript --node --scriptType bash --suppressPrompt
```

Your repository root now has two additional files: *.deployment* and *deploy.sh*.

Open *deploy.sh* and find the `Deployment` section, which looks like this:

```bash
##################################################################################################################################
# Deployment
# ----------
```

Add the code section you need to run the required tool *at the end* of the `Deployment` section:

```bash
# 4. Use composer
echo "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
if [ -e "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET/composer.json" ]; then
  echo "Found composer.json"
  pushd "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
  php composer.phar install $COMPOSER_ARGS
  exitWithMessageOnError "Composer install failed"
  popd
fi
```

Commit all your changes and deploy your code using Git, or Zip deploy with build automation enabled. Composer should now be running as part of deployment automation.

## Run Grunt/Bower/Gulp

If you want App Service to run popular automation tools at deployment time, such as Grunt, Bower, or Gulp, you need to supply a [custom deployment script](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Custom-Deployment-Script). App Service runs this script when you deploy with Git, or with [Zip deployment](deploy-zip.md) with build automation enabled. 

To enable your repository to run these tools, you need to add them to the dependencies in *package.json.* For example:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "bower": "^1.7.9",
  "grunt": "^1.0.1",
  "gulp": "^3.9.1",
  ...
}
```

From a local terminal window, change directory to your repository root and run the following commands (you need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed):

```bash
npm install kuduscript -g
kuduscript --node --scriptType bash --suppressPrompt
```

Your repository root now has two additional files: *.deployment* and *deploy.sh*.

Open *deploy.sh* and find the `Deployment` section, which looks like this:

```bash
##################################################################################################################################
# Deployment
# ----------
```

This section ends with running `npm install --production`. Add the code section you need to run the required tool *at the end* of the `Deployment` section:

- [Bower](#bower)
- [Gulp](#gulp)
- [Grunt](#grunt)

See an [example in the MEAN.js sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/meanjs/blob/master/deploy.sh#L112-L135), where the deployment script also runs a custom `npm install` command.

### Bower

This snippet runs `bower install`.

```bash
if [ -e "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET/bower.json" ]; then
  cd "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
  eval ./node_modules/.bin/bower install
  exitWithMessageOnError "bower failed"
  cd - > /dev/null
fi
```

### Gulp

This snippet runs `gulp imagemin`.

```bash
if [ -e "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET/gulpfile.js" ]; then
  cd "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
  eval ./node_modules/.bin/gulp imagemin
  exitWithMessageOnError "gulp failed"
  cd - > /dev/null
fi
```

### Grunt

This snippet runs `grunt`.

```bash
if [ -e "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET/Gruntfile.js" ]; then
  cd "$DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
  eval ./node_modules/.bin/grunt
  exitWithMessageOnError "Grunt failed"
  cd - > /dev/null
fi
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

## Customize build automation

If you deploy your app using Git or zip packages with build automation turned on, the App Service build automation steps through the following sequence:

1. Run custom script if specified by `PRE_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.
1. Run `php composer.phar install`.
1. Run custom script if specified by `POST_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.

`PRE_BUILD_COMMAND` and `POST_BUILD_COMMAND` are environment variables that are empty by default. To run pre-build commands, define `PRE_BUILD_COMMAND`. To run post-build commands, define `POST_BUILD_COMMAND`.

The following example specifies the two variables to a series of commands, separated by commas.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings PRE_BUILD_COMMAND="echo foo, scripts/prebuild.sh"
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings POST_BUILD_COMMAND="echo foo, scripts/postbuild.sh"
```

For additional environment variables to customize build automation, see [Oryx configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/master/doc/configuration.md).

For more information on how App Service runs and builds PHP apps in Linux, see [Oryx documentation: How PHP apps are detected and built](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/master/doc/runtimes/php.md).

## Customize start-up

By default, the built-in PHP container runs the Apache server. At start-up, it runs `apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND"`. If you like, you can run a different command at start-up, by running the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --startup-file "<custom-command>"
```

::: zone-end

## Access environment variables

In App Service, you can [set app settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) outside of your app code. Then you can access them using the standard [getenv()](https://secure.php.net/manual/function.getenv.php) pattern. For example, to access an app setting called `DB_HOST`, use the following code:

```php
getenv("DB_HOST")
```

## Change site root

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

The web framework of your choice may use a subdirectory as the site root. For example, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), uses the *public/* subdirectory as the site root.

To customize the site root, set the virtual application path for the app by using the [`az resource update`](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-update) command. The following example sets the site root to the *public/* subdirectory in your repository. 

```azurecli-interactive
az resource update --name web --resource-group <group-name> --namespace Microsoft.Web --resource-type config --parent sites/<app-name> --set properties.virtualApplications[0].physicalPath="site\wwwroot\public" --api-version 2015-06-01
```

By default, Azure App Service points the root virtual application path (_/_) to the root directory of the deployed application files (_sites\wwwroot_).

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

The web framework of your choice may use a subdirectory as the site root. For example, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), uses the `public/` subdirectory as the site root.

The default PHP image for App Service uses Apache, and it doesn't let you customize the site root for your app. To work around this limitation, add an *.htaccess* file to your repository root with the following content:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*)
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /public/$1 [NC,L,QSA]
</IfModule>
```

If you would rather not use *.htaccess* rewrite, you can deploy your Laravel application with a [custom Docker image](quickstart-custom-container.md) instead.

::: zone-end

## Detect HTTPS session

In App Service, [SSL termination](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy) happens at the network load balancers, so all HTTPS requests reach your app as unencrypted HTTP requests. If your app logic needs to check if the user requests are encrypted or not, inspect the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header.

```php
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] === 'https') {
// Do something when HTTPS is used
}
```

Popular web frameworks let you access the `X-Forwarded-*` information in your standard app pattern. In [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/), the [is_https()](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/master/system/core/Common.php#L338-L365) checks the value of `X_FORWARDED_PROTO` by default.

## Customize php.ini settings

If you need to make changes to your PHP installation, you can change any of the [php.ini directives](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.list.php) by following these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> The best way to see the PHP version and the current *php.ini* configuration is to call [phpinfo()](https://php.net/manual/function.phpinfo.php) in your app.
>

### <a name="Customize-non-PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives"></a>Customize-non-PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

To customize PHP_INI_USER, PHP_INI_PERDIR, and PHP_INI_ALL directives (see [php.ini directives](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.list.php)), add a `.user.ini` file to the root directory of your app.

Add configuration settings to the `.user.ini` file using the same syntax you would use in a `php.ini` file. For example, if you wanted to turn on the `display_errors` setting and set `upload_max_filesize` setting to 10M, your `.user.ini` file would contain this text:

```
 ; Example Settings
 display_errors=On
 upload_max_filesize=10M

 ; Write errors to d:\home\LogFiles\php_errors.log
 ; log_errors=On
```

Redeploy your app with the changes and restart it.

As an alternative to using a `.user.ini` file, you can use [ini_set()](https://www.php.net/manual/function.ini-set.php) in your app to customize these non-PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

To customize PHP_INI_USER, PHP_INI_PERDIR, and PHP_INI_ALL directives (see [php.ini directives](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.list.php)), add an *.htaccess* file to the root directory of your app.

In the *.htaccess* file, add the directives using the `php_value <directive-name> <value>` syntax. For example:

```
php_value upload_max_filesize 1000M
php_value post_max_size 2000M
php_value memory_limit 3000M
php_value max_execution_time 180
php_value max_input_time 180
php_value display_errors On
php_value upload_max_filesize 10M
```

Redeploy your app with the changes and restart it. If you deploy it with Kudu (for example, using [Git](deploy-local-git.md)), it's automatically restarted after deployment.

As an alternative to using *.htaccess*, you can use [ini_set()](https://www.php.net/manual/function.ini-set.php) in your app to customize these non-PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives.

::: zone-end

### <a name="customize-php_ini_system-directives"></a>Customize PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

To customize PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives (see [php.ini directives](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.list.php)), you can't use the *.htaccess* approach. App Service provides a separate mechanism using the `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` app setting.

First, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to add an app setting called `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR`:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR="d:\home\site\ini"
```

Navigate to the Kudu console (`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`) and navigate to `d:\home\site`.

Create a directory in `d:\home\site` called `ini`, then create an *.ini* file in the `d:\home\site\ini` directory (for example, *settings.ini)* with the directives you want to customize. Use the same syntax you would use in a *php.ini* file. 

For example, to change the value of [expose_php](https://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.expose-php) run the following commands:

```bash
cd /home/site
mkdir ini
echo "expose_php = Off" >> ini/setting.ini
```

For the changes to take effect, restart the app.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

To customize PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives (see [php.ini directives](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.list.php)), you can't use the *.htaccess* approach. App Service provides a separate mechanism using the `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` app setting.

First, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to add an app setting called `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR`:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR="/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini"
```

`/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d` is the default directory where *php.ini* exists. `/home/site/ini` is the custom directory in which you'll add a custom *.ini* file. You separate the values with a `:`.

Navigate to the web SSH session with your Linux container (`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/webssh/host`).

Create a directory in `/home/site` called `ini`, then create an *.ini* file in the `/home/site/ini` directory (for example, *settings.ini)* with the directives you want to customize. Use the same syntax you would use in a *php.ini* file. 

> [!TIP]
> In the built-in Linux containers in App Service, */home* is used as persisted shared storage. 
>

For example, to change the value of [expose_php](https://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.expose-php) run the following commands:

```bash
cd /home/site
mkdir ini
echo "expose_php = Off" >> ini/setting.ini
```

For the changes to take effect, restart the app.

::: zone-end

## Enable PHP extensions

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

The built-in PHP installations contain the most commonly used extensions. You can enable additional extensions in the same way that you [customize php.ini directives](#customize-php_ini_system-directives).

> [!NOTE]
> The best way to see the PHP version and the current *php.ini* configuration is to call [phpinfo()](https://php.net/manual/function.phpinfo.php) in your app.
>

To enable additional extensions, by following these steps:

Add a `bin` directory to the root directory of your app and put the `.dll` extension files in it (for example, *mongodb.dll*). Make sure that the extensions are compatible with the PHP version in Azure and are VC9 and non-thread-safe (nts) compatible.

Deploy your changes.

Follow the steps in [Customize PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives](#customize-php_ini_system-directives), add the extensions into the custom *.ini* file with the [extension](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.extension) or [zend_extension](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.zend-extension) directives.

```
extension=d:\home\site\wwwroot\bin\mongodb.dll
zend_extension=d:\home\site\wwwroot\bin\xdebug.dll
```

For the changes to take effect, restart the app.

::: zone-end

To enable additional extensions, by following these steps:

Add a `bin` directory to the root directory of your app and put the `.so` extension files in it (for example, *mongodb.so*). Make sure that the extensions are compatible with the PHP version in Azure and are VC9 and non-thread-safe (nts) compatible.

Deploy your changes.

Follow the steps in [Customize PHP_INI_SYSTEM directives](#customize-php_ini_system-directives), add the extensions into the custom *.ini* file with the [extension](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.extension) or [zend_extension](https://www.php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.zend-extension) directives.

```ini
extension=/home/site/wwwroot/bin/mongodb.so
zend_extension=/home/site/wwwroot/bin/xdebug.so
```

For the changes to take effect, restart the app.

## Access diagnostic logs

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

Use the standard [error_log()](https://php.net/manual/function.error-log.php) utility to make your diagnostic logs to show up in Azure App Service.

[!INCLUDE [Access diagnostic logs](../../includes/app-service-web-logs-access-no-h.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

[!INCLUDE [Access diagnostic logs](../../includes/app-service-web-logs-access-linux-no-h.md)]

::: zone-end

## Troubleshooting

When a working PHP app behaves differently in App Service or has errors, try the following:

- [Access the log stream](#access-diagnostic-logs).
- Test the app locally in production mode. App Service runs your app in production mode, so you need to make sure that your project works as expected in production mode locally. For example:
    - Depending on your *composer.json*, different packages may be installed for production mode (`require` vs. `require-dev`).
    - Certain web frameworks may deploy static files differently in production mode.
    - Certain web frameworks may use custom startup scripts when running in production mode.
- Run your app in App Service in debug mode. For example, in [Laravel](https://meanjs.org/), you can configure your app to output debug messages in production by [setting the `APP_DEBUG` app setting to `true`](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings).
