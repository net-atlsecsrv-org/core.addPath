# SSH support for Azure App Service on Linux

[Secure Shell (SSH)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is commonly used to execute administrative commands remotely from a command-line terminal. App Service on Linux provides SSH support into the app container with each of the built-in Docker images used for the Runtime Stack of new web apps. 

![Runtime Stacks](./media/app-service-linux-ssh-support/app-service-linux-runtime-stack.png)

For custom Docker images, by configuring SSH server in your custom image.

You can also connect to the container directly from your local development machine using SSH and SFTP.

## Open SSH session in browser

[!INCLUDE [Open SSH session in browser](../../../includes/app-service-web-ssh-connect-no-h.md)]

## Use SSH support with custom Docker images

See [Configure SSH in a custom container](configure-custom-container.md#enable-ssh).

## Open SSH session from remote shell

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in Preview.

Using TCP tunneling you can create a network connection between your development machine and Web App for Containers over an authenticated WebSocket connection. It enables you to open an SSH session with your container running in App Service from the client of your choice.

To get started, you need to install [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). To see how it works without installing Azure CLI, open [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md). 

Open a remote connection to your app using the [az webapp remote-connection create](/cli/azure/ext/webapp/webapp/remote-connection?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-webapp-az-webapp-remote-connection-create) command. Specify _\<subscription-id>_, _\<group-name>_ and \_\<app-name>_ for your app.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp create-remote-connection --subscription <subscription-id> --resource-group <resource-group-name> -n <app-name> &
```

> [!TIP]
> `&` at the end of the command is just for convenience if you are using Cloud Shell. It runs the process in the background so that you can run the next command in the same shell.

The command output gives you the information you need to open an SSH session.

```
Port 21382 is open
SSH is available { username: root, password: Docker! }
Start your favorite client and connect to port 21382
```

Open an SSH session with your container with the client of your choice, using the local port. The following example uses the default [ssh](https://ss64.com/bash/ssh.html) command:

```azurecli-interactive
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p <port>
```

When being prompted, type `yes` to continue connecting. You are then prompted for the password. Use `Docker!`, which was shown to you earlier.

```
Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:21382' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@127.0.0.1's password:
```

Once you're authenticated, you should see the session welcome screen.

```

You are now connected to your connector.  

Try running the [top](https://ss64.com/bash/top.html) command. You should be able to see your app's process in the process list. In the example output below, it's the one with `PID 263`.
