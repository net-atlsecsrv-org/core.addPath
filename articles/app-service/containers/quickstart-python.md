# Create a Python app in Azure App Service on Linux

In this quickstart, you deploy a simple Python app to [App Service on Linux](app-service-linux-intro.md), which provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. You use the Azure command-line interface (the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)) through the interactive, browser-based Azure Cloud Shell, so you can follow the steps use a Mac, Linux, or Windows computer.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart:

* <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Install Python 3.7</a>
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Install Git</a>
* An Azure subscription. If you don't have one already, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

## Download the sample locally

In a terminal window, run the following commands to clone the sample application to your local machine, and navigate to the directory with the sample code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-docs-hello-world
cd python-docs-hello-world
```

The repository contains an *application.py*, which tells App Service that the repository contains a Flask app. For more information, see [Container startup process and customizations](how-to-configure-python.md).

## Run the app locally

Run the application locally so that you see how it should look when you deploy it to Azure. Open a terminal window and use the commands below to install the required dependencies and launch the built-in development server. 

```bash
# In Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
FLASK_APP=application.py flask run

# In PowerShell
py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set-Item Env:FLASK_APP ".\application.py"
flask run
```

Open a web browser, and navigate to the sample app at `http://localhost:5000/`.

You see the **Hello World!** message from the sample app displayed in the page.

![Sample app running locally](media/quickstart-python/hello-world-in-browser.png)

In your terminal window, press **Ctrl+C** to exit the web server.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Download the sample

In the Cloud Shell, create a quickstart directory and then change to it.

```bash
mkdir quickstart

cd quickstart
```

Next, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your quickstart directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-docs-hello-world
```

While running, it displays information similar to the following example:

```bash
Cloning into 'python-docs-hello-world'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 43, done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 43
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

## Create a web app

Change to the directory that contains the sample code and run the `az webapp up` command.

In the following example, replace `<app-name>` with a globally unique app name (*valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`*).

```bash
cd python-docs-hello-world

az webapp up -n <app-name>
```

This command may take a few minutes to run. While running, it displays information similar to the following example:

```json
The behavior of this command has been altered by the following extension: webapp
Creating Resource group 'appsvc_rg_Linux_CentralUS' ...
Resource group creation complete
Creating App service plan 'appsvc_asp_Linux_CentralUS' ...
App service plan creation complete
Creating app '<app-name>' ....
Webapp creation complete
Creating zip with contents of dir /home/username/quickstart/python-docs-hello-world ...
Preparing to deploy contents to app.
All done.
{
  "app_url": "https:/<app-name>.azurewebsites.net",
  "location": "Central US",
  "name": "<app-name>",
  "os": "Linux",
  "resourcegroup": "appsvc_rg_Linux_CentralUS ",
  "serverfarm": "appsvc_asp_Linux_CentralUS",
  "sku": "BASIC",
  "src_path": "/home/username/quickstart/python-docs-hello-world ",
  "version_detected": "-",
  "version_to_create": "python|3.7"
}
```

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application using your web browser.

```bash
http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The Python sample code is running in App Service on Linux with a built-in image.

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first Python app to App Service on Linux.

## Update locally and redeploy the code

In the Cloud Shell, type `code application.py` to open the Cloud Shell editor.

![Code application.py](media/quickstart-python/code-applicationpy.png)

 Make a small change to the text in the call to `return`:

```python
return "Hello Azure!"
```

Save your changes and exit the editor. Use the command `^S` to save and `^Q` to exit.

Redeploy the app using the [`az webapp up`](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-up) command. Substitute the name of your app for `<app-name>`, and specify a location for `<location-name>` (using one of the values shown from the [`az account list-locations`](/cli/azure/appservice?view=azure-cli-latest.md#az-appservice-list-locations) command).

```bash
az webapp up -n <app-name> -l <location-name>
```

Once deployment has completed, switch back to the browser window that opened in the **Browse to the app** step, and refresh the page.

## Manage your new Azure app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the app you created.

From the left menu, click **App Services**, and then click the name of your Azure app.

![Portal navigation to Azure app](./media/quickstart-python/app-service-list.png)

You see your app's Overview page. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

The left menu provides different pages for configuring your app.
