# Quickstart: Create a Python app in Azure App Service on Linux

In this quickstart, you deploy a Python web app to [App Service on Linux](app-service-linux-intro.md), Azure's highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. You use the local [Azure command-line interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on a Mac, Linux, or Windows computer. The web app you configure uses a free App Service tier, so you incur no costs in the course of this article.

If you prefer to deploy apps through an IDE, see [Deploy Python apps to App Service from Visual Studio Code](/azure/python/tutorial-deploy-app-service-on-linux-01).

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio)
- <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a> (Python 3.6 is also supported)
- <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a>
- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli" target="_blank">Azure CLI</a> 2.0.80 or higher. Run `az --version` to check your version.

## Download the sample

In a terminal window, run the following command to clone the sample application to your local computer. 

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-docs-hello-world
```

Then go into that folder:

```terminal
cd python-docs-hello-world
```

The repository contains an *application.py* file, which tells App Service that the code contains a Flask app. For more information, see [Container startup process and customizations](how-to-configure-python.md).

## Run the sample

In a terminal window, use the commands below (as appropriate for your operating system) to install the required dependencies and launch the built-in development server. 

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=application.py
flask run
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set-Item Env:FLASK_APP ".\application.py"
flask run
```

# [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
SET FLASK_APP=application.py
flask run
```

---

Open a web browser, and go to the sample app at `http://localhost:5000/`. The app displays the message **Hello World!**.

![Run a sample Python app locally](./media/quickstart-python/run-hello-world-sample-python-app-in-browser-localhost.png)

In your terminal window, press **Ctrl**+**C** to exit the web server.

## Sign in to Azure

The Azure CLI provides you with many convenient commands that you use from a local terminal to provision and manage Azure resources from the command line. You can use commands to complete the same tasks that you would through the Azure portal in a browser. You can also use CLI commands in scripts to automate management processes.

To run Azure commands in the Azure CLI, you must first sign in using the `az login` command. This command opens a browser to gather your credentials.

```azurecli
az login
```

## Deploy the sample

The [`az webapp up`](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-up) command creates the web app on App Service and deploys your code.

In the *python-docs-hello-world* folder that contains the sample code, run the following `az webapp up` command. Replace  `<app-name>` with a globally unique app name (*valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`*).


```azurecli
az webapp up --sku F1 -n <app-name>
```

The `--sku F1` argument creates the web app on the Free pricing tier. You can omit this argument to use a premium tier instead, which incurs an hourly cost.

You can optionally include the argument `-l <location-name>` where `<location_name>` is an Azure region such as **centralus**, **eastasia**, **westeurope**, **koreasouth**, **brazilsouth**, **centralindia**, and so on. You can retrieve a list of allowable regions for your Azure account by running the [`az account list-locations`](/cli/azure/appservice?view=azure-cli-latest.md#az-appservice-list-locations) command.

The `az webapp up` command may take a few minutes to completely run. While running, it displays information similar to the following example, where `<app-name>` will be the name you provided earlier:

<pre>
Creating Resource group 'appsvc_rg_Linux_centralus' ...
Resource group creation complete
Creating App service plan 'appsvc_asp_Linux_centralus' ...
App service plan creation complete
Creating app '&lt;app-name&gt;' ....
Configuring default logging for the app, if not already enabled
Creating zip with contents of dir D:\Examples\python-docs-hello-world ...
Getting scm site credentials for zip deployment
Starting zip deployment. This operation can take a while to complete ...
Deployment endpoint responded with status code 202
You can launch the app at http://&lt;app-name&gt;.azurewebsites.net
{
  "URL": "http://&lt;app-name&gt;.net",
  "appserviceplan": "appsvc_asp_Linux_centralus",
  "location": "eastus",
  "name": "&lt;app-name&gt;",
  "os": "Linux",
  "resourcegroup": "appsvc_rg_Linux_centralus",
  "runtime_version": "python|3.7",
  "runtime_version_detected": "-",
  "sku": "FREE",
  "src_path": "D:\\Examples\\python-docs-hello-world"
}
</pre>

[!INCLUDE [AZ Webapp Up Note](../../../includes/app-service-web-az-webapp-up-note.md)]

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application in your web browser at the URL `http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`.

The Python sample code is running a Linux container in App Service using a built-in image.

![Run a sample Python app in Azure](./media/quickstart-python/run-hello-world-sample-python-app-in-browser.png)

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your Python app to App Service on Linux.

## Redeploy updates

In your favorite code editor, open *application.py* and update the `hello` function as follows. This change adds a `print` statement to generate logging output that you work with in the next section. 

```python
def hello():
    print("Handling request to home page.")
    return "Hello Azure!"
```

Save your changes and exit the editor. 

Redeploy the app using the `az webapp up` command again:

```azurecli
az webapp up
```

This command uses values that are cached in the *.azure/config* file, including the app name, resource group, and App Service plan.

Once deployment has completed, switch back to the browser window open to `http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net` and refresh the page, which should display the modified message:

![Run an updated sample Python app in Azure](./media/quickstart-python/run-updated-hello-world-sample-python-app-in-browser.png)

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio Code provides powerful extensions for Python and Azure App Service, which simplify the process of deploying Python web apps to App Service. For more information, see [Deploy Python apps to App Service from Visual Studio Code](/azure/python/tutorial-deploy-app-service-on-linux-01).

## Stream logs

You can access the console logs generated from inside the app and the container in which it runs. Logs include any output generated using `print` statements.

To stream logs, run the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp log tail
```

Refresh the app in the browser to generate console logs, which should include lines similar to the following text. If you don't see output immediately, try again in 30 seconds.

<pre>
2020-04-03T22:54:04.236405938Z Handling request to home page.
2020-04-03T22:54:04.236497641Z 172.16.0.1 - - [03/Apr/2020:22:54:04 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 12 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.83 Safari/537.36 Edg/81.0.416.41"
</pre>

You can also inspect the log files from the browser at `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker`.

To stop log streaming at any time, type `Ctrl`+`C`.

## Manage the Azure app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the app you created. Search for and select **App Services**.

![Navigate to App Services in the Azure portal](./media/quickstart-python/navigate-to-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

Select the name of your Azure app.

![Navigate to your Python app in App Services in the Azure portal](./media/quickstart-python/navigate-to-app-in-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

You see your app's Overview page. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

![Manage your Python app in the Overview page in the Azure portal](./media/quickstart-python/manage-an-app-in-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

The App Service menu provides different pages for configuring your app.

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. The resource group has a name like "appsvc_rg_Linux_CentralUS" depending on your location. If you use an App Service SKU other than the free F1 tier, these resources incur ongoing costs (see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)).

If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete the resource group by running the following command, replacing `<resource-group-name>` with the resource group shown in the output of the `az webapp up` command, such as "appsvc_rg_Linux_centralus". The command may take a minute to complete.

```azurecli
az group delete -n <resource-group-name>
```
