# Viewing Logs

In this step, you learn how to view (or "tail") the logs from the running website. Any calls to `console.log` in the site are displayed in the Output panel in Visual Studio Code.

Find the app in the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer, right-click the app, and choose **View Streaming Logs**.

When prompted, choose to enable logging and restart the application. Once the app is restarted, the VS Code Output panel opens with a connection to the log stream.

![Enable Logging and Restart](./media/tutorial-javascript-vscode/enable-restart.png)

After a few seconds, you'll see a message indicating that you're connected to the log-streaming service.

```bash
Connecting to log-streaming service...

2017-12-21 17:33:56.500 INFO  - Container logs
```

Refresh the page a few times in the browser to see log output.

```bash
