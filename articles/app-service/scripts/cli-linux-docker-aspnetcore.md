# Create an ASP.NET Core app in a Docker container from Docker Hub using Azure CLI

This sample script creates a resource group, a Linux App Service plan, and an app. It then deploys an ASP.NET Core application using a Docker Container.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/deploy-linux-docker/deploy-linux-docker.sh?highlight=6 "Linux Docker")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, App Service app, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [`az appservice plan create`](/cli/azure/appservice/plan?view=azure-cli-latest#az-appservice-plan-create) | Creates an App Service plan. |
| [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-create) | Creates an App Service app. |
| [`az webapp config container set`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/container?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-container-set) | Sets the Docker container for the App Service app. |
