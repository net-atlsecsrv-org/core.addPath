# Scale an App Service app manually using Azure CLI

This sample script creates a resource group, an App Service plan, and an app. It then scales the App Service plan from a single instance to multiple instances.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
