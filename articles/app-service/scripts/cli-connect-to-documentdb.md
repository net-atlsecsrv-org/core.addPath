# Connect an App Service app to Cosmos DB using CLI

This sample script creates an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB and an App Service app. It then links a MongoDB connection string to the web app using app settings.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/connect-to-documentdb/connect-to-documentdb.sh "Azure Cosmos DB")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, App Service app, Cosmos DB, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
