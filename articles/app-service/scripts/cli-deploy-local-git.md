# Create an App Service app and deploy code from a local Git repository using Azure CLI

This sample script creates an app in App Service with its related resources, and then deploys your app code in a local Git repository.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
