# Create an App Service app and deploy files with FTP using Azure CLI

This sample script creates an app in App Service with its related resources, and then deploys a static HTML page using FTP. For FTP upload, the script uses [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) as an example. You can use whatever FTP tool to upload your files.
