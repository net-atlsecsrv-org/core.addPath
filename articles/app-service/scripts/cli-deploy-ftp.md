# Create an App Service app and deploy files with FTP using Azure CLI

This sample script creates an app in App Service with its related resources, and then deploys a static HTML page using FTP. For FTP upload, the script uses [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) as an example. You can use whatever FTP tool to upload your files.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
