# Scale an App Service app worldwide with a high-availability architecture using Azure CLI

This sample script creates a resource group, two App Service plans, two apps, a traffic manager profile, and two traffic manager endpoints. Once the exercise is complete, you have a high-available architecture, which provides global availability of your app based on the lowest network latency.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/scale-geographic/scale-geographic.sh "Geographic Scale")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]
