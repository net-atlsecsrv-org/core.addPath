# Scale an App Service app worldwide with a high-availability architecture using Azure CLI

This sample script creates a resource group, two App Service plans, two apps, a traffic manager profile, and two traffic manager endpoints. Once the exercise is complete, you have a high-available architecture, which provides global availability of your app based on the lowest network latency.

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
