# Integrate App Service with Application Gateway using CLI

This sample script creates an Azure App Service web app, an Azure Virtual Network and an Application Gateway. It then restricts the traffic for the web app to only originate from the Application Gateway subnet.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0.74 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/integrate-with-app-gateway/integrate-with-app-gateway.sh "Integrate with Application Gateway")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]
