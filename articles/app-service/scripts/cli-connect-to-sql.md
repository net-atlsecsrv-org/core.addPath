# Connect an App Service app to a SQL database using CLI

This sample script creates an Azure SQL database and an App Service app. It then links the SQL database to the app using app settings.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/connect-to-sql/connect-to-sql.sh?highlight=9-10 "SQL Database")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]
