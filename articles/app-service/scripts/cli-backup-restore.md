# Restore a web app from a backup using CLI

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then creates a one-time backup for it. 

To run this script, you need an existing backup for a web app. To create one, see [Backup up a web app](cli-backup-onetime.md) or [Create a scheduled backup for a web app](cli-backup-scheduled.md).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/backup-restore/backup-restore.sh?highlight=3-4,9 "Restore a web app from a backup")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
