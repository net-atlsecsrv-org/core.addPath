# Create an App Service app with deployment from GitHub using Azure CLI

This sample script creates an app in App Service with its related resources. It then deploys your app code from a public GitHub repository (without continuous deployment). For GitHub deployment with continuous deployment, see [Create an app with continuous deployment from GitHub](cli-continuous-deployment-github.md).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/deploy-github/deploy-github.sh?highlight=3 "Create an app with deployment from GitHub")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation 

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [`az appservice plan create`](/cli/azure/appservice/plan?view=azure-cli-latest#az-appservice-plan-create) | Creates an App Service plan. |
| [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-create) | Creates an App Service app. |
| [`az webapp deployment source config`](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment/source?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-deployment-source-config) | Associates an App Service app with a Git or Mercurial repository. |
