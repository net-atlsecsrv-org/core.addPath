# Create an ASP.NET Core app in a Docker container in App Service from Azure Container Registry

This sample script creates a resource group, a Linux App Service plan, and an app. It then deploys an ASP.NET Core application using a Docker Container from the Azure Container Registry.


[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

You need Azure CLI version 2.0.52 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/deploy-linux-acr/deploy-linux-acr.sh "Linux Azure Container Registry")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, App Service app, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [`az appservice plan create`](/cli/azure/appservice/plan?view=azure-cli-latest#az-appservice-plan-create) | Creates an App Service plan. |
| [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-create) | Creates an App Service app. |
| [`az webapp config container set`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/container?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-container-set) | Sets the Docker container for the App Service app. |
