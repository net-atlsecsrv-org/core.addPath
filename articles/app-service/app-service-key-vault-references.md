# Use Key Vault references for App Service and Azure Functions

This topic shows you how to work with secrets from Azure Key Vault in your App Service or Azure Functions application without requiring any code changes. [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md) is a service that provides centralized secrets management, with full control over access policies and audit history.

## Granting your app access to Key Vault

In order to read secrets from Key Vault, you need to have a vault created and give your app permission to access it.

1. Create a key vault by following the [Key Vault quickstart](../key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli.md).

1. Create a [system-assigned managed identity](overview-managed-identity.md) for your application.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > Key Vault references currently only support system-assigned managed identities. User-assigned identities cannot be used.

1. Create an [access policy in Key Vault](../key-vault/general/security-features.md#privileged-access) for the application identity you created earlier. Enable the "Get" secret permission on this policy. Do not configure the "authorized application" or `applicationId` settings, as this is not compatible with a managed identity.

### Access network-restricted vaults

> [!NOTE]
> Linux-based applications are not presently able to resolve secrets from a network-restricted key vault unless the app is hosted within an [App Service Environment](./environment/intro.md).

If your vault is configured with [network restrictions](../key-vault/general/overview-vnet-service-endpoints.md), you will also need to ensure that the application has network access.

1. Make sure the application has outbound networking capabilities configured, as described in [App Service networking features](./networking-features.md) and [Azure Functions networking options](../azure-functions/functions-networking-options.md).

2. Make sure that the vault's configuration accounts for the network or subnet through which your app will access it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Accessing a vault through virtual network integration is currently incompatible with [automatic updates for secrets without a specified version](#rotation).

## Reference syntax

A Key Vault reference is of the form `@Microsoft.KeyVault({referenceString})`, where `{referenceString}` is replaced by one of the following options:

> [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]
> | Reference string                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
> |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | SecretUri=_secretUri_                                                       | The **SecretUri** should be the full data-plane URI of a secret in Key Vault, optionally including a version, e.g., `https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/` or `https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/ec96f02080254f109c51a1f14cdb1931`  |
> | VaultName=_vaultName_;SecretName=_secretName_;SecretVersion=_secretVersion_ | The **VaultName** is required and should the name of your Key Vault resource. The **SecretName** is required and should be the name of the target secret. The **SecretVersion** is optional but if present indicates the version of the secret to use. |

For example, a complete reference would look like the following:

```
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/)
```

Alternatively:

```
@Microsoft.KeyVault(VaultName=myvault;SecretName=mysecret)
```

## Rotation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Accessing a vault through virtual network integration](#access-network-restricted-vaults) is currently incompatible with automatic updates for secrets without a specified version.

If a version is not specified in the reference, then the app will use the latest version that exists in Key Vault. When newer versions become available, such as with a rotation event, the app will automatically update and begin using the latest version within one day. Any configuration changes made to the app will cause an immediate update to the latest versions of all referenced secrets.

## Source Application Settings from Key Vault

Key Vault references can be used as values for [Application Settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings), allowing you to keep secrets in Key Vault instead of the site config. Application Settings are securely encrypted at rest, but if you need secret management capabilities, they should go into Key Vault.

To use a Key Vault reference for an application setting, set the reference as the value of the setting. Your app can reference the secret through its key as normal. No code changes are required.

> [!TIP]
> Most application settings using Key Vault references should be marked as slot settings, as you should have separate vaults for each environment.

### Considerations for Azure Files mounting

Apps can use the `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING` application setting to mount Azure Files as the file system. This setting has additional validation checks to ensure that the app can be properly started. The platform relies on having a content share within Azure Files, and it assumes a default name unless one is specified via the `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` setting. For any requests which modify these settings, the platform will attempt to validate if this content share exists, and it will attempt to create it if not. If it cannot locate or create the content share, the request is blocked.

When using Key Vault references for this setting, this validation check will fail by default, as the secret itself cannot be resolved while processing the incoming request. To avoid this issue, you can skip the validation by setting `WEBSITE_SKIP_CONTENTSHARE_VALIDATION` to "1". This will bypass all checks, and the content share will not be created for you. You should ensure it is created in advance. 

> [!CAUTION]
> If you skip validation and either the connection string or content share are invalid, the app will be unable to start properly and will only serve HTTP 500 errors.

As part of creating the site, it is also possible that attempted mounting of the content share could fail due to managed identity permissions not being propagated or the virtual network integration not being set up. You can defer setting up Azure Files until later in the deployment template to accommodate this. See [Azure Resource Manager deployment](#azure-resource-manager-deployment) to learn more. App Service will use a default file system until Azure Files is set up, and files are not copied over, so you will need to ensure that no deployment attempts occur during the interim period before Azure Files is mounted.

### Azure Resource Manager deployment

When automating resource deployments through Azure Resource Manager templates, you may need to sequence your dependencies in a particular order to make this feature work. Of note, you will need to define your application settings as their own resource, rather than using a `siteConfig` property in the site definition. This is because the site needs to be defined first so that the system-assigned identity is created with it and can be used in the access policy.

An example pseudo-template for a function app might look like the following:

```json
{
    //...
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
            "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
            //...
        },
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Insights/components",
            "name": "[variables('appInsightsName')]",

> [!NOTE] 
> In this example, the source control deployment depends on the application settings. This is normally unsafe behavior, as the app setting update behaves asynchronously. However, because we have included the `WEBSITE_ENABLE_SYNC_UPDATE_SITE` application setting, the update is synchronous. This means that the source control deployment will only begin once the application settings have been fully updated.

## Troubleshooting Key Vault References

If a reference is not resolved properly, the reference value will be used instead. This means that for application settings, an environment variable would be created whose value has the `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)` syntax. This may cause the application to throw errors, as it was expecting a secret of a certain structure.

Most commonly, this is due to a misconfiguration of the [Key Vault access policy](#granting-your-app-access-to-key-vault). However, it could also be due to a secret no longer existing or a syntax error in the reference itself.

If the syntax is correct, you can view other causes for error by checking the current resolution status in the portal. Navigate to Application Settings and select "Edit" for the reference in question. Below the setting configuration, you should see status information, including any errors. The absence of these implies that the reference syntax is invalid.

You can also use one of the built-in detectors to get additional information.

### Using the detector for App Service

1. In the portal, navigate to your app.
2. Select **Diagnose and solve problems**.
3. Choose **Availability and Performance** and select **Web app down.**
