# Configure a Java app for Azure App Service

Azure App Service lets Java developers to quickly build, deploy, and scale their Java SE, Tomcat, and JBoss EAP web applications on a fully managed service. Deploy applications with Maven plugins, from the command line, or in editors like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

This guide provides key concepts and instructions for Java developers using App Service. If you've never used Azure App Service, you should read through the [Java quickstart](quickstart-java.md) first. General questions about using App Service that aren't specific to Java development are answered in the [App Service FAQ](faq-configuration-and-management.md).

## Deploying your app

You can use [Azure Web App Plugin for Maven](/java/api/overview/azure/maven/azure-webapp-maven-plugin/readme) to deploy your .war or .jar files. Deployment with popular IDEs is also supported with the [Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ](/azure/developer/java/toolkit-for-intellij/) or [Azure Toolkit for Eclipse](/azure/developer/java/toolkit-for-eclipse).

Otherwise, your deployment method will depend on your archive type:

### Java SE

To deploy .jar files to Java SE, use the `/api/zipdeploy/` endpoint of the Kudu site. For more information on this API, please see [this documentation](./deploy-zip.md#rest).

### Tomcat

To deploy .war files to Tomcat, use the `/api/wardeploy/` endpoint to POST your archive file. For more information on this API, please see [this documentation](./deploy-zip.md#deploy-war-file).

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

### JBoss EAP

To deploy .war files to JBoss, use the `/api/wardeploy/` endpoint to POST your archive file. For more information on this API, please see [this documentation](./deploy-zip.md#deploy-war-file).

To deploy .ear files, [use FTP](deploy-ftp.md).

::: zone-end

Do not deploy your .war or .jar using FTP. The FTP tool is designed to upload startup scripts, dependencies, or other runtime files. It is not the optimal choice for deploying web apps.

## Logging and debugging apps

Performance reports, traffic visualizations, and health checkups are available for each app through the Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure App Service diagnostics overview](overview-diagnostics.md).

### Stream diagnostic logs

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"

[!INCLUDE [Access diagnostic logs](../../includes/app-service-web-logs-access-no-h.md)]

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

[!INCLUDE [Access diagnostic logs](../../includes/app-service-web-logs-access-linux-no-h.md)]

::: zone-end

For more information, see [Stream logs in Cloud Shell](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#in-cloud-shell).

### SSH console access

[!INCLUDE [Open SSH session in browser](../../includes/app-service-web-ssh-connect-builtin-no-h.md)]

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

### Troubleshooting tools

The built-in Java images are based on the [Alpine Linux](https://alpine-linux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) operating system. Use the `apk` package manager to install any troubleshooting tools or commands.

::: zone-end

### Flight Recorder

All Java runtimes on App Service using the Azul JVMs come with the Zulu Flight Recorder. You can use this to record JVM, system, and application events and troubleshoot problems in your Java applications.

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"

#### Timed Recording

To take a timed recording you will need the PID (Process ID) of the Java application. To find the PID, open a browser to your web app's SCM site at https://<your-site-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/ProcessExplorer/. This page shows the running processes in your web app. Find the process named "java" in the table and copy the corresponding PID (Process ID).

Next, open the **Debug Console** in the top toolbar of the SCM site and run the following command. Replace `<pid>` with the process ID you copied earlier. This command will start a 30 second profiler recording of your Java application and generate a file named `timed_recording_example.jfr` in the `D:\home` directory.

```
jcmd <pid> JFR.start name=TimedRecording settings=profile duration=30s filename="D:\home\timed_recording_example.JFR"
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

SSH into your App Service and run the `jcmd` command to see a list of all the Java processes running. In addition to jcmd itself, you should see your Java application running with a process ID number (pid).

```shell
078990bbcd11:/home# jcmd
Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
147 sun.tools.jcmd.JCmd
116 /home/site/wwwroot/app.jar
```

Execute the command below to start a 30-second recording of the JVM. This will profile the JVM and create a JFR file named *jfr_example.jfr* in the home directory. (Replace 116 with the pid of your Java app.)

```shell
jcmd 116 JFR.start name=MyRecording settings=profile duration=30s filename="/home/jfr_example.jfr"
```

During the 30 second interval, you can validate the recording is taking place by running `jcmd 116 JFR.check`. This will show all recordings for the given Java process.

#### Continuous Recording

You can use Zulu Flight Recorder to continuously profile your Java application with minimal impact on runtime performance ([source](https://assets.azul.com/files/Zulu-Mission-Control-data-sheet-31-Mar-19.pdf)). To do so, run the following Azure CLI command to create an App Setting named JAVA_OPTS with the necessary configuration. The contents of the JAVA_OPTS App Setting are passed to the `java` command when your app is started.

```azurecli
az webapp config appsettings set -g <your_resource_group> -n <your_app_name> --settings JAVA_OPTS=-XX:StartFlightRecording=disk=true,name=continuous_recording,dumponexit=true,maxsize=1024m,maxage=1d
```

Once the recording has started, you can dump the current recording data at any time using the `JFR.dump` command.

```shell
jcmd <pid> JFR.dump name=continuous_recording filename="/home/recording1.jfr"
```

::: zone-end

#### Analyze `.jfr` files

Use [FTPS](deploy-ftp.md) to download your JFR file to your local machine. To analyze the JFR file, download and install [Zulu Mission Control](https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-mission-control/). For instructions on Zulu Mission Control, see the [Azul documentation](https://docs.azul.com/zmc/) and the [installation instructions](/java/azure/jdk/java-jdk-flight-recorder-and-mission-control).

### App logging

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"

Enable [application logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#enable-application-logging-windows) through the Azure portal or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/webapp/log#az-webapp-log-config) to configure App Service to write your application's standard console output and standard console error streams to the local filesystem or Azure Blob Storage. Logging to the local App Service filesystem instance is disabled 12 hours after it is configured. If you need longer retention, configure the application to write output to a Blob storage container. Your Java and Tomcat app logs can be found in the */home/LogFiles/Application/* directory.

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

Enable [application logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#enable-application-logging-linuxcontainer) through the Azure portal or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/webapp/log#az-webapp-log-config) to configure App Service to write your application's standard console output and standard console error streams to the local filesystem or Azure Blob Storage. If you need longer retention, configure the application to write output to a Blob storage container. Your Java and Tomcat app logs can be found in the */home/LogFiles/Application/* directory.

Azure Blob Storage logging for Linux based App Services can only be configured using [Azure Monitor (preview)](./troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#send-logs-to-azure-monitor-preview) 

::: zone-end

If your application uses [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) or [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j) for tracing, you can forward these traces for review into Azure Application Insights using the logging framework configuration instructions in [Explore Java trace logs in Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/java-trace-logs.md).

## Customization and tuning

Azure App Service for Linux supports out of the box tuning and customization through the Azure portal and CLI. Review the following articles for non-Java-specific web app configuration:

- [Configure app settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings)
- [Set up a custom domain](app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain.md)
- [Configure SSL bindings](configure-ssl-bindings.md)
- [Add a CDN](../cdn/cdn-add-to-web-app.md)
- [Configure the Kudu site](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Configurable-settings#linux-on-app-service-settings)


### Set Java runtime options

To set allocated memory or other JVM runtime options, create an [app setting](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) named `JAVA_OPTS` with the options. App Service passes this setting as an environment variable to the Java runtime when it starts.

In the Azure portal, under **Application Settings** for the web app, create a new app setting named `JAVA_OPTS` that includes the additional settings, such as `-Xms512m -Xmx1204m`.

To configure the app setting from the Maven plugin, add setting/value tags in the Azure plugin section. The following example sets a specific minimum and maximum Java heap size:

```xml
<appSettings>
    <property>
        <name>JAVA_OPTS</name>
        <value>-Xms512m -Xmx1204m</value>
    </property>
</appSettings>
```

Developers running a single application with one deployment slot in their App Service plan can use the following options:

- B1 and S1 instances: `-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m`
- B2 and S2 instances: `-Xms3072m -Xmx3072m`
- B3 and S3 instances: `-Xms6144m -Xmx6144m`

When tuning application heap settings, review your App Service plan details and take into account multiple applications and deployment slot needs to find the optimal allocation of memory.

### Turn on web sockets

Turn on support for web sockets in the Azure portal in the **Application settings** for the application. You'll need to restart the application for the setting to take effect.

Turn on web socket support using the Azure CLI with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --web-sockets-enabled true
```

Then restart your application:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp stop --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
az webapp start --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

### Set default character encoding

In the Azure portal, under **Application Settings** for the web app, create a new app setting named `JAVA_OPTS` with value `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`.

Alternatively, you can configure the app setting using the App Service Maven plugin. Add the setting name and value tags in the plugin configuration:

```xml
<appSettings>
    <property>
        <name>JAVA_OPTS</name>
        <value>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</value>
    </property>
</appSettings>
```

### Pre-Compile JSP files

To improve performance of Tomcat applications, you can compile your JSP files before deploying to App Service. You can use the [Maven plugin](https://sling.apache.org/components/jspc-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html) provided by Apache Sling, or using this [Ant build file](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/jasper-howto.html#Web_Application_Compilation).

## Secure applications

Java applications running in App Service have the same set of [security best practices](../security/fundamentals/paas-applications-using-app-services.md) as other applications.

### Authenticate users (Easy Auth)

Set up app authentication in the Azure portal with the **Authentication and Authorization** option. From there, you can enable authentication using Azure Active Directory or social logins like Facebook, Google, or GitHub. Azure portal configuration only works when configuring a single authentication provider. For more information, see [Configure your App Service app to use Azure Active Directory login](configure-authentication-provider-aad.md) and the related articles for other identity providers. If you need to enable multiple sign-in providers, follow the instructions in the [customize App Service authentication](app-service-authentication-how-to.md) article.

#### Java SE

Spring Boot developers can use the [Azure Active Directory Spring Boot starter](/java/azure/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-active-directory) to secure applications using familiar Spring Security annotations and APIs. Be sure to increase the maximum header size in your *application.properties* file. We suggest a value of `16384`.

#### Tomcat

Your Tomcat application can access the user's claims directly from the servlet by casting the Principal object to a Map object. The Map object will map each claim type to a collection of the claims for that type. In the code below, `request` is an instance of `HttpServletRequest`.

```java
Map<String, Collection<String>> map = (Map<String, Collection<String>>) request.getUserPrincipal();
```

Now you can inspect the `Map` object for any specific claim. For example, the following code snippet iterates through all the claim types and prints the contents of each collection.

```java
for (Object key : map.keySet()) {
        Object value = map.get(key);
        if (value != null && value instanceof Collection {
            Collection claims = (Collection) value;
            for (Object claim : claims) {
                System.out.println(claims);
            }
        }
    }
```

To sign users out, use the `/.auth/ext/logout` path. To perform other actions, please see the documentation on [App Service Authentication and Authorization usage](./app-service-authentication-how-to.md). There is also official documentation on the Tomcat [HttpServletRequest interface](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html) and its methods. The following servlet methods are also hydrated based on your App Service configuration:

```java
public boolean isSecure()
public String getRemoteAddr()
public String getRemoteHost()
public String getScheme()
public int getServerPort()
```

To disable this feature, create an Application Setting named `WEBSITE_AUTH_SKIP_PRINCIPAL` with a value of `1`. To disable all servlet filters added by App Service, create a setting named `WEBSITE_SKIP_FILTERS` with a value of `1`.

### Configure TLS/SSL

Follow the instructions in the [Secure a custom DNS name with an SSL binding in Azure App Service](configure-ssl-bindings.md) to upload an existing SSL certificate and bind it to your application's domain name. By default your application will still allow HTTP connections-follow the specific steps in the tutorial to enforce SSL and TLS.

### Use KeyVault References

[Azure KeyVault](../key-vault/general/overview.md) provides centralized secret management with access policies and audit history. You can store secrets (such as passwords or connection strings) in KeyVault and access these secrets in your application through environment variables.

First, follow the instructions for [granting your app access to Key Vault](app-service-key-vault-references.md#granting-your-app-access-to-key-vault) and [making a KeyVault reference to your secret in an Application Setting](app-service-key-vault-references.md#reference-syntax). You can validate that the reference resolves to the secret by printing the environment variable while remotely accessing the App Service terminal.

To inject these secrets in your Spring or Tomcat configuration file, use environment variable injection syntax (`${MY_ENV_VAR}`). For Spring configuration files, please see this documentation on [externalized configurations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html).

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

### Use the Java Key Store

By default, any public or private certificates [uploaded to App Service Linux](configure-ssl-certificate.md) will be loaded into the respective Java Key Stores as the container starts. After uploading your certificate, you will need to restart your App Service for it to be loaded into the Java Key Store. Public certificates are loaded into the Key Store at `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`, and private certificates are stored in `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/client.jks`.

Additional configuration may be necessary for encrypting your JDBC connection with certificates in the Java Key Store. Please refer to the documentation for your chosen JDBC driver.

- [PostgreSQL](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/ssl-client.html)
- [SQL Server](/sql/connect/jdbc/connecting-with-ssl-encryption)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/5.1/en/connector-j-reference-using-ssl.html)
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.4/driver/tutorials/ssl/)
- [Cassandra](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.3/)

#### Initialize the Java Key Store

To initialize the `import java.security.KeyStore` object, load the keystore file with the password. The default password for both key stores is "changeit".

```java
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("jks");
keyStore.load(
    new FileInputStream(System.getenv("JAVA_HOME")+"/lib/security/cacets"),
    "changeit".toCharArray());

KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("pkcs12");
keyStore.load(
    new FileInputStream(System.getenv("JAVA_HOME")+"/lib/security/client.jks"),
    "changeit".toCharArray());
```

#### Manually load the key store

You can load certificates manually to the key store. Create an app setting, `SKIP_JAVA_KEYSTORE_LOAD`, with a value of `1` to disable App Service from loading the certificates into the key store automatically. All public certificates uploaded to App Service via the Azure portal are stored under `/var/ssl/certs/`. Private certificates are stored under `/var/ssl/private/`.

You can interact or debug the Java Key Tool by [opening an SSH connection](configure-linux-open-ssh-session.md) to your App Service and running the command `keytool`. See the [Key Tool documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html) for a list of commands. For more information on the KeyStore API, please refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.html).

## Configure data sources

### Java SE

To connect to data sources in Spring Boot applications, we suggest creating connection strings and injecting them into your *application.properties* file.

1. In the "Configuration" section of the App Service page, set a name for the string, paste your JDBC connection string into the value field, and set the type to "Custom". You can optionally set this connection string as slot setting.

    This connection string is accessible to our application as an environment variable named `CUSTOMCONNSTR_<your-string-name>`. For example, the connection string we created above will be named `CUSTOMCONNSTR_exampledb`.

2. In your *application.properties* file, reference this connection string with the environment variable name. For our example, we would use the following.

    ```yml
    app.datasource.url=${CUSTOMCONNSTR_exampledb}
    ```

Please see the [Spring Boot documentation on data access](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-data-access.html) and [externalized configurations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) for more information on this topic.

### Tomcat

These instructions apply to all database connections. You will need to fill placeholders with your chosen database's driver class name and JAR file. Provided is a table with class names and driver downloads for common databases.

| Database   | Driver Class Name                             | JDBC Driver                                                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | `org.postgresql.Driver`                        | [Download](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)                                    |
| MySQL      | `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`                        | [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) (Select "Platform Independent") |
| SQL Server | `com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver` | [Download](/sql/connect/jdbc/download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017#download)                                                           |

To configure Tomcat to use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or the Java Persistence API (JPA), first customize the `CATALINA_OPTS` environment variable that is read in by Tomcat at start-up. Set these values through an app setting in the [App Service Maven plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/blob/develop/azure-webapp-maven-plugin/README.md):

```xml
<appSettings>
    <property>
        <name>CATALINA_OPTS</name>
        <value>"$CATALINA_OPTS -Ddbuser=${DBUSER} -Ddbpassword=${DBPASSWORD} -DconnURL=${CONNURL}"</value>
    </property>
</appSettings>
```

Or set the environment variables in the **Configuration** > **Application Settings** page in the Azure portal.

Next, determine if the data source should be available to one application or to all applications running on the Tomcat servlet.

#### Application-level data sources

1. Create a *context.xml* file in the *META-INF/* directory of your project. Create the *META-INF/* directory if it does not exist.

2. In *context.xml*, add a `Context` element to link the data source to a JNDI address. Replace the `driverClassName` placeholder with your driver's class name from the table above.

    ```xml
    <Context>
        <Resource
            name="jdbc/dbconnection"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource"
            url="${dbuser}"
            driverClassName="<insert your driver class name>"
            username="${dbpassword}"
            password="${connURL}"
        />
    </Context>
    ```

3. Update your application's *web.xml* to use the data source in your application.

    ```xml
    <resource-env-ref>
        <resource-env-ref-name>jdbc/dbconnection</resource-env-ref-name>
        <resource-env-ref-type>javax.sql.DataSource</resource-env-ref-type>
    </resource-env-ref>
    ```

#### Finalize configuration

Finally, we will place the driver JARs in the Tomcat classpath and restart your App Service. Ensure that the JDBC driver files are available to the Tomcat classloader by placing them in the */home/tomcat/lib* directory. (Create this directory if it does not already exist.) To upload these files to your App Service instance, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com), install the webapp extension:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add -–name webapp
    ```

2. Run the following CLI command to create an SSH tunnel from your local system to App Service:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webapp remote-connection create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --port <port-on-local-machine>
    ```

3. Connect to the local tunneling port with your SFTP client and upload the files to the */home/tomcat/lib* folder.

Alternatively, you can use an FTP client to upload the JDBC driver. Follow these [instructions for getting your FTP credentials](deploy-configure-credentials.md).

### Tomcat

These instructions apply to all database connections. You will need to fill placeholders with your chosen database's driver class name and JAR file. Provided is a table with class names and driver downloads for common databases.

| Database   | Driver Class Name                             | JDBC Driver                                                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | `org.postgresql.Driver`                        | [Download](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)                                    |
| MySQL      | `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`                        | [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) (Select "Platform Independent") |
| SQL Server | `com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver` | [Download](/sql/connect/jdbc/download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017#download)                                                           |

To configure Tomcat to use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or the Java Persistence API (JPA), first customize the `CATALINA_OPTS` environment variable that is read in by Tomcat at start-up. Set these values through an app setting in the [App Service Maven plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/blob/develop/azure-webapp-maven-plugin/README.md):

```xml
<appSettings>
    <property>
        <name>CATALINA_OPTS</name>
        <value>"$CATALINA_OPTS -Ddbuser=${DBUSER} -Ddbpassword=${DBPASSWORD} -DconnURL=${CONNURL}"</value>
    </property>
</appSettings>
```

Or set the environment variables in the **Configuration** > **Application Settings** page in the Azure portal.

Next, determine if the data source should be available to one application or to all applications running on the Tomcat servlet.

#### Application-level data sources

1. Create a *context.xml* file in the *META-INF/* directory of your project. Create the *META-INF/* directory if it does not exist.

2. In *context.xml*, add a `Context` element to link the data source to a JNDI address. Replace the `driverClassName` placeholder with your driver's class name from the table above.

    ```xml
    <Context>
        <Resource
            name="jdbc/dbconnection"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource"
            url="${dbuser}"
            driverClassName="<insert your driver class name>"
            username="${dbpassword}"
            password="${connURL}"
        />
    </Context>
    ```

3. Update your application's *web.xml* to use the data source in your application.

    ```xml
    <resource-env-ref>
        <resource-env-ref-name>jdbc/dbconnection</resource-env-ref-name>
        <resource-env-ref-type>javax.sql.DataSource</resource-env-ref-type>
    </resource-env-ref>
    ```

#### Shared server-level resources

Adding a shared, server-level data source will require you to edit Tomcat's server.xml. First, upload a [startup script](faq-app-service-linux.md#built-in-images) and set the path to the script in **Configuration** > **Startup Command**. You can upload the startup script using [FTP](deploy-ftp.md).

Your startup script will make an [xsl transform](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_intro.asp) to the server.xml file and output the resulting xml file to `/usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml`. The startup script should install libxslt via apk. Your xsl file and startup script can be uploaded via FTP. Below is an example startup script.

```sh
# Install libxslt. Also copy the transform file to /home/tomcat/conf/
apk add --update libxslt

# Usage: xsltproc --output output.xml style.xsl input.xml
xsltproc --output /home/tomcat/conf/server.xml /home/tomcat/conf/transform.xsl /usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml
```

An example xsl file is provided below. The example xsl file adds a new connector node to the Tomcat server.xml.

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="@* | node()" name="Copy">
    <xsl:copy>
      <xsl:apply-templates select="@* | node()"/>
    </xsl:copy>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="@* | node()" mode="insertConnector">
    <xsl:call-template name="Copy" />
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="comment()[not(../Connector[@scheme = 'https']) and
                                 contains(., '&lt;Connector') and
                                 (contains(., 'scheme=&quot;https&quot;') or
                                  contains(., &quot;scheme='https'&quot;))]">
    <xsl:value-of select="." disable-output-escaping="yes" />
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="Service[not(Connector[@scheme = 'https'] or
                                   comment()[contains(., '&lt;Connector') and
                                             (contains(., 'scheme=&quot;https&quot;') or
                                              contains(., &quot;scheme='https'&quot;))]
                                  )]
                      ">
    <xsl:copy>
      <xsl:apply-templates select="@* | node()" mode="insertConnector" />
    </xsl:copy>
  </xsl:template>

  <!-- Add the new connector after the last existing Connnector if there is one -->
  <xsl:template match="Connector[last()]" mode="insertConnector">
    <xsl:call-template name="Copy" />

    <xsl:call-template name="AddConnector" />
  </xsl:template>

  <!-- ... or before the first Engine if there is no existing Connector -->
  <xsl:template match="Engine[1][not(preceding-sibling::Connector)]"
                mode="insertConnector">
    <xsl:call-template name="AddConnector" />

    <xsl:call-template name="Copy" />
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template name="AddConnector">
    <!-- Add new line -->
    <xsl:text>&#xa;</xsl:text>
    <!-- This is the new connector -->
    <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true" 
               maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true" 
               keystroreFile="${{user.home}}/.keystore" keystorePass="changeit"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
  </xsl:template>
  
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

#### Finalize configuration

Finally, place the driver JARs in the Tomcat classpath and restart your App Service.

1. Ensure that the JDBC driver files are available to the Tomcat classloader by placing them in the */home/tomcat/lib* directory. (Create this directory if it does not already exist.) To upload these files to your App Service instance, perform the following steps:

    1. In the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com), install the webapp extension:

      ```azurecli-interactive
      az extension add -–name webapp
      ```

    2. Run the following CLI command to create an SSH tunnel from your local system to App Service:

      ```azurecli-interactive
      az webapp remote-connection create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --port <port-on-local-machine>
      ```

    3. Connect to the local tunneling port with your SFTP client and upload the files to the */home/tomcat/lib* folder.

    Alternatively, you can use an FTP client to upload the JDBC driver. Follow these [instructions for getting your FTP credentials](deploy-configure-credentials.md).

2. If you created a server-level data source, restart the App Service Linux application. Tomcat will reset `CATALINA_BASE` to `/home/tomcat` and use the updated configuration.

### JBoss EAP

There are three core steps when [registering a data source with JBoss EAP](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.0/html/configuration_guide/datasource_management): uploading the JDBC driver, adding the JDBC driver as a module, and registering the module. App Service is a stateless hosting service, so the configuration commands for adding and registering the data source module must be scripted and applied as the container starts.

1. Obtain your database's JDBC driver. 
2. Create an XML module definition file for the JDBC driver. The example shown below is a module definition for PostgreSQL.

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="org.postgres">
        <resources>
        <!-- ***** IMPORTANT : REPLACE THIS PLACEHOLDER *******-->
        <resource-root path="/home/site/deployments/tools/postgresql-42.2.12.jar" />
        </resources>
        <dependencies>
            <module name="javax.api"/>
            <module name="javax.transaction.api"/>
        </dependencies>
    </module>
    ```

1. Put your JBoss CLI commands into a file named `jboss-cli-commands.cli`. The JBoss commands must add the module and register it as a data source. The example below shows the JBoss CLI commands for PostgreSQL.

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    module add --name=org.postgres --resources=/home/site/deployments/tools/postgresql-42.2.12.jar --module-xml=/home/site/deployments/tools/postgres-module.xml

    /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=postgres:add(driver-name="postgres",driver-module-name="org.postgres",driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource)

    data-source add --name=postgresDS --driver-name=postgres --jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/postgresDS --connection-url=${POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL,env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL:jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/postgres} --user-name=${POSTGRES_SERVER_ADMIN_FULL_NAME,env.POSTGRES_SERVER_ADMIN_FULL_NAME:postgres} --password=${POSTGRES_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD,env.POSTGRES_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD:example} --use-ccm=true --max-pool-size=5 --blocking-timeout-wait-millis=5000 --enabled=true --driver-class=org.postgresql.Driver --exception-sorter-class-name=org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.postgres.PostgreSQLExceptionSorter --jta=true --use-java-context=true --valid-connection-checker-class-name=org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.postgres.PostgreSQLValidConnectionChecker
    ```

1. Create a startup script, `startup_script.sh` that calls the JBoss CLI commands. The example below shows how to call your `jboss-cli-commands.cli`. Later you will configre App Service to run this script when the container starts. 

    ```bash
    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=/home/site/deployments/tools/jboss-cli-commands.cli
    ```

1. Using an FTP client of your choice, upload your JDBC driver, `jboss-cli-commands.cli`, `startup_script.sh`, and the module definition to `/site/deployments/tools/`.
2. Configure your site to run `startup_script.sh` when the container starts. In the Azure Portal, navigate to **Configuration** > **General Settings** > **Startup Command**. Set the startup command field to `/home/site/deployments/tools/startup_script.sh`. **Save** your changes.

To confirm that the datasource was added to the JBoss server, SSH into your webapp and run `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect`. Once you are connected to JBoss run the `/subsystem=datasources:read-resource` to print a list of the data sources.

## Choosing a Java runtime version

App Service allows users to choose the major version of the JVM, such as Java 8 or Java 11, as well as the minor version, such as 1.8.0_232 or 11.0.5. You can also choose to have the minor version automatically updated as new minor versions become available. In most cases, production sites should use pinned minor JVM versions. This will prevent unnanticipated outages during a minor version auto-update.

If you choose to pin the minor version, you will need to periodically update the JVM minor version on the site. To ensure that your application runs on the newer minor version, create a staging slot and increment the minor version on the staging site. Once you have confirmed the application runs correctly on the new minor version, you can swap the staging and production slots.

## JBoss EAP hardware options

JBoss EAP is only available on the Premium and Isolated hardware options. Customers that created a JBoss EAP site on a Free, Shared, Basic, or Standard tier during the public preview should scale up to Premium or Isolated hardware tier to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Java runtime statement of support

### JDK versions and maintenance

Azure's supported Java Development Kit (JDK) is [Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) provided through [Azul Systems](https://www.azul.com/). Azul Zulu Enterprise builds of OpenJDK are a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of the OpenJDK for Azure and Azure Stack backed by Microsoft and Azul Systems. They contain all the components for building and running Java SE applications. You can install the JDK from [Java JDK Installation](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks).

Major version updates will be provided through new runtime options in Azure App Service. Customers update to these newer versions of Java by configuring their App Service deployment and are responsible for testing and ensuring the major update meets their needs.

Supported JDKs are automatically patched on a quarterly basis in January, April, July, and October of each year. For more information on Java on Azure, please see [this support document](/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-long-term-support).

### Security updates

Patches and fixes for major security vulnerabilities will be released as soon as they become available from Azul Systems. A "major" vulnerability is defined by a base score of 9.0 or higher on the [NIST Common Vulnerability Scoring System, version 2](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss).

Tomcat 8.0 has reached [End of Life (EOL) as of September 30, 2018](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-80-eol.html). While the runtime is still available on Azure App Service, Azure will not apply security updates to Tomcat 8.0. If possible, migrate your applications to Tomcat 8.5 or 9.0. Both Tomcat 8.5 and 9.0 are available on Azure App Service. See the [official Tomcat site](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html) for more information. 

### Deprecation and retirement

If a supported Java runtime will be retired, Azure developers using the affected runtime will be given a deprecation notice at least six months before the runtime is retired.


### Local development

Developers can download the Production Edition of Azul Zulu Enterprise JDK for local development from [Azul's download site](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/).

### Development support

Product support for the [Azure-supported Azul Zulu JDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) is available through Microsoft when developing for Azure or [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/) with a [qualified Azure support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/).

## Next steps

Visit the [Azure for Java Developers](/java/azure/) center to find Azure quickstarts, tutorials, and Java reference documentation.

General questions about using App Service for Linux that aren't specific to the Java development are answered in the [App Service Linux FAQ](faq-app-service-linux.md).
