# Configure your App Service or Azure Functions app to use Azure AD login

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-authentication.md)]

This article shows you how to configure authentication for Azure App Service or Azure Functions so that your app signs in users with the [Microsoft Identity Platform](../active-directory/develop/v2-overview.md) (Azure AD) as the authentication provider.

The App Service Authentication feature can automatically create an app registration with the Microsoft Identity Platform. You can also use a registration that you or a directory admin creates separately.

- [Create a new app registration automatically](#express)
- [Use an existing registration created separately](#advanced)

> [!NOTE]
> The option to create a new registration is not available for government clouds. Instead, [define a registration separately](#advanced).

## <a name="express"> </a>Create a new app registration automatically

This option is designed to make enabling authentication simple and requires just a few clicks.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your app.
1. Select **Authentication** in the menu on the left. Click **Add identity provider**.
1. Select **Microsoft** in the identity provider dropdown. The option to create a new registration is selected by default. You can change the name of the registration or the supported account types.

    A client secret will be created and stored as a slot-sticky [application setting](./configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) named `MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`. You can update that setting later to use [Key Vault references](./app-service-key-vault-references.md) if you wish to manage the secret in Azure Key Vault.

1. If this is the first identity provider configured for the application, you will also be prompted with an **App Service authentication settings** section. Otherwise, you may move on to the next step.
    
    These options determine how your application responds to unauthenticated requests, and the default selections will redirect all requests to log in with this new provider. You can change customize this behavior now or adjust these settings later from the main **Authentication** screen by choosing **Edit** next to **Authentication settings**. To learn more about these options, see [Authentication flow](overview-authentication-authorization.md#authentication-flow).

1. (Optional) Click **Next: Permissions** and add any scopes needed by the application. These will be added to the app registration, but you can also change them later.
1. Click **Add**.

You're now ready to use the Microsoft Identity Platform for authentication in your app. The provider will be listed on the **Authentication** screen. From there, you can edit or delete this provider configuration.

For an example of configuring Azure AD login for a web app that accesses Azure Storage and Microsoft Graph, see [this tutorial](scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service.md).

## <a name="advanced"> </a>Use an existing registration created separately

You can also manually register your application for the Microsoft Identity Platform, customizing the registration and configuring App Service Authentication with the registration details. This is useful, for example, if you want to use an app registration from a different Azure AD tenant than the one your application is in.

### <a name="register"> </a>Create an app registration in Azure AD for your App Service app

First, you will create your app registration. As you do so, collect the following information which you will need later when you configure the authentication in the App Service app:

- Client ID
- Tenant ID
- Client secret (optional)
- Application ID URI

To register the app, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal], search for and select **App Services**, and then select your app. Note your app's **URL**. You'll use it to configure your Azure Active Directory app registration.
1. From the portal menu, select **Azure Active Directory**, then go to the **App registrations** tab and select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter a **Name** for your app registration.
1. In **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and type `<app-url>/.auth/login/aad/callback`. For example, `https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback`.
1. Select **Register**.
1. After the app registration is created, copy the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** for later.
1. Select **Authentication**. Under **Implicit grant**, enable **ID tokens** to allow OpenID Connect user sign-ins from App Service.
1. (Optional) Select **Branding**. In **Home page URL**, enter the URL of your App Service app and select **Save**.
1. Select **Expose an API** > **Set**. For single-tenant app, paste in the URL of your App Service app and select **Save** and for multi-tenant app, paste in the URL which is based on one of tenant verified domains and then select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This value is the **Application ID URI** of the app registration. If your web app requires access to an API in the cloud, you need the **Application ID URI** of the web app when you configure the cloud App Service resource. You can use this, for example, if you want the cloud service to explicitly grant access to the web app.

1. Select **Add a scope**.
   1. In **Scope name**, enter *user_impersonation*.
   1. In the text boxes, enter the consent scope name and description you want users to see on the consent page. For example, enter *Access my app*.
   1. Select **Add scope**.
1. (Optional) To create a client secret, select **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret** > **Add**. Copy the client secret value shown in the page. It won't be shown again.
1. (Optional) To add multiple **Reply URLs**, select **Authentication**.

### <a name="secrets"> </a>Enable Azure Active Directory in your App Service app

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your app.
1. Select **Authentication** in the menu on the left. Click **Add identity provider**.
1. Select **Microsoft** in the identity provider dropdown.
1. For **App registration type**, you can choose to **Pick an existing app registration in this directory** which will automatically gather the necessary app information. If your registration is from another tenant or you do not have permission to view the registration object, choose **Provide the details of an existing app registration**. For this option, you will need to fill in the following configuration details:

    |Field|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Application (client) ID| Use the **Application (client) ID** of the app registration. |
    |Client Secret (Optional)| Use the client secret you generated in the app registration. With a client secret, hybrid flow is used and the App Service will return access and refresh tokens. When the client secret is not set, implicit flow is used and only an id token is returned. These tokens are sent by the provider and stored in the EasyAuth token store.|
    |Issuer Url| Use `<authentication-endpoint>/<tenant-id>/v2.0`, and replace *\<authentication-endpoint>* with the [authentication endpoint for your cloud environment](../active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints) (e.g., "https://login.microsoftonline.com" for global Azure), also replacing *\<tenant-id>* with the **Directory (tenant) ID** in which the app registration was created. This value is used to redirect users to the correct Azure AD tenant, as well as to download the appropriate metadata to determine the appropriate token signing keys and token issuer claim value for example. For applications that use Azure AD v1 and for Azure Functions apps, omit `/v2.0` in the URL.|
    |Allowed Token Audiences| If this is a cloud or server app and you want to allow authentication tokens from a web app, add the **Application ID URI** of the web app here. The configured **Client ID** is *always* implicitly considered to be an allowed audience.|

    The client secret will be stored as a slot-sticky [application setting](./configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) named `MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`. You can update that setting later to use [Key Vault references](./app-service-key-vault-references.md) if you wish to manage the secret in Azure Key Vault.

1. If this is the first identity provider configured for the application, you will also be prompted with an **App Service authentication settings** section. Otherwise, you may move on to the next step.
    
    These options determine how your application responds to unauthenticated requests, and the default selections will redirect all requests to log in with this new provider. You can change customize this behavior now or adjust these settings later from the main **Authentication** screen by choosing **Edit** next to **Authentication settings**. To learn more about these options, see [Authentication flow](overview-authentication-authorization.md#authentication-flow).

1. Click **Add**.

You're now ready to use the Microsoft Identity Platform for authentication in your app. The provider will be listed on the **Authentication** screen. From there, you can edit or delete this provider configuration.

## Configure client apps to access your App Service

In the prior section, you registered your App Service or Azure Function to authenticate users. This section explains how to register native client or daemon apps so that they can request access to APIs exposed by your App Service on behalf of users or themselves. Completing the steps in this section is not required if you only wish to authenticate users.

### Native client application

You can register native clients to request access your App Service app's APIs on behalf of a signed in user.

1. In the [Azure portal], select **Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter a **Name** for your app registration.
1. In **Redirect URI**, select **Public client (mobile & desktop)** and type the URL `<app-url>/.auth/login/aad/callback`. For example, `https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For a Microsoft Store application, use the [package SID](/previous-versions/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-dotnet-how-to-use-client-library#package-sid) as the URI instead.
1. Select **Create**.
1. After the app registration is created, copy the value of **Application (client) ID**.
1. Select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **My APIs**.
1. Select the app registration you created earlier for your App Service app. If you don't see the app registration, make sure that you've added the **user_impersonation** scope in [Create an app registration in Azure AD for your App Service app](#register).
1. Under **Delegated permissions**, select **user_impersonation**, and then select **Add permissions**.

You have now configured a native client application that can request access your App Service app on behalf of a user.

### Daemon client application (service-to-service calls)

Your application can acquire a token to call a Web API hosted in your App Service or Function app on behalf of itself (not on behalf of a user). This scenario is useful for non-interactive daemon applications that perform tasks without a logged in user. It uses the standard OAuth 2.0 [client credentials](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) grant.

1. In the [Azure portal], select **Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter a **Name** for your daemon app registration.
1. For a daemon application, you don't need a Redirect URI so you can keep that empty.
1. Select **Create**.
1. After the app registration is created, copy the value of **Application (client) ID**.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret** > **Add**. Copy the client secret value shown in the page. It won't be shown again.

You can now [request an access token using the client ID and client secret](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md#first-case-access-token-request-with-a-shared-secret) by setting the `resource` parameter to the **Application ID URI** of the target app. The resulting access token can then be presented to the target app using the standard [OAuth 2.0 Authorization header](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md#use-the-access-token-to-access-the-secured-resource), and App Service Authentication / Authorization will validate and use the token as usual to now indicate that the caller (an application in this case, not a user) is authenticated.

At present, this allows _any_ client application in your Azure AD tenant to request an access token and authenticate to the target app. If you also want to enforce _authorization_ to allow only certain client applications, you must perform some additional configuration.

1. [Define an App Role](../active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) in the manifest of the app registration representing the App Service or Function app you want to protect.
1. On the app registration representing the client that needs to be authorized, select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **My APIs**.
1. Select the app registration you created earlier. If you don't see the app registration, make sure that you've [added an App Role](../active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md).
1. Under **Application permissions**, select the App Role you created earlier, and then select **Add permissions**.
1. Make sure to click **Grant admin consent** to authorize the client application to request the permission.
1. Similar to the previous scenario (before any roles were added), you can now [request an access token](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md#first-case-access-token-request-with-a-shared-secret) for the same target `resource`, and the access token will include a `roles` claim containing the App Roles that were authorized for the client application.
1. Within the target App Service or Function app code, you can now validate that the expected roles are present in the token (this is not performed by App Service Authentication / Authorization). For more information, see [Access user claims](app-service-authentication-how-to.md#access-user-claims).

You have now configured a daemon client application that can access your App Service app using its own identity.

## Best practices

Regardless of the configuration you use to set up authentication, the following best practices will keep your tenant and applications more secure:

- Give each App Service app its own permissions and consent.
- Configure each App Service app with its own registration.
- Avoid permission sharing between environments by using separate app registrations for separate deployment slots. When testing new code, this practice can help prevent issues from affecting the production app.
