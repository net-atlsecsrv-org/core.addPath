# How to prepare for an SSL IP address change

If you received a notification that the SSL IP address of your Azure App Service app is changing, follow the instructions in this article to release existing SSL IP address and assign a new one.

## Release SSL IP addresses and assign new ones

1.	Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2.	In the left-hand navigation menu, select **App Services**.

3.	Select your App Service app from the list.

4.	Under the **Settings** header, click **SSL settings** in the left navigation.

1. In the SSL bindings section, select the host name record. In the editor that opens, choose **SNI SSL** on the **SSL Type** drop-down menu and click **Add Binding**. When you see the operation success message, the existing IP address has been released.

6.	In the **SSL bindings** section, again select the same host name record with the certificate. In the editor that opens, this time choose **IP Based SSL** on the **SSL Type** drop-down menu and click **Add Binding**. When you see the operation success message, youâ€™ve acquired a new IP address.

7.	If an A record (DNS record pointing directly to your IP address) is configured in your Domain Registration Portal (third party DNS Provider or Azure DNS), replace the existing IP address with the newly generated one. You can find the new IP address by following the instructions in the next section.

## Find the new SSL IP address in the Azure Portal

1.	Wait a few minutes, and then open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2.	In the left-hand navigation menu, select **App Services**.

3.	Select your App Service app from the list.

4.	Under the **Settings** header, click **Properties** in the left navigation, and find the section labeled **Virtual IP address**.

5. Copy the IP address and reconfigure your domain record or IP mechanism.
