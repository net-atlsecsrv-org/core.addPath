# Create a Node.js web app in Azure 

Get started with Azure App Service by creating a Node.js/Express app locally using Visual Studio Code and then deploying the app to the cloud. Because you use a free App Service tier, you incur no costs to complete this quickstart.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-app-service-extension&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-app-service-extension).
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org). Run the command `node --version` to verify that Node.js is installed.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Azure App Service extension](vscode:extension/ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) for Visual Studio Code.

## Clone and run a local Node.js application

1. On your local computer, open a terminal and clone the sample repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world
    ```

1. Navigate into the new app folder:

    ```bash
    cd nodejs-docs-hello-world
    ```

1. Start the app to test it locally:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
1. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337). The browser should display "Hello World!".

1. Press **Ctrl**+**C** in the terminal to stop the server.

## Deploy the app to Azure

In this section, you deploy your Node.js app to Azure using VS Code and the Azure App Service extension.

1. In the terminal, make sure you're in the *nodejs-docs-hello-world* folder, then start Visual Studio Code with the following command:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. In the VS Code activity bar, select the Azure logo to show the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer. Select **Sign in to Azure...** and follow the instructions. (See [Troubleshooting Azure sign-in](#troubleshooting-azure-sign-in) below if you run into errors.) Once signed in, the explorer should show the name of your Azure subscription.

    ![Sign in to Azure](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/sign-in.png)

1. In the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer of VS Code, select the blue up arrow icon to deploy your app to Azure. (You can also invoke the same command from the **Command Palette** (**Ctrl**+**Shift**+**P**) by typing 'deploy to web app' and choosing **Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App**).

    ![Deploy to Web App](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/deploy.png)
        
1. Choose the *nodejs-docs-hello-world* folder.

1. Choose a creation option based on the operating system to which you want to deploy:

    - Linux: Choose **Create new Web App**
    - Windows: Choose **Create new Web App... Advanced**

1. Type a globally unique name for your web app and press **Enter**. The name must be unique across all of Azure and use only alphanumeric characters ('A-Z', 'a-z', and '0-9') and hyphens ('-').

1. If targeting Linux, select a Node.js version when prompted. An **LTS** version is recommended.

1. If targeting Windows, follow the additional prompts:
    1. Select **Create a new resource group**, then enter a name for the resource group, such as `AppServiceQS-rg`.
    1. Select **Windows** for the operating system.
    1. Select **Create new App Service plan**, then enter a name for the plan (such as `AppServiceQS-plan`), then select **F1 Free** for the pricing tier.
    1. Choose **Skip for now** when prompted about Application Insights.
    1. Choose a region near you or near resources you wish to access.

1. After you respond to all the prompts, VS Code shows the Azure resources that are being created for your app in its notification popup.

    When deploying to Linux, select **Yes** when prompted to update your configuration to run `npm install` on the target Linux server.

    ![Prompt to update configuration on the target Linux server](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/server-build.png)

1. Select **Yes** when prompted with **Always deploy the workspace "nodejs-docs-hello-world" to (app name)"**. Selecting **Yes** tells VS Code to automatically target the same App Service Web App with subsequent deployments.

1. If deploying to Linux, select **Browse Website** in the prompt to view your freshly deployed web app once deployment is complete. The browser should display "Hello World!"

1. If deploying to Windows, you must first set the Node.js version number for the web app:

    1. In VS Code, expand the node for the new app service, right-click **Application Settings**, and select **Add New Setting...**:

        ![Add app setting command](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/add-setting.png)

    1. Enter `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION` for the setting key.
    1. Enter `10.15.2` for the setting value.
    1. Right-click the node for the app service and select **Restart**

        ![Restart app service command](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/restart.png)

    1. Right-click the node for the app service once more and select **Browse Website**.

### Troubleshooting Azure sign-in

If you see the error **"Cannot find subscription with name [subscription ID]"** when signing into Azure, it might be because you're behind a proxy and unable to reach the Azure API. Configure `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables with your proxy information in your terminal using `export`.

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy:8080
export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:8080
```

If setting the environment variables doesn't correct the issue, contact us by selecting the **I ran into an issue** button above.

### Update the app

You can deploy changes to this app by making edits in VS Code, saving your files, and then using the same process as before only choosing the existing app rather than creating a new one.

## Viewing Logs

You can view log output (calls to `console.log`) from the app directly in the VS Code output window.

1. In the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer, right-click the app node and choose **Start Streaming Logs**.

    ![Start Streaming Logs](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/view-logs.png)

1. When prompted, choose to enable logging and restart the application. Once the app is restarted, the VS Code output window opens with a connection to the log stream. 

    ![Enable Logging and Restart](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/enable-restart.png)

1. After a few seconds, the output window shows a message indicating that you're connected to the log-streaming service. You can generate more output activity by refreshing the page in the browser.

    <pre>
    Connecting to log stream...
    2020-03-04T19:29:44  Welcome, you are now connected to log-streaming service. The default timeout is 2 hours.
    Change the timeout with the App Setting SCM_LOGSTREAM_TIMEOUT (in seconds).    
    </pre>
