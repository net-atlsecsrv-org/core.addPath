# Create a Node.js web app in Azure 

Azure App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. This quickstart shows how to deploy a Node.js app to Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-app-service-extension&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-app-service-extension) for a free account with $200 in Azure credits to try out any combination of services.

You need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed along with [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), the Node.js package manager.

You will also need to install the [Azure App Service extension](vscode:extension/ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice), which you can use to create, manage, and deploy Linux Web Apps on the Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS).

### Sign in

Once the extension is installed, log into your Azure account. In the Activity Bar, select on the Azure logo to show the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer. Select **Sign in to Azure...** and follow the instructions.

### Troubleshooting

If you see the error **"Cannot find subscription with name [subscription ID]"**, it might be because you're behind a proxy and unable to reach the Azure API. Configure `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables with your proxy information in your terminal using `export`.

```sh
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy:8080
export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:8080
```

If setting the environment variables doesn't correct the issue, contact us by selecting the **I ran into an issue** button below.

### Prerequisite check

Before you continue, ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed and configured.

In VS Code, you should see your Azure email address in the Status Bar and your subscription in the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer.

## Create your Node.js application

Next, create a Node.js application that can be deployed to the Cloud. This quickstart uses an application generator to quickly scaffold out the application from a terminal.

> [!TIP]
> If you have already completed the [Node.js tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial), you can skip ahead to [Deploy to Azure](#deploy-to-azure).

### Scaffold a new application with the Express Generator

[Express](https://www.expressjs.com) is a popular framework for building and running Node.js applications. You can scaffold (create) a new Express application using the [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) tool. The Express Generator is shipped as an npm module and can be run directly (without installation) by using the npm command-line tool `npx`.

```bash
npx express-generator myExpressApp --view pug --git
```

The `--view pug --git` parameters tell the generator to use the [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template engine (formerly known as `jade`) and to create a `.gitignore` file.

To install all of the application's dependencies, go to the new folder and run `npm install`.

```bash
cd myExpressApp
npm install
```

### Run the application

Next, ensure that the application runs. From the terminal, start the application using the `npm start` command to start the server.

```bash
npm start
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you should see something like this:

## Deploy to Azure

In this section, you deploy your Node.js app using VS Code and the Azure App Service extension. This quickstart uses the most basic deployment model where your app is zipped and deployed to an Azure Web App on Linux.

### Deploy using Azure App Service

First, open your application folder in VS Code.

```bash
code .
```

In the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer, select the blue up arrow icon to deploy your app to Azure.

![Deploy to Web App](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/deploy.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can also deploy from the **Command Palette** (CTRL + SHIFT + P) by typing 'deploy to web app' and running the **Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App** command.

1. Choose the directory that you currently have open, `myExpressApp`.

1. Choose a creation option based on the operating system to which you want to deploy:

    - Linux: Choose **Create new Web App**.
    - Windows: Choose **Create new Web App** and select the **Advanced** option.

1. Type a globally unique name for your Web App and press ENTER. Valid characters for an app name are 'a-z', '0-9', and '-'.

1. If targeting Linux, select a Node.js version when prompted. An **LTS** version is recommended.

1. If targeting Windows using the **Advanced** option, follow the additional prompts:
    1. Select **Create a new resource group**, then enter a name for the resource group.
    1. Select **Windows** for the operating system.
    1. Select an existing App Service Plan or create a new one. You can select a pricing tier when creating a new plan.
    1. Choose **Skip for now** when prompted about Application Insights.
    1. Choose a region near you or near resources you wish to access.

1. After you respond to all the prompts, the notification channel shows the Azure resources that are being created for your app.

1. Select **Yes** when prompted to update your configuration to run `npm install` on the target server. Your app is then deployed.

    ![Configured deployment](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/server-build.png)

1. When the deployment starts, you're prompted to update your workspace so that later deployments will automatically target the same App Service Web App. Choose **Yes** to ensure your changes are deployed to the correct app.

    ![Configured deployment](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/save-configuration.png)

> [!TIP]
> Be sure that your application is listening on the port provided by the PORT environment variable: `process.env.PORT`.

### Browse the app in Azure

Once the deployment completes, select **Browse Website** in the prompt to view your freshly deployed web app.

### Troubleshooting

If you see the error **"You do not have permission to view this directory or page."**, then the application probably failed to start correctly. Head to the next section and view the log output to find and fix the error. If you aren't able to fix it, contact us by selecting the **I ran into an issue** button below. We're happy to help!

> [I ran into an issue](https://www.research.net/r/PWZWZ52?tutorial=node-deployment-azure-app-service&step=deploy-app)

### Update the app

You can deploy changes to this app by using the same process and choosing the existing app rather than creating a new one.

## Viewing Logs

In this section, you learn how to view (or "tail") the logs from the running App Service app. Any calls to `console.log` in the app are displayed in the output window in Visual Studio Code.

Find the app in the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer, right-click the app, and choose **View Streaming Logs**.

When prompted, choose to enable logging and restart the application. Once the app is restarted, the VS Code output window opens with a connection to the log stream.

![View Streaming Logs](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/view-logs.png)

![Enable Logging and Restart](containers/media/quickstart-nodejs/enable-restart.png)

After a few seconds, you'll see a message indicating that you're connected to the log-streaming service. Refresh the page a few times to see more activity.
