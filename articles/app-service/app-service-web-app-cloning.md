# Azure App Service App Cloning Using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

With the release of Microsoft Azure PowerShell version 1.1.0, a new option has been added to `New-AzWebApp` that lets you clone an existing App Service app to a newly created app in a different region or in the same region. This option enables customers to deploy a number of apps across different regions quickly and easily.

App cloning is supported for Standard, Premium, Premium V2, and Isolated app service plans. The new feature uses the same limitations as App Service Backup feature, see [Back up an app in Azure App Service](manage-backup.md).

## Cloning an existing app
Scenario: An existing app in South Central US region, and you want to clone the contents to a new app in North Central US region. It can be accomplished by using the Azure Resource Manager version of the PowerShell cmdlet to create a new app with the `-SourceWebApp` option.

Knowing the resource group name that contains the source app, you can use the following PowerShell command to get the source app's information (in this case named `source-webapp`):

```powershell
$srcapp = Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName SourceAzureResourceGroup -Name source-webapp
```

To create a new App Service Plan, you can use `New-AzAppServicePlan` command as in the following example

```powershell
New-AzAppServicePlan -Location "South Central US" -ResourceGroupName DestinationAzureResourceGroup -Name NewAppServicePlan -Tier Premium
```

Using the `New-AzWebApp` command, you can create the new app in the North Central US region, and tie it to an existing premium tier App Service Plan. Moreover, you can use the same resource group as the source app, or define a new resource group, as shown in the following command:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName DestinationAzureResourceGroup -Name dest-webapp -Location "North Central US" -AppServicePlan DestinationAppServicePlan -SourceWebApp $srcapp
```

To clone an existing app including all associated deployment slots, you need to use the `IncludeSourceWebAppSlots` parameter. The following PowerShell command demonstrates the use of that parameter with the `New-AzWebApp` command:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName DestinationAzureResourceGroup -Name dest-webapp -Location "North Central US" -AppServicePlan DestinationAppServicePlan -SourceWebApp $srcapp -IncludeSourceWebAppSlots
```

To clone an existing app within the same region, you need to create a new resource group and a new app service plan in the same region, and then use the following PowerShell command to clone the app:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName NewAzureResourceGroup -Name dest-webapp -Location "South Central US" -AppServicePlan NewAppServicePlan -SourceWebApp $srcap
```

## Cloning an existing App to an App Service Environment
Scenario: An existing app in South Central US region, and you want to clone the contents to a new app to an existing App Service Environment (ASE).

Knowing the resource group name that contains the source app, you can use the following PowerShell command to get the source app's information (in this case named `source-webapp`):

```powershell
$srcapp = Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName SourceAzureResourceGroup -Name source-webapp
```

Knowing the ASE's name, and the resource group name that the ASE belongs to, you can create the new app in the existing ASE, as shown in the following command:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName DestinationAzureResourceGroup -Name dest-webapp -Location "North Central US" -AppServicePlan DestinationAppServicePlan -ASEName DestinationASE -ASEResourceGroupName DestinationASEResourceGroupName -SourceWebApp $srcapp
```

The `Location` parameter is required due to legacy reason, but it is ignored when you create the app in an ASE. 

## Cloning an existing App Slot
Scenario: You want to clone an existing deployment slot of an app to either a new app or a new slot. The new app can be in the same region as the original app slot or in a different region.

Knowing the resource group name that contains the source app, you can use the following PowerShell command to get the source app slot's information (in this case named `source-appslot`) tied to `source-app`:

```powershell
$srcappslot = Get-AzWebAppSlot -ResourceGroupName SourceAzureResourceGroup -Name source-app -Slot source-appslot
```

The following command demonstrates creating a clone of the source app to a new app:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName DestinationAzureResourceGroup -Name dest-app -Location "North Central US" -AppServicePlan DestinationAppServicePlan -SourceWebApp $srcappslot
```

## Configuring Traffic Manager while cloning an app
Creating multi-region apps and configuring Azure Traffic Manager to route traffic to all these apps, is an important scenario to ensure that customers' apps are highly available. When cloning an existing app, you have the option to connect both apps to either a new traffic manager profile or an existing one. Only Azure Resource Manager version of Traffic Manager is supported.

### Creating a new Traffic Manager profile while cloning an app
Scenario: You want to clone an app to another region, while configuring an Azure Resource Manager traffic manager profile that includes both apps. The following command demonstrates creating a clone of the source app to a new app while configuring a new Traffic Manager profile:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName DestinationAzureResourceGroup -Name dest-webapp -Location "South Central US" -AppServicePlan DestinationAppServicePlan -SourceWebApp $srcapp -TrafficManagerProfileName newTrafficManagerProfile
```

### Adding new cloned app to an existing Traffic Manager profile
Scenario: You already have an Azure Resource Manager traffic manager profile and want to add both apps as endpoints. To do so, you first need to assemble the existing traffic manager profile ID. You need the subscription ID, the resource group name, and the existing traffic manager profile name.

```powershell
$TMProfileID = "/subscriptions/<Your subscription ID goes here>/resourceGroups/<Your resource group name goes here>/providers/Microsoft.TrafficManagerProfiles/ExistingTrafficManagerProfileName"
```

After having the traffic manger ID, the following command demonstrates creating a clone of the source app to a new app while adding them to an existing Traffic Manager profile:

```powershell
$destapp = New-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <Resource group name> -Name dest-webapp -Location "South Central US" -AppServicePlan DestinationAppServicePlan -SourceWebApp $srcapp -TrafficManagerProfileId $TMProfileID
```

## Current Restrictions
Here are the known restrictions of app cloning:

* Auto scale settings are not cloned
* Backup schedule settings are not cloned
* VNET settings are not cloned
* App Insights are not automatically set up on the destination app
* Easy Auth settings are not cloned
* Kudu Extension are not cloned
* TiP rules are not cloned
* Database content is not cloned
* Outbound IP Addresses changes if cloning to a different scale unit
