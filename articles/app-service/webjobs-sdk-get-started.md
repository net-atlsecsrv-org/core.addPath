# Get started with the Azure WebJobs SDK for event-driven background processing

This article shows how to use Visual Studio 2019 to create an Azure WebJobs SDK project, run it locally, and then deploy it to [Azure App Service](overview.md). Version 3.x of the WebJobs SDK supports both .NET Core and .NET Framework console apps. To learn more about working with the WebJobs SDK, see [How to use the Azure WebJobs SDK for event-driven background processing](webjobs-sdk-how-to.md).

This article shows you how to deploy WebJobs as a .NET Core console app. To deploy WebJobs as a .NET Framework console app, see [WebJobs as .NET Framework console apps](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md#webjobs-as-net-framework-console-apps). If you are interested in WebJobs SDK version 2.x, which only supports .NET Framework, see [Develop and deploy WebJobs using Visual Studio - Azure App Service](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Install Visual Studio 2019](/visualstudio/install/) with the **Azure development** workload. If you already have Visual Studio but don't have that workload, add the workload by selecting **Tools > Get Tools and Features**.

* You must have [an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) to publish your WebJobs SDK project to Azure.

## Create a project

1. In Visual Studio, select **Create a New Project**.

2. Select **Console App (.NET Core)**.

3. Name the project *WebJobsSDKSample*, and then select **Create**.

   ![New Project dialog](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/new-project.png)

## WebJobs NuGet packages

1. Install the latest stable 3.x version of the [`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions/), which includes `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`.

     Here's the **Package Manager Console** command:

     ```powershell
     Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions -version <3_X_VERSION>
     ```

    In this command, replace `<3_X_VERSION>` with a supported version of the package. 

## Create the Host

The host is the runtime container for functions that listens for triggers and calls functions. The following steps create a host that implements [`IHost`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.ihost), which is the Generic Host in ASP.NET Core.

1. In *Program.cs*, add these `using` statements:

    ```cs
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
    ```

1. Replace the `Main` method with the following code:

    ```cs
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var builder = new HostBuilder();
        builder.ConfigureWebJobs(b =>
                {
                    b.AddAzureStorageCoreServices();
                });
        var host = builder.Build();
        using (host)
        {
            await host.RunAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

In ASP.NET Core, host configurations are set by calling methods on the [`HostBuilder`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostbuilder) instance. For more information, see [.NET Generic Host](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host). The `ConfigureWebJobs` extension method initializes the WebJobs host. In `ConfigureWebJobs`, you initialize specific WebJobs extensions and set properties of those extensions.  

## Enable console logging

In this section, you set up console logging that uses the [ASP.NET Core logging framework](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging).

1. Install the latest stable version of the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/), which includes `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`.

   Here's the **Package Manager Console** command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console -version <3_X_VERSION>
   ```
   In this command, replace `<3_X_VERSION>` with a supported 3.x version of the package.

1. In *Program.cs*, add a `using` statement:

   ```cs
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
   ```

1. Call the [`ConfigureLogging`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderextensions.configurelogging) method on [`HostBuilder`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostbuilder). The [`AddConsole`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.consoleloggerextensions.addconsole) method adds console logging to the configuration.

    ```cs
    builder.ConfigureLogging((context, b) =>
    {
        b.AddConsole();
    });
    ```

    The `Main` method now looks like this:

    ```cs
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var builder = new HostBuilder();
        builder.ConfigureWebJobs(b =>
                {
                    b.AddAzureStorageCoreServices();
                });
        builder.ConfigureLogging((context, b) =>
                {
                    b.AddConsole();
                });
        var host = builder.Build();
        using (host)
        {
            await host.RunAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

    This update does the following:

    * Disables [dashboard logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/wiki/Queues#logs). The dashboard is a legacy monitoring tool, and dashboard logging is not recommended for high-throughput production scenarios.
    * Adds the console provider with default [filtering](webjobs-sdk-how-to.md#log-filtering).

Now, you can add a function that is triggered by messages arriving in an Azure Storage queue.

## Install the Storage binding extension

Starting with version 3.x, you must explicitly install the Storage binding extension required by the WebJobs SDK. In prior versions, the Storage bindings were included in the SDK.

1. Install the latest stable version of the  [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage) NuGet package, version 3.x. 

    Here's the **Package Manager Console** command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage -Version <3_X_VERSION>
    ```
    
    In this command, replace `<3_X_VERSION>` with a supported version of the package. 

2. In the `ConfigureWebJobs` extension method, call the `AddAzureStorage` method on the [`HostBuilder`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostbuilder) instance to initialize the Storage extension. At this point, the `ConfigureWebJobs` method looks like the following example:

    ```cs
    builder.ConfigureWebJobs(b =>
                    {
                        b.AddAzureStorageCoreServices();
                        b.AddAzureStorage();
                    });
    ```

## Create a function

1. Right-click the project, select **Add** > **New Item...**, choose **Class**, name the new C# class file *Functions.cs*, and select **Add**.

1. In Functions.cs, replace the generated template with the following code:
    
    ```cs
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    
    namespace WebJobsSDKSample
    {
        public class Functions
        {
            public static void ProcessQueueMessage([QueueTrigger("queue")] string message, ILogger logger)
            {
                logger.LogInformation(message);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

   The `QueueTrigger` attribute tells the runtime to call this function when a new message is written on an Azure Storage queue called `queue`. The contents of the queue message are provided to the method code in the `message` parameter. The body of the method is where you process the trigger data. In this example, the code just logs the message.

   The `message` parameter doesn't have to be a string. You can also bind to a JSON object, a byte array, or a [CloudQueueMessage](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.storage.queue.cloudqueuemessage) object. [See Queue trigger usage](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger.md?tabs=csharp#usage). Each binding type (such as queues, blobs, or tables) has a different set of parameter types that you can bind to.

## Create a storage account

The Azure Storage Emulator that runs locally doesn't have all of the features that the WebJobs SDK needs. So in this section you create a storage account in Azure and configure the project to use it. If you already have a storage account, skip down to step 6.

1. Open **Server Explorer** in Visual studio and sign in to Azure. Right-click the **Azure** node, and then select **Connect to Microsoft Azure Subscription**.

   ![Sign in to Azure](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/sign-in.png)

1. Under the **Azure** node in **Server Explorer**, right-click **Storage**, and then select **Create Storage account**.

   ![Create Storage account menu](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/create-storage-account-menu.png)

1. In the **Create Storage Account** dialog box, enter a unique name for the storage account.

1. Choose the same **Region** that you created your App Service app in, or a region close to you.

1. Select **Create**.

   ![Create Storage account](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/create-storage-account.png)

1. Under the **Storage** node in **Server Explorer**, select the new Storage account. In the **Properties** window, select the ellipsis (**...**) at the right of the **Connection String** value field.

   ![Connection String ellipsis](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/conn-string-ellipsis.png)

1. Copy the connection string, and save this value somewhere that you can copy it again readily.

   ![Copy connection string](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/copy-key.png)

## Configure storage to run locally

The WebJobs SDK looks for the storage connection string in the Application Settings in Azure. When you run locally, it looks for this value in the local configuration file or in environment variables.

1. Right-click the project, select **Add** > **New Item...**, choose **JavaScript JSON configuration file**, name the new file *appsettings.json* file, and select **Add**. 

1. In the new file, add a `AzureWebJobsStorage` field, as in the following example:

    ```json
    {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "{storage connection string}"
    }
    ```

1. Replace *{storage connection string}* with the connection string that you copied earlier.

1. Select the *appsettings.json* file in Solution Explorer and in the **Properties** window, set **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer**.

Later, you'll add the same connection string app setting in your app in Azure App Service.

## Test locally

In this section, you build and run the project locally and trigger the function by creating a queue message.

1. Press **Ctrl+F5** to run the project.

   The console shows that the runtime found your function and is waiting for queue messages to trigger it. The following output is generated by the v3.x host:

   ```console
    info: Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Hosting.JobHostService[0]
          Starting JobHost
    info: Host.Startup[0]
          Found the following functions:
          WebJobsSDKSample.Functions.ProcessQueueMessage

    info: Host.Startup[0]
          Job host started
    Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    Hosting environment: Development
    Content root path: C:\WebJobsSDKSample\WebJobsSDKSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\
   ```

1. Close the console window.

1. In **Server Explorer** in Visual Studio, expand the node for your new storage account, and then right-click **Queues**.

1. Select **Create Queue**.

1. Enter *queue* as the name for the queue, and then select **OK**.

   ![Screenshot that shows where you create the queue and name it "queue". ](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/create-queue.png)

1. Right-click the node for the new queue, and then select **View Queue**.

1. Select the **Add Message** icon.

   ![Screenshot that highlights the Add Message icon.](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/create-queue-message.png)

1. In the **Add Message** dialog, enter *Hello World!* as the **Message text**, and then select **OK**. There is now a message in the queue.

   ![Create queue](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/hello-world-text.png)

1. Run the project again.

   Because you used the `QueueTrigger` attribute in the `ProcessQueueMessage` function, the WeJobs SDK runtime listens for queue messages when it starts up. It finds a new queue message in the queue named *queue* and calls the function.

   Due to [queue polling exponential backoff](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger.md?tabs=csharp#polling-algorithm), it might take as long as 2 minutes for the runtime to find the message and invoke the function. This wait time can be reduced by running in [development mode](webjobs-sdk-how-to.md#host-development-settings).

   The console output looks like this:

   ```console
    info: Function.ProcessQueueMessage[0]
          Executing 'Functions.ProcessQueueMessage' (Reason='New queue message detected on 'queue'.', Id=2c319369-d381-43f3-aedf-ff538a4209b8)
    info: Function.ProcessQueueMessage[0]
          Trigger Details: MessageId: b00a86dc-298d-4cd2-811f-98ec39545539, DequeueCount: 1, InsertionTime: 1/18/2019 3:28:51 AM +00:00
    info: Function.ProcessQueueMessage.User[0]
          Hello World!
    info: Function.ProcessQueueMessage[0]
          Executed 'Functions.ProcessQueueMessage' (Succeeded, Id=2c319369-d381-43f3-aedf-ff538a4209b8)
   ```

1. Close the console window. 

1. Go back to the Queue window and refresh it. The message is gone, since it has been processed by your function running locally. 

## Add Application Insights logging

When the project runs in Azure, you can't monitor function execution by viewing console output. The monitoring solution we recommend is [Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md). For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-monitoring.md).

In this section, you do the following tasks to set up Application Insights logging before you deploy to Azure:

* Make sure you have an App Service app and an Application Insights instance to work with.
* Configure the App Service app to use the Application Insights instance and the storage account that you created earlier.
* Set up the project for logging to Application Insights.

### Create App Service app and Application Insights instance

1. If you don't already have an App Service app that you can use, [create one](quickstart-dotnet-framework.md). When you create your app, you can also create a connected Application Insights resource. When you do this, the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` is set for you in your app.

1. If you don't already have an Application Insights resource that you can use, [create one](../azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource.md ). Set **Application type** to **General**, and skip the sections that follow **Copy the instrumentation key**.

1. If you already have an Application Insights resource that you want to use, [copy the instrumentation key](../azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource.md#copy-the-instrumentation-key).

### Configure app settings 

1. In **Server Explorer** in Visual Studio, expand the **App Service** node under **Azure**.

1. Expand the resource group that your App Service app is in, and then right-click your App Service app.

1. Select **View Settings**.

1. In the **Connection Strings** box, add the following entry.

   |Name  |connection String  |Database Type|
   |---------|---------|------|
   |AzureWebJobsStorage | {the Storage connection string that you copied earlier}|Custom|

1. If the **Application Settings** box doesn't have an Application Insights instrumentation key, add the one that you copied earlier. (The instrumentation key may already be there, depending on how you created the App Service app.)

   |Name  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY | {instrumentation key} |

1. Replace *{instrumentation key}* with the instrumentation key from the Application Insights resource that you're using.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Add the Application Insights connection to the project so that you can run it locally. In the *appsettings.json* file, add an `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` field, as in the following example:

    ```json
    {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "{storage connection string}",
        "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY": "{instrumentation key}"
    }
    ```

    Replace *{instrumentation key}* with the instrumentation key from the Application Insights resource that you're using.

1. Save your changes.

### Add Application Insights logging provider

To take advantage of [Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md) logging, update your logging code to do the following:

* Add an Application Insights logging provider with default [filtering](webjobs-sdk-how-to.md#log-filtering). When running locally, all Information and higher-level logs are written to both the console and Application Insights.
* Put the [LoggerFactory](./webjobs-sdk-how-to.md#logging-and-monitoring) object in a `using` block to ensure that log output is flushed when the host exits.

1. Install the latest stable 3.x version of the [`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights/).

   Here's the **Package Manager Console** command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights -Version <3_X_VERSION>
   ```
    In this command, replace `<3_X_VERSION>` with a supported version of the package.

1. Open *Program.cs* and replace the code in the `Main` method with the following code:

    ```cs
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var builder = new HostBuilder();
        builder.UseEnvironment(EnvironmentName.Development);
        builder.ConfigureWebJobs(b =>
                {
                    b.AddAzureStorageCoreServices();
                    b.AddAzureStorage();
                });
        builder.ConfigureLogging((context, b) =>
                {
                    b.AddConsole();

                    // If the key exists in settings, use it to enable Application Insights.
                    string instrumentationKey = context.Configuration["APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY"];
                    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(instrumentationKey))
                    {
                        b.AddApplicationInsightsWebJobs(o => o.InstrumentationKey = instrumentationKey);
                    }
                });
        var host = builder.Build();
        using (host)
        {
            await host.RunAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

    This adds the Application Insights provider to the logging, using the key you added earlier to your app settings.

## Test Application Insights logging

In this section, you run locally again to verify that logging data is now going to Application Insights as well as to the console.

1. Use **Server Explorer** in Visual Studio to create a queue message like you did [earlier](#test-locally), except enter *Hello App Insights!* as the message text.

1. Run the project.

   The WebJobs SDK processes the queue message, and you see the logs in the console window.

1. Close the console window.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to view your Application Insights resource. Search for and select **Application Insights**.

1. Choose your Application Insights instance.

1. Select **Search**.

   ![Select Search](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/select-search.png)

1. If you don't see the *Hello App Insights!* message, select **Refresh** periodically for several minutes. (Logs don't appear immediately, because it takes a while for the Application Insights client to flush the logs it processes.)

   ![Logs in Application Insights](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/logs-in-ai.png)

1. Close the console window.

## <a name="deploy-as-a-webjob"></a>Deploy to Azure

During deployment, you create an app service instance in which to run your functions. When you publish a .NET Core console app to App Service in Azure, it automatically gets run as a WebJob. To learn more about publishing, see [Develop and deploy WebJobs using Visual Studio](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md).

[!INCLUDE [webjobs-publish-net-core](../../includes/webjobs-publish-net-core.md)]

## Trigger the function in Azure

1. Make sure you're not running locally (close the console window if it's still open). Otherwise the local instance might be the first to process any queue messages you create.

1. In the **Queue** page in Visual Studio, add a message to the queue as before.

1. Refresh the **Queue** page, and the new message disappears because it has been processed by the function running in Azure.

   > [!TIP]
   > When you're testing in Azure, use [development mode](webjobs-sdk-how-to.md#host-development-settings) to ensure that a queue trigger function is invoked right away and avoid delays due to [queue polling exponential backoff](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger.md?tabs=csharp#polling-algorithm).

### View logs in Application Insights

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and go to your Application Insights resource.

1. Select **Search**.

1. If you don't see the *Hello Azure!* message, select **Refresh** periodically for several minutes.

   You see the logs from the function running in a WebJob, including the *Hello Azure!* text that you entered in the preceding section.

## Add an input binding

Input bindings simplify code that reads data. For this example, the queue message will be a blob name and you'll use the blob name to find and read a blob in Azure Storage.

1. In *Functions.cs*, replace the `ProcessQueueMessage` method with the following code:

   ```cs
   public static void ProcessQueueMessage(
       [QueueTrigger("queue")] string message,
       [Blob("container/{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Read)] Stream myBlob,
       ILogger logger)
   {
       logger.LogInformation($"Blob name:{message} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} bytes");
   }
   ```

   In this code, `queueTrigger` is a [binding expression](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-expressions-patterns.md), which means it resolves to a different value at runtime.  At runtime, it has the contents of the queue message.

1. Add a `using`:

   ```cs
   using System.IO;
   ```

1. Create a blob container in your storage account.

   a. In **Server Explorer** in Visual Studio, expand the node for your storage account, right-click **Blobs**, and then select **Create Blob Container**.

   b. In the **Create Blob Container** dialog, enter *container* as the container name, and then click **OK**.

1. Upload the *Program.cs* file to the blob container. (This file is used here as an example; you could upload any text file and create a queue message with the file's name.)

   a. In **Server Explorer**, double-click the node for the container you created.

   b. In the **Container** window, select the **Upload** button.

   ![Blob upload button](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/blob-upload-button.png)

   c. Find and select *Program.cs*, and then select **OK**.

1. Create a queue message in the queue you created earlier, with *Program.cs* as the text of the message.

   ![Queue message Program.cs](./media/webjobs-sdk-get-started/queue-msg-program-cs.png)

1. Run the project locally.

   The queue message triggers the function, which then reads the blob and logs its length. The console output looks like this:

   ```console
   Found the following functions:
   ConsoleApp1.Functions.ProcessQueueMessage
   Job host started
   Executing 'Functions.ProcessQueueMessage' (Reason='New queue message detected on 'queue'.', Id=5a2ac479-de13-4f41-aae9-1361f291ff88)
   Blob name:Program.cs
   Size: 532 bytes
   Executed 'Functions.ProcessQueueMessage' (Succeeded, Id=5a2ac479-de13-4f41-aae9-1361f291ff88)
   ```

## Add an output binding

Output bindings simplify code that writes data. This example modifies the previous one by writing a copy of the blob instead of logging its size. Blob storage bindings are included in the Azure Storage extension package that we installed previously.

1. Replace the `ProcessQueueMessage` method with the following code:

   ```cs
   public static void ProcessQueueMessage(
       [QueueTrigger("queue")] string message,
       [Blob("container/{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Read)] Stream myBlob,
       [Blob("container/copy-{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Write)] Stream outputBlob,
       ILogger logger)
   {
       logger.LogInformation($"Blob name:{message} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} bytes");
       myBlob.CopyTo(outputBlob);
   }
   ```

1. Create another queue message with *Program.cs* as the text of the message.

1. Run the project locally.

   The queue message triggers the function, which then reads the blob, logs its length, and creates a new blob. The console output is the same, but when you go to the blob container window and select **Refresh**, you see a new blob named *copy-Program.cs.*

## Republish the updates to Azure

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Publish**.

1. In the **Publish** dialog, make sure that the current profile is selected and then choose **Publish**. Results of the publish are detailed in the **Output** window.
 
1. Verify the function in Azure by again uploading a file to the blob container and adding a message to the queue that is the name of the uploaded file. You see the message get removed from the queue and a copy of the file created in the blob container.
