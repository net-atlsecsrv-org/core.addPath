# Verify the Azure SQL Managed Instance built-in firewall
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

The Azure SQL Managed Instance [mandatory inbound security rules](connectivity-architecture-overview.md#mandatory-inbound-security-rules) require management ports 9000, 9003, 1438, 1440, and 1452 to be open from **Any source** on the Network Security Group (NSG) that protects SQL Managed Instance. Although these ports are open at the NSG level, they are protected at the network level by the built-in firewall.

## Verify firewall

To verify these ports, use any security scanner tool to test these ports. The following screenshot shows how to use one of these tools.
