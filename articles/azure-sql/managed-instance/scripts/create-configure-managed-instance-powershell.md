# Use PowerShell to create a managed instance

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This PowerShell script example creates a managed instance in a dedicated subnet within a new virtual network. It also configures a route table and a network security group for the virtual network. Once the script has been successfully run, the managed instance can be accessed from within the virtual network or from an on-premises environment. See [Configure Azure VM to connect to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](../connect-vm-instance-configure.md) and [Configure a point-to-site connection to Azure SQL Managed Instance from on-premises](../point-to-site-p2s-configure.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For limitations, see [supported regions](../resource-limits.md#supported-regions) and [supported subscription types](../resource-limits.md#supported-subscription-types).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires Azure PowerShell 1.4.0 or later. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell-interactive[main](../../../../powershell_scripts/sql-database/managed-instance/create-and-configure-managed-instance.ps1 "Create managed instance")]

## Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove  the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname
```
