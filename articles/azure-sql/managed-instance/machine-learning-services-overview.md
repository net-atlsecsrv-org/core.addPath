# Machine Learning Services in Azure SQL Managed Instance (preview)

Machine Learning Services is a feature of Azure SQL Managed Instance (preview) that provides in-database machine learning, supporting both Python and R scripts. The feature includes Microsoft Python and R packages for high-performance predictive analytics and machine learning. The relational data can be used in scripts through stored procedures, T-SQL script containing Python or R statements, or Python or R code containing T-SQL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Machine Learning Services is a feature of Azure SQL Managed Instance that's currently in public preview.
> This preview functionality is initially available in a limited number of regions in the US, Asia Europe, and Australia with additional regions being added later.
>
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## What is Machine Learning Services?

Machine Learning Services in Azure SQL Managed Instance lets you execute Python and R scripts in-database. You can use it to prepare and clean data, do feature engineering, and train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models within a database. The feature runs your scripts where the data resides and eliminates transfer of the data across the network to another server.

Use Machine Learning Services with R/Python support in Azure SQL Managed Instance to:

- **Run R and Python scripts to do data preparation and general purpose data processing** - You can now bring your R/Python scripts to Azure SQL Managed Instance where your data lives, instead of having to move data out to some other server to run R and Python scripts. You can eliminate the need for data movement and associated problems related to latency, security, and compliance.

- **Train machine learning models in database** - You can train models using any open source algorithms. You can easily scale your training to the entire dataset rather than relying on sample datasets pulled out of the database.

- **Deploy your models and scripts into production in stored procedures** - The scripts and trained models can be operationalized simply by embedding them in T-SQL stored procedures. Apps connecting to Azure SQL Managed Instance can benefit from predictions and intelligence in these models by just calling a stored procedure. You can also use the native T-SQL PREDICT function to operationalize models for fast scoring in highly concurrent real-time scoring scenarios.

Base distributions of Python and R are included in Machine Learning Services. You can install and use open-source packages and frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, in addition to the Microsoft packages [revoscalepy](/sql/advanced-analytics/python/ref-py-revoscalepy) and [microsoftml](/sql/advanced-analytics/python/ref-py-microsoftml) for Python, and [RevoScaleR](/sql/advanced-analytics/r/ref-r-revoscaler), [MicrosoftML](/sql/advanced-analytics/r/ref-r-microsoftml), [olapR](/sql/advanced-analytics/r/ref-r-olapr), and [sqlrutils](/sql/advanced-analytics/r/ref-r-sqlrutils) for R.
