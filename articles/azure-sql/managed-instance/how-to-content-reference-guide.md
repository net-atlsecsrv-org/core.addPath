# Azure SQL Managed Instance content reference
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

In this article you can find a content reference to various guides, scripts, and explanations that help you manage and configure Azure SQL Managed Instance.

## Load data

- [Migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance](migrate-to-instance-from-sql-server.md): Learn about the recommended migration process and tools for migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance.
- [Migrate TDE cert to Azure SQL Managed Instance](tde-certificate-migrate.md): If your SQL Server database is protected with transparent data encryption (TDE), you would need to migrate the certificate that SQL Managed Instance can use to decrypt the backup that you want to restore in Azure.
- [Import a DB from a BACPAC](../database/database-import.md)
- [Export a DB to BACPAC](../database/database-export.md)
- [Load data with BCP](../load-from-csv-with-bcp.md)
- [Load data with Azure Data Factory](../../data-factory/connector-azure-sql-database.md?toc=/azure/sql-database/toc.json)

## Network configuration

- [Determine subnet size](vnet-subnet-determine-size.md):
  Since the subnet cannot be resized after SQL Managed Instance is deployed, you need to calculate what IP range of addresses is required for the number and types of managed instances you plan to deploy to the subnet. 
- [Create a new VNet and subnet](virtual-network-subnet-create-arm-template.md):
  Configure the virtual network and subnet according to the [network requirements](connectivity-architecture-overview.md#network-requirements). 
- [Configure an existing VNet and subnet](vnet-existing-add-subnet.md):
  Verify network requirements and configure your existing virtual network and subnet to deploy SQL Managed Instance. 
- [Configure custom DNS](custom-dns-configure.md):
  Configure custom DNS to grant external resource access to  custom domains from SQL Managed Instance via a linked server of db mail profiles. 
- [Sync network configuration](azure-app-sync-network-configuration.md):
  Refresh the networking configuration plan if you can't establish a connection after [integrating your app with an Azure virtual network](../../app-service/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet.md).
- [Find the management endpoint IP address](management-endpoint-find-ip-address.md): 
  Determine the public endpoint that SQL Managed Instance is using for management purposes. 
- [Verify built-in firewall protection](management-endpoint-verify-built-in-firewall.md):
  Verify that SQL Managed Instance allows traffic only on necessary ports, and other built-in firewall rules. 
- [Connect applications](connect-application-instance.md): 
  Learn about different patterns for connecting the applications to SQL Managed Instance.

## Feature configuration

- [Configure Azure AD auth](../database/authentication-aad-configure.md)

- [Configure Azure Automation](../database/automation-manage.md)
- [Transactional replication](replication-between-two-instances-configure-tutorial.md) enables you to replicate your data between managed instances, or from SQL Server on-premises to SQL Managed Instance, and vice versa.
- [Configure threat detection](threat-detection-configure.md) â€“ [threat detection](../database/threat-detection-overview.md) is a built-in Azure SQL Managed Instance feature that detects various potential attacks such as SQL injection or access from suspicious locations. 
- [Creating alerts](alerts-create.md) enables you to set up alerts on monitored metrics such as CPU utilization, storage space consumption, IOPS and others for SQL Managed Instance.
