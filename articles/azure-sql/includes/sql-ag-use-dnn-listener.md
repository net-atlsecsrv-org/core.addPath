> [!NOTE]
> Customers on SQL Server 2019 CU8 and later on Windows 2016 and later can replace the traditional VNN listener and Azure Load Balancer with a [distributed network name (DNN) listener](../virtual-machines/windows/availability-group-distributed-network-name-dnn-listener-configure.md) instead. Skip the rest of the steps in this article that create the listener and load balancer.
