# Migration guide: Access to Azure SQL Database

This migration guide teaches you to migrate your Microsoft Access databases to Azure SQL Database using the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access.

For other migration guides, see [Database Migration](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/). 

## Prerequisites

To migrate your Access database to Azure SQL Database, you need:

- to verify your source environment is supported. 
- [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54255). 

## Pre-migration

After you have met the prerequisites, you are ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of your migration.


### Assess 

Create an assessment using [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54255). 

To create an assessment, follow these steps: 

1. Open SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access. 
1. Select **File** and then choose **New Project**. Provide a name for your migration project. 

   ![Choose New Project](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/new-project.png)

1. Select **Add Databases** and choose databases to be added to your new project. 

   ![Choose Add databases](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/add-databases.png)

1. In **Access Metadata Explorer**, right-click the database and then choose **Create Report**. 

   ![Right-click the database and choose Create Report](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/create-report.png)

1. Review the sample assessment. For example: 

   ![Review the sample report assessment](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/sample-assessment.png)

### Validate data types

Validate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements if necessary. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select **Tools** from the menu. 
1. Select **Project Settings**. 
1. Select the **Type mappings** tab. 

   ![Type Mappings](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/type-mappings.png)

1. You can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in the **Access Metadata Explorer**.


### Convert schema

To convert database objects, follow these steps: 

1. Select **Connect to Azure SQL Database** and provide connection details.

   ![Connect to Azure SQL Database](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/connect-to-sqldb.png)

1. Right-click the database in **Access Metadata Explorer** and choose **Convert schema**. Alternatively, you can choose **Convert Schema** from the top navigation bar after selecting your database.

   ![Right-click the database and choose convert schema](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/convert-schema.png)

   Compare converted queries to original queries: 

   ![Converted queries can be compared with source code](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/query-comparison.png)

   Compare converted objects to original objects: 

   ![Converted objects can be compared with source](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/table-comparison.png)

1. (Optional) To convert an individual object, right-click the object and choose **Convert schema**. Converted objects appear bold in the **Access Metadata Explorer**: 

   ![Bold objects in metadata explorer have been converted](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/converted-items.png)
 
1. Select **Review results** in the Output pane, and review errors in the **Error list** pane. 


## Migrate

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migrating data is a bulk-load operation that moves rows of data into Azure SQL Database in transactions. The number of rows to be loaded into Azure SQL Database in each transaction is configured in the project settings.

To migrate data by using SSMA for Access, follow these steps: 

1. If you haven't already, select **Connect to Azure SQL Database** and provide connection details. 
1. Right-click the database from the **Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer** and choose **Synchronize with Database**. This action publishes the MySQL schema to Azure SQL Database.

   ![Synchronize with Database](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/synchronize-with-database.png)

   Review the mapping between your source project and your target:

   ![Review the synchronization with the database](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/synchronize-with-database-review.png)

1. Use **Access Metadata Explorer** to check boxes next to the items you want to migrate. If you want to migrate the entire database, check the box next to the database. 
1. Right-click the database or object you want to migrate, and choose **Migrate data**. 
   To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expand Tables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box.

    ![Migrate Data](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/migrate-data.png)

    Review the migrated data: 

    ![Migrate Data Review](./media/access-to-sql-database-guide/migrate-data-review.png)

1. Connect to your Azure SQL Database by using [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) and validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema.

## Post-migration 

After you have successfully completed the **Migration** stage, you need to go through a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

### Remediate applications

After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this will in some cases require changes to the applications.

### Perform tests

The test approach for database migration consists of performing the following activities:

  1. **Develop validation tests**. To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you have defined.

  2. **Set up test environment**. The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

  3. **Run validation tests**. Run the validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.

  4. **Run performance tests**. Run performance test against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.

### Optimize

The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues and verifying completeness, as well as addressing performance issues with the workload.

For additional detail about these issues and specific steps to mitigate them, see the [Post-migration Validation and Optimization Guide](/sql/relational-databases/post-migration-validation-and-optimization-guide).
