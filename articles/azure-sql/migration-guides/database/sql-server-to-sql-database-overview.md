# Migration overview: SQL Server to SQL Database
[!INCLUDE[appliesto--sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

Learn about different migration options and considerations to migrate your SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. 

You can migrate SQL Server running on-premises or on: 

- SQL Server on Virtual Machines  
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 
- Amazon Relational Database Service (AWS RDS) 
- Compute Engine (Google Cloud Platform - GCP)  
- Cloud SQL for SQL Server (Google Cloud Platform â€“ GCP) 

For other scenarios, see the [Database Migration Guide](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/). 

## Overview

[Azure SQL Database](../../database/sql-database-paas-overview.md) is a recommended target option for SQL Server workloads that require a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS). SQL Database handles most database management functions, along with high availability, intelligent query processing, scalability, and performance capabilities built in to suit many different application types. 

SQL Database provides flexibility with multiple [deployment models](../../database/sql-database-paas-overview.md#deployment-models) and [service tiers](../../database/service-tiers-vcore.md#service-tiers) that cater to different types of applications or workloads.

One of the key benefits of migrating to SQL Database is that you can modernize your application by leveraging the PaaS capabilities and eliminate any dependency on technical components that are scoped at the instance level such as SQL Agent jobs.

You can also save on cost by migrating your SQL Server on-premises licenses to Azure SQL Database using the [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) for SQL Server should you choose the [vCore-based purchasing model](../../database/service-tiers-vcore.md).

This guide aims to clarify migration options and considerations as you prepare to migrate your SQL Server databases to Azure SQL Database.  

## Considerations 

The key factors to consider when evaluating migration options depend on: 

- Number of servers and databases
- Size of databases
- Acceptable business downtime during the migration process 

The migration options listed in this guide take these factors into account. For logical data migration to Azure SQL Database, the time to migrate can depend both on the number of objects in a database and the size of the database. 

Different tools are available for different workloads and user preferences. Some tools can be used to perform a quick migration of a single database using a UI-based tool while other tools can migrate multiple databases that can be automated to handle migrations at scale. 

## Choose appropriate target

Consider general guidelines to help you choose the right deployment model and service tier of Azure SQL Database. You can choose compute and storage resources during deployment and then change them afterwards using the  [Azure portal](../../database/scale-resources.md)  without incurring downtime for your application.


**Deployment models**: Understand your application workload and the usage pattern to decide between a single database or elastic pool. 

- A [single database](../../database/single-database-overview.md) represents a fully managed database suitable for most modern cloud applications and microservices.
- An [elastic pool](../../database/elastic-pool-overview.md) is a collection of single databases with a shared set of resources such as CPU or memory and suitable for combining databases in a pool with predictable usage patterns that can effectively share the same set of resources.

**Purchasing models**: Choose between the vCore, DTU, or serverless purchasing model. 

- The [vCore model](../../database/service-tiers-vcore.md) lets you choose the number of vCores for your Azure SQL Database, making it the easiest choice when translating from on-premises SQL Server. This is the only option that supports saving on license cost with the [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/). 
- The [DTU model](../../database/service-tiers-dtu.md) abstracts the underlying compute, memory, and IO resources in order to provide a blended DTU. 
- The [serverless model](../../database/serverless-tier-overview.md) is intended for workloads that require automatic on-demand scaling with compute resources billed per second of usage. The serverless compute tier automatically pauses databases during inactive periods (where only storage is billed), and automatically resumes databases when activity returns. 

**Service tiers**: Choose between three service tiers designed for different types of applications.

- [General Purpose / Standard service tier](../../database/service-tier-general-purpose.md) offers a balanced budget-oriented option with compute and storage suitable to deliver mid-lower tier applications, with redundancy built in at the storage layer to recover from failures. Designed for most database workloads. 
- [Business Critical / Premium service tier](../../database/service-tier-business-critical.md) is for high tier applications that require high transaction rates, low latency IO, and a high level of resiliency with secondary replicas available for both failover and to offload read workloads.
- [Hyperscale service tier](../../database/service-tier-hyperscale.md) is for databases that have growing data volumes and need to automatically scale up to 100-TB database size. Designed for very large databases. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Transaction log rate is governed](../../database/resource-limits-logical-server.md#transaction-log-rate-governance) in Azure SQL Database to limit high ingestion rates. As such, during migration, it may be necessary to scale target database resources (vCores/DTUs) to ease pressure on CPU or throughput. Choose the appropriately-sized target database, but plan to scale resources up for the migration if necessary. 


### SQL Server on Azure VM alternative

Your business may have requirements that make [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](../../virtual-machines/windows/sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md) a more suitable target than Azure SQL Database. 

If the following apply to your business, consider moving to a SQL Server on Azure VM instead: 

- If you require direct access to the operating system or file system, such as to install third-party or custom agents on the same virtual machine with SQL Server. 
- If you have strict dependency on features that are still not supported, such as FileStream/FileTable, PolyBase, and cross-instance transactions. 
- If you absolutely need to stay at a specific version of SQL Server (2012, for instance). 
- If your compute requirements are much lower than managed instance offers (one vCore, for instance), and database consolidation is not an acceptable option. 


## Migration tools 

The recommended tools for migration are the Data Migration Assistant and the Azure Database Migration Service. There are other alternative migration options available as well. 

### Recommended tools

| | | |

### Alternative options

The following table compares the alternative migration options: 

|Method / technology |When to use    |Considerations  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|[Transactional replication](../../database/replication-to-sql-database.md)| - Migrate by continuously publishing changes from source database tables to target SQL Database tables. </br> - Full or partial database migrations of selected tables (subset of database).  </br> </br> Supported sources: </br> - [SQL Server (2016 - 2019) with some limitations](/sql/relational-databases/replication/replication-backward-compatibility) </br> - AWS EC2  </br> - GCP Compute SQL Server VM  | - Setup is relatively complex compared to other migration options.   </br> - Provides a continuous replication option to migrate data (without taking the databases offline).  </br> - Transactional replication has a number of limitations to consider when setting up the Publisher on the source SQL Server.

## Feature interoperability 

There are additional considerations when migrating workloads that rely on other SQL Server features.

#### SQL Server Integration Services
Migrate SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages  to Azure by redeploying the packages to Azure-SSIS runtime in [Azure Data Factory](../../../data-factory/introduction.md). Azure Data Factory [supports migration of SSIS packages](../../../data-factory/scenario-ssis-migration-overview.md#azure-sql-database-as-database-workload-destination) by providing a runtime built to execute SSIS packages in Azure. Alternatively, you can also rewrite the SSIS ETL logic natively in ADF using [Dataflows](../../../data-factory/concepts-data-flow-overview.md).


#### SQL Server Reporting Services
Migrate SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports to paginated reports in Power BI. Use theâ€¯[RDL Migration Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/RdlMigration) to help prepare and migrate your reports. This tool was developed by Microsoft to help customers migrate RDL reports from their SSRS servers to Power BI. It is available on GitHub, and it documents an end-to-end walkthrough of the migration scenario. 

#### High availability
Manual setup of SQL Server high availability features like Always On failover cluster instances and Always On availability groups become obsolete on the target Azure SQL Database as high availability architecture is already built into both [General Purpose (standard availability model)](../../database/high-availability-sla.md#basic-standard-and-general-purpose-service-tier-locally-redundant-availability) and [Business Critical (premium availability model)](../../database/high-availability-sla.md#premium-and-business-critical-service-tier-locally-redundant-availability) SQL Database. The Business Critical / Premium Service Tier also provides read scale-out that allows connecting into one of the secondary nodes for read-only purposes. 

Beyond the high availability architecture that is included in SQL Database, there is also the [auto-failover groups](../../database/auto-failover-group-overview.md) feature that allows you to manageâ€¯the replication and failover of databases in a managed instance to another region. 

#### SQL Agent jobs
SQL Agent jobs are not directly supported in Azure SQL Database and will need to be deployed to [Elastic Database Jobs (Preview)](../../database/job-automation-overview.md#elastic-database-jobs-preview).

#### Logins and groups
Move SQL logins from the source SQL Server to Azure SQL Database using Database Migration Service (DMS) in offline mode.  Use the **Selected logins** blade in the **Migration Wizard** to migrate logins to your target SQL Database. 

Windows users and groups can also be migrated using DMS by enabling the corresponding toggle button in the DMS Configuration page. 

Alternatively, you can use the [PowerShell utility tool](https://github.com/microsoft/DataMigrationTeam/tree/master/IP%20and%20Scripts/MoveLogins) specially designed by the Microsoft Data Migration Architects. The utility uses PowerShell to create a Transact-SQL (T-SQL) script to recreate logins and select database users from the source to the target. The tool automatically maps Windows AD accounts to Azure AD accounts, and can do a UPN lookup for each login against the source Active Directory. The tool scripts custom server and database roles, as well as role membership, database role, and user permissions. Contained databases are not yet supported and only a subset of possible SQL Server permissions are scripted. 


#### System databases
For Azure SQL Database, the only applicable system databases are [master](/sql/relational-databases/databases/master-database) and tempdb. To learn more, see [Tempdb in Azure SQL Database](/sql/relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database#tempdb-database-in-sql-database).

## Leverage advanced features 

Be sure to take advantage of the advanced cloud-based features offered by SQL Database. For example, you no longer need to worry about managing backups as the service does it for you. You can restore to any [point in time within the retention period](../../database/recovery-using-backups.md#point-in-time-restore). 

To strengthen security, consider usingâ€¯[Azure Active Directory Authentication](../../database/authentication-aad-overview.md), [auditing](../../database/auditing-overview.md),â€¯[threat detection](../../database/azure-defender-for-sql.md),â€¯[row-level security](/sql/relational-databases/security/row-level-security), andâ€¯[dynamic data masking](/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking).

In addition to advanced management and security features, SQL Database provides a set of advanced tools that can help you [monitor and tune your workload](../../database/monitor-tune-overview.md). [Azure SQL Analytics (Preview)](../../../azure-monitor/insights/azure-sql.md) is an advanced cloud monitoring solution for monitoring performance of all of your databases in Azure SQL Database at scale and across multiple subscriptions in a single view. Azure SQL Analytics collects and visualizes key performance metrics with built-in intelligence for performance troubleshooting.

[Automatic tuning](/sql/relational-databases/automatic-tuning/automatic-tuning#automatic-plan-correction)â€¯continuously monitors performance of your SQL execution plan statistics and automatically fixes identified performance issues.
