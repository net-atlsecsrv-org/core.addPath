# Migration guide: Oracle to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This guide teaches you to migrate your Oracle schemas to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines by using SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle. 

For other migration guides, see [Database Migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-migration). 

## Prerequisites 

To migrate your Oracle schema to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, you need:

- A supported source environment.
- [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258).
- A target [SQL Server VM](../../virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart.md).
- The [necessary permissions for SSMA for Oracle](/sql/ssma/oracle/connecting-to-oracle-database-oracletosql) and the [provider](/sql/ssma/oracle/connect-to-oracle-oracletosql).
- Connectivity and sufficient permissions to access the source and the target. 


## Pre-migration

To prepare to migrate to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you've addressed any prerequisites. Doing so will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

This part of the process involves: 
- Conducting an inventory of the databases that you need to migrate.
- Assessing those databases for potential migration problems or blockers. 
- Resolving any problems that you uncover. 

### Discover

Use [MAP Toolkit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=316883) to identify existing data sources and details about the features your business is using. Doing so will give you a better understanding of the migration and help you plan for it. This process involves scanning the network to identify your organization's Oracle instances and the versions and features you're using.

To use MAP Toolkit to do an inventory scan, follow these steps: 


1. Open [MAP Toolkit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=316883).


1. Select **Create/Select database**:

Validate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements, if necessary. To do so, follow these steps: 


1. On the **Tools** menu, select **Project Settings**. 
1. Select the **Type Mappings** tab. 

   ![Screenshot that shows the Type Mappings tab.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/type-mappings.png)

1. You can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in **Oracle Metadata Explorer**. 

### Convert the schema

To convert the schema, follow these steps: 

1. (Optional) To convert dynamic or ad-hoc queries, right-click the node and select **Add statement**.

1. Select **Connect to SQL Server** in the top menu. 
     1. Enter connection details for your SQL Server on Azure VM. 
     1. Select your target database from the list, or provide a new name. If you provide a new name, a database will be created on the target server. 
     1. Provide authentication details. 
     1. Select **Connect**. 


   ![Screenshot that shows how to connect to SQL Server.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/connect-to-sql-vm.png)

## Migrate

After you have the necessary prerequisites in place and have completed the tasks associated with the pre-migration stage, you're ready to start the schema and data migration. Migration involves two steps: publishing the schema and migrating the data. 


To publish your schema and migrate the data, follow these steps: 

1. Publish the schema: right-click the database in **SQL Server Metadata Explorer** and select **Synchronize with Database**. Doing so publishes the Oracle schema to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. 

   ![Screenshot that shows the Synchronize with Database command.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/synchronize-database.png)

   Review the mapping between your source project and your target:

   ![Screenshot that shows the synchronization status.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/synchronize-database-review.png)



1. Migrate the data: right-click the database or object that you want to migrate in **Oracle Metadata Explorer** and select **Migrate Data**. Alternatively, you can select **Migrate Data** in the top menu.

   To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expand **Tables**, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear appropriate the check boxes.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Migrate Data command.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/migrate-data.png)

1. Provide connection details for Oracle and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the dialog box.
1. After the migration finishes, view the **Data Migration Report**:

    ![Screenshot that shows the Data Migration Report.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/data-migration-report.png)

1. Connect to your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines instance by using [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms). Validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema:


   ![Screenshot that shows a SQL Server instance in SSMA.](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/validate-in-ssms.png)

Instead of using SSMA, you could use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to migrate the data. To learn more, see: 
- The article [SQL Server Integration Services](https://docs.microsoft.com//sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services).
- The white paper [SSIS for Azure and Hybrid Data Movement](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/0/D20E1C5F-72EA-4505-9F26-FEF9550EFD44/SSIS%20Hybrid%20and%20Azure.docx).


## Post-migration 

After you complete the migration stage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is running as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

### Remediate applications

After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that previously consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Making those changes might require changes to the applications.

[Data Access Migration Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-databasemigration.data-access-migration-toolkit) is an extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows you to analyze your Java source code and detect data access API calls and queries. The toolkit provides a single-pane view of what needs to be addressed to support the new database back end. To learn more, see [Migrate your Java application from Oracle](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-data-migration/migrate-your-java-applications-from-oracle-to-sql-server-with/ba-p/368727). 

### Perform tests

To test your database migration, complete these activities:

1. **Develop validation tests**. To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. Create the validation queries to run against both the source and target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope that you've defined.

2. **Set up a test environment**. The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

3. **Run validation tests**. Run the validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.

4. **Run performance tests**. Run performance test against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.

### Optimize

The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy problems and verifying completeness. It's also critical for addressing performance issues with the workload.

> [!Note]
> For more information about these problems and specific steps to mitigate them, see the [Post-migration validation and optimization guide](/sql/relational-databases/post-migration-validation-and-optimization-guide).
