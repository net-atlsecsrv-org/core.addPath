# Migration guide: Oracle to SQL Server on Azure VM
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This guide teaches you to migrate your Oracle schemas to SQL Server on Azure VM using SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle. 

For other migration guides, see [Database Migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-migration). 

## Prerequisites 

To migrate your Oracle schema to SQL Server on Azure VM, you need:

- To verify your source environment is supported.
- To download [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258).
- A target [SQL Server VM](../../virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart.md).
- The [necessary permissions for SSMA for Oracle](/sql/ssma/oracle/connecting-to-oracle-database-oracletosql) and [provider](/sql/ssma/oracle/connect-to-oracle-oracletosql).
- Connectivity and sufficient permissions to access both source and target. 


## Pre-migration

As you prepare for migrating to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

This part of the process involves conducting an inventory of the databases that you need to migrate, assessing those databases for potential migration issues or blockers, and then resolving any items you might have uncovered. 

### Discover

Use the [MAP Toolkit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=316883) to identify existing data sources and details about the features that are being used by your business to get a better understanding of and plan for the migration. This process involves scanning the network to identify all your organization's Oracle instances together with the version and features in use.

To use the MAP Toolkit to perform an inventory scan, follow these steps: 

1. Open the [MAP Toolkit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=316883).
1. Select **Create/Select database**:

   ![Select database](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/select-database.png)

1. Select **Create an inventory database**, enter a name for the new inventory database you're creating, provide a brief description, and then select **OK**:

1. Select **Options** to generate a report about the Oracle Assessment and database details. Select both options (one by one) to generate the report.


### Assess

After identifying the data sources, use the [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258) to assess the Oracle instance(s) migrating to the SQL Server VM so that you understand the gaps between the two. Using the migration assistant, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Server, and then migrate data to SQL Server.

To create an assessment, follow these steps: 

1. Open the  [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258). 
1. Select **File** and then choose **New Project**. 
1. Provide a project name, a location to save your project, and then select a SQL Server migration target from the drop-down. Select **OK**:

   ![New project](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/new-project.png)

1. Select **Connect to Oracle**. Enter in values for Oracle connection details on the **Connect to Oracle** dialog box:

   ![Connect to Oracle](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/connect-to-oracle.png)

   Select the Oracle schema(s) you want to migrate: 

   ![Select Oracle schema](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/select-schema.png)

1. Right-click the Oracle schema you want to migrate in the **Oracle Metadata Explorer**, and then choose **Create report**. This will generate an HTML report. Alternatively, you can choose **Create report** from the navigation bar after selecting the database:

   ![Create Report](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/create-report.png)

1. In **Oracle Metadata Explorer**, select the Oracle schema, and then select **Create Report** to generate an HTML report with conversion statistics and error/warnings, if any.
1. Review the HTML report to understand conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Oracle objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects. 

   For example: `drive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyOracleMigration\report\report_2016_11_12T02_47_55\`
    
   ![Conversion Report](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/conversion-report.png)

### Validate data types

Validate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements if necessary. To do so, follow these steps: 

1. Select **Tools** from the menu. 
1. Select **Project Settings**. 
1. Select the **Type mappings** tab:

   ![Type Mappings](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/type-mappings.png)

1. You can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in the **Oracle Metadata explorer**. 

### Convert schema

To convert the schema, follow these steps: 

1. (Optional) To convert dynamic or ad-hoc queries, right-click the node and choose **Add statement**.
1. Select **Connect to SQL Server** from the top-line navigation bar. 
     1. Enter connection details for your SQL Server on Azure VM. 
     1. Choose your target database from the drop-down, or provide a new name, in which case a database will be created on the target server. 
     1. Provide authentication details. 
     1. Select **Connect**. 

   ![Connect to SQL](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/connect-to-sql-vm.png)

1. Right-click the Oracle schema in the **Oracle Metadata Explorer** and choose **Convert Schema**. Alternatively, you can select **Convert schema** from the top-line navigation bar:

   ![Convert Schema](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/convert-schema.png)

1. After the conversion completes, compare and review the converted objects to the original objects to identify potential problems and address them based on the recommendations:

   ![Review recommendations](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/table-mapping.png)

   Compare the converted Transact-SQL text to the original stored procedures and review the recommendations: 

   ![Review recommendations code](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/procedure-comparison.png)

   You can save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. You can do so by selecting **Save Project** from the **File** menu. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you can publish the schema to SQL Server.

1. Select **Review results** in the Output pane, and review errors in the **Error list** pane.

## Migrate

After you have the necessary prerequisites in place and have completed the tasks associated with the **Pre-migration** stage, you are ready to perform the schema and data migration. Migration involves two steps – publishing the schema and migrating the data. 


To publish your schema and migrate the data, follow these steps: 

1. Publish the schema: Right-click the database from the **SQL Server Metadata Explorer**  and choose **Synchronize with Database**. This action publishes the Oracle schema to SQL Server on Azure VM:

   ![Synchronize with database](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/synchronize-database.png)

   Review the mapping between your source project and your target:

   ![Review synchronization status](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/synchronize-database-review.png)


1. Migrate the data: Right-click the database or object you want to migrate in **Oracle Metadata Explorer**, and choose **Migrate data**. Alternatively, you can select **Migrate Data** from the top-line navigation bar. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expand Tables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box:

   ![Migrate Data](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/migrate-data.png)

1. Provide connection details for Oracle and SQL Server on Azure VM at the dialog box.
1. After migration completes, view the **Data Migration Report**:  

    ![Data Migration Report](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/data-migration-report.png)

1. Connect to your SQL Server on Azure VM instance by using [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) and validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema:

   ![Validate in SSMA](./media/oracle-to-sql-on-azure-vm-guide/validate-in-ssms.png)


In addition to using SSMA, you can also use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to migrate the data. To learn more, see: 
- The article [Getting Started with SQL Server Integration Services](https://docs.microsoft.com//sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services).
- The white paper [SQL Server Integration Services: SSIS for Azure and Hybrid Data Movement](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/0/D20E1C5F-72EA-4505-9F26-FEF9550EFD44/SSIS%20Hybrid%20and%20Azure.docx).



## Post-migration 

After you have successfully completed the **Migration** stage, you need to go through a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

### Remediate applications

After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this will in some cases require changes to the applications.

The [Data Access Migration Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-databasemigration.data-access-migration-toolkit) is an extension for Visual Studio Code that allows you to analyze your Java source code and detect data access API calls and queries, providing you with a single-pane view of what needs to be addressed to support the new database back end. To learn more, see the [Migrate our Java application from Oracle](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-data-migration/migrate-your-java-applications-from-oracle-to-sql-server-with/ba-p/368727) blog. 

### Perform tests

The test approach for database migration consists of performing the following activities:

1. **Develop validation tests**. To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you have defined.

2. **Set up test environment**. The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

3. **Run validation tests**. Run the validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.

4. **Run performance tests**. Run performance test against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.

### Optimize

The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues and verifying completeness, as well as addressing performance issues with the workload.

> [!Note]
> For additional detail about these issues and specific steps to mitigate them, see the [Post-migration Validation and Optimization Guide](/sql/relational-databases/post-migration-validation-and-optimization-guide).
