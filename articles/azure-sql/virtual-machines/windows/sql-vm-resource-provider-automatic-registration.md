# Automatic registration with SQL VM resource provider
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

Enable the automatic registration feature in the Azure portal to automatically register all current and future SQL Server on Azure VMs with the SQL VM resource provider in lightweight mode.

This article teaches you to enable the automatic registration feature. Alternatively, you can [register a single VM](sql-vm-resource-provider-register.md), or [register your VMs in bulk](sql-vm-resource-provider-bulk-register.md) with the SQL VM resource provider. 

## Overview

The [SQL VM resource provider](sql-vm-resource-provider-register.md#overview) allows you to manage your SQL Server VM from the Azure portal. Additionally, the resource provider enables a robust feature set, including [automated patching](automated-patching.md), [automated backup](automated-backup.md), as well as monitoring and manageability capabilities. It also unlocks [licensing](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md) and [edition](change-sql-server-edition.md) flexibility. Previously, these features were only available to SQL Server VM images deployed from Azure Marketplace. 

The automatic registration feature allows customers to automatically register all current and future SQL Server VMs in their Azure subscription with the SQL VM resource provider. This is different from manual registration , which only focus on current SQL Server VMs. 

Automatic registration registers your SQL Server VMs in lightweight mode. You still need to [manually upgrade to full manageability mode](sql-vm-resource-provider-register.md#upgrade-to-full) to take advantage of the full feature set. 

## Prerequisites

To register your SQL Server VM with the resource provider, you'll need: 

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- An Azure Resource Model [Windows virtual machine](../../../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md) with [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) deployed to the public or Azure Government cloud. 


## Enable

To enable automatic registration of your SQL Server VMs in the Azure portal, follow the steps:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to the [**SQL virtual machines**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine%2FSqlVirtualMachines) resource page. 
1. Select **Automatic SQL Server VM registration** to open the **Automatic registration** page. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-vm-resource-provider-automatic-registration/automatic-registration.png" alt-text="Select Automatic SQL Server VM registration to open the automatic registration page":::

1. Choose your subscription from the drop-down. 
1. Read through the terms and if you agree, select **I accept**. 
1. Select **Register** to enable the feature and automatically register all current and future SQL Server VMs with the SQL VM resource provider. This will not restart the SQL Server service on any of the VMs. 

## Disable

Use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) to disable the automatic registration feature. When the automatic registration feature is disabled, SQL Server VMs added to the subscription need to be manually registered with the SQL VM resource provider. This will not unregister existing SQL Server VMs that have already been registered.



# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To disable automatic registration using Azure CLI, run the following command: 

```azurecli-interactive
az feature unregister --namespace Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine --name BulkRegistration
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To disable automatic registration using Azure PowerShell, run the following command: 

```powershell-interactive
Unregister-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName BulkRegistration -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine
```

## Next steps

Upgrade your manageability mode to [full](sql-vm-resource-provider-register.md#upgrade-to-full) to take advantage of the full feature set provided to you by the SQL VM resource provider.
