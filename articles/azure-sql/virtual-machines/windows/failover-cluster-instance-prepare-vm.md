# Prepare virtual machines for an FCI (SQL Server on Azure VMs)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

This article describes how to prepare Azure virtual machines (VMs) to use them with a SQL Server failover cluster instance (FCI). Configuration settings vary depending on the FCI storage solution, so validate that you're choosing the correct configuration to suit your environment and business. 

To learn more, see an overview of [FCI with SQL Server on Azure VMs](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md) and [cluster best practices](hadr-cluster-best-practices.md). 

## Prerequisites 

- A Microsoft Azure subscription. Get started for [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
- A Windows domain on Azure virtual machines or an on-premises datacenter extended to Azure with virtual network pairing.
- An account that has permissions to create objects on Azure virtual machines and in Active Directory.
- An Azure virtual network and subnet with enough IP address space for these components:
   - Both virtual machines
   - The IP address of the Windows failover cluster
   - An IP address for each FCI
- DNS configured on the Azure network, pointing to the domain controllers.

## Choose an FCI storage option

The configuration settings for your virtual machine vary depending on the storage option you're planning to use for your SQL Server failover cluster instance. Before you prepare the virtual machine, review the [available FCI storage options](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md#storage) and choose the option that best suits your environment and business need. Then carefully select the appropriate VM configuration options throughout this article based on your storage selection. 

## Configure VM availability 

The failover cluster feature requires virtual machines to be placed in an [availability set](../../../virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-availability-sets.md) or an [availability zone](../../../availability-zones/az-overview.md#availability-zones). If you choose availability sets, you can use [proximity placement groups](../../../virtual-machines/windows/co-location.md#proximity-placement-groups) to locate the VMs closer. In fact, proximity placement groups are a prerequisite for using Azure shared disks. 

Carefully select the VM availability option that matches your intended cluster configuration: 

 - **Azure shared disks**: [Availability set](../../../virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets.md#create-an-availability-set) configured with the fault domain and update domain set to 1 and placed inside a [proximity placement group](../../../virtual-machines/windows/proximity-placement-groups-portal.md).
 - **Premium file shares**: [Availability set](../../../virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets.md#create-an-availability-set) or [availability zone](../../../virtual-machines/windows/create-portal-availability-zone.md#confirm-zone-for-managed-disk-and-ip-address). Premium file shares are the only shared storage option if you choose availability zones as the availability configuration for your VMs. 
 - **Storage Spaces Direct**: [Availability set](../../../virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets.md#create-an-availability-set).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can't set or change the availability set after you've created a virtual machine.

## Create the virtual machines

After you've configured your VM availability, you're ready to create your virtual machines. You can choose to use an Azure Marketplace image that does or doesn't have SQL Server already installed on it. However, if you choose an image for SQL Server on Azure VMs, you'll need to uninstall SQL Server from the virtual machine before configuring the failover cluster instance. 


Place both virtual machines:

- In the same Azure resource group as your availability set, if you're using availability sets.
- On the same virtual network as your domain controller.
- On a subnet that has enough IP address space for both virtual machines and all FCIs that you might eventually use on the cluster.
- In the Azure availability set or availability zone.

You can create an Azure virtual machine by using an image [with](sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart.md) or [without](../../../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md) SQL Server preinstalled to it. If you choose the SQL Server image, you'll need to manually uninstall the SQL Server instance before installing the failover cluster instance. 


## Uninstall SQL Server

As part of the FCI creation process, you'll install SQL Server as a clustered instance to the failover cluster. *If you deployed a virtual machine with an Azure Marketplace image without SQL Server, you can skip this step.* If you deployed an image with SQL Server preinstalled, you'll need to unregister the SQL Server VM from the SQL VM resource provider, and then uninstall SQL Server. 

### Unregister from the SQL VM resource provider

SQL Server VM images from Azure Marketplace are automatically registered with the SQL VM resource provider. Before you uninstall the preinstalled SQL Server instance, you must first [unregister each SQL Server VM from the SQL VM resource provider](sql-vm-resource-provider-register.md#unregister-from-rp). 

### Uninstall SQL Server

After you've unregistered from the resource provider, you can uninstall SQL Server. Follow these steps on each virtual machine: 

1. Connect to the virtual machine by using RDP.

   When you first connect to a virtual machine by using RDP, a prompt asks you if you want to allow the PC to be discoverable on the network. Select **Yes**.

1. If you're using one of the SQL Server-based virtual machine images, remove the SQL Server instance:

   1. In **Programs and Features**, right-click **Microsoft SQL Server 201_ (64-bit)** and select **Uninstall/Change**.
   1. Select **Remove**.
   1. Select the default instance.
   1. Remove all features under **Database Engine Services**. Don't remove anything under **Shared Features**. You'll see something like the following screenshot:

      ![Select features](./media/failover-cluster-instance-prepare-vm/03-remove-features.png)

   1. Select **Next**, and then select **Remove**.
   1. After the instance is successfully removed, restart the virtual machine. 

## Open the firewall 

On each virtual machine, open the Windows Firewall TCP port that SQL Server uses. By default, this is port 1433. But you can change the SQL Server port on an Azure VM deployment, so open the port that SQL Server uses in your environment. This port is automatically open on SQL Server images deployed from Azure Marketplace. 

If you use a [load balancer](hadr-vnn-azure-load-balancer-configure.md), you'll also need to open the port that the health probe uses. By default, this is port 59999. But it can be any TCP port that you specify when you create the load balancer. 

This table details the ports that you might need to open, depending on your FCI configuration: 

   | Purpose | Port | Notes
   | ------ | ------ | ------
   | SQL Server | TCP 1433 | Normal port for default instances of SQL Server. If you used an image from the gallery, this port is automatically opened. </br> </br> **Used by**: All FCI configurations. |
   | Health probe | TCP 59999 | Any open TCP port. Configure the load balancer [health probe](hadr-vnn-azure-load-balancer-configure.md#configure-health-probe) and the cluster  to use this port. </br> </br> **Used by**: FCI with load balancer. |
   | File share | UDP 445 | Port that the file share service uses. </br> </br> **Used by**: FCI with Premium file share. |

## Join the domain

You also need to join your virtual machines to the domain. You can do so by using a [quickstart template](../../../active-directory-domain-services/join-windows-vm-template.md#join-an-existing-windows-server-vm-to-a-managed-domain). 

## Review storage configuration

Virtual machines created from Azure Marketplace come with attached storage. If you plan to configure your FCI storage by using Premium file shares or Azure shared disks, you can remove the attached storage to save on costs because local storage is not used for the failover cluster instance. However, it's possible to use the attached storage for Storage Spaces Direct FCI solutions, so removing them in this case might be unhelpful. Review your FCI storage solution to determine if removing attached storage is optimal for saving costs. 


## Next steps

Now that you've prepared your virtual machine environment, you're ready to configure your failover cluster instance.
