# Resource limits for single databases using the DTU purchasing model - Azure SQL Database
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This article provides the detailed resource limits for Azure SQL Database single databases using the DTU purchasing model.

For DTU purchasing model resource limits for elastic pools, see [DTU resource limits - elastic pools](resource-limits-dtu-elastic-pools.md). For vCore resource limits, see [vCore resource limits - single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md) and [vCore resource limits - elastic pools](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md). For more information regarding the different purchasing models, see [Purchasing models and service tiers](purchasing-models.md).

## Single database: Storage sizes and compute sizes

The following tables show the resources available for a single database at each service tier and compute size. You can set the service tier, compute size, and storage amount for a single database using the [Azure portal](single-database-manage.md#azure-portal), [Transact-SQL](single-database-manage.md#transact-sql-t-sql), [PowerShell](single-database-manage.md#powershell), the [Azure CLI](single-database-manage.md#azure-cli), or the [REST API](single-database-manage.md#rest-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For scaling guidance and considerations, see [Scale a single database](single-database-scale.md)

### Basic service tier

| **Compute size** | **Basic** |
| :--- | --: |
| Max DTUs | 5 |
| Included storage (GB) | 2 |
| Max storage choices (GB) | 2 |
| Max in-memory OLTP storage (GB) |N/A |
| Max concurrent workers (requests) | 30 |
| Max concurrent sessions | 300 |
|||

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Basic service tier provides less than one vCore (CPU).  For CPU-intensive workloads, a service tier of S3 or greater is recommended. 
>
>Regarding data storage, the Basic service tier is placed on Standard Page Blobs. Standard Page Blobs use hard disk drive (HDD)-based storage media and are best suited for development, testing, and other infrequently accessed workloads that are less sensitive to performance variability.

### Standard service tier

| **Compute size** | **S0** | **S1** | **S2** | **S3** |
| :--- |---:| ---:|---:|---:|
| Max DTUs | 10 | 20 | 50 | 100 |
| Included storage (GB) | 250 | 250 | 250 | 250 |
| Max storage choices (GB) | 250 | 250 | 250 | 250, 500, 750, 1024 |
| Max in-memory OLTP storage (GB) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Max concurrent workers (requests)| 60 | 90 | 120 | 200 |
| Max concurrent sessions |600 | 900 | 1200 | 2400 |

### Premium service tier

| :--- |---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Max DTUs | 125 | 250 | 500 | 1000 | 1750 | 4000 |
| Included storage (GB) | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 4096* | 4096* |
| Max storage choices (GB) | 500, 750, 1024 | 500, 750, 1024 | 500, 750, 1024 | 500, 750, 1024 | 4096* | 4096* |
| Max in-memory OLTP storage (GB) | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 14 | 32 |
| Max concurrent workers (requests)| 200 | 400 | 800 | 1600 | 2400 | 6400 |
| Max concurrent sessions | 30000 | 30000 | 30000 | 30000 | 30000 | 30000 |

\* From 1024 GB up to 4096 GB in increments of 256 GB

> [!IMPORTANT]
> More than 1 TB of storage in the Premium tier is currently available in all regions except: China East, China North, Germany Central, Germany Northeast, West Central US, US DoD regions, and US Government Central. In these regions, the storage max in the Premium tier is limited to 1 TB.  For more information, see [P11-P15 current limitations](single-database-scale.md#p11-and-p15-constraints-when-max-size-greater-than-1-tb).
