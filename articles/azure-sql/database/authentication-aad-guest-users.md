# Create Azure AD guest users and set as an Azure AD admin

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This article is in **public preview**.

Guest users in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are users that have been imported into the current Azure AD from other Azure Active Directories, or outside of it. For example, guest users can include users from other Azure Active Directories, or from accounts like *\@outlook.com*, *\@hotmail.com*, 
*\@live.com*, or *\@gmail.com*. This article will demonstrate how to create an Azure AD guest user, and set that user as an Azure AD admin for the Azure SQL logical server, without needing to have that guest user be part of a group inside Azure AD.

## Feature description

This feature lifts the current limitation that only allows guest users to connect to Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse Analytics when they're members of a group created in Azure AD. The group needed to be mapped to a user manually using the [CREATE USER (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-user-transact-sql) statement in a given database. Once a database user has been created for the Azure AD group containing the guest user, the guest user can sign into the database using Azure Active Directory with MFA authentication. As part of this **public preview**, guest users can be created and connect directly to SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse without the requirement of adding them to an Azure AD group first, and then creating a database user for that Azure AD group.

As part of this feature, you also have the ability to set the Azure AD guest user directly as an AD admin for the Azure SQL logical server. The existing functionality where the guest user can be part of an Azure AD group, and that group can then be set as the Azure AD admin for the Azure SQL logical server is not impacted. Guest users in the database that are a part of an Azure AD group are also not impacted by this change.

For more information about existing support for guest users using Azure AD groups, see [Using multi-factor Azure Active Directory authentication](authentication-mfa-ssms-overview.md).

## Prerequisite

- [Az.Sql 2.9.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Sql/2.9.0) module or higher is needed when using PowerShell to set a guest user as an Azure AD admin for the Azure SQL logical server.

## Create database user for Azure AD guest user 

Follow these steps to create a database user using an Azure AD guest user.

### Create guest user in SQL Database and Azure Synapse

1. Ensure that the guest user (for example, `user1@gmail.com`) is already added into your Azure AD and an Azure AD admin has been set for the database server. Having an Azure AD admin is required for Azure Active Directory authentication.

1. Connect to the SQL database as the Azure AD admin or an Azure AD user with sufficient SQL permissions to create users, and run the below command on the database where the guest user needs to be added:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER [user1@gmail.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER
    ```

1. There should now be a database user created for the guest user `user1@gmail.com`.

1. Run the below command to verify the database user got created successfully:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals
    ```

1. Disconnect and sign into the database as the guest user `user1@gmail.com` using [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) using the authentication method **Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA**. For more information, see [Using multi-factor Azure Active Directory authentication](authentication-mfa-ssms-overview.md).

### Create guest user in SQL Managed Instance

> [!NOTE]
> SQL Managed Instance supports logins for Azure AD users, as well as Azure AD contained database users. The below steps show how to create a login and user for an Azure AD guest user in SQL Managed Instance. You can also choose to create a [contained database user](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/contained-database-users-making-your-database-portable) in SQL Managed Instance by using the method in the [Create guest user in SQL Database and Azure Synapse](#create-guest-user-in-sql-database-and-azure-synapse) section.

1. Ensure that the guest user (for example, `user1@gmail.com`) is already added into your Azure AD and an Azure AD admin has been set for the SQL Managed Instance server. Having an Azure AD admin is required for Azure Active Directory authentication.

1. Connect to the SQL Managed Instance server as the Azure AD admin or an Azure AD user with sufficient SQL permissions to create users, and run the following command on the `master` database to create a login for the guest user:

    ```sql
    CREATE LOGIN [user1@gmail.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER
    ```

1. There should now be a login created for the guest user `user1@gmail.com` in the `master` database.

1. Run the below command to verify the login got created successfully:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.server_principals
    ```

1. Run the below command on the database where the guest user needs to be added: 

    ```sql
    CREATE USER [user1@gmail.com] FROM LOGIN [user1@gmail.com]
    ```

1. There should now be a database user created for the guest user `user1@gmail.com`.

1. Disconnect and sign into the database as the guest user `user1@gmail.com` using [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) using the authentication method **Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA**. For more information, see [Using multi-factor Azure Active Directory authentication](authentication-mfa-ssms-overview.md).

## Setting a guest user as an Azure AD admin

Follow these steps to set an Azure AD guest user as the Azure AD admin for the SQL logical server.

### Set Azure AD admin for SQL Database and Azure Synapse

1. Ensure that the guest user (for example, `user1@gmail.com`) is already added into your Azure AD.

1. Run the following PowerShell command to add the guest user as the Azure AD admin for your Azure SQL logical server:

    - Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with your Azure Resource Group name that contains the Azure SQL logical server.
    - Replace `<ServerName>` with your Azure SQL logical server name. If your server name is `myserver.database.windows.net`, replace `<Server Name>` with `myserver`.
    - Replace `<DisplayNameOfGuestUser>` with your guest user name.

    ```powershell
    Set-AzSqlServerActiveDirectoryAdministrator -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -ServerName <ServerName> -DisplayName <DisplayNameOfGuestUser>
    ```

    You can also use the Azure CLI command [az sql server ad-admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/server/ad-admin) to set the guest user as an Azure AD admin for your Azure SQL logical server.

### Set Azure AD admin for SQL Managed Instance

1. Ensure that the guest user (for example, `user1@gmail.com`) is already added into your Azure AD.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and go to your **Azure Active Directory** resource. Under **Manage**, go to the **Users** pane. Select your guest user, and record the `Object ID`. 

1. Run the following PowerShell command to add the guest user as the Azure AD admin for your SQL Managed Instance:

    - Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with your Azure Resource Group name that contains the SQL Managed Instance.
    - Replace `<ManagedInstanceName>` with your SQL Managed Instance name.
    - Replace `<DisplayNameOfGuestUser>` with your guest user name.
    - Replace `<AADObjectIDOfGuestUser>` with the `Object ID` gathered earlier.

    ```powershell
    Set-AzSqlInstanceActiveDirectoryAdministrator -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -InstanceName "<ManagedInstanceName>" -DisplayName <DisplayNameOfGuestUser> -ObjectId <AADObjectIDOfGuestUser>
    ```

    You can also use the Azure CLI command [az sql mi ad-admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/mi/ad-admin) to set the guest user as an Azure AD admin for your SQL Managed Instance.

## Limitations

There is a limitation on the Azure portal that prevents selecting an Azure AD guest user as the Azure AD admin for SQL Managed Instance. For guest accounts outside of your Azure AD like *\@outlook.com*, *\@hotmail.com*, *\@live.com*, or *\@gmail.com*, the AD admin selector shows these accounts, but they are grayed out and cannot be selected. Use the above listed [PowerShell or CLI commands](#setting-a-guest-user-as-an-azure-ad-admin) to set the Azure AD admin. Alternatively, an Azure AD group containing the guest user can be set as the Azure AD admin for the SQL Managed Instance.

This functionality will be enabled for SQL Managed Instance prior to General Availability of this feature.
