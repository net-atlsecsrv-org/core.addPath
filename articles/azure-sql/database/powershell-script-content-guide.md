# Azure PowerShell samples for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance enable you to configure your databases, instances, and pools using Azure PowerShell.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires AZ PowerShell 1.4.0 or later. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Additional resources

The examples listed on this page use the [PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/module/az.sql/) for creating and managing Azure SQL resources. Additional cmdlets for running queries, and performing many database tasks are located in the [sqlserver](/powershell/module/sqlserver/) module. For more information, see [SQL Server PowerShell](/sql/powershell/sql-server-powershell/).
