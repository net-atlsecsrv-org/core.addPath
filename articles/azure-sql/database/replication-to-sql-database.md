# Replication to Azure SQL Database
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

You can configure an Azure SQL Database as the push subscriber in a one-way transactional or snapshot replication topology.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the use of [transactional replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/transactional/transactional-replication) in Azure SQL Database. It is unrelated to [active geo-replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-active-geo-replication), an Azure SQL Database feature that allows you to create complete readable replicas of individual databases.

## Supported Configurations
  
- Azure SQL Database can only be the push subscriber of a SQL Server publisher and distributor.  
- The SQL Server acting as publisher and/or distributor can be an instance of [SQL Server running on-premises](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads), an [Azure SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/instance-create-quickstart.md), or an instance of [SQL Server running on an Azure virtual machine in the cloud](../virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart.md). 
- The distribution database and the replication agents cannot be placed on an Azure SQL Database.  
- [Snapshot](/sql/relational-databases/replication/snapshot-replication) and [one-way transactional](/sql/relational-databases/replication/transactional/transactional-replication) replication are supported. Peer-to-peer transactional replication and merge replication are not supported.

### Versions  

To successfully replicate to an Azure SQL Database, SQL Server publishers and distributors must be using (at least) one of the following versions: 

Publishing to any Azure SQL Database from a SQL Server database is supported by the following versions of SQL Server:

- SQL Server 2016 and greater
- SQL Server 2014 [RTM CU10 (12.0.4427.24)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3094220/cumulative-update-10-for-sql-server-2014) or [SP1 CU3 (12.0.2556.4)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3094221/cumulative-update-3-for-sql-server-2014-service-pack-1)
- SQL Server 2012 [SP2 CU8 (11.0.5634.1)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3082561/cumulative-update-8-for-sql-server-2012-sp2) or [SP3 (11.0.6020.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49996)

> [!NOTE]
> Attempting to configure replication using an unsupported version can result in error number MSSQL_REPL20084 (The process could not connect to Subscriber.) and MSSQL_REPL40532 (Cannot open server \<name> requested by the login. The login failed.).  

To use all the features of Azure SQL Database, you must be using the latest versions of [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) and [SQL Server Data Tools](/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt).  

### Types of replication

There are different [types of replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/types-of-replication):

| Replication | Azure SQL Database | Azure SQL Managed Instance |
| :----| :------------- | :--------------- |
| [**Standard Transactional**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/transactional/transactional-replication) | Yes (only as subscriber) | Yes | 
| [**Snapshot**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/snapshot-replication) | Yes (only as subscriber) | Yes|
| [**Merge replication**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/merge/merge-replication) | No | No|
| [**Peer-to-peer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/transactional/peer-to-peer-transactional-replication) | No | No|
| [**Bidirectional**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/transactional/bidirectional-transactional-replication) | No | Yes|
| [**Updatable subscriptions**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/transactional/updatable-subscriptions-for-transactional-replication) | No | No|
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

  
## Remarks

- Only push subscriptions to Azure SQL Database are supported.  
- Replication can be configured by using [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) or by executing Transact-SQL statements on the publisher. You cannot configure replication by using the Azure portal.  
- Replication can only use SQL Server authentication logins to connect to Azure SQL Database.
- Replicated tables must have a primary key.  
- You must have an existing Azure subscription.  
- The Azure SQL Database subscriber can be in any region.  
- A single publication on SQL Server can support both Azure SQL Database and SQL Server (on-premises and SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine) subscribers.  
- Replication management, monitoring, and troubleshooting must be performed from SQL Server rather than Azure SQL Database.  
- Only `@subscriber_type = 0` is supported in **sp_addsubscription** for SQL Database.  
- Azure SQL Database does not support bi-directional, immediate, updatable, or peer-to-peer replication.

## Replication Architecture  

![replication-to-sql-database](./media/replication-to-sql-database/replication-to-sql-database.png)  

## Scenarios  

### Typical Replication Scenario  

1. Create a transactional replication publication on a SQL Server database.  
2. On SQL Server use the **New Subscription Wizard** or Transact-SQL statements to create a push to subscription to Azure SQL Database.  
3. With single and pooled databases in Azure SQL Database, the initial data set is a snapshot that is created by the Snapshot Agent and distributed and applied by the Distribution Agent. With a SQL Managed Instance publisher, you can also use a database backup to seed the Azure SQL Database subscriber.

### Data Migration Scenario  

1. Use transactional replication to replicate data from a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database.  
2. Redirect the client or middle-tier applications to update the database copy.  
3. Stop updating the SQL Server version of the table and remove the publication.  

## Limitations

The following options are not supported for Azure SQL Database subscriptions:

- Copy file groups association  
- Copy table partitioning schemes  
- Copy index partitioning schemes  
- Copy user defined statistics  
- Copy default bindings  
- Copy rule bindings  
- Copy fulltext indexes  
- Copy XML XSD  
- Copy XML indexes  
- Copy permissions  
- Copy spatial indexes  
- Copy filtered indexes  
- Copy data compression attribute  
- Copy sparse column attribute  
- Convert filestream to MAX data types  
- Convert hierarchyid to MAX data types  
- Convert spatial to MAX data types  
- Copy extended properties  
- Copy permissions  

### Limitations to be determined

- Copy collation  
- Execution in a serialized transaction of the SP  

## Examples

Create a publication and a push subscription. For more information, see:
  
- [Create a Publication](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/publish/create-a-publication)
- [Create a Push Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/create-a-push-subscription/) by using the server name as the subscriber (for example **N'azuresqldbdns.database.windows.net'**) and the Azure SQL Database name as the destination database (for example **AdventureWorks**).
