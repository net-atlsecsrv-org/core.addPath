# vCore model overview - Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance 
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

The virtual core (vCore) purchasing model used by Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance provides several benefits:

- Higher compute, memory, I/O, and storage limits.
- Control over the hardware generation to better match compute and memory requirements of the workload.
- Pricing discounts for [Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)](../azure-hybrid-benefit.md) and [Reserved Instance (RI)](reserved-capacity-overview.md).
- Greater transparency in the hardware details that power the compute, that facilitates planning for migrations from on-premises deployments.

## Service tiers

Service tier options in the vCore model include General Purpose, Business Critical, and Hyperscale. The service tier generally defines the storage architecture, space and I/O limits, and business continuity options related to availability and disaster recovery.

|-|**General Purpose**|**Business Critical**|**Hyperscale**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Best for|Most business workloads. Offers budget-oriented, balanced, and scalable compute and storage options. |Offers business applications the highest resilience to failures by using several isolated replicas, and provides the highest I/O performance per database replica.|Most business workloads with highly scalable storage and read-scale requirements.  Offers higher resilience to failures by allowing configuration of more than one isolated database replica. |
|Storage|Uses remote storage.<br/>**SQL Database provisioned compute**:<br/>5 GB – 4 TB<br/>**Serverless compute**:<br/>5 GB - 3 TB<br/>**SQL Managed Instance**: 32 GB - 8 TB |Uses local SSD storage.<br/>**SQL Database provisioned compute**:<br/>5 GB – 4 TB<br/>**SQL Managed Instance**:<br/>32 GB - 4 TB |Flexible autogrow of storage as needed. Supports up to 100 TB of storage. Uses local SSD storage for local buffer-pool cache and local data storage. Uses Azure remote storage as final long-term data store. |
|IOPS and throughput (approximate)|**SQL Database**: See resource limits for [single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md) and [elastic pools](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md).<br/>**SQL Managed Instance**: See [Overview Azure SQL Managed Instance resource limits](../managed-instance/resource-limits.md#service-tier-characteristics).|See resource limits for [single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md) and [elastic pools](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md).|Hyperscale is a multi-tiered architecture with caching at multiple levels. Effective IOPS and throughput will depend on the workload.|
|Availability|1 replica, no read-scale replicas|3 replicas, 1 [read-scale replica](read-scale-out.md),<br/>zone-redundant high availability (HA)|1 read-write replica, plus 0-4 [read-scale replicas](read-scale-out.md)|
|Backups|[Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](../../storage/common/geo-redundant-design.md), 7-35 days (7 days by default)|[RA-GRS](../..//storage/common/geo-redundant-design.md), 7-35 days (7 days by default)|Snapshot-based backups in Azure remote storage. Restores use these snapshots for fast recovery. Backups are instantaneous and don't impact compute I/O performance. Restores are fast and aren't a size-of-data operation (taking minutes rather than hours or days).|

### Choosing a service tier

For information on selecting a service tier for your particular workload, see the following articles:

- [When to choose the General Purpose service tier](service-tier-general-purpose.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)
- [When to choose the Business Critical service tier](service-tier-business-critical.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)
- [When to choose the Hyperscale service tier](service-tier-hyperscale.md#who-should-consider-the-hyperscale-service-tier)


## Compute tiers

Compute tier options in the vCore model include the provisioned and serverless compute tiers.


### Provisioned compute

The provisioned compute tier provides a specific amount of compute resources that are continuously provisioned independent of workload activity, and bills for the amount of compute provisioned at a fixed price per hour.


### Serverless compute

The [serverless compute tier](serverless-tier-overview.md) auto-scales compute resources based on workload activity, and bills for the amount of compute used per second.



## Hardware generations

Hardware generation options in the vCore model include Gen 4/5, M-series, and Fsv2-series. The hardware generation generally defines the compute and memory limits and other characteristics that impact the performance of the workload.

### Gen4/Gen5

- Gen4/Gen5 hardware provides balanced compute and memory resources, and is suitable for most database workloads that do not have higher memory, higher vCore, or faster single vCore requirements as provided by Fsv2-series or M-series.

For regions where Gen4/Gen5 is available, see [Gen4/Gen5 availability](#gen4gen5-1).

### Fsv2-series

- Fsv2-series is a compute optimized hardware option delivering low CPU latency and high clock speed for the most CPU demanding workloads.
- Depending on the workload, Fsv2-series can deliver more CPU performance per vCore than Gen5, and the 72 vCore size can provide more CPU performance for less cost than 80 vCores on Gen5. 
- Fsv2 provides less memory and tempdb per vCore than other hardware so workloads sensitive to those limits may want to consider Gen5 or M-series instead.  

Fsv2-series in only supported in the General Purpose tier. For regions where Fsv2-series is available, see [Fsv2-series availability](#fsv2-series-1).


### M-series

- M-series is a memory optimized hardware option for workloads demanding more memory and higher compute limits than provided by Gen5.
- M-series provides 29 GB per vCore and up to 128 vCores, which increases the memory limit relative to Gen5 by 8x to nearly 4 TB.

M-series is only supported in the Business Critical tier and does not support zone redundancy.  For regions where M-series is available, see [M-series availability](#m-series-1).

#### Azure offer types supported by M-series

To access M-series, the subscription must be a paid offer type including Pay-As-You-Go or Enterprise Agreement (EA).  For a complete list of Azure offer types supported by M-series, see [current offers without spending limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details).

<!--
To enable M-series hardware for a subscription and region, a support request must be opened. The subscription must be a paid offer type including Pay-As-You-Go or Enterprise Agreement (EA).  If the support request is approved, then the selection and provisioning experience of M-series follows the same pattern as for other hardware generations. For regions where M-series is available, see [M-series availability](#m-series).
