# Azure Security Baseline for Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure SQL Database contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](../../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: You can enable Azure Private Link to allow access Azure PaaS Services (for example, SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet.

To allow traffic to reach Azure SQL Database, use the SQL service tags to allow outbound traffic through Network Security Groups.

Virtual network rules enable Azure SQL Database to only accept communications that are sent from selected subnets inside a virtual network.

How to set up Private Link for Azure SQL Database:

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the subnet your Azure SQL Database is deployed to.

For Azure Virtual Machines (VM) that will be connecting to your Azure SQL Database, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs for the NSGs protecting those VMs and send logs into a Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.
