# Azure security baseline for Azure SQL Database

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure SQL Database. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure SQL Database. **Controls** not applicable to Azure SQL Database have been excluded.

To see how Azure SQL Database completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure SQL Database security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: You can enable Azure Private Link to allow access Azure PaaS Services (for example, SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. 

To allow traffic to reach Azure SQL Database, use the SQL service tags to allow outbound traffic through Network Security Groups.

Virtual network rules enable Azure SQL Database to only accept communications that are sent from selected subnets inside a virtual network.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the subnet your Azure SQL Database Server is deployed to. 

For Azure Virtual Machines (VM) that will be connecting to your Azure SQL Database Server instance, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs for the NSGs protecting those VMs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing. 

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags  to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

When using service endpoints for Azure SQL Database, outbound to Azure SQL Database Public IP addresses is required: Network Security Groups (NSGs) must be opened to Azure SQL Database IPs to allow connectivity. You can do this by using NSG service tags for Azure SQL Database.

- [Understand and using Service Tags](../../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement network security configurations for your Azure SQL Database server instances with Azure Policy. You may use the "Microsoft.Sql" namespace to define custom policy definitions, or use any of the built-in policy definitions designed for Azure SQL Database server network protection. An example of an applicable built-in network security policy for Azure SQL Database server would be: "SQL Server should use a virtual network service endpoint".

 

Use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Management templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.
