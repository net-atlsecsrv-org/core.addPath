# Using multi-factor Azure Active Directory authentication
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa.md)]

Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics support connections from [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) using *Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA* authentication. This article discusses the differences between the various authentication options, and also the limitations associated with using Universal Authentication in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Azure SQL.

**Download the latest SSMS** - On the client computer, download the latest version of SSMS, from [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx).

For all the features discussed in this article, use at least July 2017, version 17.2. The most recent connection dialog box, should look similar to the following image:

  ![Screenshot of the Connect to Server dialog in SQL Server Management Studio, showing settings for Server type, Server name, and Authentication.](./media/authentication-mfa-ssms-overview/1mfa-universal-connect.png)  

## Authentication options

There are two non-interactive authentication models for Azure AD, which can be used in many different applications (ADO.NET, JDCB, ODC, and so on). These two methods never result in pop-up dialog boxes:

- `Azure Active Directory - Password`
- `Azure Active Directory - Integrated`

The interactive method that also supports Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is: 

- `Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA`

Azure MFA helps safeguard access to data and applications while meeting user demand for a simple sign-in process. It delivers strong authentication with a range of easy verification options (phone call, text message, smart cards with pin, or mobile app notification), allowing users to choose the method they prefer. Interactive MFA with Azure AD can result in a pop-up dialog box for validation.

For a description of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, see [Multi-Factor Authentication](../../active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication.md).
For configuration steps, see [Configure Azure SQL Database multi-factor authentication for SQL Server Management Studio](authentication-mfa-ssms-configure.md).

### Azure AD domain name or tenant ID parameter

Beginning with [SSMS version 17](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms), users that are imported into the current Azure AD from other Azure Active Directories as guest users, can provide the Azure AD domain name, or tenant ID when they connect. Guest users include users invited from other Azure ADs, Microsoft accounts such as outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, or other accounts like gmail.com. This information allows `Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA` authentication to identify the correct authenticating authority. This option is also required to support Microsoft accounts (MSA) such as outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, or non-MSA accounts. 

All guest users who want to be authenticated using Universal Authentication must enter their Azure AD domain name or tenant ID. This parameter represents the current Azure AD domain name or tenant ID that the Azure SQL logical server is associated with. For example, if the SQL logical server is associated with the Azure AD domain `contosotest.onmicrosoft.com`, where user `joe@contosodev.onmicrosoft.com` is hosted as an imported user from the Azure AD domain `contosodev.onmicrosoft.com`, the domain name required to authenticate this user is `contosotest.onmicrosoft.com`. When the user is a native user of the Azure AD associated to SQL logical server, and is not an MSA account, no domain name or tenant ID is required. To enter the parameter (beginning with SSMS version 17.2):


1. Open a connection in SSMS. Input your server name, and select **Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA** authentication. Add the **User name** that you want to sign in with.
1. Select the **Options** box, and go over to the **Connection Properties** tab. In the **Connect to Database** dialog box, complete the dialog box for your database. Check the **AD domain name or tenant ID** box, and provide authenticating authority, such as the domain name (**contosotest.onmicrosoft.com**) or the GUID of the tenant ID. 

   ![Screenshot of the Connection Properties tab highlighting the settings for Connect to database and AD domain name or tenant ID.](./media/authentication-mfa-ssms-overview/mfa-tenant-ssms.png)

If you are running SSMS 18.x or later, the AD domain name or tenant ID is no longer needed for guest users because 18.x or later automatically recognizes it.

### Azure AD business to business support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for guest users to connect to Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse without the need to be part of a group is currently in **public preview**. For more information, see [Create Azure AD guest users and set as an Azure AD admin](authentication-aad-guest-users.md).

Azure AD users that are supported for Azure AD B2B scenarios as guest users (see [What is Azure B2B collaboration](../../active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b.md)) can connect to SQL Database and Azure Synapse only as part of members of a group created in the associated Azure AD, and mapped manually using the [CREATE USER (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-user-transact-sql) statement in a given database. For example, if `steve@gmail.com` is invited to Azure AD `contosotest` (with the Azure AD domain `contosotest.onmicrosoft.com`), an Azure AD group, such as `usergroup` must be created in the Azure AD that contains the `steve@gmail.com` member. Then, this group must be created for a specific database (for example, `MyDatabase`) by an Azure AD SQL admin or Azure AD DBO,  by executing the Transact-SQL `CREATE USER [usergroup] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER` statement. 

After the database user is created, then the user `steve@gmail.com` can sign into `MyDatabase` using the SSMS authentication option `Azure Active Directory â€“ Universal with MFA`. By default, the `usergroup` has only the connect permission. Any further data access will need to be [granted](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/grant-transact-sql) in the database by a user with enough privilege. 

> [!NOTE]
> For SSMS 17.x, using `steve@gmail.com` as a guest user, you must check the **AD domain name or tenant ID** box and add the AD domain name `contosotest.onmicrosoft.com` in the **Connection Property** dialog box. The **AD domain name or tenant ID** option is only supported for the **Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA** authentication. Otherwise, the check box it is greyed out.

## Universal Authentication limitations

- SSMS and SqlPackage.exe are the only tools currently enabled for MFA through Active Directory Universal Authentication.
- SSMS version 17.2 supports multi-user concurrent access using Universal Authentication with MFA. For SSMS version 17.0 and 17.1, the tool restricts a login for an instance of SSMS using Universal Authentication to a single Azure Active Directory account. To sign in as another Azure AD account, you must use another instance of SSMS. This restriction is limited to Active Directory Universal Authentication; you can sign into a different server using `Azure Active Directory - Password` authentication, `Azure Active Directory - Integrated` authentication, or `SQL Server Authentication`.
- SSMS supports Active Directory Universal Authentication for Object Explorer, Query Editor, and Query Store visualization.
- SSMS version 17.2 provides DacFx Wizard support for Export/Extract/Deploy Data database. Once a specific user is authenticated through the initial authentication dialog using Universal Authentication, the DacFx Wizard functions the same way it does for all other authentication methods.
- The SSMS Table Designer does not support Universal Authentication.
- There are no additional software requirements for Active Directory Universal Authentication except that you must use a supported version of SSMS.  
- See the following link for the latest Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) version for Universal authentication: [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/).

- When using **Azure Active Directory- Universal with MFA** authentication, ADAL tracing is available beginning with [SSMS 17.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

The traces are available in the output window when selecting **Azure Active Directory option**.
