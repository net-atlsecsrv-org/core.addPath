# Automated backups - Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

Both Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance create database backups that are kept for the duration of the configured retention period. They use Azure [read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md) to ensure backups are preserved even if the datacenter is unavailable.

Database backups are an essential part of any business continuity and disaster recovery strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion. If your security rules require that your backups are available for an extended time (up to 10 years), you can configure [long-term retention](long-term-retention-overview.md) for both single and pooled databases.

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## What is a SQL Database backup?

Both SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance use SQL Server technology to create [full backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/full-database-backups-sql-server) every week, [differential backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/differential-backups-sql-server) every 12 hours, and [transaction log backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/transaction-log-backups-sql-server) every 5 to 10 minutes. The backups are stored in [RA-GRS storage blobs](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md) that are replicated to a [paired datacenter](../../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md) for protection against a datacenter outage. When you restore a database, the service determines which full, differential, and transaction log backups need to be restored.

You can use these backups to:

- **Restore an existing database to a point in time in the past** within the retention period by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API. For single and pooled databases, this operation will create a new database on the same server in the same subscription as the original database. In a managed instance, this operation can create a copy of the database or the same or a different managed instance under the same subscription.
- **Restore a deleted database to the time of deletion** or anytime within the retention period. The deleted database can be restored only on the same server or managed instance and in the same subscription where the original database was created.
- **Restore a database to another geographic region**. Geo-restore allows you to recover from a geographic disaster when you can't access your server and database. It creates a new database on any existing server, anywhere in the world.
- **Restore a database from a specific long-term backup** on a single database or pooled database, if the database is configured with a long-term retention policy (LTR). LTR allows you to restore an old version of the database by using [the Azure portal](long-term-backup-retention-configure.md#using-azure-portal) or [Azure PowerShell](long-term-backup-retention-configure.md#using-powershell) to satisfy a compliance request or to run an old version of the application. For more information, see [Long-term retention](long-term-retention-overview.md).

To perform a restore, see [Restore database from backups](recovery-using-backups.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In Azure Storage, the term *replication* refers to copying files from one location to another. In Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance, *database replication* refers to keeping multiple secondary databases synchronized with a primary database.

You can try some of these operations by using the following examples:

## Backup frequency

### Point-in-time restore

SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance support self-service for point-in-time restore (PITR) by automatically creating full backups, differential backups, and transaction log backups. Full database backups are created weekly, and differential database backups are generally created every 12 hours. Transaction log backups are generally created every 5 to 10 minutes. The frequency of transaction log backups is based on the compute size and the amount of database activity.

The first full backup is scheduled immediately after a database is created. This backup usually completes within 30 minutes, but it can take longer when the database is large. For example, the initial backup can take longer on a restored database or a database copy. After the first full backup, all further backups are scheduled automatically and managed silently in the background. The exact timing of all database backups is determined by SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance as it balances the overall system workload. You can't change or disable the backup jobs.

### Default backup retention period

PITR backups are protected with geo-redundant storage. For more information, see [Azure Storage redundancy](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md).

For more information about PITR, see [Point-in-time restore](recovery-using-backups.md#point-in-time-restore).

### Long-term retention

For single and pooled databases, you can configure long-term retention (LTR) of full backups for up to 10 years in Azure Blob storage. If you enable LTR policy, the weekly full backups are automatically copied to a different RA-GRS storage container. To meet various compliance requirements, you can select different retention periods for weekly, monthly, and/or yearly backups. The storage consumption depends on the selected frequency of backups and the retention period or periods. You can use the [LTR pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=sql-database) to estimate the cost of LTR storage.

Like PITR backups, LTR backups are protected with geo-redundant storage. For more information, see [Azure Storage redundancy](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md).

For more information about LTR, see [Long-term backup retention](long-term-retention-overview.md).

## Backup storage consumption

For single databases and managed instances, this equation is used to calculate the total backup storage usage:

`Total backup storage size = (size of full backups + size of differential backups + size of log backups) â€“ database size`

For pooled databases, the total backup storage size is aggregated at the pool level and is calculated as follows:

`Total backup storage size = (total size of all full backups + total size of all differential backups + total size of all log backups) - allocated pool data storage`

Backups that occur before the retention period are automatically purged based on their timestamp. Because differential backups and log backups require an earlier full backup to be useful, they're purged together in weekly chunks.

SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance compute your total in-retention backup storage as a cumulative value. Every hour, this value is reported to the Azure billing pipeline, which is responsible for aggregating this hourly usage to calculate your consumption at the end of each month. After the database is dropped, consumption decreases as backups age. After backups become older than the retention period, billing stops.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Backups of a database are retained for the specified retention period, even if the database has been dropped. While dropping and re-creating a database can frequently save on storage and compute costs, it might increase backup storage costs because Microsoft retains a backup for the specified retention period for each dropped database, every time it's dropped. 

### Monitor consumption

Each type of backup (full, differential, and log) is reported on the database monitoring blade as a separate metric. The following diagram shows how to monitor the backup storage consumption for a single database. This feature is currently unavailable for managed instances.

![Monitor database backup consumption in the Azure portal](./media/automated-backups-overview/backup-metrics.png)

### Fine-tune backup storage consumption

Excess backup storage consumption will depend on the workload and the size of the individual databases. Consider some of the following tuning techniques to reduce your backup storage consumption:

- Reduce the [backup retention period](#change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period-by-using-the-azure-portal) to the minimum possible for your needs.
- Avoid doing large write operations, like index rebuilds, more frequently than you need to.
- For large data load operations, consider using [clustered columnstore indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/using-clustered-columnstore-indexes), reduce the number of non-clustered indexes, and consider bulk load operations with row count around 1 million.
- In the general purpose service tier, the provisioned data storage is less expensive than the price of the excess backup storage. If you have continually high excess backup storage costs, you might consider increasing the data storage to save on the backup storage.
- Use TempDB instead of permanent tables in your ETL logic for storing temporary results. (Applicable only to SQL Managed Instance.)
- Consider turning off TDE encryption for databases that don't contain sensitive data (development or test databases, for example). Backups for non-encrypted databases are typically compressed with a higher compression ratio.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For analytical data mart \ data warehouse workloads, we strongly recommend that you use [clustered columnstore indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/using-clustered-columnstore-indexes), reduce the number of non-clustered indexes, and consider bulk load operations with row count around 1 million to reduce excess backup storage consumption.

## Storage costs

The price for storage varies depending on whether you're using the DTU model or the vCore model.

### DTU model

There's no additional charge for backup storage for databases and elastic database pools if you're using the DTU model.

### vCore model

For single databases in SQL Database, a minimum backup storage amount equal to 100 percent of the database size is provided at no extra charge. For elastic pools in SQL Database and single instances and instance pools in SQL Managed Instance, a minimum backup storage amount equal to 100 percent of the allocated data storage for the pool or instance size, respectively, is provided at no extra charge. Additional consumption of backup storage will be charged in GB/month. This additional consumption will depend on the workload and size of the individual databases.

SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance will compute your total in-retention backup storage as a cumulative value. Every hour, this value is reported to the Azure billing pipeline, which is responsible for aggregating this hourly usage to get your consumption at the end of each month. After the database is dropped, Microsoft decreases the consumption as the backups age. After backups become older than the retention period, billing stops. Because all log backups and differential backups are retained for the full retention period, heavily modified databases will have higher backup charges.

Assume a database has accumulated 744 GB of backup storage and that this amount stays constant throughout an entire month. To convert this cumulative storage consumption to hourly usage, divide it by 744.0 (31 days per month * 24 hours per day). So SQL Database will report that the database consumed 1 GB of PITR backup each hour. Azure billing will aggregate this consumption and show a usage of 744 GB for the entire month. The cost will be based on the $/GB/month rate in your region.

Now, a more complex example. Suppose the database has its retention increased to 14 days in the middle of the month. Assume this increase (hypothetically) results in the total backup storage doubling to 1,488 GB. SQL Database would report 1 GB of usage for hours 1 through 372. It would report the usage as 2 GB for hours 373 through 744. This usage would be aggregated to a final bill of 1,116 GB/month.

### Monitor costs

To understand backup storage costs, go to **Cost Management + Billing** in the Azure portal, select **Cost Management**, and then select **Cost analysis**. Select the desired subscription as the **Scope**, and then filter for the time period and service that you're interested in.

Add a filter for **Service name**, and then select **sql database** in the drop-down list. Use the **meter subcategory** filter to choose the billing counter for your service. For a single database or an elastic database pool, select **single/elastic pool pitr backup storage**. For a managed instance, select **mi pitr backup storage**. The **Storage** and **compute** subcategories might interest you as well, but they're not associated with backup storage costs.

![Backup storage cost analysis](./media/automated-backups-overview/check-backup-storage-cost-sql-mi.png)

## Backup retention

All databases in SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance have a default backup retention period of 7 days. You can [change the backup retention period](#change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period) to as long as 35 days.

If you delete a database, Azure keeps the backups in the same way it would for an online database. For example, if you delete a Basic database that has a retention period of seven days, a backup that's four days old is saved for three more days.

If you need to keep the backups for longer than the maximum retention period, you can modify the backup properties to add one or more long-term retention periods to your database. For more information, see [Long-term retention](long-term-retention-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting up backup retention period to 1 day (or to any value between 1 - 7) is only supported via PowerShell or REST API at this time. Minimum required version of Az.SQL module is v2.6.0, or it can be executed through CloudShell which always has the latest Az.SQL version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete the server or managed instance, all databases managed by that server or managed instance are also deleted. They can't be recovered. You can't restore a deleted server or managed instance. But if you configured long-term retention for SQL Database or manged instance, the backups for the databases with LTR won't be deleted, and these databases can be restored.

## Encrypted backups

If your database is encrypted with TDE, backups are automatically encrypted at rest, including LTR backups. When TDE is enabled for SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance, backups are also encrypted. All new databases in SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance are configured with TDE enabled by default. For more information on TDE, see  [Transparent Data Encryption with SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql).

## Backup integrity

On an ongoing basis, the Azure SQL engineering team automatically tests the restore of automated database backups of databases in SQL Database. (This testing isn't available in SQL Managed Instance.) Upon point-in-time restore, databases also receive DBCC CHECKDB integrity checks.

SQL Managed Instance takes an automatic initial backup with `CHECKSUM` of databases restored with the native `RESTORE` command or with Azure Data Migration Service after the migration is completed.

Any issues found during the integrity check will result in an alert to the engineering team. For more information, see [Data Integrity in SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/data-integrity-in-azure-sql-database/).

## Compliance

When you migrate your database from a DTU-based service tier to a vCore-based service tier, the PITR retention is preserved to ensure that your application's data recovery policy isn't compromised. If the default retention doesn't meet your compliance requirements, you can change the PITR retention period by using PowerShell or the REST API. For more information, see [Change the PITR backup retention period](#change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period).

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## Change the PITR backup retention period

You can change the default PITR backup retention period by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the REST API. The following examples illustrate how to change the PITR retention to 28 days.

> [!WARNING]
> If you reduce the current retention period, all existing backups that are older than the new retention period are no longer available. If you increase the current retention period, Azure keeps the existing backups until the end of the longer retention period is reached.

> [!NOTE]
> These APIs will affect only the PITR retention period. If you configured LTR for your database, it won't be affected. For information about how to change LTR retention periods, see [Long-term retention](long-term-retention-overview.md).

### Change the PITR backup retention period by using the Azure portal

To change the PITR backup retention period by using the Azure portal, go to the server object whose retention period you want to change in the portal. Then select the appropriate option based on the server object you're modifying.

#### [SQL Database](#tab/single-database)

Changes to PITR backup retention for SQL Database are done at the server level. Changes made at the server level apply to databases on the server. To change PITR retention for a server from the Azure portal, go to the server overview blade. Select **Manage Backups** in the left pane, and then select **Configure retention** at the top of the screen:

![Change PITR retention, server level](./media/automated-backups-overview/configure-backup-retention-sqldb.png)

#### [SQL Managed Instance](#tab/managed-instance)

Changes to PITR backup retention for SQL Managed Instance are done at an individual database level. To change PITR backup retention for an instance database from the Azure portal, go to the individual database overview blade. Then select **Configure backup retention** at the top of the screen:

![Change PITR retention, managed instance](./media/automated-backups-overview/configure-backup-retention-sqlmi.png)

### Change the PITR backup retention period by using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PowerShell AzureRM module is still supported by SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance, but all future development is for the Az.Sql module. For more information, see [AzureRM.Sql](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureRM.Sql/). The arguments for the commands in the Az module are substantially identical to those in the AzureRm modules.

```powershell
Set-AzSqlDatabaseBackupShortTermRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName resourceGroup -ServerName testserver -DatabaseName testDatabase -RetentionDays 28
```

### Change the PITR backup retention period by using the REST API

#### Sample request

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444/resourceGroups/resourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/testserver/databases/testDatabase/backupShortTermRetentionPolicies/default?api-version=2017-10-01-preview
