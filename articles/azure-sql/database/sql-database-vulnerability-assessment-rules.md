# SQL Vulnerability Assessment rules reference guide
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

This article lists the set of built-in rules that are used to flag security vulnerabilities and highlight deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data. The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover both database-level issues as well as server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions. These rules also represent many of the requirements from various regulatory bodies to meet their compliance standards.

The rules shown in your database scans depend on the SQL version and platform that was scanned. 

To learn about how to implement Vulnerability Assessment in Azure, see [Implement Vulnerability Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment#implement-vulnerability-assessment).

|VA1068     |Server permissions shouldn't be granted directly to principals         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |Server level permissions are associated with a server level object to regulate which users can gain access to the object. This rule checks that there are no server level permissions granted directly to logins.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1069     |Permissions to select from system tables and views should be revoked from non-sysadmins         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |Non-sysadmin permissions to select from system tables and views exist out of the box and are typically used by tools such as SSMS. This rule enumerates which system tables and views can be accessed by non-sysadmins.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1070     |Database users shouldn't share the same name as a server login         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |Database users may share the same name as a server login. This rule validates that there are no such users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1071     |'Scan for startup stored procedures' option should be disabled         |Surface Area Reduction         |Medium         |When 'Scan for startup procs' is enabled SQL Server scans for and runs all automatically run stored procedures defined on the server. If this option is enabled SQL Server scans for and runs all automatically run stored procedures defined on the server. This rule checks that this option is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1072     |Authentication mode should be Windows Authentication         |Authentication and Authorization         |Medium         |There are two possible authentication modes: Windows Authentication mode and mixed mode. Mixed mode means that SQL Server enables both Windows authentication and SQL Server authentication. This rule checks that the authentication mode is set to Windows Authentication.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1091     |Auditing of both successful and failed login attempts (default trace) should be enabled when 'Login auditing' is set up to track logins         |Auditing and Logging         |Low         |SQL Server Login auditing configuration enables administrators to track the users logging into SQL Server instances. If the user chooses to count on 'Login auditing' to track users logging into SQL Server instances, then it is important to enable it for both successful and failed login attempts.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1092     |SQL Server instance shouldn't be advertised by the SQL Server Browser service         |Surface Area Reduction         |Low         |SQL Server uses the SQL Server Browser service to enumerate instances of the Database Engine installed on the computer. This enables client applications to browse for a server and helps clients distinguish between multiple instances of the Database Engine on the same computer. This rule checks that the SQL instance is hidden.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1093     |Maximum number of error logs should be 12 or more         |Auditing and Logging         |Low         |Each SQL Server Error log will have all the information related to failures / errors that have occurred since SQL Server was last restarted or since the last time you have recycled the error logs.

|VA1095     |Excessive permissions should not be granted to PUBLIC role         |Authentication and Authorization         |Medium         |Every SQL Server login belongs to the public server role. When a server principal has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object the user inherits the permissions granted to public on that object. This displays a list of all permissions that are granted to the PUBLIC role.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1096     |Principal GUEST should not be granted permissions in the database         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST. Permissions granted to GUEST are inherited by users who have access to the database but who do not have a user account in the database. This rule checks that all permissions have been revoked from the GUEST user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1097     |Principal GUEST should not be granted permissions on objects or columns         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST. Permissions granted to GUEST are inherited by users who have access to the database but who do not have a user account in the database. This rule checks that all permissions have been revoked from the GUEST user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |

This rule checks that any existing endpoint requires AES encryption.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1099     |GUEST user should not be granted permissions on database securables         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST. Permissions granted to GUEST are inherited by users who have access to the database but who do not have a user account in the database. This rule checks that all permissions have been revoked from the GUEST user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1102     |The Trustworthy bit should be disabled on all databases except MSDB         |Surface Area Reduction         |High         |The TRUSTWORTHY database property is used to indicate whether the instance of SQL Server trusts the database and the contents within it. If this option is enabled database modules (for example user-defined functions or stored procedures) that use an impersonation context can access resources outside the database. This rule verifies that the TRUSTWORTHY bit is disabled on all databases except MSDB.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1143     |'dbo' user should not be used for normal service operation         |Surface Area Reduction         |Medium         |The 'dbo' or database owner is a user account that has implied permissions to perform all activities in the database. Members of the sysadmin fixed server role are automatically mapped to dbo. This rule checks that dbo is not the only account allowed to access this database. Note that on a newly created clean database this rule will fail until additional roles are created.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1144     |Model database should only be accessible by 'dbo'         |Surface Area Reduction         |Medium         |The Model database is used as the template for all databases created on the instance of SQL Server. Modifications made to the model database such as database size recovery model and other database options are applied to any databases created afterward. This rule checks that dbo is the only account allowed to access the model database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1219     |Transparent data encryption should be enabled         |Data Protection         |Medium         |Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect against the threat of malicious activity by performing real-time encryption and decryption of the database associated backups and transaction log files 'at rest' without requiring changes to the application. This rule checks that TDE is enabled on the database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1220     |Database communication using TDS should be protected through TLS         |Data Protection         |High         |Microsoft SQL Server can use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data that is transmitted across a network between an instance of SQL Server and a client application. This rule checks that all connections to the SQL Server are encrypted through TLS.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1221     |Database Encryption Symmetric Keys should use AES algorithm         |Data Protection         |High         |SQL Server uses encryption keys to help secure data credentials and connection information that is stored in a server database. SQL Server has two kinds of keys: symmetric and asymmetric. This rule checks that Database Encryption Symmetric Keys use AES algorithm.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1222     |Cell-Level Encryption keys should use AES algorithm         |Data Protection         |High         |Cell-Level Encryption (CLE) allows you to encrypt your data using symmetric and asymmetric keys. This rule checks that Cell-Level Encryption symmetric keys use AES algorithm.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1223     |Certificate keys should use at least 2048 bits         |Data Protection         |High         |Certificate keys are used in RSA and other encryption algorithms to protect data. These keys need to be of enough length to secure the user's data. This rule checks that the key's length is at least 2048 bits for all certificates.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |

|VA1229     |Filestream setting in registry and in SQL Server configuration should match         |Surface Area Reduction         |High         |There are two settings governing Filestream option one in the registry (OS level) and one in SQL Server configuration. This rule checks that the two settings match.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1230     |Filestream should be disabled         |Surface Area Reduction         |High         |FILESTREAM integrates the SQL Server Database Engine with an NTFS file system by storing varbinary(max) binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. Transact-SQL statements can insert update query search and back up FILESTREAM data. This rule checks that Filestream is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1231     |Filestream should be disabled (SQL)         |Surface Area Reduction         |High         |FILESTREAM integrates the SQL Server Database Engine with an NTFS file system by storing varbinary(max) binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. Transact-SQL statements can insert update query search and back up FILESTREAM data. This rule checks that Filestream SQL specific option is disabled         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>          |
|VA1234     |Common Criteria setting should be enabled         |Auditing and Logging         |Low         |The Common Criteria enabled setting enables several elements and behaviors that are required for common criteria compliance. This rule checks that this option is enabled. Notice this option isn't available in standard edition. For full details Please visit: [Common Criteria Compliance Enabled Server Configuration](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/common-criteria-compliance-enabled-server-configuration-option) and [SQL Server Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2019).        |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>          |
|VA1235     |Replication XPs should be disabled         |Surface Area Reduction         |Medium         |Disable Replication XPs attack surface area         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1244     |Orphaned users should be removed from SQL server databases         |Surface Area Reduction         |Medium         |A database user that exists on a database but has no corresponding login in the master database or as an external resource (for example, a Windows user) is referred to as an orphaned user and it should either be removed or remapped to a valid login. This rule checks that there are no orphaned users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1245     |The dbo information should be consistent between the target DB and master         |Surface Area Reduction         |High         |There is redundant information about the dbo identity for any database: metadata stored in the database itself and metadata stored in master DB. This rule checks that this information is consistent between the target DB and master.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed <br/>Instance         |
|VA1246     |Application roles should not be used         |Authentication and Authorization         |Low         |An application role is a database principal that enables an application to run with its own user-like permissions.
