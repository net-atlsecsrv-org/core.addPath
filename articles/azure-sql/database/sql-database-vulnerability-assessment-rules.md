# SQL Vulnerability Assessment rules reference guide
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa.md)]

This article lists the set of built-in rules that are used to flag security vulnerabilities and highlight deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data. The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover both database-level issues as well as server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions. These rules also represent many of the requirements from various regulatory bodies to meet their compliance standards.

The rules shown in your database scans depend on the SQL version and platform that was scanned. 

To learn about how to implement Vulnerability Assessment in Azure, see [Implement Vulnerability Assessment](./sql-vulnerability-assessment.md#implement-vulnerability-assessment).

For a list of changes to these rules, see [SQL Vulnerability Assessment rules changelog](sql-database-vulnerability-assessment-rules-changelog.md).

## Authentication and Authorization

|Rule ID  |Rule Title   |Rule Severity  |Rule Description  |Platform  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| VA1017     |Execute permissions on xp_cmdshell from all users (except dbo) should be revoked          |High         |The xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure spawns a Windows command shell, passing in a string for execution. This rule checks that no users (other than users with the CONTROL SERVER permission like members of the sysadmin server role) have permission to execute the xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<sup>1</sup><nobr/>         |
|VA1020     |Database user GUEST should not be a member of any role          |High         |The guest user permits access to a database for any logins that are not mapped to a specific database user. This rule checks that no database roles are assigned to the Guest user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1042     |Database ownership chaining should be disabled for all databases except for `master`, `msdb`, and `tempdb`          |High         |Cross database ownership chaining is an extension of ownership chaining, except it does cross the database boundary. This rule checks that this option is disabled for all databases except for `master`, `msdb`, and `tempdb` . For `master`, `msdb`, and `tempdb`, cross database ownership chaining is enabled by default.        |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1043     |Principal GUEST should not have access to any user database          |Medium         |The guest user permits access to a database for any logins that are not mapped to a specific database user. This rule checks that the guest user cannot connect to any database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance        |
|VA1046     |CHECK_POLICY should be enabled for all SQL logins          |Low         |CHECK_POLICY option enables verifying SQL logins against the domain policy. This rule checks that CHECK_POLICY option is enabled for all SQL logins.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1047     |Password expiration check should be enabled for all SQL logins          |Low         |Password expiration policies are used to manage the lifespan of a password. When SQL Server enforces password expiration policy, users are reminded to change old passwords, and accounts that have expired passwords are disabled. This rule checks that password expiration policy is enabled for all SQL logins.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1048     |Database principals should not be mapped to the `sa` account          |High         |A database principal that is mapped to the `sa` account can be exploited by an attacker to elevate permissions to `sysadmin`         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1052     |Remove BUILTIN\Administrators as a server login          |Low         |The BUILTIN\Administrators group contains the Windows Local Administrators group. In older versions of Microsoft SQL Server this group has administrator rights by default. This rule checks that this group is removed from SQL Server.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1053     |Account with default name `sa` should be renamed or disabled          |Low         |`sa` is a well-known account with principal ID 1. This rule verifies that the `sa` account is either renamed or disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1054     |Excessive permissions should not be granted to PUBLIC role on objects or columns          |Low         |Every SQL Server login belongs to the public server role. When a server principal has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object the user inherits the permissions granted to public on that object. This rule displays a list of all securable objects or columns that are accessible to all users through the PUBLIC role.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1058     |`sa` login should be disabled          |High         |`sa` is a well-known account with principal ID 1. This rule verifies that the `sa` account is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1059     |xp_cmdshell should be disabled          |High         |xp_cmdshell spawns a Windows command shell and passes it a string for execution. This rule checks that xp_cmdshell is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1067     |Database Mail XPs should be disabled when it is not in use          |Medium         |This rule checks that Database Mail is disabled when no database mail profile is configured. Database Mail can be used for sending e-mail messages from the SQL Server Database Engine and is disabled by default. If you are not using this feature, it is recommended to disable it to reduce the surface area.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1068     |Server permissions shouldn't be granted directly to principals          |Low         |Server level permissions are associated with a server level object to regulate which users can gain access to the object. This rule checks that there are no server level permissions granted directly to logins.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1070     |Database users shouldn't share the same name as a server login          |Low         |Database users may share the same name as a server login. This rule validates that there are no such users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1072     |Authentication mode should be Windows Authentication          |Medium         |There are two possible authentication modes: Windows Authentication mode and mixed mode. Mixed mode means that SQL Server enables both Windows authentication and SQL Server authentication. This rule checks that the authentication mode is set to Windows Authentication.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1094     |Database permissions shouldn't be granted directly to principals          |Low         |Permissions are rules associated with a securable object to regulate which users can gain access to the object. This rule checks that there are no DB permissions granted directly to users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1095     |Excessive permissions should not be granted to PUBLIC role          |Medium         |Every SQL Server login belongs to the public server role. When a server principal has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object the user inherits the permissions granted to public on that object. This displays a list of all permissions that are granted to the PUBLIC role.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1096     |Principal GUEST should not be granted permissions in the database          |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST. Permissions granted to GUEST are inherited by users who have access to the database but who do not have a user account in the database. This rule checks that all permissions have been revoked from the GUEST user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1097     |Principal GUEST should not be granted permissions on objects or columns          |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST. Permissions granted to GUEST are inherited by users who have access to the database but who do not have a user account in the database. This rule checks that all permissions have been revoked from the GUEST user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1099     |GUEST user should not be granted permissions on database securables          |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST.

|VA1246     |Application roles should not be used          |Low         |An application role is a database principal that enables an application to run with its own user-like permissions. Application roles enable that only users connecting through a particular application can access specific data. Application roles are password-based (which applications typically hardcode) and not permission based which exposes the database to app role impersonation by password-guessing. This rule checks that no application roles are defined in the database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database         |
|VA1248     |User-defined database roles should not be members of fixed roles          |Medium         |To easily manage the permissions in your databases SQL Server provides several roles, which are security principals that group other principals. They are like groups in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Database accounts and other SQL Server roles can be added into database-level roles. Each member of a fixed-database role can add other users to that same role. This rule checks that no user-defined roles are members of fixed roles.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1267     |Contained users should use Windows Authentication          |Medium         |Contained users are users that exist within the database and do not require a login mapping. This rule checks that contained users use Windows Authentication.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1280     |Server Permissions granted to public should be minimized          |Medium         |Every SQL Server login belongs to the public server role. When a server principal has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object the user inherits the permissions granted to public on that object. This rule checks that server permissions granted to public are minimized.          |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1282     |Orphan roles should be removed          |Low         |Orphan roles are user-defined roles that have no members. Eliminate orphaned roles as they are not needed on the system. This rule checks whether there are any orphan roles.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2020     |Minimal set of principals should be granted ALTER or ALTER ANY USER database-scoped permissions          |High         |Every SQL Server securable has permissions associated with it that can be granted to principals. Permissions can be scoped at the server level (assigned to logins and server roles) or at the database level (assigned to database users and database roles). These rules check that only a minimal set of principals are granted ALTER or ALTER ANY USER database-scoped permissions.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2033     |Minimal set of principals should be granted database-scoped EXECUTE permission on objects or columns          |Low         |This rule checks which principals are granted EXECUTE permission on objects or columns to ensure this permission is granted to a minimal set of principals. Every SQL Server securable has permissions associated with it that can be granted to principals. Permissions can be scoped at the server level (assigned to logins and server roles) or at the database level (assigned to database users, database roles, or application roles). The EXECUTE permission applies to both stored procedures and scalar functions, which can be used in computed columns.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2103     |Unnecessary execute permissions on extended stored procedures should be revoked          |Medium         |Extended stored procedures are DLLs that an instance of SQL Server can dynamically load and run. SQL Server is packaged with many extended stored procedures that allow for interaction with the system DLLs. This rule checks that unnecessary execute permissions on extended stored procedures have been revoked.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2107     |Minimal set of principals should be members of fixed Azure SQL DB master database roles          |High         |SQL Database provides two restricted administrative roles in the master database to which user accounts can be added that grant permissions to either create databases or manage logins. This rule check that a minimal set of principals are members of these administrative roles.         |<nobr/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2108     |Minimal set of principals should be members of fixed high impact database roles          |High         |SQL Server provides roles to help manage the permissions. Roles are security principals that group other principals. Database-level roles are database-wide in their permission scope. This rule checks that a minimal set of principals are members of the fixed database roles.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2109     |Minimal set of principals should be members of fixed low impact database roles          |Low         |SQL Server provides roles to help manage the permissions. Roles are security principals that group other principals. Database-level roles are database-wide in their permission scope. This rule checks that a minimal set of principals are members of the fixed database roles.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2110     |Execute permissions to access the registry should be revoked          |High         |Registry extended stored procedures allow Microsoft SQL Server to read write and enumerate values and keys in the registry. They are used by Enterprise Manager to configure the server. This rule checks that the permissions to execute registry extended stored procedures have been revoked from all users (other than dbo).         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2113     |Data Transformation Services (DTS) permissions should only be granted to SSIS roles          |Medium         |Data Transformation Services (DTS), is a set of objects and utilities that allow the automation of extract, transform, and load operations to or from a database. The objects are DTS packages and their components, and the utilities are called DTS tools. This rule checks that only the SSIS roles are granted permissions to use the DTS system stored procedures and the permissions for the PUBLIC role to use the DTS system stored procedures have been revoked.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2114     |Minimal set of principals should be members of high impact fixed server roles          |High         |SQL Server provides roles to help manage permissions. Roles are security principals that group other principals. Server-level roles are server-wide in their permission scope. This rule checks that a minimal set of principals are members of the fixed server roles.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2129     |Changes to signed modules should be authorized          |High         |You can sign a stored procedure, function, or trigger with a certificate or an asymmetric key. This is designed for scenarios when permissions cannot be inherited through ownership chaining or when the ownership chain is broken, such as dynamic SQL. This rule checks for changes made to signed modules, which could be an indication of malicious use.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2130     |Track all users with access to the database          |Low         |This check tracks all users with access to a database. Make sure that these users are authorized according to their current role in the organization.         |<nobr>SQL Database<nobr/><br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |

## Auditing and Logging

|Rule ID  |Rule Title  |Rule Severity  |Rule Description  |Platform  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|VA1045     |Default trace should be enabled          |Medium         |Default trace provides troubleshooting assistance to database administrators by ensuring that they have the log data necessary to diagnose problems the first time they occur. This rule checks that the default trace is enabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1091     |Auditing of both successful and failed login attempts (default trace) should be enabled when 'Login auditing' is set up to track logins          |Low         |SQL Server Login auditing configuration enables administrators to track the users logging into SQL Server instances. If the user chooses to count on 'Login auditing' to track users logging into SQL Server instances, then it is important to enable it for both successful and failed login attempts.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1093     |Maximum number of error logs should be 12 or more          |Low         |Each SQL Server Error log will have all the information related to failures / errors that have occurred since SQL Server was last restarted or since the last time you have recycled the error logs. This rule checks that the maximum number of error logs is 12 or more.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1258     |Database owners are as expected          |High         |Database owners can perform all configuration and maintenance activities on the database and can also drop databases in SQL Server. Tracking database owners is important to avoid having excessive permission for some principals. Create a baseline that defines the expected database owners for the database. This rule checks whether the database owners are as defined in the baseline.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2016+<sup>3</sup><nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1264     |Auditing of both successful and failed login attempts should be enabled          |Low         |SQL Server auditing configuration enables administrators to track the users logging into SQL Server instances that they're responsible for. This rule checks that auditing is enabled for both successful and failed login attempts.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1265     |Auditing of both successful and failed login attempts for contained DB authentication should be enabled          |Medium         |SQL Server auditing configuration enables administrators to track users logging to SQL Server instances that they're responsible for. This rule checks that auditing is enabled for both successful and failed login attempts for contained DB authentication.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1281     |All memberships for user-defined roles should be intended          |Medium         |User-defined roles are security principals defined by the user to group principals to easily manage permissions. Monitoring these roles is important to avoid having excessive permissions. Create a baseline that defines expected membership for each user-defined role. This rule checks whether all memberships for user-defined roles are as defined in the baseline.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1283     |There should be at least 1 active audit in the system          |Low         |Auditing an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine or an individual database involves tracking and logging events that occur on the Database Engine. The SQL Server Audit object collects a single instance of server or database-level actions and groups of actions to monitor. This rule checks that there is at least one active audit in the system.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2061     |Auditing should be enabled at the server level          |High         |Azure SQL Database Auditing tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure storage account. Auditing helps you understand database activity and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations as well as helps you meet regulatory compliance. For more information, see [Azure SQL Auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing). This rule checks that auditing is enabled.         |<nobr/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse          |

|VA1219     |Transparent data encryption should be enabled          |Medium         |Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps to protect the database files against information disclosure by performing real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files 'at rest', without requiring changes to the application. This rule checks that TDE is enabled on the database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1220     |Database communication using TDS should be protected through TLS          |High         |Microsoft SQL Server can use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data that is transmitted across a network between an instance of SQL Server and a client application. This rule checks that all connections to the SQL Server are encrypted through TLS.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1221     |Database Encryption Symmetric Keys should use AES algorithm          |High         |SQL Server uses encryption keys to help secure data credentials and connection information that is stored in a server database. SQL Server has two kinds of keys: symmetric and asymmetric. This rule checks that Database Encryption Symmetric Keys use AES algorithm.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1222     |Cell-Level Encryption keys should use AES algorithm          |High         |Cell-Level Encryption (CLE) allows you to encrypt your data using symmetric and asymmetric keys. This rule checks that Cell-Level Encryption symmetric keys use AES algorithm.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1223     |Certificate keys should use at least 2048 bits          |High         |Certificate keys are used in RSA and other encryption algorithms to protect data. These keys need to be of enough length to secure the user's data. This rule checks that the key's length is at least 2048 bits for all certificates.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1224     |Asymmetric keys' length should be at least 2048 bits          |High         |Database asymmetric keys are used in many encryption algorithms these keys need to be of enough length to secure the encrypted data this rule checks that all asymmetric keys stored in the database are of length of at least 2048 bits         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012<nobr/><br/><br/><nobr>SQL Server 2014<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Database         |
|VA1279     |Force encryption should be enabled for TDS          |High         |When the Force Encryption option for the Database Engine is enabled all communications between client and server is encrypted regardless of whether the 'Encrypt connection' option (such as from SSMS) is checked or not. This rule checks that Force Encryption option is enabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1288     |Sensitive data columns should be classified          |Medium         |This rule checks if the scanned database has potentially sensitive data that has not been classified.         |<nobr/>SQL Database         |
|VA2060     |SQL Threat Detection should be enabled at the server level          |Medium         |SQL Threat Detection provides a layer of security that detects potential vulnerabilities and anomalous activity in databases such as SQL injection attacks and unusual behavior patterns. When a potential threat is detected Threat Detection sends an actionable real-time alert by email and in Azure Security Center, which includes clear investigation and remediation steps for the specific threat.

## Surface Area Reduction

|Rule ID  |Rule Title  |Rule Severity  |Rule Description  |Platform  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|VA1022     |Ad hoc distributed queries should be disabled          |Medium         |Ad hoc distributed queries use the `OPENROWSET` and `OPENDATASOURCE` functions to connect to remote data sources that use OLE DB. This rule checks that ad hoc distributed queries are disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1023     |CLR should be disabled          |High         |The CLR allows managed code to be hosted by and run in the Microsoft SQL Server environment. This rule checks that CLR is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1026     |CLR should be disabled          |Medium         |The CLR allows managed code to be hosted by and run in the Microsoft SQL Server environment. CLR strict security treats SAFE and EXTERNAL_ACCESS assemblies as if they were marked UNSAFE and requires all assemblies be signed by a certificate or asymmetric key with a corresponding login that has been granted UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission in the master database. This rule checks that CLR is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2017+<sup>2</sup><nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1027     |Untracked trusted assemblies should be removed          |High         |Assemblies marked as UNSAFE are required to be signed by a certificate or asymmetric key with a corresponding login that has been granted UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission in the master database. Trusted assemblies may bypass this requirement.          |<nobr>SQL Server 2017+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1044     |Remote Admin Connections should be disabled unless specifically required          |Medium         |This rule checks that remote dedicated admin connections are disabled if they are not being used for clustering to reduce attack surface area. SQL Server provides a dedicated administrator connection (DAC). The DAC lets an administrator access a running server to execute diagnostic functions or Transact-SQL statements, or to troubleshoot problems on the server and it becomes an attractive target to attack when it is enabled remotely.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1051     |AUTO_CLOSE should be disabled on all databases          |Medium         |The AUTO_CLOSE option specifies whether the database shuts down gracefully and frees resources after the last user disconnects. Regardless of its benefits it can cause denial of service by aggressively opening and closing the database, thus it is important to keep this feature disabled. This rule checks that this option is disabled on the current database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1066     |Unused service broker endpoints should be removed          |Low         |Service Broker provides queuing and reliable messaging for SQL Server. Service Broker is used both for applications that use a single SQL Server instance and applications that distribute work across multiple instances. Service Broker endpoints provide options for transport security and message forwarding. This rule enumerates all the service broker endpoints. Remove those that are not used.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1071     |'Scan for startup stored procedures' option should be disabled          |Medium         |When 'Scan for startup procs' is enabled SQL Server scans for and runs all automatically run stored procedures defined on the server. If this option is enabled SQL Server scans for and runs all automatically run stored procedures defined on the server. This rule checks that this option is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1092     |SQL Server instance shouldn't be advertised by the SQL Server Browser service          |Low         |SQL Server uses the SQL Server Browser service to enumerate instances of the Database Engine installed on the computer. This enables client applications to browse for a server and helps clients distinguish between multiple instances of the Database Engine on the same computer. This rule checks that the SQL instance is hidden.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1102     |The Trustworthy bit should be disabled on all databases except MSDB          |High         |The TRUSTWORTHY database property is used to indicate whether the instance of SQL Server trusts the database and the contents within it. If this option is enabled database modules (for example user-defined functions or stored procedures) that use an impersonation context can access resources outside the database. This rule verifies that the TRUSTWORTHY bit is disabled on all databases except MSDB.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1143     |'dbo' user should not be used for normal service operation          |Medium         |The 'dbo' or database owner is a user account that has implied permissions to perform all activities in the database. Members of the sysadmin fixed server role are automatically mapped to dbo. This rule checks that dbo is not the only account allowed to access this database. Note that on a newly created clean database this rule will fail until additional roles are created.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1144     |Model database should only be accessible by 'dbo'          |Medium         |The Model database is used as the template for all databases created on the instance of SQL Server. Modifications made to the model database such as database size recovery model and other database options are applied to any databases created afterward. This rule checks that dbo is the only account allowed to access the model database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1230     |Filestream should be disabled          |High         |FILESTREAM integrates the SQL Server Database Engine with an NTFS file system by storing varbinary (max) binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. Transact-SQL statements can insert, update, query, search, and back up FILESTREAM data. Enabling Filestream on SQL server exposes additional NTFS streaming API, which increases its attack surface and makes it prone to malicious attacks. This rule checks that Filestream is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1235     |Server configuration 'Replication XPs' should be disabled          |Medium         |Disable the deprecated server configuration 'Replication XPs' to limit the attack surface area. This is an internal only configuration setting.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1244     |Orphaned users should be removed from SQL server databases          |Medium         |A database user that exists on a database but has no corresponding login in the master database or as an external resource (for example, a Windows user) is referred to as an orphaned user and it should either be removed or remapped to a valid login. This rule checks that there are no orphaned users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1245     |The dbo information should be consistent between the target DB and master          |High         |There is redundant information about the dbo identity for any database: metadata stored in the database itself and metadata stored in master DB. This rule checks that this information is consistent between the target DB and master.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1247     |There should be no SPs marked as auto-start          |High         |When SQL Server has been configured to 'scan for startup procs' the server will scan master DB for stored procedures marked as auto-start. This rule checks that there are no SPs marked as auto-start.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1256     |User CLR assemblies should not be defined in the database          |High         |CLR assemblies can be used to execute arbitrary code on SQL Server process. This rule checks that there are no user-defined CLR assemblies in the database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1277     |Polybase network encryption should be enabled          |High         |PolyBase is a technology that accesses and combines both non-relational and relational data all from within SQL Server. Polybase network encryption option configures SQL Server to encrypt control and data channels when using Polybase. This rule verifies that this option is enabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2016+<nobr/>         |
|VA1278     |Create a baseline of External Key Management Providers          |Medium         |The SQL Server Extensible Key Management (EKM) enables third-party EKM / Hardware Security Modules (HSM) vendors to register their modules in SQL Server. When registered SQL Server users can use the encryption keys stored on EKM modules,this rule displays a list of EKM providers being used in the system.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2062     |Database-level firewall rules should not grant excessive access          |High         |The Azure SQL Database-level firewall helps protect your data by preventing all access to your database until you specify which IP addresses have permission. Database-level firewall rules grant access to the specific database based on the originating IP address of each request. Database-level firewall rules for master and user databases can only be created and managed through Transact-SQL (unlike server-level firewall rules, which can also be created and managed using the Azure portal or PowerShell). For more information, see [Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics IP firewall rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure). This check verifies that database-level firewall rules do not grant access to more than 255 IP addresses.         |<nobr/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2063     |Server-level firewall rules should not grant excessive access          |High         |The Azure SQL server-level firewall helps protect your server by preventing all access to your databases until you specify which IP addresses have permission. Server-level firewall rules grant access to all databases that belong to the server based on the originating IP address of each request.  Server-level firewall rules can only be created and managed through Transact-SQL as well as through the Azure portal or PowerShell. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics IP firewall rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure). This check verifies that server-level firewall rules do not grant access to more than 255 IP addresses.         |<nobr/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA2064     |Database-level firewall rules should be tracked and maintained at a strict minimum          |High         |The Azure SQL Database-level firewall helps protect your data by preventing all access to your database until you specify which IP addresses have permission. Database-level firewall rules grant access to the specific database based on the originating IP address of each request. Database-level firewall rules for master and user databases can only be created and managed through Transact-SQL (unlike server-level firewall rules, which can also be created and managed using the Azure portal or PowerShell).

|VA2111     |Sample databases should be removed          |Low         |Microsoft SQL Server comes shipped with several sample databases. This rule checks whether the sample databases have been removed.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2120     |Features that may affect security should be disabled          |High         |SQL Server is capable of providing a wide range of features and services. Some of the features and services provided by default may not be necessary and enabling them could adversely affect the security of the system. This rule checks that these features are disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2121     | 'OLE Automation Procedures' feature should be disabled         |High         |SQL Server is capable of providing a wide range of features and services. Some of the features and services, provided by default, may not be necessary, and enabling them could adversely affect the security of the system. The OLE Automation Procedures option controls whether OLE Automation objects can be instantiated within Transact-SQL batches. These are extended stored procedures that allow SQL Server users to execute functions external to SQL Server. Regardless of its benefits it can also be used for exploits, and is known as a popular mechanism to plant files on the target machines. It is advised to use PowerShell as a replacement for this tool. This rule checks that 'OLE Automation Procedures' feature is disabled.          |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2122     |'User Options' feature should be disabled          |Medium         |SQL Server is capable of providing a wide range of features and services. Some of the features and services provided by default may not be necessary and enabling them could adversely affect the security of the system. The user options specifies global defaults for all users. A list of default query processing options is established for the duration of a user's work session. The user options allows you to change the default values of the SET options (if the server's default settings are not appropriate). This rule checks that 'user options' feature is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2126     |Extensibility-features that may affect security should be disabled if not needed          |Medium         |SQL Server provides a wide range of features and services.
