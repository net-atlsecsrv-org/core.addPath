# Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance connect and query articles
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

The following document includes links to Azure examples showing how to connect and query Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. For some related recommendations for Transport Level Security, see [TLS considerations for database connectivity](#tls-considerations-for-database-connectivity).

## TLS considerations for database connectivity

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by all drivers that Microsoft supplies or supports for connecting to databases in Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance. No special configuration is necessary. For all connections to a SQL Server instance, a database in Azure SQL Database, or an instance of Azure SQL Managed Instance, we recommend that all applications set
the following configurations, or their equivalents:

- **Encrypt = On**
- **TrustServerCertificate = Off**

Some systems use different yet equivalent keywords for those configuration keywords. These configurations ensure that the client driver
verifies the identity of the TLS certificate received from the server.

We also recommend that you disable TLS 1.1 and 1.0 on the client if you need to comply with Payment Card Industry - Data Security
Standard (PCI-DSS).

Non-Microsoft drivers might not use TLS by default. This can be a factor when connecting to Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance. Applications with embedded drivers might not allow you to control these connection settings. We recommend that you examine the security of such drivers and applications before using them on systems that interact with sensitive data.

## Libraries

You can use various libraries and frameworks to connect to Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance. Check out our [Get started tutorials](https://aka.ms/sqldev) to quickly get started with programming languages such as C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python. Then build an app by using SQL Server on Linux or Windows or Docker on macOS.

The following table lists connectivity libraries or *drivers* that client applications can use from a variety of languages to connect to and use SQL Server running on-premises or in the cloud. You can use them on Linux, Windows, or Docker and use them to connect to Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
