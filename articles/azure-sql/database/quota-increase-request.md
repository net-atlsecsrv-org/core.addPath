[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

This article explains how to request a quota increase for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. It also explains how to enable subscription access to a region.

## <a id="newquota"></a> Create a new support request

Use the following steps to create a new support request from the Azure portal for SQL Database.

1. On  the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, select **Help + support**.

   ![The Help + support link](./media/quota-increase-request/help-plus-support.png)

1. In **Help + support**, select **New support request**.

    ![Create a new support request](./media/quota-increase-request/new-support-request.png)

1. For **Issue type**, select **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**.

   ![Select an issue type](./media/quota-increase-request/select-quota-issue-type.png)

1. For **Subscription**, select the subscription whose quota you want to increase.

   ![Select a subscription for an increased quota](./media/quota-increase-request/select-subscription-support-request.png)

1. For **Quota type**, select one of the following quota types:

   - **SQL Database** for single database and elastic pool quotas.
   - **SQL Database Managed Instance** for managed instances.

   Then select **Next: Solutions >>**.

Clicking **Enter details** displays the **Quota details** window that allows you to add additional information. The following sections describe the different options for **SQL Database** and **SQL Database Managed Instance** quota types.

## <a id="sqldbquota"></a> SQL Database quota types

The following sections describe the quota increase options for the **SQL Database** quota types:

- Database transaction units (DTUs) per server
- Servers per subscription
- M-series region access
- Region access

### Database transaction units (DTUs) per server

Use the following steps to request an increase in the DTUs per server.

1. Select the **Database transaction units (DTUs) per server** quota type.

1. In the **Resource** list, select the resource to target.

1. In the **New quota** field, enter the new DTU limit that you are requesting.

For more information, see [Resource limits for single databases using the DTU purchasing model](resource-limits-dtu-single-databases.md) and [Resources limits for elastic pools using the DTU purchasing model](resource-limits-dtu-elastic-pools.md).

### Servers per subscription

Use the following steps to request an increase in the number of servers per subscription.

1. Select the **Servers per subscription** quota type.

1. In the **Location** list, select the Azure region to use. The quota is per subscription in each region.

For more information, see [SQL Database resource limits and resource governance](resource-limits-logical-server.md).

### <a id="region"></a> Enable subscription access to a region

Some offer types are not available in every region. You may see an error such as the following:

`Your subscription does not have access to create a server in the selected region. For the latest information about region availability for your subscription, go to aka.ms/sqlcapacity. Please try another region or create a support ticket to request access.`

If your subscription needs access in a particular region, select the **Region access** option. In your request, specify the offering and SKU details that you want to enable for the region. To explore the offering and SKU options, see [Azure SQL Database pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/single/).

1. Select the **Region access** quota type.

1. In the **Select a location** list, select the Azure region to use. The quota is per subscription in each region.

1. Enter the **Purchase Model**, and **Expected Consumption** details.

To enable M-series hardware for a subscription and region, a support request must be opened.

1. Select the **M-series region access** quota type.

1. In the **Select a location** list, select the Azure region to use. The quota is per subscription in each region.

## Submit your request

The final step is to fill in the remaining details of your SQL Database quota request. Then select **Next: Review + create>>**, and after reviewing the request details, click **Create** to submit the request.

## Next steps

After you submit your request, it will be reviewed. You will be contacted with an answer based on the information you provided in the form.
