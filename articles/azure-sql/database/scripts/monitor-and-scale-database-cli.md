# Use the Azure CLI to monitor and scale a single database in Azure SQL Database

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This Azure CLI script example scales a single database in Azure SQL Database to a different compute size after querying the size information of the database.

If you choose to install and use the Azure CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
$subscription = "<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

### Run the script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/monitor-and-scale-database/monitor-and-scale-database.sh "Monitor and scale a database in Azure SQL Database")]

> [!TIP]
> Use [az sql db op list](/cli/azure/sql/db/op?#az-sql-db-op-list) to get a list of operations performed on the database, and use [az sql db op cancel](/cli/azure/sql/db/op#az-sql-db-op-cancel) to cancel an update operation on the database.

### Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resource
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command-specific documentation.

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| [az sql server](/cli/azure/sql/server) | Server commands. |
| [az sql db show-usage](/cli/azure/sql#az-sql-show-usage) | Shows the size usage information for a database. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure).

Additional CLI script samples can be found in [Azure CLI sample scripts](../az-cli-script-samples-content-guide.md).
