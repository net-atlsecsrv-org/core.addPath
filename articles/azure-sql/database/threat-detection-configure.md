# Configure Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

[Advanced Threat Protection](threat-detection-overview.md) for Azure SQL Database detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. Advanced Threat Protection can identify **Potential SQL injection**, **Access from unusual location or data center**, **Access from unfamiliar principal or potentially harmful application**, and **Brute force SQL credentials** - see more details in [Advanced Threat Protection alerts](threat-detection-overview.md#alerts).

You can receive notifications about the detected threats via [email notifications](threat-detection-overview.md#explore-detection-of-a-suspicious-event) or [Azure portal](threat-detection-overview.md#explore-alerts-in-azure-portal)

[Advanced Threat Protection](threat-detection-overview.md) is part of the [advanced data security](advanced-data-security.md) offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Advanced Threat Protection can be accessed and managed via the central SQL Advanced Data Security portal.

## Set up Advanced Threat Protection in the Azure portal

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to the configuration page of the server you want to protect. In the security settings, select **Advanced Data Security**.
3. On the **Advanced Data Security** configuration page:

   - Enable Advanced Data Security on the server.
   - In **Advanced Threat Protection Settings**, in the **Send alerts to** text box, provide the list of emails to receive security alerts upon detection of anomalous database activities.
