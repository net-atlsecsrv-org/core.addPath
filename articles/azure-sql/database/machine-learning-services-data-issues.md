# Work with R and SQL data in Azure SQL Database Machine Learning Services (preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This article discusses some of the common issues you may encounter when moving data between R and SQL Database in [Machine Learning Services (with R) in Azure SQL Database](machine-learning-services-overview.md). The experience you gain through this exercise provides essential background when working with data in your own script.

[!INCLUDE[ml-preview-note](../../../includes/sql-database-ml-preview-note.md)]

Common issues that you may encounter include:

- Data types sometimes don't match
- Implicit conversions might take place
- Cast and convert operations are sometimes required
- R and SQL use different data objects

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

- To run the example code in these exercises, you must first have [Azure SQL Database with Machine Learning Services (with R)](machine-learning-services-overview.md) enabled.

- Make sure you've installed the latest [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (SSMS). You can run R scripts using other database management or query tools, but in this quickstart you'll use SSMS.

## Working with a data frame

When your script returns results from R to SQL, it must return the data as a **data.frame**. Any other type of object that you generate in your script - whether that be a list, factor, vector, or binary data - must be converted to a data frame if you want to output it as part of the stored procedure results. Fortunately, there are multiple R functions to support changing other objects to a data frame. You can even serialize a binary model and return it in a data frame, which you'll do later in this article.

First, let's experiment with some basic R objects - vectors, matrices, and lists - and see how conversion to a data frame changes the output passed to SQL.

Compare these two "Hello World" scripts in R. The scripts look almost identical, but the first returns a single column of three values, whereas the second returns three columns with a single value each.

**Example 1**

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N' mytextvariable <- c("hello", " ", "world");
OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(mytextvariable);
'
    , @input_data_1 = N'';
```

**Example 2**

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N' OutputDataSet<- data.frame(c("hello"), " ", c("world"));'
    , @input_data_1 = N'';
```

Why are the results so different?

The answer can usually be found by using the R `str()` command. Add the function `str(object_name)` anywhere in your R script to have the data schema of the specified R object returned as an informational message. You can view the messages in the **Messages** tab in SSMS.

To figure out why Example 1 and Example 2 have such different results, insert the line `str(OutputDataSet)` at the end of the `@script` variable definition in each statement, like this:

**Example 1 with str function added**

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
mytextvariable <- c("hello", " ", "world");
OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(mytextvariable);
str(OutputDataSet);
'
    , @input_data_1 = N'  ';
```

**Example 2 with str function added**

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
OutputDataSet <- data.frame(c("hello"), " ", c("world"));
str(OutputDataSet);
'
    , @input_data_1 = N'  ';
```

Now, review the text in **Messages** to see why the output is different.

**Results - Example 1**

```text
STDOUT message(s) from external script:
'data.frame':    3 obs. of  1 variable:
$ mytextvariable: Factor w/ 3 levels " ","hello","world": 2 1 3
```

**Results - Example 2**

```text
STDOUT message(s) from external script:
'data.frame':    1 obs. of  3 variables:
$ c..hello..: Factor w/ 1 level "hello": 1
$ X...      : Factor w/ 1 level " ": 1
$ c..world..: Factor w/ 1 level "world": 1
```

As you can see, a slight change in R syntax had a big effect on the schema of the results. For all the details, the differences in R data types are explained in details in the *Data Structures* section in ["Advanced R" by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz).

For now, just be aware that you need to check the expected results when coercing R objects into data frames.

> [!TIP]
> You also can use R identity functions, such as `is.matrix`, `is.vector`, to return information about the internal data structure.

## Implicit conversion of data objects

Each R data object has its own rules for how values are handled when combined with other data objects if the two data objects have the same number of dimensions, or if any data object contains heterogeneous data types.

For example, assume you want to perform matrix multiplication using R. You want to multiply a single-column matrix with the three values by an array with four values, and expect a 4x3 matrix as a result.

First, create a small table of test data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE RTestData (col1 INT NOT NULL)

INSERT INTO RTestData
VALUES (1);

INSERT INTO RTestData
VALUES (10);

INSERT INTO RTestData
VALUES (100);
GO
```

Now run the following script.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
x <- as.matrix(InputDataSet);
y <- array(12:15);
OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(x %*% y);
'
    , @input_data_1 = N' SELECT [Col1]  from RTestData;'
WITH RESULT SETS((
            [Col1] INT
            , [Col2] INT
            , [Col3] INT
            , Col4 INT
            ));
```

Under the covers, the column of three values is converted to a single-column matrix. Because a matrix is just a special case of an array in R, the array `y` is implicitly coerced to a single-column matrix to make the two arguments conform.

**Results**

|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|12|13|14|15|
|120|130|140|150|
|1200|1300|1400|1500|

However, note what happens when you change the size of the array `y`.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
x <- as.matrix(InputDataSet);
y <- array(12:14);
OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(y %*% x);
'
    , @input_data_1 = N' SELECT [Col1]  from RTestData;'
WITH RESULT SETS(([Col1] INT));
```

Now R returns a single value as the result.

**Results**
    
|Col1|
|---|
|1542|

Why? In this case, because the two arguments can be handled as vectors of the same length, R returns the inner product as a matrix.  This is the expected behavior according to the rules of linear algebra. However, it could cause problems if your downstream application expects the output schema to never change!

## Merge or multiply columns of different length

R provides great flexibility for working with vectors of different sizes, and for combining these column-like structures into data frames. Lists of vectors can look like a table, but they don't follow all the rules that govern database tables.

For example, the following script defines a numeric array of length 6 and stores it in the R variable `df1`. The numeric array is then combined with the integers of the RTestData table (created above) which contains three (3) values, to make a new data frame, `df2`.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
df1 <- as.data.frame( array(1:6) );
df2 <- as.data.frame( c( InputDataSet , df1 ));
OutputDataSet <- df2;
'
    , @input_data_1 = N' SELECT [Col1]  from RTestData;'
WITH RESULT SETS((
            [Col2] INT NOT NULL
            , [Col3] INT NOT NULL
            ));
```

To fill out the data frame, R repeats the elements retrieved from RTestData as many times as needed to match the number of elements in the array `df1`.

**Results**
    
|*Col2*|*Col3*|
|----|----|
|1|1|
|10|2|
|100|3|
|1|4|
|10|5|
|100|6|

Remember that a data frame only looks like a table, but is actually a list of vectors.

## Cast or convert SQL data

R and SQL don't use the same data types, so when you run a query in SQL to get data and then pass that to the R runtime, some type of implicit conversion usually takes place. Another set of conversions takes place when you return data from R to SQL.

- SQL pushes the data from the query to the R process and converts it to an internal representation for greater efficiency.
- The R runtime loads the data into a data.frame variable and performs its own operations on the data.
- The database engine returns the data to SQL using a secured internal connection and presents the data in terms of SQL data types.
- You get the data by connecting to SQL using a client or network library that can issue SQL queries and handle tabular data sets. This client application can potentially affect the data in other ways.

To see how this works, run a query such as this one on the [AdventureWorksDW](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) data warehouse. This view returns sales data used in creating forecasts.

```sql
USE AdventureWorksDW
GO

SELECT ReportingDate
    , CAST(ModelRegion AS VARCHAR(50)) AS ProductSeries
    , Amount
FROM [AdventureWorksDW].[dbo].[vTimeSeries]
WHERE [ModelRegion] = 'M200 Europe'
ORDER BY ReportingDate ASC
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any version of AdventureWorks, or create a different query using a database of your own. The point is to try to handle some data that contains text, datetime, and numeric values.

Now, try using this query as the input to the stored procedure.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
str(InputDataSet);
OutputDataSet <- InputDataSet;
'
    , @input_data_1 = N'
           SELECT ReportingDate
         , CAST(ModelRegion as varchar(50)) as ProductSeries
         , Amount
           FROM [AdventureWorksDW].[dbo].[vTimeSeries]
           WHERE [ModelRegion] = ''M200 Europe''
           ORDER BY ReportingDate ASC ;'
WITH RESULT SETS undefined;
```

If you get an error, you'll probably need to make some edits to the query text. For example, the string predicate in the WHERE clause must be enclosed by two sets of single quotation marks.

After you get the query working, review the results of the `str` function to see how R treats the input data.

**Results**

```text
STDOUT message(s) from external script: 'data.frame':    37 obs. of  3 variables:
STDOUT message(s) from external script: $ ReportingDate: POSIXct, format: "2010-12-24 23:00:00" "2010-12-24 23:00:00"
STDOUT message(s) from external script: $ ProductSeries: Factor w/ 1 levels "M200 Europe",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
STDOUT message(s) from external script: $ Amount       : num  3400 16925 20350 16950 16950
```

- The datetime column has been processed using the R data type, **POSIXct**.
- The text column "ProductSeries" has been identified as a **factor**, meaning a categorical variable. String values are handled as factors by default. If you pass a string to R, it is converted to an integer for internal use, and then mapped back to the string on output.

## Summary

From even these short examples, you can see the need to check the effects of data conversion when passing SQL queries as input. Because some SQL data types are not supported by R, consider these ways to avoid errors:

- Test your data in advance and verify columns or values in your schema that could be a problem when passed to R code.
- Specify columns in your input data source individually, rather than using `SELECT *`, and know how each column will be handled.
- Perform explicit casts as necessary when preparing your input data, to avoid surprises.
- Avoid passing columns of data (such as GUIDS or rowguids) that cause errors and aren't useful for modeling.
