# YAML configuration options to customize the build tasks

This article lists all YAML configuration options available in each of the build tasks. The article starts with the tasks for security code analysis tools. It ends with the post-processing tasks.

|------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| InputType | pickList | always | True | Basic | Basic, Custom | 
| ScanType | pickList | InputType = Basic | True | CustomScan | CustomScan, FullSystemScan, QuickScan, YourConfiguredScan | The scan type to use for the AntiMalware scan.
| FileDirPath | filePath | ScanType = CustomScan | True | $(Build.StagingDirectory) |  | Indicates the file or directory to be scanned.
| DisableRemediation | boolean | ScanType = CustomScan | False | true |  | When checked: 1) File exclusions are ignored. 2) Archive files are scanned. 3) Actions are not applied after detection. 4) Event log entries are not written after detection. 5) Detections from the custom scan are not displayed in the user interface. 6) The console output will show the list of detections from the custom scan.
| BootSectorScan | boolean | ScanType = CustomScan | False | false |  | If checked, it enables boot sector scanning.
| Arguments | string | InputType = Custom | True | -Scan -ScanType 3 -DisableRemediation -File $(Build.StagingDirectory) |  | The command line arguments, where the argument for -File is an absolute path, or a relative path to the $(Build.StagingDirectory) predefined on your build agent. Note: If you do not provide an argument for -File as the last argument, it defaults to $(Build.StagingDirectory). You can also provide your own arguments allowed by the MpCmdRun.exe tool.<br/><br/>For more details about the command line arguments for this tool, please enter <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> in the Arguments field and execute the build task.
| EnableServices | boolean | always | True | false |  | If checked, it will try enabling the required services for Windows Update in case they are disabled.<br/>**NOTE**: Please make sure that the group policy does not disable the services and the account this build is running under has admin privileges.

| SignatureFreshness | pickList | always | True | UpToDate | OneDay, ThreeDays, TwoDays, UpToDate | The maximum allowed age for the AntiMalware signature. If the signature cannot be updated and is older than this value, the build task will behave according to the selected value in the **Validate Signatures Age As** field. Note: If you choose **Up-To-Date**, the signatures are allowed to be up to 3 hours old.
| TreatStaleSignatureAs | pickList | always | True | Error | Error, Standard, Warning | The log level used if the signature age is older than the selected **AntiMalware Signature Age**. An outdated signature may be treated as a **Warning** or **Informational** to continue with the AntiMalware scan, but this is not recommended.

Using this config may introduce breaking changes across minor releases as a new rules are enabled which cause lint failures in your code. When TSLint reaches a major version bump, `tslint:recommended` will be updated to be identical to `tslint:latest`.<br/><br/>**[tslint:recommended](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/blob/master/src/configs/recommended.ts) -** A stable, somewhat opinionated set of rules which TSLint encourages for general TypeScript programming.
