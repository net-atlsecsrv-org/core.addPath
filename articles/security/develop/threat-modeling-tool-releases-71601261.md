# Threat Modeling Tool update release 7.1.60126.1 - 1/29/2019

Version 7.1.60126.1 of the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool was released on January 29 2019 and contains the following changes:

- The minimum required version of .NET has been increased to [.NET 4.7.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=863262).
- The minimum required version of Windows has been increased to [Windows 10 Anniversary Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/08/02/how-to-get-the-windows-10-anniversary-update/#HTkoK5Zdv0g2F2Zq.97) due to the .NET dependency.
- A model validation toggle feature has been added to the tool's Options menu.
- Several links in the Threat Properties were updated.
- Minor UX changes to the tool's home screen.
- The Threat Modeling Tool now inherits the TLS settings of the host operating system and is supported in environments that require TLS 1.2 or greater.

## Feature changes

### Model validation option

Based on customer feedback, an option has been added to the tool to enable or disable the model validation. Previously, if your template used a single unidirectional data flow between two objects, you may have received an error message in the Messages frame stating: ObjectsName requires at least one 'Any'. Disabling model validation will prevent these warnings from showing in the view.

The option to toggle model validation on and off can be found in the File->Settings->Options menu. The default value for this setting is Disabled.
