# Threat Modeling Tool update release 7.3.00316.1 - 03/22/2020

Version 7.3.00316.1 of the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT) was released on March 22 2020 and contains the following changes:

- Accessibility improvements
- Bug fixes

## Notable bug fixes

### Exporting the threat list to CSV

The export to CSV function was inconsistently selecting which fields from the threat list would be exported. Now all fields from the threat list will be exported into the CSV file. 

### UX bugs

- The help menus in the primary workflow (create/open/analyze) and the template editor experience now have consistent menu options.
- The search bar in the stencils pane now has a standard cursor and appropriate labels have been added.
