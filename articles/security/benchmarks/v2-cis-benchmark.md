# Mapping of Azure Security Benchmark v2 and CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark

The CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark is the security guidance provided by Center for Internet Security for establishing a secure baseline configuration for Azure. The scope of the benchmark is to establish the foundation level of security while adopting Azure Cloud. This benchmark is in alignment with the [Azure Security Benchmark v2](overview.md).

We provide a mapping between the [CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark latest version v1.3.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) and [Azure Security Benchmark v2](overview.md). This will help you to understand how the recommendations for both benchmarks are aligned. You can download the complete mapping [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/blob/master/Azure%20Security%20Benchmark/2.0/asb_v2_to_cis_microsoft_azure_foundations_benchmark_v1.3.0.xlsx).
