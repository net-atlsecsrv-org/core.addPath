# Security Control V2: Data Protection

Data Protection covers control of data protection at rest, in transit, and via authorized access mechanisms. This includes discover, classify, protect, and monitor sensitive data assets using access control, encryption, and logging in Azure.

## DP-1: Discovery, classify and label sensitive data

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| DP-1 | 13.1, 14.5, 14.7 | SC-28 |

Discover, classify, and label your sensitive data so that you can design the appropriate controls to ensure sensitive information is stored, processed, and transmitted securely by the organization's technology systems. 

Use Azure Information Protection (and its associated scanning tool) for sensitive information within Office documents on Azure, on-premises, on Office 365, and in other locations. 

You can use Azure SQL Information Protection to assist in the classification and labeling of information stored in Azure SQL Databases.

## DP-2: Protect sensitive data

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| DP-2 | 13.2, 2.10 | SC-7, AC-4 |

Protect sensitive data by restricting access using Azure Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC), network-based access controls, and specific controls in Azure services (such as encryption in SQL and other databases). 

To ensure consistent access control, all types of access control should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy. The enterprise segmentation strategy should also be informed by the location of sensitive or business critical data and systems.

For the underlying platform, which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guards against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented some default data protection controls and capabilities.

## DP-3: Monitor for unauthorized transfer of sensitive data

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| DP-3 | 13.3 | AC-4, SI-4 |

Monitor for unauthorized transfer of data to locations outside of enterprise visibility and control. This typically involves monitoring for anomalous activities (large or unusual transfers) that could indicate unauthorized data exfiltration. 

Azure Storage Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and Azure SQL ATP can alert on anomalous transfer of information that might indicate unauthorized transfers of sensitive information. 

Azure Information protection (AIP) provides monitoring capabilities for information that has been classified and labeled. 

If required for compliance of data loss prevention (DLP), you can use a host-based DLP solution to enforce detective and/or preventative controls to prevent data exfiltration.

## DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| DP-4 | 14.4 | SC-8 |

To complement access controls, data in transit should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (e.g. traffic capture) using encryption to ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data. 

While this is optional for traffic on private networks, this is critical for traffic on external and public networks. For HTTP traffic, ensure that any clients connecting to your Azure resources can negotiate TLS v1.2 or greater. For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of an unencrypted protocol. Obsoleted SSL, TLS, and SSH versions and protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.  

By default, Azure provides encryption for data in transit between Azure data centers.

## DP-5: Encrypt sensitive data at rest

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| DP-5 | 14.8 | SC-28, SC-12 |

To complement access controls, data at rest should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (such as accessing underlying storage) using encryption. This helps ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data. 

Azure provides encryption for data at rest by default. For highly sensitive data, you have options to implement additional encryption at rest on all Azure resources where available. Azure manages your encryption keys by default, but Azure provides options to manage your own keys (customer managed keys) for certain Azure services.
