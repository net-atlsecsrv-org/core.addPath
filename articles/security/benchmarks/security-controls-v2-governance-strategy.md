# Security Control V2: Governance and Strategy

Governance and Strategy provides guidance for ensuring a coherent security strategy and documented governance approach to guide and sustain security assurance, including establishing roles and responsibilities for the different cloud security functions, unified technical strategy, and supporting policies and standards.

## GS-1: Define asset management and data protection strategy

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| GS-1 | 2, 13 | SC, AC |

Ensure you document and communicate a clear strategy for continuous monitoring and protection of systems and data. Prioritize discovery, assessment, protection, and monitoring of business-critical data and systems. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

- Data classification standard in accordance with the business risks

- Security organization visibility into risks and asset inventory 

- Security organization approval of Azure services for use 

- Security of assets through their lifecycle

- Required access control strategy in accordance with organizational data classification

- Use of Azure native and third party data protection capabilities

- Data encryption requirements for in-transit and at-rest use cases

- Appropriate cryptographic standards

## GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy

| Azure ID | CIS Controls v7.1 ID(s) | NIST SP800-53 r4 ID(s) |
|--|--|--|--|
| GS-2 | 4, 9, 16 | AC, CA, SC |

Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.
