## Overview

Azure Disk Encryption is a capability that helps you encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS VM disks. Disk Encryption leverages the industry standard [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) feature of Windows and the [DM-Crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt) feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks. The solution is integrated with [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/key-vault/) to help you control and manage the disk-encryption keys and secrets. The solution also ensures that all data on the VM disks are encrypted at rest in your Azure storage.

Disk Encryption for Windows and Linux IaaS VMs is in General Availability in all Azure public regions and Azure Government regions for Standard VMs and VMs with Azure Premium Storage. When you apply the Disk Encryption management solution, you can satisfy the following business needs:

* IaaS VMs are secured at rest by using industry-standard encryption technology to address organizational security and compliance requirements.
* IaaS VMs boot under customer-controlled keys and policies. You can audit their usage in your key vault.

If you use Azure Security Center, you're alerted if you have VMs that aren't encrypted. The alerts show as High Severity and the recommendation is to encrypt these VMs.

* The Azure Resource Manager disk encryption templates.

The Azure Disk Encryption solution is supported on IaaS VMs that run Windows or Linux OS. For more information about the supported operating systems, see the [Prerequisites](azure-security-disk-encryption-prerequisites.md) article.

> [!NOTE]
> There's no additional charge to encrypt VM disks with Azure Disk Encryption. Standard [Key Vault pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/) applies to the key vault that's used to store the encryption keys. 


## Encryption workflow

To enable disk encryption for Windows and Linux VMs, do the following steps:

1. Choose an encryption scenario from the scenarios listed in the [Encryption scenarios](#encryption-scenarios) section.

1. Opt in to enable disk encryption via the Azure Disk Encryption Resource Manager template, PowerShell cmdlets, or the Azure CLI, and specify the encryption configuration.

   * For the customer-encrypted VHD scenario, upload the encrypted VHD to your storage account and the encryption key material to your key vault. Then, provide the encryption configuration to enable encryption on a new IaaS VM.
   * For new VMs that are created from the Marketplace and existing VMs that already run in Azure, provide the encryption configuration to enable encryption on the IaaS VM.

1. Grant access to the Azure platform to read the encryption key material (BitLocker encryption keys for Windows systems and Passphrase for Linux) from your key vault to enable encryption on the IaaS VM.

1. Azure updates the VM service model with encryption and the key vault configuration, and sets up your encrypted VM.

## Decryption workflow
To disable disk encryption for IaaS VMs, complete the following high-level steps:

1. Choose to disable encryption (decryption) on a running IaaS VM in Azure and specify the decryption configuration. You can disable via the Azure Disk Encryption Resource Manager template, PowerShell cmdlets, or the Azure CLI.

   This step disables encryption of the OS or the data volume or both on the running Windows IaaS VM. As mentioned in the previous section, disabling OS disk encryption for Linux isn't supported. The decryption step is allowed only for data drives on Linux VMs as long as the OS disk isn't encrypted.

1. Azure updates the VM service model and the IaaS VM is marked as decrypted. The contents of the VM are no longer encrypted at rest.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The disable encryption operation doesn't delete your key vault and the encryption key material (BitLocker encryption keys for Windows systems or Passphrase for Linux).
   >
   > Disabling OS disk encryption for Linux isn't supported. The decryption step is allowed only for data drives on Linux VMs.
   >
   > Disabling data disk encryption for Linux isn't supported if the OS drive is encrypted.


## Encryption workflow (previous release)

The new release of Azure Disk Encryption eliminates the requirement to provide an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application parameter to enable VM disk encryption. With the new release, you're no longer required to provide an Azure AD credential during the enable encryption step. All new VMs must be encrypted without the Azure AD application parameters when you use the new release. VMs that were already encrypted with Azure AD application parameters are still supported and should continue to be maintained with the Azure AD syntax. To enable disk encryption for Windows and Linux VMs (previous release), do the following steps:

1. Choose an encryption scenario from the scenarios listed in the [Encryption scenarios](#encryption-scenarios) section.

1. Opt in to enable disk encryption via the Azure Disk Encryption Resource Manager template, PowerShell cmdlets, or the Azure CLI, and specify the encryption configuration.

   * For the customer-encrypted VHD scenario, upload the encrypted VHD to your storage account and the encryption key material to your key vault. Then, provide the encryption configuration to enable encryption on a new IaaS VM.
   * For new VMs that are created from the Marketplace and existing VMs that already run in Azure, provide the encryption configuration to enable encryption on the IaaS VM.

1. Grant access to the Azure platform to read the encryption key material (BitLocker encryption keys for Windows systems and Passphrase for Linux) from your key vault to enable encryption on the IaaS VM.

1. Provide the Azure AD application identity to write the encryption key material to your key vault. This step enables encryption on the IaaS VM for the scenarios mentioned in step 2.

1. Azure updates the VM service model with encryption and the key vault configuration, and sets up your encrypted VM.
