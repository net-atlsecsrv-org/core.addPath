# Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - Data Analytics for NIST SP 800-171

## Overview
[NIST Special Publication 800-171](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf) provides guidelines for protecting the controlled unclassified information (CUI) that resides in nonfederal information systems and organizations. NIST SP 800-171 establishes 14 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI.

This Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint provides guidance to help customers deploy a data analytics architecture in Azure that implements a subset of NIST SP 800-171 controls. This solution demonstrates ways in which customers can meet specific security and compliance requirements. It also serves as a foundation for customers to build and configure their own data analytics solutions in Azure.

This reference architecture, associated implementation guide, and threat model are intended to serve as a foundation for customers to adapt to their specific requirements. They shouldn't be used as-is in a production environment. Deploying this architecture without modification is insufficient to completely meet the requirements of NIST SP 800-171. Customers are responsible for conducting appropriate security and compliance assessments of any solution built that uses this architecture. Requirements might vary based on the specifics of each customer's implementation.

## Architecture diagram and components
This solution provides an analytics platform upon which customers can build their own analytics tools. The reference architecture outlines a generic use case. Customers can use it to input data through bulk data imports by the SQL/Data administrator. They also can use it to input data through operational data updates via an operational user. Both workstreams incorporate Azure Functions for importing data into Azure SQL Database. Azure Functions must be configured by the customer through the Azure portal to handle the import tasks unique to the customer's analytics requirements.

Azure offers a variety of reporting and analytics services for the customer. This solution uses Azure Machine Learning services and SQL Database to rapidly browse through data and deliver quicker results through smarter modeling of data. Machine Learning is intended to increase query speeds by discovering new relationships between datasets. Initially, data is trained through several statistical functions. Afterward, up to seven additional query pools can be synchronized with the same tabular models to spread query workload and reduce response times. The customer server brings the total of query pools to eight.

For enhanced analytics and reporting, SQL Database can be configured with column store indexes. Machine Learning and SQL Database can be scaled up or down or shut off completely in response to customer usage. All SQL traffic is encrypted with SSL through the inclusion of self-signed certificates. As a best practice, we recommend the use of a trusted certificate authority for enhanced security.

After data is uploaded to the SQL database and trained by Machine Learning, it's digested by the operational user and SQL/Data administrator with Power BI. Power BI displays data intuitively and pulls together information across multiple datasets to draw greater insight. Power BI has a high degree of adaptability and easily integrates with SQL Database. Customers can configure it to handle a wide array of scenarios that are required by their business needs.

The entire solution is built upon Azure Storage, which customers configure from the Azure portal. Storage encrypts all data with Storage Service Encryption to maintain confidentiality of data at rest. Geo-redundant storage ensures that an adverse event at the customer's primary data center doesn't result in a loss of data. A second copy is stored in a separate location hundreds of miles away.

For enhanced security, all resources in this solution are managed as a resource group through Azure Resource Manager. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role-based access control (RBAC) is used to control access to deployed resources. These resources include customer keys in Azure Key Vault. System health is monitored through Azure Security Center and Azure Monitor. Customers configure both monitoring services to capture logs. System health is displayed in a single dashboard that's easy to use.

SQL Database is commonly managed through SQL Server Management Studio. It runs from a local machine configured to access the SQL database via a secure VPN or an Azure ExpressRoute connection. *We recommend that you configure a VPN or ExpressRoute connection for management and data import into the resource group*.

## Deployment architecture
The following section details the deployment and implementation elements.

**Azure Event Grid**:
With [Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview), customers can easily build applications with event-based architectures. Users select the Azure resource they want to subscribe to. Then they give the event handler or webhook an endpoint to send the event to. Customers can secure webhook endpoints by adding query parameters to the webhook URL when they create an event subscription. Event Grid supports only HTTPS webhook endpoints. With Event Grid, customers can control the level of access given to different users to do various management operations. Users can list event subscriptions, create new ones, and generate keys. Event Grid uses Azure RBAC.

**Azure Functions**:
[Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) is a serverless compute service that runs code on-demand. You don't have to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Use Azure Functions to run a script or piece of code in response to a variety of events.

**Azure Machine Learning service**:
[Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/) is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

**Azure Data Catalog**:
[Data Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-catalog/data-catalog-what-is-data-catalog) makes data sources easy to discover and understand by the users who manage the data. Common data sources can be registered, tagged, and searched for data. The data remains in its existing location, but a copy of its metadata is added to Data Catalog. A reference to the data source location is included. The metadata is indexed to make each data source easy to discover via search. Indexing also makes it understandable to the users who discover it.

### Virtual network
This reference architecture defines a private virtual network with an address space of 10.0.0.0/16.

**Network security groups**: [Network security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg) (NSGs) contain access control lists that allow or deny traffic within a virtual network. NSGs can be used to secure traffic at a subnet or individual virtual machine level. The following NSGs exist:
  - An NSG for Active Directory
  - An NSG for the workload

Each of the NSGs has specific ports and protocols open so that the solution can work securely and correctly. In addition, the following configurations are enabled for each NSG:
  -	[Diagnostic logs and events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-nsg-manage-log) are enabled and stored in a storage account
  -	Azure Monitor logs is connected to the [NSG's diagnostics](https://github.com/krnese/AzureDeploy/blob/master/AzureMgmt/AzureMonitor/nsgWithDiagnostics.json)

**Subnets**: Each subnet is associated with its corresponding NSG.

### Data in transit
Azure encrypts all communications to and from Azure data centers by default. All transactions to Storage through the Azure portal occur via HTTPS.

### Data at rest

The architecture protects data at rest through encryption, database auditing, and other measures.

**Azure Storage**:
To meet requirements for encrypted data at rest, all [Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) uses [Storage Service Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption). This feature helps protect and safeguard data in support of organizational security commitments and compliance requirements defined by NIST SP 800-171.

**Azure Disk Encryption**:
[Disk Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption) uses the BitLocker feature of Windows to provide volume encryption for data disks. The solution integrates with Azure Key Vault to help control and manage the disk-encryption keys.

**Azure SQL Database**:
The SQL Database instance uses the following database security measures:
-	[Active Directory authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication) enables identity management of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location.
-	[SQL database auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing-get-started) tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in an Azure storage account.
-	SQL Database is configured to use [transparent data encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql). It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files to protect information at rest. Transparent data encryption provides assurance that stored data hasn't been subject to unauthorized access.
-	[Firewall rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure) prevent all access to database servers until proper permissions are granted. The firewall grants access to databases based on the originating IP address of each request.
-	[SQL Threat Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection-get-started) enables the detection and response to potential threats as they occur. It provides security alerts for suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, SQL injection attacks, and anomalous database access patterns.
-	[Encrypted columns](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted-azure-key-vault) ensure that sensitive data never appears as plain text inside the database system. After data encryption is enabled, only client applications or application servers with access to the keys can access plain-text data.
- [SQL Database dynamic data masking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started) limits sensitive data exposure by masking the data to nonprivileged users or applications. It can automatically discover potentially sensitive data and suggest the appropriate masks to be applied. Dynamic data masking helps to reduce access so that sensitive data doesn't exit the database via unauthorized access. *Customers are responsible for adjusting settings to adhere to their database schema.*

### Identity management
The following technologies provide capabilities to manage access to data in the Azure environment:
-	[Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) is the Microsoft multitenant cloud-based directory and identity management service. All users for this solution are created in Azure AD and include the users who access SQL Database.
-	Authentication to the application is performed by using Azure AD. For more information, see how to [integrate applications with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications). The database column encryption also uses Azure AD to authenticate the application to SQL Database. For more information, see how to [protect sensitive data in SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted-azure-key-vault).
-	[Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure) can be used by administrators to define fine-grained access permissions. With it, they can grant only the amount of access that users need to perform their jobs. Instead of giving every user unrestricted permissions for Azure resources, administrators can allow only certain actions for accessing data. Subscription access is limited to the subscription administrator.
- [Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-getting-started) can be used by customers to minimize the number of users who have access to certain information, such as data. Administrators can use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to discover, restrict, and monitor privileged identities and their access to resources. This functionality also can be used to enforce on-demand, just-in-time administrative access when needed.
-	[Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection) detects potential vulnerabilities that affect an organization’s identities. It configures automated responses to detected suspicious actions related to an organization’s identities. It also investigates suspicious incidents to take appropriate action to resolve them.

### Security
**Secrets management**:
The solution uses [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) for the management of keys and secrets. Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. The following Key Vault capabilities help customers protect data:
- Advanced access policies are configured on a need basis.
- Key Vault access policies are defined with minimum required permissions to keys and secrets.
- All keys and secrets in Key Vault have expiration dates.
- All keys in Key Vault are protected by specialized hardware security modules. The key type is a hardware security-module-protected 2048-bit RSA key.
- All users and identities are granted minimum required permissions by using RBAC.
- Diagnostics logs for Key Vault are enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days.
- Permitted cryptographic operations for keys are restricted to the ones required.

**Azure Security Center**: With [Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-intro), customers can centrally apply and manage security policies across workloads, limit exposure to threats, and detect and respond to attacks. Security Center also accesses existing configurations of Azure services to provide configuration and service recommendations to help improve security posture and protect data.

 Security Center uses a variety of detection capabilities to alert customers of potential attacks that target their environments. These alerts contain valuable information about what triggered the alert, the resources targeted, and the source of the attack. Security Center has a set of [predefined security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-alerts-type) that are triggered when a threat or suspicious activity takes place. Customers can use [custom alert rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-custom-alert) to define new security alerts based on data that's already collected from their environment.

 Security Center provides prioritized security alerts and incidents. Security Center makes it simpler for customers to discover and address potential security issues. A [threat intelligence report](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-threat-report) is generated for each detected threat. Incident response teams can use the reports when they investigate and remediate threats.

### Logging and auditing

Azure services extensively log system and user activity, as well as system health:
- **Activity logs**: [Activity logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-activity-logs) provide insight into operations performed on resources in a subscription. Activity logs can help determine an operation's initiator, time of occurrence, and status.
- **Diagnostic logs**: [Diagnostic logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs) include all logs emitted by every resource. These logs include Windows event system logs, Storage logs, Key Vault audit logs, and Azure Application Gateway access and firewall logs. All diagnostic logs write to a centralized and encrypted Azure storage account for archival. Users can configure the retention period, up to 730 days, to meet their specific requirements.

**Azure Monitor logs**: Logs are consolidated in [Azure Monitor logs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/log-analytics/) for processing, storing, and dashboard reporting. After data is collected, it's organized into separate tables for each data type within Log Analytics workspaces. In this way, all data can be analyzed together, regardless of its original source. Security Center integrates with Azure Monitor logs. Customers can use Kusto queries to access their security event data and combine it with data from other services.

The following Azure [monitoring solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions) are included as a part of this architecture:
-	[Active Directory assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-ad-assessment): The Active Directory Health Check solution assesses the risk and health of server environments on a regular interval. It provides a prioritized list of recommendations specific to the deployed server infrastructure.
- [SQL assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-sql-assessment): The SQL Health Check solution assesses the risk and health of server environments on a regular interval. It provides customers with a prioritized list of recommendations specific to the deployed server infrastructure.
- [Agent Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/operations-management-suite/oms-solution-agenthealth): The Agent Health solution reports how many agents are deployed and their geographic distribution. It also reports on how many agents are unresponsive and the number of agents that submit operational data.
-	[Activity Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-activity): The Activity Log Analytics solution assists with analysis of the Azure activity logs across all Azure subscriptions for a customer.

**Azure Automation**: [Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker) stores, runs, and manages runbooks. In this solution, runbooks help collect logs from SQL Database. Customers can use the Automation [Change Tracking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-change-tracking) solution to easily identify changes in the environment.

**Azure Monitor**:
[Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/) helps users track performance, maintain security, and identify trends. Organizations can use it to audit, create alerts, and archive data. They also can track API calls in their Azure resources.

**Application Insights**:
[Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/) is an extensible Application Performance Management service for web developers on multiple platforms. It detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools. The tools help diagnose issues and help customers understand what users do with the app. It's designed to help users continuously improve performance and usability.

## Threat model

The data flow diagram for this reference architecture is available for [download](https://aka.ms/nist171-analytics-tm) or can be found here. This model can help customers understand the points of potential risk in the system infrastructure when they make modifications.

![Data Analytics for NIST SP 800-171 threat model](images/nist171-analytics-threat-model.png "Data Analytics for NIST SP 800-171 threat model")

## Compliance documentation
The [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - NIST SP 800-171 Customer Responsibility Matrix](https://aka.ms/nist171-crm) lists all security controls required by NIST SP 800-171. This matrix details whether the implementation of each control is the responsibility of Microsoft, the customer, or shared between the two.

The [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - NIST SP 800-171 Data Analytics Control Implementation Matrix](https://aka.ms/nist171-analytics-cim) provides information on which NIST SP 800-171 controls are addressed by the data analytics architecture. It includes detailed descriptions of how the implementation meets the requirements of each covered control.


## Guidance and recommendations
### VPN and ExpressRoute
A secure VPN tunnel or [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) must be configured to securely establish a connection to the resources deployed as a part of this data analytics reference architecture. By appropriately setting up a VPN or ExpressRoute, customers can add a layer of protection for data in transit.

By implementing a secure VPN tunnel with Azure, a virtual private connection between an on-premises network and an Azure virtual network can be created. This connection takes place over the Internet. Customers can use the connection to securely “tunnel” information inside an encrypted link between their network and Azure. Site-to-site VPN is a secure, mature technology that has been deployed by enterprises of all sizes for decades. The [IPsec tunnel mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc786385(v=ws.10)) is used in this option as an encryption mechanism.

Because traffic within the VPN tunnel traverses the Internet with a site-to-site VPN, Microsoft offers another even more secure connection option. ExpressRoute is a dedicated WAN link between Azure and an on-premises location or an Exchange hosting provider. ExpressRoute connections connect directly to a customer's telecommunication provider. As a result, the data doesn't travel over the Internet and isn't exposed to it. These connections offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections. 

Best practices for implementing a secure hybrid network that extends an on-premises network to Azure are [available](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid).

### Extract-transform-load process
[PolyBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide) can load data into SQL Database without the need for a separate extract-transform-load or import tool. PolyBase allows access to data through T-SQL queries. The Microsoft business intelligence and analysis stack and third-party tools that are compatible with SQL Server can be used with PolyBase.

### Azure AD setup
[Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) is essential to managing the deployment and provisioning access to personnel who interact with the environment. On-premises Active Directory can be integrated with Azure AD in [four clicks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-express). Customers also can tie the deployed Active Directory infrastructure (domain controllers) to Azure AD. To do this, make the deployed Active Directory infrastructure a subdomain of an Azure AD forest.
