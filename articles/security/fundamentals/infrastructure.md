# Azure infrastructure security
Microsoft Azure runs in datacenters managed and operated by Microsoft. These geographically dispersed datacenters comply with key industry standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and NIST SP 800-53, for security and reliability. The datacenters are managed, monitored, and administered by Microsoft operations staff. The operations staff has years of experience in delivering the worldâ€™s largest online services with 24 x 7 continuity.
