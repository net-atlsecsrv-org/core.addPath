### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to your Customer Lockbox requests. You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Azure Active Directory.

At the customer organization, the user who has the Owner role for the Azure subscription receives an email from Microsoft, to notify them about any pending access requests. For Customer Lockbox requests, this person is the designated approver.

* [Understand custom roles](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md)

* [How to configure Azure RBAC for workbooks](../../sentinel/quickstart-get-visibility.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

* [How to use Azure Security Center to monitor identity and access (Preview)](../../security-center/security-center-identity-access.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.8: Manage Azure resources from only approved locations

**Guidance**: Use Conditional Access named locations to allow access to the Azure portal from only specific logical groupings of IP address ranges or countries/regions.

* [How to configure named locations in Azure](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory as the central authentication and authorization system where applicable. Azure Active Directory protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure Active Directory also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

* [How to create and configure an Azure Active Directory instance](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory provides logs to help you discover stale accounts. In addition, use Azure Active Directory access reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right users have continued access.

You have access to Azure Active Directory sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure Active Directory user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

* [How to integrate Azure activity logs into Azure Monitor](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics.md)
