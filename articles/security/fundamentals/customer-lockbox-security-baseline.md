## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to your Customer Lockbox requests. You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

At the customer organization, the user who has the Owner role for the Azure subscription receives an email from Microsoft, to notify them about any pending access requests. For Customer Lockbox requests, this person is the designated approver.

- [How to configure Azure RBAC for workbooks](../../sentinel/quickstart-get-visibility.md)

- [Understand access request permissions in Customer Lockbox](customer-lockbox-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

- [How to use Azure Security Center to monitor identity and access (Preview)](../../security-center/security-center-identity-access.md)

- [How to use Azure Policy](../../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Not applicable; access to Customer Lockbox is through the Azure portal and reserved for accounts with the tenant role of Owner. Single sign-on is not supported.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.5: Use multi-factor authentication for all Azure Active Directory-based access

**Guidance**: Enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.
