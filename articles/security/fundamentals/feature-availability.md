# Cloud feature availability for US Government customers

This article describes feature availability in the Microsoft Azure and Azure Government clouds for the following security services:

- Azure Sentinel

> [!NOTE]
> Additional security services will be added to this article soon.
> 

## Azure Government

Azure Government uses the same underlying technologies as Azure (sometimes referred to as Azure Commercial or Azure Public), which includes the core components of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Both Azure and Azure Government have comprehensive security controls in place, and the Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data.

Azure Government is a physically isolated cloud environment dedicated to US federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and their partners. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to screened US persons. These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations such as the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810.

For more information about Azure Government, see [What is Azure Government?](/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome)

## Microsoft 365 integration

Integrations between products rely on interoperability between Azure and Office platforms. Offerings hosted in the Azure environment are accessible from the Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Government platforms. Office 365 and Office 365 GCC are paired with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Azure AD in Azure Government.

The following diagram displays the hierarchy of Microsoft clouds and how they relate to each other.

The Office 365 GCC environment helps customers comply with US government requirements, including FedRAMP High, CJIS, and IRS 1075. The Office 365 GCC High and DoD environments support customers who need compliance with DoD IL4/5, DFARS 7012, NIST 800-171, and ITAR.

For more information about Office 365 US Government environments, see:

- [Office 365 GCC](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc)
- [Office 365 GCC High and DoD](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod)


The following sections identify when a service has an integration with Microsoft 365 and the feature availability for Office 365 GCC, Office 365 High, and Office 365 DoD.
## Azure Sentinel

Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM), and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

For more information, see the [Azure Sentinel product documentation](/azure/sentinel/overview).

The following tables display the current Azure Sentinel feature availability in Azure and Azure Government.

### Microsoft 365 data connectors

Office 365 GCC is paired with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Azure AD in Azure Government.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to pay attention to the Azure environment to understand where [interoperability is possible](#microsoft-365-integration). In the following table, interoperability that is *not* possible is marked with a dash (-) to indicate that support is not relevant.
