# Security attributes for Azure services

This article collects the security attributes for selected Azure services. A security attribute is a quality or feature of an Azure service. It contributes to the service's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to security vulnerabilities.

Security attributes are categorized as:
* Preventative
* Network segmentation
* Detection
* Support for identity and access management
* Audit trail
* Access controls (if used)
* Configuration management (if used)

In each category, we show "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether an attribute is used. For some services, we show "N/A" for an attribute that is not applicable. We might also provide a note or a link to more information about an attribute.

## [API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-security-attributes)

### Preventative

| Security Attribute | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Encryption at rest (such as server-side encryption, server-side encryption with customer-managed keys, and other encryption features) | Sensitive data such as certificates, keys, and secret-named values are encrypted with service-managed, per service instance keys. |

| Vulnerability               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ticketbleed (CVE-2016-9244) | Ticketbleed is vulnerability in the implementation of the TLS SessionTicket extension found in some F5 products. It allows the leakage ("bleeding") of up to 31 bytes of data from uninitialized memory. This is caused by the TLS stack padding a Session ID, passed from the client, with data to make it 32 bits long. |

### Preventative

| Security attribute | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Encryption at rest (such as server-side encryption, server-side encryption with customer-managed keys, and other encryption features) | Yes | Web site file content is stored in Azure Storage, which automatically encrypts the content at rest. See [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).<br><br>Customer supplied secrets are encrypted at rest. The secrets are encrypted at rest while stored in App Service configuration databases.<br><br>Locally attached disks can optionally be used as temporary storage by websites (D:\local and %TMP%). Locally attached disks are not encrypted at rest. |
| Encryption in transit (such as ExpressRoute encryption, in VNet encryption, and VNet-VNet encryption ) | Yes | Customers can configure web sites to require and use HTTPS for inbound traffic. See the blog post [How to make an Azure App Service HTTPS only](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2017/11/30/how-to-make-an-azure-app-service-https-only/). |
