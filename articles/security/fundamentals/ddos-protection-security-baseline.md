# Azure security baseline for Azure DDoS Protection Standard

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure DDoS Protection standard. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to DDoS Protection. **Controls** not applicable to DDoS Protection have been excluded. To see how DDoS Protection completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full DDoS Protection security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see [Security control: Logging and monitoring](../benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on your Azure DDoS Protection plans at the control plane level. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure DDoS Protection instances.
