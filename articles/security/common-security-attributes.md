### Preventative

| Security Attribute | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Encryption at rest:<ul><li>Server-side encryption</li><li>Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys</li><li>Other encryption features (such as client-side, always encrypted, etc.)</ul>| Yes (service-side encryption only) | Sensitive data such as certificates, keys, and secret-named values are encrypted with service-managed, per service instance keys. |

| Security Attribute | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Configuration management support (versioning of configuration, etc.)| Yes | Using the [Azure API Management DevOps Resource Kit](https://aka.ms/apimdevops) |


## [Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-security-attributes.md)

### Preventative

| Security attribute | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Encryption at rest (such as server-side encryption, server-side encryption with customer-managed keys, and other encryption features) | Yes | Web site file content is stored in Azure Storage, which automatically encrypts the content at rest. See [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md).<br><br>Customer supplied secrets are encrypted at rest. The secrets are encrypted at rest while stored in App Service configuration databases.<br><br>Locally attached disks can optionally be used as temporary storage by websites (D:\local and %TMP%). Locally attached disks are not encrypted at rest. |
| Encryption in transit (such as ExpressRoute encryption, in VNet encryption, and VNet-VNet encryption )| Yes | Customers can configure web sites to require and use HTTPS for inbound traffic. See the blog post [How to make an Azure App Service HTTPS only](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2017/11/30/how-to-make-an-azure-app-service-https-only/). |
