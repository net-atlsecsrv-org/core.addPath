# Azure Functions and serverless platform security
## Abstract
Most enterprises need a significant amount of resources and time to manage servers, which adds cost. If enterprises can use fewer resources to manage servers, they can focus on building great applications.  

Serverless computing helps you do just that, because the infrastructure that you need to run and scale your apps is managed for you. Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and operating systems. Serverless computing is driven by the reaction to events and triggers, which are all taking place in near real-time—in the cloud. 

As a fully managed service, server management and capacity planning are invisible to the developer. The serverless framework helps you develop and deploy serverless applications by using Azure Functions. It's a command-line interface (CLI) that offers structure and automation to help you build sophisticated, event-driven, serverless architectures composed of functions and events. An Azure function is an independent unit of deployment, like a microservice. It's merely code, deployed in the cloud, that is most often written to perform a single job.

Despite the benefits, serverless security has its own risk factors to deal with. The serverless approach doesn’t introduce new security concerns, but it requires having an approach to existing security concerns. This white paper focuses on these security matters: 
* Benefits of a serverless platform
* Security issues in serverless computing
* Critical security issues and mitigations in the context of Azure
* Securing the Microsoft serverless platform
