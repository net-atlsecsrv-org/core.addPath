# OS patching for HDInsight 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ubuntu images become available for new HDInsight cluster creation within 3 months of being published. As of January 2019, running clusters are **not** auto-patched. Customers must use script actions or other mechanisms to patch a running cluster. Newly created clusters will always have the latest available updates, including the most recent security patches.

## How to configure the OS patching schedule for Linux-based HDInsight clusters
The virtual machines in an HDInsight cluster need to be rebooted occasionally so that important security patches can be installed. 

Using the script action described in this article, you can modify the OS patching schedule as follows:
1. Install full OS updates or install security updates only
2. Reboot the VM

> [!NOTE]  
> This script action will only work with Linux-based HDInsight clusters created after August 1st, 2016. Patches will be effective only when VMs are rebooted. 
> This script will not automatically apply updates for all future update cycles. Run the script each time new updates need to be applied in order to install the updates and reboot the VM.

## How to use the script 

When using this script requires the following information:
1. The script location: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxospatchingrebootconfigv02/os-patching-reboot-config.sh.
 	HDInsight uses this URI to find and run the script on all the virtual machines in the cluster.
  
2. The cluster node types that the script is applied to: headnode, workernode, zookeeper. This script must be applied to all node types in the cluster. If it is not applied to a node type, then the virtual machines for that node type will not be updated.


3.  Parameter: This script accepts one numeric parameter:

    | Parameter | Definition |
    | --- | --- |
    | Install full OS updates/Install security updates only |0 or 1. A value of 0 installs security updates only while 1 installs full OS updates. If no parameter is provided the default is 0. |

> [!NOTE]  
> You must mark this script as persisted when applying to an existing cluster. Otherwise, any new nodes created through scaling operations will use the default patching schedule.  If you apply the script as part of the cluster creation process, it is persisted automatically.


## Next steps
