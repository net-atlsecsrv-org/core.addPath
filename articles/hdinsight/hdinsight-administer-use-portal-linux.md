# Manage Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight by using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [selector](../../includes/hdinsight-portal-management-selector.md)]

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can manage [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) clusters in Azure HDInsight. Use the tab selector above for information on managing Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using other tools.

## Prerequisites

An existing Apache Hadoop cluster in HDInsight.  See [Create Linux-based clusters in HDInsight using the Azure portal](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md).

## Getting Started

Sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

## <a name="showClusters"></a> List and show clusters

The **HDInsight clusters** page will list your existing clusters.  From the portal:
1. Select **All services** from the left menu.
2. Select **HDInsight clusters** under **ANALYTICS**.

## <a name="homePage"></a> Cluster home page

Select your cluster name from the [**HDInsight clusters**](#showClusters) page.  This will open the **Overview** view, which looks similar to the following image:

## Move clusters

You can move an HDInsight cluster to another Azure resource group or another subscription.

From the [cluster home page](#homePage):

1. Select **Move** from the top menu.
2. Select **Move to another resource group** or **Move to another subscription**.
3. Follow the instructions from the new page.

## Delete clusters

Deleting a cluster doesn't delete the default storage account nor any linked storage accounts. You can re-create the cluster by using the same storage accounts and the same metastores. We recommend using a new default Blob container when you re-create the cluster.

From the [cluster home page](#homePage):

1. Select **Delete** from the top menu.
2. Follow the instructions from the new page.

See also [Pause/shut down clusters](#pauseshut-down-clusters).

## Add additional storage accounts

You can add additional Azure Storage accounts and Azure Data Lake Storage accounts after a cluster is created. For more information, see [Add additional storage accounts to HDInsight](./hdinsight-hadoop-add-storage.md).

## Scale clusters

The cluster scaling feature allows you to change the number of worker nodes used by an Azure HDInsight cluster, without having to re-create the cluster.

See [Scale HDInsight clusters](./hdinsight-scaling-best-practices.md) for complete information.

## Pause/shut down clusters

Most of Hadoop jobs are batch jobs that are only run occasionally. For most Hadoop clusters, there are large periods of time that the cluster isn't being used for processing. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it isn't in use.
You're also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it isn't in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they aren't in use.

There are many ways you can program the process:

- User Azure Data Factory. See [Create on-demand Linux-based Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using Azure Data Factory](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf.md) for creating on-demand HDInsight linked services.
- Use Azure PowerShell.  See [Analyze flight delay data](./interactive-query/interactive-query-tutorial-analyze-flight-data.md).
- Use Azure CLI. See [Manage Azure HDInsight clusters using Azure CLI](hdinsight-administer-use-command-line.md).
- Use HDInsight .NET SDK. See [Submit Apache Hadoop jobs](hadoop/submit-apache-hadoop-jobs-programmatically.md).

For the pricing information, see [HDInsight pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/hdinsight/). To delete a cluster from the Portal, see [Delete clusters](#delete-clusters)

## Upgrade clusters

See [Upgrade HDInsight cluster to a newer version](./hdinsight-upgrade-cluster.md).

## Open the Apache Ambari web UI

Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs. Ambari enables system administrators to manage and monitor Hadoop clusters.

From the [cluster home page](#homePage):

1. Select **Cluster dashboards**.

    ![HDInsight Apache Hadoop cluster menu](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux/hdinsight-azure-portal-cluster-menu2.png)

1. Select **Ambari home** from the new page.
1. Enter the cluster username and password.  The default cluster username is _admin_.

For more information, see [Manage HDInsight clusters by using the Apache Ambari Web UI](hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md).

## Change passwords

An HDInsight cluster can have two user accounts. The HDInsight cluster user account (HTTP user account) and the SSH user account are created during the creation process. You can use the portal to change the cluster user account password, and script actions to change the SSH user account.

### Change the cluster user password

> [!NOTE]  
> Changing the cluster user (admin) password may cause script actions run against this cluster to fail. If you have any persisted script actions that target worker nodes, these scripts may fail when you add nodes to the cluster through resize operations. For more information on script actions, see [Customize HDInsight clusters using script actions](hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md).

From the [cluster home page](#homePage):
1. Select **SSH + Cluster login** under **Settings**.
2. Select **Reset credential**.
3. Enter and confirm new password in the text boxes.
4. Select **OK**.

The password is changed on all nodes in the cluster.

### Change the SSH user password

1. Using a text editor, save the following text as a file named **changepassword.sh**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > You must use an editor that uses LF as the line ending. If the editor uses CRLF, then the script does not work.

    ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    USER=$1
    PASS=$2
    usermod --password $(echo $PASS | openssl passwd -1 -stdin) $USER
    ```

2. Upload the file to a storage location that can be accessed from HDInsight using an HTTP or HTTPS address. For example, a public file store such as OneDrive or Azure Blob storage. Save the URI (HTTP or HTTPS address) to the file, as this URI is needed in the next step.
3. From the [cluster home page](#homePage), select **Script actions** under **Settings**.
4. From the **Script actions** page, select **Submit new**.
5. From the **Submit script action** page, enter the following information:

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Script type | Select **- Custom** from the drop-down list.|
   | Name |"Change ssh password" |
   | Bash script URI |The URI to the changepassword.sh file |
   | Node type(s): (Head, Worker, Nimbus, Supervisor, or Zookeeper.) |✓ for all node types listed |
   | Parameters |Enter the SSH user name and then the new password. There should be one space between the user name and the password. |
   | Persist this script action ... |Leave this field unchecked. |

6. Select **Create** to apply the script. Once the script finishes, you're able to connect to the cluster using SSH with the new password.

## Find the subscription ID

Each cluster is tied to an Azure subscription.  The Azure subscription ID is visible from the [cluster home page](#homePage).

## Find the resource group

In the Azure Resource Manager mode, each HDInsight cluster is created with an Azure Resource Manager group. The Resource Manager group is visible from the [cluster home page](#homePage).

## Find the storage accounts

HDInsight clusters use either an Azure Storage account or Azure Data Lake Storage to store data. Each HDInsight cluster can have one default storage account and a number of linked storage accounts. To list the storage accounts, from the [cluster home page](#homePage) under **Settings**, select **Storage accounts**.

## Monitor jobs

See [Manage HDInsight clusters by using the Apache Ambari Web UI](hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md#monitoring).

## Cluster size

The **Cluster size** tile from the [cluster home page](#homePage) displays the number of cores allocated to this cluster and how they're allocated for the nodes within this cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To monitor the services provided by the HDInsight cluster, you must use Ambari Web or the Ambari REST API. For more information on using Ambari, see [Manage HDInsight clusters using Apache Ambari](hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md)
