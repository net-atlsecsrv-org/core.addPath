# Use Spark & Hive Tools for Visual Studio Code

Learn how to use Spark & Hive Tools for Visual Studio Code to create and submit Apache Hive batch jobs, interactive Hive queries, and PySpark scripts for Apache Spark. First we'll describe how to install Spark & Hive Tools in Visual Studio Code, and then we'll walk through how to submit jobs to Spark & Hive Tools.  

Spark & Hive Tools can be installed on platforms that are supported by Visual Studio Code, which include Windows, Linux, and macOS. Note the following prerequisites for different platforms.

## Prerequisites

The following items are required for completing the steps in this article:

- An Azure HDInsight cluster. To create a cluster, see [Get started with HDInsight](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal.md). Or use a Spark and Hive cluster that supports an Apache Livy endpoint.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/). Mono is required only for Linux and macOS.
- [A PySpark interactive environment for Visual Studio Code](set-up-pyspark-interactive-environment.md).
- A local directory. This article uses  **C:\HD\HDexample**.

## Install Spark & Hive Tools

After you meet the prerequisites, you can install Spark & Hive Tools for Visual Studio Code by following these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. From the menu bar, navigate to **View** > **Extensions**.

3. In the search box, enter **Spark & Hive**.

4. Select **Spark & Hive Tools** from the search results, and then select **Install**:

5. Select **Reload** when necessary.

## Open a work folder

To open a work folder and to create a file in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. From the menu bar, navigate to to **File** > **Open Folder...** > **C:\HD\HDexample**, and then select the **Select Folder** button. The folder appears in the **Explorer** view on the left.

2. In **Explorer** view, select the **HDexample** folder, and then select the **New File** icon next to the work folder:

   ![visual studio code new file icon](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/visual-studio-code-new-file.png)

3. Name the new file by using either the `.hql` (Hive queries) or the `.py` (Spark script) file extension. This example uses **HelloWorld.hql**.

## Set the Azure environment

For a national cloud user, follow these steps to set the Azure environment first, and then use the **Azure: Sign In** command to sign in to Azure:

1. Navigate to  **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings**.
2. Search on the following string: **Azure: Cloud**.
3. Select the national cloud from the list:

   ![Set default login entry configuration](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/set-default-login-entry-configuration.png)

## Connect to an Azure account

Before you can submit scripts to your clusters from Visual Studio Code, you must either connect to your Azure account or link a cluster (using Apache Ambari username and password credentials or a domain-joined account). Follow these steps to connect to Azure:

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **View** > **Command Palette...**, and enter **Azure: Sign In**:

    ![Spark & Hive Tools for Visual Studio Code login](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/hdinsight-for-vscode-extension-login.png)

## Link a cluster

### Link: Azure HDInsight

You can link a normal cluster by using an [Apache Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/)-managed username, or you can link an Enterprise Security Pack secure Hadoop cluster by using a domain username (such as: `user1@contoso.com`).

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **View** > **Command Palette...**, and enter **Spark / Hive: Link a Cluster**.

   ![Command Palette link cluster command](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/link-cluster-command.png)

2. Select linked cluster type **Azure HDInsight**.

3. Enter the HDInsight cluster URL.

4. Enter your Ambari username; the default is **admin**.

5. Enter your Ambari password.

6. Select the cluster type.

7. Set the display name of the cluster (optional).

8. Review **OUTPUT** view for verification.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The linked username and password are used if the cluster both logged in to the Azure subscription and linked a cluster.  

### Link: Generic Livy endpoint

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **View** > **Command Palette...**, and enter **Spark / Hive: Link a Cluster**.

2. Select linked cluster type **Generic Livy Endpoint**.

3. Enter the generic Livy endpoint. For example: http\://10.172.41.42:18080.

4. Select authorization type **Basic** or **None**.  If you select **Basic**:  
    &emsp;a. Enter your Ambari username; the default is **admin**.  
    &emsp;b. Enter your Ambari password.

5. Review **OUTPUT** view for verification.

## List clusters

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **View** > **Command Palette...**, and enter **Spark / Hive: List Cluster**.

2. Select the subscription that you want.

3. Review the **OUTPUT** view. This view shows your linked cluster (or clusters) and all the clusters under your Azure subscription:

## Set the default cluster

1. Reopen the **HDexample** folder that was discussed [earlier](#open-a-work-folder), if closed.  

2. Select the **HelloWorld.hql** file that was created [earlier](#open-a-work-folder). It opens in the script editor.

3. Right-click the script editor, and then select **Spark / Hive: Set Default Cluster**.  

4. [Connect](#connect-to-an-azure-account) to your Azure account, or link a cluster if you haven't yet done so.

5. Select a cluster as the default cluster for the current script file. The tools automatically update the **.VSCode\settings.json** configuration file:

   ![Set default cluster configuration](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/set-default-cluster-configuration.png)

## Submit interactive Hive queries and Hive batch scripts

With Spark & Hive Tools for Visual Studio Code, you can submit interactive Hive queries and Hive batch scripts to your clusters.

1. Reopen the **HDexample** folder that was discussed [earlier](#open-a-work-folder), if closed.  

2. Select the **HelloWorld.hql** file that was created [earlier](#open-a-work-folder). It opens in the script editor.

3. Copy and paste the following code into your Hive file, and then save it:

    ```hiveql
    SELECT * FROM hivesampletable;
    ```

4. [Connect](#connect-to-an-azure-account) to your Azure account, or link a cluster if you haven't yet done so.

5. Right-click the script editor and select **Hive: Interactive** to submit the query, or use the Ctrl+Alt+I keyboard shortcut.  Select **Hive: Batch** to submit the script, or use the Ctrl+Alt+H keyboard shortcut.  

6. If you haven't specified a default cluster, select a cluster. The tools also let you submit a block of code instead of the whole script file by using the context menu. After a few moments, the query results appear in a new tab:

   ![Interactive Apache Hive query result](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/interactive-hive-result.png)

    - **RESULTS** panel: You can save the whole result as a CSV, JSON, or Excel file to a local path or just select multiple lines.

    - **MESSAGES** panel: When you select a **Line** number, it jumps to the first line of the running script.

## Submit interactive PySpark queries

To submit interactive PySpark queries, follow these steps:

1. Reopen the **HDexample** folder that was discussed [earlier](#open-a-work-folder), if closed.  

2. Create a new **HelloWorld.py** file, following the [earlier](#open-a-work-folder) steps.

3. Copy and paste the following code into the script file:

   ```python
   from operator import add
   lines = spark.read.text("/HdiSamples/HdiSamples/FoodInspectionData/README").rdd.map(lambda r: r[0])
   counters = lines.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')) \
                .map(lambda x: (x, 1)) \
                .reduceByKey(add)

   coll = counters.collect()
   sortedCollection = sorted(coll, key = lambda r: r[1], reverse = True)

   for i in range(0, 5):
        print(sortedCollection[i])
   ```

4. [Connect](#connect-to-an-azure-account) to your Azure account, or link a cluster if you haven't yet done so.

5. Select all the code, right-click the script editor, and select **Spark: PySpark Interactive** to submit the query. Or, use the Ctrl+Alt+I shortcut.

   ![pyspark interactive context menu](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/pyspark-interactive-right-click.png)

   > ![pyspark interactive python extension disabled](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/pyspark-interactive-python-extension-disabled.png)

## Submit PySpark batch job

1. Reopen the **HDexample** folder that you discussed [earlier](#open-a-work-folder), if closed.  

2. Create a new **BatchFile.py** file by following the [earlier](#open-a-work-folder) steps.

3. Copy and paste the following code into the script file:

    ```python
    from __future__ import print_function
    import sys
    from operator import add
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        spark = SparkSession\
            .builder\
            .appName("PythonWordCount")\
            .getOrCreate()
    
        lines = spark.read.text('/HdiSamples/HdiSamples/SensorSampleData/hvac/HVAC.csv').rdd.map(lambda r: r[0])
        counts = lines.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(' '))\
                    .map(lambda x: (x, 1))\
                    .reduceByKey(add)
        output = counts.collect()
        for (word, count) in output:
            print("%s: %i" % (word, count))
        spark.stop()
    ```

4. [Connect](#connect-to-an-azure-account) to your Azure account, or link a cluster if you haven't yet done so.

5. Right-click the script editor, and then select **Spark: PySpark Batch**, or use the Ctrl+Alt+H keyboard shortcut.

6. Select a cluster to submit your PySpark job to:

   ![Submit Python job result output](./media/hdinsight-for-vscode/submit-pythonjob-result.png)

After you submit a Python job, submission logs appear in the **OUTPUT** window in Visual Studio Code. The Spark UI URL and Yarn UI URL are also shown. You can open the URL in a web browser to track the job status.
