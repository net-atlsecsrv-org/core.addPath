# Troubleshoot Apache HBase by using Azure HDInsight

Learn about the top issues and their resolutions when working with Apache HBase payloads in Apache Ambari.

## How do I run hbck command reports with multiple unassigned regions?

A common error message that you might see when you run the `hbase hbck` command is "multiple regions being unassigned or holes in the chain of regions."

In the HBase Master UI, you can see the number of regions that are unbalanced across all region servers. Then, you can run `hbase hbck` command to see holes in the region chain.

Holes might be caused by the offline regions, so fix the assignments first. 

To bring the unassigned regions back to a normal state, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the HDInsight HBase cluster by using SSH.
2. To connect with the Apache ZooKeeper shell, run the `hbase zkcli` command.
3. Run the `rmr /hbase/regions-in-transition` command or the `rmr /hbase-unsecure/regions-in-transition` command.
4. To exit from the `hbase zkcli` shell, use the `exit` command.
5. Open the Apache Ambari UI, and then restart the Active HBase Master service.
6. Run the `hbase hbck` command again (without any options). Check the output of this command to ensure that all regions are being assigned.


## <a name="how-do-i-fix-timeout-issues-with-hbck-commands-for-region-assignments"></a>How do I fix timeout issues when using hbck commands for region assignments?

### Issue

A potential cause for timeout issues when you use the `hbck` command might be that several regions are in the "in transition" state for a long time. You can see those regions as offline in the HBase Master UI. Because a high number of regions are attempting to transition, HBase Master might timeout and be unable to bring those regions back online.

### Resolution steps

1. Sign in to the HDInsight HBase cluster by using SSH.
2. To connect with the Apache ZooKeeper shell, run the `hbase zkcli` command.
3. Run the `rmr /hbase/regions-in-transition` or the `rmr /hbase-unsecure/regions-in-transition` command.
4. To exit the `hbase zkcli` shell, use the `exit` command.
5. In the Ambari UI, restart the Active HBase Master service.
6. Run the `hbase hbck -fixAssignments` command again.

## How do I fix JDBC or SQLLine connectivity issues with Apache Phoenix?

### Resolution steps

To connect with Apache Phoenix, you must provide the IP address of an active Apache ZooKeeper node. Ensure that the ZooKeeper service to which sqlline.py is trying to connect is up and running.
1. Sign in to the HDInsight cluster by using SSH.
2. Enter the following command:
                
   ```apache
           "/usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/bin/sqlline.py <IP of machine where Active Zookeeper is running"
   ```

   > [!Note] 
   > You can get the IP address of the active ZooKeeper node from the Ambari UI. Go to **HBase** > **Quick Links** > **ZK\* (Active)** > **Zookeeper Info**. 

3. If the sqlline.py connects to Phoenix and does not timeout, run the following command to validate the availability and health of Phoenix:

   ```apache
           !tables
           !quit
   ```      
4. If this command works, there is no issue. The IP address provided by the user might be incorrect. However, if the command pauses for an extended time and then displays the following error, continue to step 5.

   ```apache
           Error while connecting to sqlline.py (Hbase - phoenix) Setting property: [isolation, TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED] issuing: !connect jdbc:phoenix:10.2.0.7 none none org.apache.phoenix.jdbc.PhoenixDriver Connecting to jdbc:phoenix:10.2.0.7 SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings. 
   ```

5. Run the following commands from the head node (hn0) to diagnose the condition of the Phoenix SYSTEM.CATALOG table:

   ```apache
            hbase shell
                
           count 'SYSTEM.CATALOG'
   ```

   The command should return an error similar to the following: 

   ```apache
           ERROR: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException: Region SYSTEM.CATALOG,,1485464083256.c0568c94033870c517ed36c45da98129. is not online on 10.2.0.5,16020,1489466172189) 
   ```
6. In the Apache Ambari UI, complete the following steps to restart the HMaster service on all ZooKeeper nodes:

    1. In the **Summary** section of HBase, go to **HBase** > **Active HBase Master**. 
    2. In the **Components** section, restart the HBase Master service.
    3. Repeat these steps for all remaining **Standby HBase Master** services. 

It can take up to five minutes for the HBase Master service to stabilize and finish the recovery process. After a few minutes, repeat the sqlline.py commands to confirm that the SYSTEM.CATALOG table is up, and that it can be queried. 

When the SYSTEM.CATALOG table is back to normal, the connectivity issue to Phoenix should be automatically resolved.

## What causes a restart failure on a region server?

### Issue

A restart failure on a region server might be prevented by following best practices. We recommend that you pause heavy workload activity when you are planning to restart HBase region servers. If an application continues to connect with region servers when shutdown is in progress, the region server restart operation will be slower by several minutes. Also, it's a good idea to first flush all the tables. For a reference on how to flush tables, see [HDInsight HBase: How to improve the Apache HBase cluster restart time by flushing tables](https://web.archive.org/web/20190112153155/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuredatalake/2016/09/19/hdinsight-hbase-how-to-improve-hbase-cluster-restart-time-by-flushing-tables/).

If you initiate the restart operation on HBase region servers from the Apache Ambari UI, you immediately see that the region servers went down, but they don't restart right away. 

Here's what's happening behind the scenes: 

1. The Ambari agent sends a stop request to the region server.
2. The Ambari agent waits for 30 seconds for the region server to shut down gracefully. 
3. If your application continues to connect with the region server, the server won't shut down immediately. The 30-second timeout expires before shutdown occurs. 
4. After 30 seconds, the Ambari agent sends a force-kill (`kill -9`) command to the region server. You can see this in the ambari-agent log (in the /var/log/ directory of the respective worker node):

   ```apache

           2017-03-21 13:22:40,285 - Deleting File['/var/run/hbase/hbase-hbase-regionserver.pid']
   ```
   Because of the abrupt shutdown, the port associated with the process might not be released, even though the region server process is stopped. This situation can lead to an AddressBindException when the region server is starting, as shown in the following logs. You can verify this in the region-server.log in the /var/log/hbase directory on the worker nodes where the region server fails to start. 

   ```apache

### Resolution steps

1. Try to reduce the load on the HBase region servers before you initiate a restart. 
2. Alternatively (if step 1 doesn't help), try to manually restart region servers on the worker nodes by using the following commands:

   ```apache
   sudo su - hbase -c "/usr/hdp/current/hbase-regionserver/bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop regionserver"
   sudo su - hbase -c "/usr/hdp/current/hbase-regionserver/bin/hbase-daemon.sh start regionserver"   
   ```
