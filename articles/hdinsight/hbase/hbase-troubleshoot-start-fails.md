# Apache HBase Master (HMaster) fails to start in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Scenario: Atomic renaming failure

### Issue

Unexpected files identified during startup process.

### Cause

During the startup process, HMaster performs many initialization steps, including moving data from scratch (.tmp) folder to data folder. HMaster also looks at the write-ahead logs (WAL) folder to see if there are any unresponsive region servers.

HMaster does a basic list command on the WAL folders. If at any time, HMaster sees an unexpected file in any of these folders, it throws an exception and doesn't start.

### Resolution

Check the call stack and try to determine which folder might be causing the problem (for instance, it might be the WAL folder or the .tmp folder). Then, in Cloud Explorer or by using HDFS commands, try to locate the problem file. Usually, this is a `*-renamePending.json` file. (The `*-renamePending.json` file is a journal file that's used to implement the atomic rename operation in the WASB driver. Due to bugs in this implementation, these files can be left over after process crashes, and so on.) Force-delete this file either in Cloud Explorer or by using HDFS commands.

Sometimes, there might also be a temporary file named something like `$$$.$$$` at this location. You have to use HDFS `ls` command to see this file; you cannot see the file in Cloud Explorer. To delete this file, use the HDFS command `hdfs dfs -rm /\<path>\/\$\$\$.\$\$\$`.

After you've run these commands, HMaster should start immediately.

## Scenario: No server address listed

### Issue

You might see a message that indicates that the `hbase: meta` table is not online. Running `hbck` might report that `hbase: meta table replicaId 0 is not found on any region.` In the HMaster logs, you might see the message: `No server address listed in hbase: meta for region hbase: backup <region name>`.  

### Cause

HMaster could not initialize after restarting HBase.

### Resolution

1. In the HBase shell, enter the following commands (change actual values as applicable):

    ```hbase
    scan 'hbase:meta'
    delete 'hbase:meta','hbase:backup <region name>','<column name>'
    ```

1. Delete the `hbase: namespace` entry. This entry might be the same error that's being reported when the `hbase: namespace` table is scanned.

1. Restart the active HMaster from Ambari UI to bring up HBase in running state.

1. In the HBase shell, to bring up all offline tables, run the following command:

    ```hbase
    hbase hbck -ignorePreCheckPermission -fixAssignments
    ```

## Scenario: java.io.IOException: Timedout

### Issue

HMaster times out with fatal exception similar to: `java.io.IOException: Timedout 300000ms waiting for namespace table to be assigned`.

### Cause

You might experience this issue if you have many tables and regions that have not been flushed when you restart your HMaster services. The time-out is a known defect with HMaster. General cluster startup tasks can take a long time. HMaster shuts down if the namespace table isnâ€™t yet assigned. The lengthy startup tasks happen where large amount of unflushed data exists and a timeout of five minutes is not sufficient.

### Resolution

1. From the Apache Ambari UI, go to **HBase** > **Configs**. In the custom `hbase-site.xml` file, add the following setting:

    ```
    Key: hbase.master.namespace.init.timeout Value: 2400000  
    ```

1. Restart the required services (HMaster, and possibly other HBase services).

## Scenario: Frequent region server restarts

### Issue

Nodes reboot periodically. From the region server logs you may see entries similar to:

```
2017-05-09 17:45:07,683 WARN  [JvmPauseMonitor] util.JvmPauseMonitor: Detected pause in JVM or host machine (eg GC): pause of approximately 31000ms
2017-05-09 17:45:07,683 WARN  [JvmPauseMonitor] util.JvmPauseMonitor: Detected pause in JVM or host machine (eg GC): pause of approximately 31000ms
2017-05-09 17:45:07,683 WARN  [JvmPauseMonitor] util.JvmPauseMonitor: Detected pause in JVM or host machine (eg GC): pause of approximately 31000ms
```

### Cause

Long `regionserver` JVM GC pause. The pause will cause `regionserver` to be unresponsive and not able to send heart beat to HMaster within the zk session timeout 40s. HMaster will believe `regionserver` is dead and will abort the `regionserver` and restart.

### Resolution

Change the Zookeeper session timeout, not only `hbase-site` setting `zookeeper.session.timeout` but also Zookeeper `zoo.cfg` setting `maxSessionTimeout` need to be changed.

1. Access Ambari UI, go to **HBase -> Configs -> Settings**, in Timeouts section, change the value of Zookeeper Session Timeout.

1. Access Ambari UI, go to **Zookeeper -> Configs -> Custom** `zoo.cfg`, add/change the following setting. Make sure the value is the same as HBase `zookeeper.session.timeout`.

    ```
    Key: maxSessionTimeout Value: 120000  
    ```

1. Restart required services.

## Scenario: Log splitting failure

### Issue

HMasters failed to come up on a HBase cluster.

### Cause

Misconfigured HDFS and HBase settings for a secondary storage account.

### Resolution

set hbase.rootdir: wasb://@.blob.core.windows.net/hbase and restart services on Ambari.
