# How to monitor cluster availability with Apache Ambari and Azure Monitor logs

HDInsight clusters include both Apache Ambari, which provides health information at a glance and predefined alerts, as well as Azure Monitor logs integration, which provides queryable metrics and logs, as well as configurable alerts.

This doc shows how to use these tools to monitor your cluster and walks through some examples for configuring an Ambari alert, monitoring node availability rate, and creating an Azure Monitor alert that fires when a heartbeat hasn't been received from one or more nodes in five hours.

## Ambari

### Dashboard

The Ambari dashboard can be accessed by selecting the **Ambari home** link in the **Cluster dashboards** section of the HDInsight Overview in Azure portal as shown below. Alternatively, it can be accessed by navigating to `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net` in a browser where CLUSTERNAME is the name of your cluster.

![HDInsight resource portal view](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/azure-portal-dashboard-ambari.png)

You'll then be prompted for a cluster login username and password. Enter the credentials you chose when you created the cluster.

You'll then be taken to the Ambari dashboard, which contains widgets that show a handful of metrics to give you a quick overview of your HDInsight cluster's health. These widgets show metrics such as the number of live DataNodes (worker nodes) and JournalNodes (zookeeper node), NameNodes (head nodes) uptime, as well metrics specific to certain cluster types, like YARN ResourceManager uptime for
Spark and Hadoop clusters.

### Hosts â€“ view individual node status

You can also view status information for individual nodes. Select the **Hosts** tab to view a list of all nodes in your cluster and see basic information about each node. The green check to the left of each node name indicates all components are up on the node. If a component is down on a node, you'll see a red alert triangle instead of the green check.

![HDInsight Apache Ambari hosts view](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/apache-ambari-hosts1.png)

You can then select on the **name** of a node to view more detailed host metrics for that particular node. This view shows the status/availability of each individual component.

### Ambari alerts

Ambari also offers several configurable alerts that can provide notification of certain events. When alerts are triggered, they're shown in the upper-left corner of Ambari in a red badge containing the number of alerts. Selecting this badge shows a list of current alerts.

![Apache Ambari current alerts count](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/apache-ambari-alerts.png)

To view a list of alert definitions and their statuses, select the **Alerts** tab, as shown below.

![Ambari alerts definitions view](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/ambari-alerts-definitions.png)

Ambari offers many predefined alerts related to availability, including:

| Alert Name                        | Description   |
|---|---|
| DataNode Health Summary           | This service-level alert is triggered if there are unhealthy DataNodes|
| NameNode High Availability Health | This service-level alert is triggered if either the Active NameNode or Standby NameNode aren't running.|
| Percent JournalNodes Available    | This alert is triggered if the number of down JournalNodes in the cluster is greater than the configured critical threshold. It aggregates the results of JournalNode process checks. |
| Percent DataNodes Available       | This alert is triggered if the number of down DataNodes in the cluster is greater than the configured critical threshold. It aggregates the results of DataNode process checks.|

A full list of Ambari alerts that help monitor the availability of a cluster can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-high-availability-linux#ambari-web-ui),

To view details for an alert or modify criteria, select the **name** of the alert. Take **DataNode Health Summary** as an example. You can see a description of the alert as well as the specific criteria that will trigger a 'warning' or 'critical' alert and the check interval for the criteria. To edit the configuration, select the **Edit** button in the upper-right corner of the Configuration box.

![Apache Ambari alert configuration](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/ambari-alert-configuration.png)

Here, you can edit the description and, more importantly, the check interval and thresholds for warning or critical alerts.

![Ambari alert configurations edit view](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/ambari-alert-configuration-edit.png)

In this example, you could make 2 unhealthy DataNodes trigger a critical alert and 1 unhealthy DataNode only trigger a warning. Select **Save** when you're done editing.

### Email notifications

You can also optionally configure email notifications for Ambari alerts. To do this, when on the **Alerts** tab, click the **Actions** button in the upper-left, then **Manage Notifications.**

![Ambari manage notifications action](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/ambari-manage-notifications.png)

A dialog for managing alert notifications will open. Select the **+** at the bottom of the dialog and fill out the required fields to provide Ambari with email server details from which to send emails.

> [!TIP]
> Setting up Ambari email notifications can be a good way to receive alerts in one place when managing many HDInsight clusters.

## Azure Monitor logs integration

Azure Monitor logs enable data generated by multiple resources, such as HDInsight clusters, to be collected and aggregated in one place to achieve a unified monitoring experience.

As a prerequisite, you'll need a Log Analytics Workspace to store the collected data. If you haven't already created one, you can follow instructions here: [Create a Log Analytics Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace).

### Enable HDInsight Azure Monitor logs integration

From the HDInsight cluster resource page in the portal, select **Operations Management Suite**. Then, select **enable** and select your Log Analytics workspace from the dropdown.

![HDInsight Operations Management Suite](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/hdi-portal-oms-enable.png)

### Query metrics and logs tables

Once Azure Monitor log integration is enabled (this may take a few minutes), navigate to your **Log Analytics Workspace** resource and select **Logs**.

![Log Analytics workspace logs](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/hdinsight-portal-logs.png)

Logs list a number of sample queries, such as:

| Query Name                      | Description                                                               |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Computers availability today    | Chart the number of computers sending logs, each hour                     |
| List heartbeats                 | List all computer heartbeats from the last hour                           |
| Last heartbeat of each computer | Show the last heartbeat sent by each computer                             |
| Unavailable computers           | List all known computers that didn't send a heartbeat in the last 5 hours |
| Availability rate               | Calculate the availability rate of each connected computer                |

As an example, run the **Availability rate** sample query by selecting **Run** on that query, as shown in the screenshot above. This will show the availability rate of each node in your cluster as a percentage. If you have enabled multiple HDInsight clusters to send metrics to the same Log Analytics workspace, you'll see the availability rate for all nodes in those clusters displayed.

![Log Analytics workspace logs 'availability rate' sample query](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-availability-rate.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> Availability rate is measured over a 24-hour period, so your cluster will need to run for at least 24 hours before you see accurate availability rates.

You can pin this table to a shared dashboard by clicking **Pin** in the upper-right corner. If you don't have any writable shared dashboards, you can see how to create one here: [Create and share dashboards in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards#publish-and-share-a-dashboard).

### Azure Monitor alerts

You can also set up Azure Monitor alerts that will trigger when the value of a metric or the results of a query meet certain conditions. As an example, let's create an alert to send an email when one or more nodes hasn't sent a heartbeat in 5 hours (i.e. is presumed to be unavailable).

From **Logs**, run the **Unavailable computers** sample query by selecting **Run** on that query, as shown below.

![Log Analytics workspace logs 'unavailable computers' sample](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-unavailable-computers.png)

If all nodes are available, this query should return zero results for now. Click **New alert rule** to begin configuring your alert for this query.

![Log Analytics workspace new alert rule](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-logs-new-alert-rule.png)

There are three components to an alert: the *resource* for which to create the rule (the Log Analytics workspace in this case), the *condition* to trigger the alert, and the *action groups* that determine what will happen when the alert is triggered.
Click the **condition title**, as shown below, to finish configuring the signal logic.

![Portal alert create rule condition](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-condition-title.png)

This will open **Configure signal logic**.

Set the **Alert logic** section as follows:

*Based on: Number of results, Condition: Greater than, Threshold: 0.*

Since this query only returns unavailable nodes as results, if the number of results is ever greater than 0, the alert should fire.

In the **Evaluated based on** section, set the **period** and **frequency** based on how often you want to check for unavailable nodes.

For the purpose of this alert, you want to make sure **Period=Frequency.** More information about period, frequency, and other alert parameters can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log#log-search-alert-rule---definition-and-types).

Select **Done** when you're finished configuring the signal logic.

![Alert rule configures signal logic](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-configure-signal-logic.png)

If you don't already have an existing action group, click **Create New** under the **Action Groups** section.

![Alert rule creates new action group](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-create-new-action-group.png)

This will open **Add action group**. Choose an **Action group name**, **Short name**, **Subscription**, and **Resource group.** Under the **Actions** section, choose an **Action Name** and select **Email/SMS/Push/Voice** as the **Action Type.**

> [!NOTE]
> There are several other actions an alert can trigger besides an Email/SMS/Push/Voice, such as an Azure Function, LogicApp, Webhook, ITSM, and Automation Runbook. [Learn More.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/action-groups#action-specific-information)

This will open **Email/SMS/Push/Voice**. Choose a **Name** for the recipient, **check** the **Email** box, and type an email address to which you want the alert sent. Select **OK** in  **Email/SMS/Push/Voice**, then in **Add action group** to finish configuring your action group.

![Alert rule creates add action group](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-add-action-group.png)

After these blades close, you should see your action group listed under the **Action Groups** section. Finally, complete the **Alert Details** section by typing an **Alert Rule Name** and **Description** and choosing a **Severity**. Click **Create Alert Rule** to finish.

![Portal creates alert rule finish](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-create-alert-rule-finish.png)

> [!TIP]
> The ability to specify **Severity** is a powerful tool that can be used when creating multiple alerts. For example, you could create one alert to raise a Warning (Sev 1) if a single head node goes down and another alert that raises Critical (Sev 0) in the unlikely event that both head nodes go down.

When the condition for this alert is met, the alert will fire and you'll receive an email with the alert details like this:

![Azure Monitor alert email example](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-oms-alert-email.png)

You can also view all alerts that have fired, grouped by severity, by going to **Alerts** in your **Log Analytics Workspace**.

![Log Analytics workspace alerts](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/hdi-portal-oms-alerts.png)

Selecting on a severity grouping (i.e. **Sev 1,** as highlighted above) will show records for all alerts of that severity that have fired like below:

![Log Analytics workspace sev one alert](media/hdinsight-cluster-availability/portal-oms-alerts-sev1.png)
