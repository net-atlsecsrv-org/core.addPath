# Apache Hadoop clusters with secure transfer storage accounts in Azure HDInsight

The [Secure transfer required](../storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md) feature enhances the security of your Azure Storage account by enforcing all requests to your account through a secure connection. This feature and the wasbs scheme are only supported by HDInsight cluster version 3.6 or newer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling secure storage transfer after creating a cluster can result in errors using your storage account and is not recommended. It is better to create a new cluster using a storage account with secure transfer already enabled.

## Storage accounts

### Azure portal

By default, the secure transfer required property is enabled when you create a storage account in Azure portal.

To update an existing storage account with Azure portal, see [Require secure transfer with Azure portal](../storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md#require-secure-transfer-for-an-existing-storage-account).

### PowerShell

For the PowerShell cmdlet [New-AzStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstorageaccount), ensure parameter `-EnableHttpsTrafficOnly` is set to `1`.

To update an existing storage account with PowerShell, see [Require secure transfer with PowerShell](../storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md#require-secure-transfer-with-powershell).

### Azure CLI

For the Azure CLI command [az storage account create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-account-create), ensure parameter `--https-only` is set to `true`.

To update an existing storage account with Azure CLI, see [Require secure transfer with Azure CLI](../storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md#require-secure-transfer-with-azure-cli).

## Add additional storage accounts

There are several options to add additional secure transfer enabled storage accounts:

* Modify the Azure Resource Manager template in the last section.
* Create a cluster using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and specify linked storage account.
* Use script action to add additional secure transfer enabled storage accounts to an existing HDInsight cluster. For more information, see [Add additional storage accounts to HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-add-storage.md).

## Next steps

* The use of Azure Storage (WASB) instead of [Apache Hadoop HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html) as the default data store
* For information on how HDInsight uses Azure Storage, see [Use Azure Storage with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-use-blob-storage.md).
* For information on how to upload data to HDInsight, see [Upload data to HDInsight](hdinsight-upload-data.md).
