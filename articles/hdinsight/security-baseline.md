# Azure Security Baseline for HDInsight

The Azure Security Baseline for HDInsight contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

**Guidance**: Perimeter security in Azure HDInsight is achieved through virtual networks. An enterprise administrator can create a cluster inside a virtual network and use a network security group (NSG) to restrict access to the virtual network. Only the allowed IP addresses in the inbound Network Security Group rules will be able to communicate with the Azure HDInsight cluster. This configuration provides perimeter security. All clusters deployed in a virtual network will also have a private endpoint that resolves to a private IP address inside the Virtual Network for private HTTP access to the cluster gateways.

To reduce the risk of data loss via exfiltration, restrict outbound network traffic for Azure HDInsight clusters using Azure Firewall.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the virtual network, subnet, and network security group being used to secure your Azure HDInsight cluster. Enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into a Azure Storage Account to traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Azure Log Analytics Workspace and use Azure Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network mis-configurations.

### 1.6: Deploy network based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Requirement can be met Azure security control ID 1.1; Deploy Azure HDInsight cluster into a virtual network and secure with a network security group (NSG).

There are several dependencies for Azure HDInsight that require inbound traffic. The inbound management traffic can't be sent through a firewall device. The source addresses for required management traffic are known and published. Create Network Security Group rules with this information to allow traffic from only trusted locations, securing inbound traffic to the clusters.

To reduce the risk of data loss via exfiltration, restrict outbound network traffic for Azure HDInsight clusters using Azure Firewall.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual network service tags  to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) that are attached to the subnet your Azure HDInsight cluster is deployed in. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
