The instructions provided in this article use Azure portal. You can also export the Azure Resource Manager template from the portal or obtain a copy of the Resource Manager template from vendors, and use Azure PowerShell and Azure Classic CLI to deploy the template.  See [Create Apache Hadoop clusters on HDInsight using Resource Manager templates](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-arm-templates.md).

## Prerequisites
If you want to install HDInsight applications on an existing HDInsight cluster, you must have an HDInsight cluster. To create one, see [Create clusters](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md#create-cluster). You can also install HDInsight applications when you create an HDInsight cluster.

## Install applications to existing clusters
The following procedure shows you how to install HDInsight applications to an existing HDInsight cluster.

**Install an HDInsight application**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. From the left menu, navigate to **All services** > **Analytics** > **HDInsight clusters**.
3. Select an HDInsight cluster from the list.  If you don't have one, you must create one first.  see [Create clusters](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md#create-cluster).
4. Under the **Settings** category, select **Applications**. You can see a list of installed applications in the main window. 
   
    ![HDInsight applications portal menu](./media/hdinsight-apps-install-applications/hdinsight-apps-portal-menu.png)
5. Select **+Add** from the menu. You can see a list of available applications.  If **+Add** is greyed out, that means there are no applications for this version of the HDInsight cluster.
   
    ![HDInsight applications available applications](./media/hdinsight-apps-install-applications/hdinsight-apps-list.png)
6. Select one of the available applications, and then follow the instructions to accept the legal terms.

You can see the installation status from the portal notifications (select the bell icon on the top of the portal). After the application is installed, the application  appears on the Installed Apps list.

## Install applications during cluster creation
You have the option to install HDInsight applications when you create a cluster. During the process, HDInsight applications are installed after the cluster is created and is in the running state. To install applications during cluster creation using the Azure portal, you use the **Custom** option instead of the default **Quick create** option.

## List installed HDInsight apps and properties
The portal shows a list of the installed HDInsight applications for a cluster, and the properties of each installed application.

**List HDInsight application and display properties**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. From the left menu, navigate to **All services** > **Analytics** > **HDInsight clusters**.
3. Select an HDInsight cluster from the list.
4. Under the **Settings** category, select **Applications**. You can see a list of installed applications in the main window. 
   
    ![HDInsight applications installed apps](./media/hdinsight-apps-install-applications/hdinsight-apps-installed-apps-with-apps.png)
5. Select one of the installed applications to show the property. The property lists:

    |Property | Description |
    |---|---|
    |App name |Application name. |
    |Status |Application status. |
    |Webpage |The URL of the web application that you have deployed to the edge node. The credential is the same as the HTTP user credentials that you have configured for the cluster. |
    |SSH endpoint |You can use SSH to connect to the edge node. The SSH credentials are the same as the SSH user credentials that you have configured for the cluster. For information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md). |
    |Description | Application description. |

6. To delete an application, right-click the application, and then click **Delete** from the context menu.

## Connect to the edge node
You can connect to the edge node using HTTP and SSH. The endpoint information can be found from the [portal](#list-installed-hdinsight-apps-and-properties). For information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

The HTTP endpoint credentials are the HTTP user credentials that you have configured for the HDInsight cluster; the SSH endpoint credentials are the SSH credentials that you have configured for the HDInsight cluster.
