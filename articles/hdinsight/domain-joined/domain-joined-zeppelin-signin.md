# Scenario: Unable to sign in to Apache Zeppelin in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

Unable to sign in to Apache Zeppelin after changing the ADDS password in active directory.

## Cause

User mentioned in the `activeDirectoryRealm.systemUsername` of the `shiro_ini` file changed the active directory password.

## Resolution

1. Verify that the changed password is the root cause by including `activeDirectoryRealm.systemPassword = <new password>` in the Zeppelin `shiro_ini` config in Ambari. Remove the `activeDirectoryRealm.hadoopSecurityCredentialPath` setting. Below is location of `shiro ini`.

1. If users can now sign in to Zeppelin after step 1, create a new `jceks` file with the new password and replace the `activeDirectoryRealm.hadoopSecurityCredentialPath` with the new file.
