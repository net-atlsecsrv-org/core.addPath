# Apache components and versions available for Azure HDInsight

In this article, you learn about the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) environment components and versions in Azure HDInsight and the Enterprise Security Package. You also learn how to check the Hadoop component versions in HDInsight.

## Apache components available with different HDInsight versions

Azure HDInsight supports multiple Hadoop cluster versions that can be deployed at any time. On April 4, 2017, the default cluster version used by Azure HDInsight was 3.6.

The component versions associated with HDInsight cluster versions are listed in the following table.

> [!NOTE]
> The default version for the HDInsight service might change without notice. If you have a version dependency, specify the HDInsight version when you create your clusters with the .NET SDK with Azure PowerShell and the Azure classic CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> HDInsight 4.0: Spark 2.4 and Kafka 2.1 are fully supported. However, Spark 2.3 and Kafka 1.1 cluster types are not serviced. 
> HDInsight 3.6: Spark 2.3 and Kafka 1.1 are fully supported.  

## Check for current Apache component version information

The Hadoop environment component versions associated with HDInsight cluster versions can change with updates to HDInsight. To check the Hadoop components and to verify which versions are being used for a cluster, use the Ambari REST API. The **GetComponentInformation** command retrieves information about service components. For more information, see the [Apache Ambari documentation](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md).

### Release notes

For additional release notes on the latest versions of HDInsight, see [HDInsight release notes](hdinsight-release-notes.md).

## Supported HDInsight versions

### Support expiration and retirement for HDInsight versions

**Support expiration** means that Microsoft no longer provides support for the specific HDInsight version. And it's no longer available through the Azure portal for cluster creation. These versions can still be created by using the Azure CLI or the various SDKs.

**Retirement** means that existing clusters of an HDInsight version continue to run as is. New clusters of this version can't be created through any means, which includes the CLI and SDKs. Other control plane features, such as manual scaling and autoscaling, also might not work after version retirement. Support isn't available for retired versions.

The following tables list the versions of HDInsight. The support expiration and retirement dates are also provided when they're known.

### Available versions

This table lists the versions of HDInsight that are available in the Azure portal and via other deployment methods like PowerShell and the .NET SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> After support for a cluster version expires, it might not be available through the Azure portal. In some cases, cluster versions continue to be available by using the **Version** parameter in the Windows PowerShell [New-AzHDInsightCluster](/powershell/module/az.hdinsight/new-azhdinsightcluster) command and the .NET SDK until the version retirement date.

## Service-level agreement for HDInsight cluster versions

The service-level agreement is defined as a _support window_. A support window is the time period that an HDInsight version is supported by Microsoft Customer Service and Support. If the version has passed the _support expiration date_, the HDInsight cluster is outside the support window. Support expiration for HDInsight version X (after a newer X+1 version is available) is the later of:

- **Formula 1:** Add 180 days to the date when the HDInsight cluster version X was released.
- **Formula 2:** Add 90 days to the date when the HDInsight cluster version X+1 is made available in the Azure portal.

The _retirement date_ is the date after which the cluster version can't be created on HDInsight. As of July 31, 2017, you can't resize an HDInsight cluster after its retirement date.

## Default node configuration and virtual machine sizes for clusters

For more information on which virtual machine SKUs to select for your cluster, see [Azure HDInsight cluster configuration details](hdinsight-supported-node-configuration.md).
