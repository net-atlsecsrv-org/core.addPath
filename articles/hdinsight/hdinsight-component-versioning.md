# What are the Apache Hadoop components and versions available with HDInsight?

Learn about the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) ecosystem components and versions in Microsoft Azure HDInsight, as well as the Enterprise Security Package. Also, learn how to check Hadoop component versions in HDInsight.

Each HDInsight version is a cloud distribution of a version of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP).

## Apache Hadoop components available with different HDInsight versions

Azure HDInsight supports multiple Hadoop cluster versions that can be deployed at any time. Each version choice creates a specific version of the HDP distribution and a set of components that are contained within that distribution. As of April 4, 2017, the default cluster version used by Azure HDInsight is 3.6 and is based on HDP 2.6.

The component versions associated with HDInsight cluster versions are listed in the following table: 

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version for the HDInsight service might change without notice. If you have a version dependency, specify the HDInsight version when you create your clusters with the .NET SDK with Azure PowerShell and Azure Classic CLI.

## Enterprise Security Package for HDInsight

Enterprise Security is an optional package that you can add on your HDInsight cluster as part of create cluster workflow. The Enterprise Security Package supports:

- Integration with Active Directory for authentication.

    In the past, you can only create HDInsight clusters with a local admin user and a local SSH user. The local admin user can access all the files, folders, tables, and columns.  With the Enterprise Security Package, you can enable role-based access control by integrating HDInsight clusters with your own Active Directory, which include on-premises Active Directory, Azure Active Directory Domain Services, or Active Directory on IaaS virtual machine. Domain administrator on the cluster can grant users to use their own corporate (domain) user-name and password to access the cluster. 

    For more information, see:

    - [An introduction to Apache Hadoop security with domain-joined HDInsight clusters](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-introduction.md)
    - [Plan Azure domain-joined Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-architecture.md)

    - [Configure Domain-joined HDInsight clusters using Azure Active Directory Domain Services](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-configure-using-azure-adds.md)

- Authorization for data

  - Integration with Apache Ranger for authorization for Hive, Spark SQL, and Yarn Queues.
  - You can set access control on files and folders.

    For more information, see:

  - [Configure Apache Hive policies in Domain-joined HDInsight](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-run-hive.md)

### Supported cluster types

Currently, only the following cluster types support the Enterprise Security Package:

- Hadoop (HDInsight 3.6 only)
- Spark
- Interactive Query

### Support for Azure Data Lake Storage

The Enterprise Security Package supports using Azure Data Lake Storage as both the primary storage and the add-on storage.

### Pricing and SLA

## HDInsight Windows retirement

Microsoft Azure HDInsight version 3.3 was the last version of HDInsight on Windows. The retirement date for HDInsight on Windows is July 31, 2018. If you have any HDInsight clusters on Windows 3.3 or earlier, you must migrate to HDInsight on Linux (HDInsight version 3.5 or later) before July 31, 2018. Migrating to the Linux OS enables you to retain the ability to create or resize your HDInsight clusters. Support for HDInsight version 3.3 on Windows expired on June 27, 2016.

Starting with HDInsight version 3.4, Microsoft has released HDInsight only on the Linux OS. As a result, some of the components within HDInsight are available for Linux only. These include [Apache Ranger](https://ranger.apache.org/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), Interactive Query, [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), HDInsight applications, and Azure Data Lake Storage as the primary file system. Future releases of HDInsight are available only on the Linux OS. There will be no future releases of HDInsight on Windows. 

## FAQs

### What is the timeline for retiring HDInsight on Windows?

July 31, 2018, is the retirement date for HDInsight on Windows. If the planned retirement date is different for your region, you are notified separately. 

### What is the impact of retiring HDInsight on Windows for existing customers?

After HDInsight on Windows is retired, you can't create a new HDInsight Windows cluster, or resize an existing HDInsight Windows cluster. Support for HDInsight version 3.3 expired on June 27, 2016. Therefore, there is no support or bug fixes for HDInsight 3.3 or earlier versions. Future releases of HDInsight are available only on the Linux OS. There will be no future releases of HDInsight on Windows.
 
### Which versions of HDInsight on Windows are affected?

Azure HDInsight version 3.3 is the last version of HDInsight for Windows. Before HDInsight on Windows is retired, all HDInsight Windows clusters version 3.3 or earlier must be migrated to HDInsight on Linux version 3.5 or later. Migrating your clusters to HDInsight on Linux enables you to retain the ability to create new clusters or resize existing clusters. 

### What do I need to do?

Migrate your HDInsight Windows clusters to a supported HDInsight Linux cluster before July 31, 2018. Learn more in the [HDInsight migration document](hdinsight-migrate-from-windows-to-linux.md). For details about Azure HDInsight versions, see the list of [supported versions](hdinsight-component-versioning.md#supported-hdinsight-versions). 

### Where do I find the cluster OS type?

In the Azure portal, go to the HDInsight Cluster overview page and locate **Cluster type** under **Essentials**. The cluster OS types are listed on that page. 

### I can’t migrate to an HDInsight Linux cluster by July 31, 2018. What is the impact to my HDInsight Windows cluster?

The HDInsight Windows cluster runs as-is, but you cannot create a new HDInsight Windows cluster, or resize an existing HDInsight Windows cluster. 

### My cluster has a .NET dependency. How do I resolve this dependency on Linux?

You can resolve your Linux cluster dependency by using the [Mono project](https://www.mono-project.com/). This open-source implementation of .NET is available for HDInsight Linux clusters. Learn more in the [HDInsight migration document](hdinsight-migrate-from-windows-to-linux.md). 

### I'm a new customer for HDInsight on Windows. How can I create an HDInsight Windows cluster?

As of July 3, 2017, only existing HDInsight Windows customers can create new HDInsight Windows clusters. New customers cannot create an HDInsight Windows cluster in the Azure portal by using PowerShell or the SDK. We recommend that new customers create a Linux HDInsight cluster. Existing customers can create new HDInsight Windows clusters until the HDInsight on Windows retirement date. 

### Is there a pricing impact associated with moving from HDInsight on Windows to HDInsight on Linux?

No, the pricing is the same for HDInsight on either OS. 

### What are the customer advantages associated with the move to only using HDInsight on Linux?

* Faster time-to-market for open-source big data technologies through the HDInsight service
* A large community and ecosystem for support
* Ability to exercise active development by the open-source community for Hadoop and other big data technologies

### Does HDInsight on Linux provide additional functionality beyond what is available in HDInsight on Windows?

Starting with HDInsight version 3.4, Microsoft has released HDInsight only on the Linux OS. As a result, some of the components within HDInsight are available for Linux only. These include Apache Ranger, Kafka, Interactive Query, Spark, HDInsight applications, and Azure Data Lake Storage as the primary file system. 

## Service level agreement for HDInsight cluster versions

The service level agreement (SLA) is defined in terms of a _support window_. The support window is the period of time that an HDInsight cluster version is supported by Microsoft Customer Service and Support. If the version has a _support expiration date_ that has passed, the HDInsight cluster is outside the support window. For more information about supported versions, see the list of [supported HDInsight cluster versions](hdinsight-migrate-from-windows-to-linux.md). The support expiration date for a specified HDInsight version X (after a newer X+1 version is available) is calculated as the later of:  

* Formula 1: Add 180 days to the date when the HDInsight cluster version X was released.
* Formula 2: Add 90 days to the date when the HDInsight cluster version X+1 is made available in Azure portal.

The _retirement date_ is the date after which the cluster version cannot be created on HDInsight. Starting July 31, 2017, you cannot resize an HDInsight cluster after its retirement date. 

> [!NOTE]  
> HDInsight Windows clusters (including versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) run on Azure Guest OS Family version 4, which uses the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2012 R2. Azure Guest OS Family version 4 supports the .NET Framework versions 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2.
