# What are the Apache Hadoop components and versions available with HDInsight?

Learn about the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) ecosystem components and versions in Microsoft Azure HDInsight, as well as the Enterprise Security Package. Also, learn how to check Hadoop component versions in HDInsight.

## Apache Hadoop components available with different HDInsight versions

Azure HDInsight supports multiple Hadoop cluster versions that can be deployed at any time. As of April 4, 2017, the default cluster version used by Azure HDInsight is 3.6.

The component versions associated with HDInsight cluster versions are listed in the following table:

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version for the HDInsight service might change without notice. If you have a version dependency, specify the HDInsight version when you create your clusters with the .NET SDK with Azure PowerShell and Azure Classic CLI.

## Check for current Hadoop component version information

The Hadoop ecosystem component versions associated with HDInsight cluster versions can change with updates to HDInsight. To check the Hadoop components and to verify which versions are being used for a cluster, use the Ambari REST API. The **GetComponentInformation** command retrieves information about service components. For details, see the [Apache Ambari documentation](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md).

### Release notes

See [HDInsight release notes](hdinsight-release-notes.md) for additional release notes on the latest versions of HDInsight.

## Supported HDInsight versions

The following tables list the versions of HDInsight. The support expiration and retirement dates are also provided, when they're known.

### Available versions

The following table lists the versions of HDInsight that are available in the Azure portal as well as other deployment methods like PowerShell and .NET SDK.

## Enterprise Security Package for HDInsight

Enterprise Security is an optional package that you can add on your HDInsight cluster as part of create cluster workflow. The Enterprise Security Package supports:

- Integration with Active Directory for authentication.

    In the past, you can only create HDInsight clusters with a local admin user and a local SSH user. The local admin user can access all the files, folders, tables, and columns.  With the Enterprise Security Package, you can enable role-based access control by integrating HDInsight clusters with your own Active Directory, which include on-premises Active Directory, Azure Active Directory Domain Services, or Active Directory on IaaS virtual machine. Domain administrator on the cluster can grant users to use their own corporate (domain) user-name and password to access the cluster.

    For more information, see:

    - [An introduction to Apache Hadoop security with domain-joined HDInsight clusters](./domain-joined/hdinsight-security-overview.md)
    - [Plan Azure domain-joined Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-architecture.md)
    - [Configure domain-joined sandbox environment](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-configure.md)
    - [Configure Domain-joined HDInsight clusters using Azure Active Directory Domain Services](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-configure-using-azure-adds.md)

- Authorization for data

  - Integration with Apache Ranger for authorization for Hive, Spark SQL, and Yarn Queues.
  - You can set access control on files and folders.

    For more information, see:

  - [Configure Apache Hive policies in Domain-joined HDInsight](./domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-run-hive.md)

- View the audit logs to monitor accesses and the configured policies.

### Supported cluster types

Currently, only the following cluster types support the Enterprise Security Package:

- Hadoop (HDInsight 3.6 only)
- Spark
- Interactive Query

### Support for Azure Data Lake Storage

The Enterprise Security Package supports using Azure Data Lake Storage as both the primary storage and the add-on storage.

### Pricing and service level agreement

For information on pricing and SLA for the Enterprise Security Package, see [HDInsight pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/hdinsight/).

## Service level agreement for HDInsight cluster versions

The service level agreement (SLA) is defined in terms of a _support window_. The support window is the period of time that an HDInsight cluster version is supported by Microsoft Customer Service and Support. If the version has a _support expiration date_ that has passed, the HDInsight cluster is outside the support window. The support expiration date for a specified HDInsight version X (after a newer X+1 version is available) is calculated as the later of:  

- Formula 1: Add 180 days to the date when the HDInsight cluster version X was released.
- Formula 2: Add 90 days to the date when the HDInsight cluster version X+1 is made available in Azure portal.

The _retirement date_ is the date after which the cluster version cannot be created on HDInsight. Starting July 31, 2017, you cannot resize an HDInsight cluster after its retirement date.

> [!NOTE]  
> HDInsight Windows clusters (including versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) run on Azure Guest OS Family version 4, which uses the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2012 R2. Azure Guest OS Family version 4 supports the .NET Framework versions 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2.
