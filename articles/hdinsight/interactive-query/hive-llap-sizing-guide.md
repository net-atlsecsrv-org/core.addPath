# Azure HDInsight Interactive Query Cluster (Hive LLAP) sizing guide

This document describes the sizing of the HDInsight Interactive Query Cluster (Hive LLAP cluster) for a typical workload to achieve reasonable performance. Note that the recommendations provided in this document are generic guidelines and specific workloads may need 
specific tuning.

### **Azure Default VM Types for HDInsight Interactive Query Cluster(LLAP)**

| Node Type      | Instance | Size     |
| :---        |    :----:   | :---     |

### **LLAP Daemon size estimations:**  

#### **1. Determining total YARN memory allocation for all containers on a node**    
Configuration: ***yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb***  

This value indicates a maximum sum of memory in MB that can be used by the YARN containers on each node. The value specified should be lesser than the total amount of physical memory on that node.   
Total memory for all YARN containers on a node = [Total physical memory] – [ memory for OS + Other services ]  
Set this value to ~90% of the available RAM size.  
For D14 v2, the recommended value is **102400 MB**. 

#### **2. Determining maximum amount of memory per YARN container request**  
Configuration: ***yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb***

This value indicates the maximum allocation for every container request at the Resource Manager, in MB. Memory requests higher than the specified value won't take effect. The Resource Manager can give memory to containers in increments of *yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb* and can't exceed the size specified by *yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb*. The value specified shouldn't be more than the total given memory for all containers on the node specified by *yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb*.    
For D14 v2 worker nodes, the recommended value is **102400 MB**

#### **3. Determining maximum amount of vcores per YARN container request**  
Configuration: ***yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores***  

This value indicates the maximum number of virtual CPU cores for every container request at the Resource Manager. Requesting a higher number of vcores than this value won't take effect. It's a global property of the YARN scheduler. For LLAP daemon container, this value can be set to 75% of total available vcores. The remaining 25% should be reserved for NodeManager, DataNode, and other services running on the worker nodes.  
There are 16 vcores on D14 v2 VMs and 75% of total 16 vcores can be used by LLAP daemon container.  
For D14 v2, the recommended value is **12**.  

#### **4. Number of concurrent queries**  
Configuration: ***hive.server2.tez.sessions.per.default.queue***

This configuration value determines the number of Tez sessions that can be launched in parallel. These Tez sessions will be launched for each of the queues specified by "hive.server2.tez.default.queues". It corresponds to the number of Tez AMs (Query Coordinators). It's recommended to be the same as the number of worker nodes. The number of Tez AMs can be higher than the number of LLAP daemon nodes. The Tez AM's primary responsibility is to coordinate the query execution and assign query plan fragments to corresponding LLAP daemons for execution. Keep this value as multiple of a number of LLAP daemon nodes to achieve higher throughput.  

Default HDInsight cluster has four LLAP daemons running on four worker nodes, so the recommended value is **4**.  

#### **5. Tez Container and Tez Application Master size**    
Configuration: ***tez.am.resource.memory.mb, hive.tez.container.size***  

*tez.am.resource.memory.mb* - defines the Tez Application Master size.  
The recommended value is **4096 MB**.
   
*hive.tez.container.size* - defines the amount of memory given for Tez container. This value must be set between  the YARN minimum container size(*yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb*) and the YARN maximum container size(*yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb*). The LLAP daemon executors use this value for limiting memory usage per executor.  
The recommended value is **4096 MB**.  

#### **6. LLAP Queue capacity allocation**   
Configuration: ***yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.llap.capacity***  

This value indicates a percentage of capacity given to llap queue. The capacity allocations may have different values for different workloads depending on how the YARN queues are configured. If your workload is read-only operations, then setting it as high as 90% of the capacity should work. However, if your workload is mix of update/delete/merge operations using managed tables, it's recommended to give 80% of the capacity for llap queue. The remaining 20% capacity can be used by other tasks such as compaction etc. to allocate containers from default queue. That way tasks in default queue won't deprive of YARN resources.    
For D14v2 worker nodes, the recommended value for llap queue is **80**.   
(For readonly workloads, it can be increased up to 90 as suitable.)  

#### **7. LLAP daemon container size**    
Configuration: ***hive.llap.daemon.yarn.container.mb***  
   
LLAP daemon is run as a YARN container on each worker node. The total memory size for LLAP daemon container depends on following factors,    
*  Configurations of YARN container size (yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb, yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb, yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb)
*  Number of Tez AMs on a node
*  Total memory configured for all containers on a node and LLAP queue capacity  

Memory needed by Tez Application Masters(Tez AM) can be calculated as follows.  
For HDInsight Interactive cluster, by default, there is one Tez AM per worker node that acts as a query coordinator. The number of Tez AMs can be configured based on a number of concurrent queries to be served.
It's recommended to have 4 GB of memory per Tez AM.

Tez AM memory per node = [ ceil(number of Tez AMs / Number of LLAP daemon nodes) ]  x [ Tez AM container size ]  
For D14 v2, the default configuration has four Tez AMs and four LLAP daemon nodes.  
Tez AM memory per node = (ceil(4/4) x 4 GB) = 4 GB

Total Memory available for LLAP queue per worker node can be calculated as follows:
This value depends on the total amount of memory available for all YARN containers on a node(*yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb*) and the percentage of capacity configured for llap queue(*yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.llap.capacity*).  
Total memory for LLAP queue on worker node =  Total memory available for all YARN containers on a node x  Percentage of capacity for llap queue.  
For D14 v2, this value is [ 100 GB x 0.80 ] = 80 GB.

The LLAP daemon container size is calculated as follows;

**LLAP daemon container size =  [ Total memory available for LLAP queue ] – [ Tez AM memory per node ]**  
    
For D14 v2 worker node, HDI 4.0 -  the recommended value is (80 GB - 4 GB)) = **76 GB**   
(For HDI 3.6, recommended value is **74 GB** because you should reserve additional ~2 GB for slider AM.)  

#### **8. Determining number of executors per LLAP daemon**  
Configuration: ***hive.llap.daemon.num.executors***, ***hive.llap.io.threadpool.size***

***hive.llap.daemon.num.executors***:   
This configuration controls the number of executors that can execute tasks in parallel per LLAP daemon. This value depends on the number of vcores, the amount of memory given per executor and the amount of total memory available for LLAP daemon. Usually, we would like this value to be as close as possible to the number of vcores.
There are 16 vcores on D14 v2 VMs. However, not all of the vcores can be taken because other services like NodeManager, DataNode, Metrics Monitor etc. also need portion of available vcores. 

If you need to adjust the number of executors, it's recommended that you consider 4 GB of memory per executor as specified by *hive.tez.container.size* and make sure total memory needed for all executors do not exceed the total memory available for LLAP daemon container.  
This value can be configured up to 75% of the total vcores available on that node.  
For D14 v2, the recommended value is (.75 X 16) = **12**

***hive.llap.io.threadpool.size***:   
This value specifies the thread pool size for executors. Since executors are fixed as specified, it will be same as number of executors per LLAP daemon.   
For D14 v2, the recommended value is **12**.

#### **9. Determining LLAP daemon cache size**  
Configuration: ***hive.llap.io.memory.size***

LLAP daemon container memory consists of following components;
*  Head room
*  Heap memory used by executors (Xmx)
*  In-memory cache per daemon (its off-heap memory size, not applicable when SSD cache is enabled)
*  In-memory cache metadata size (applicable only when SSD cache is enabled)

**Headroom size**:
This size indicates a portion of off-heap memory used for Java VM overhead (metaspace, threads stack, gc data structures, etc.). Generally, this overhead is about 6% of the heap size (Xmx). To be on the safer side, this value can be calculated as 6% of total LLAP daemon memory size.  
For D14 v2, the recommended value is ceil(76 GB x 0.06) ~= **5 GB**.  

**Heap size(Xmx)**:
It is amount of heap memory available for all executors.
Total Heap size = Number of executors x 4 GB  
For D14 v2, this value is 12 x 4 GB = **48 GB**  

If SSD cache is disabled, the in-memory cache is amount of memory that is left after taking out Headroom size and Heap size from the LLAP daemon container size.

Cache size calculation differs when SSD cache is enabled.
Setting *hive.llap.io.allocator.mmap* = true will enable SSD caching.
When SSD cache is enabled, some portion of the memory will be used to store metadata for the SSD cache. The metadata is stored in memory and it's expected to be ~10% of SSD cache size.   
SSD Cache in-memory metadata size = [ LLAP daemon container size ] - [ Head room + Heap size ]  
For D14 v2, with HDI 4.0, SSD cache in-memory metadata size = [ 76 GB ] - [ 5 GB + 48 GB ] = **23 GB**  
For D14 v2, with HDI 3.6, SSD cache in-memory metadata size = [ 76 GB ] - [ 5 GB + 48 GB + 2 GB slider ] = **21 GB**

Given the size of available memory for storing SSD cache metadata, we can calculate the size of SSD cache that can be supported.  
Size of in-memory metadata for SSD cache =  10% of size of SSD Cache       
Size of SSD cache = size of in-memory metadata for SSD cache x 10  

For D14 v2 and HDI 4.0, the recommended SSD cache size = 23 GB x 10 = **230 GB**  
For D14 v2 and HDI 3.6, the recommended SSD cache size = 21 GB x 10 = **210 GB**

#### **10. Adjusting Map Join memory**   
Configuration: ***hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size***

Make sure you have *hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask* enabled for this parameter to take effect.
This configuration allows the user to specify the size of the tables that can fit in memory to do Map join. If the sum of the size of n-1 tables or partitions for n-way join is less than the configured value, the Map join will be chosen. The LLAP executor memory size should be used to calculate the threshold for autoconvert to Map Join.
Each executor is assumed to have 4 GB of heap size, but not all of it will be available for Map join. Some heap memory will be used for sort buffers, shuffle buffers, hash tables, etc. by other operations as well. So, you can give 50% of 4 GB heap memory for Map join.  
Note: This value may need adjustments that are suitable for your workload. Setting this value too low may not use autoconvert feature. And setting it too high may result into out of memory exceptions or GC pauses that can result into adverse performance.  
For D14 v2, with 4 GB memory per executor, it's recommended to set this value to **2048 MB**.
