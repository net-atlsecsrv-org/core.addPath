# Integrate Apache Spark and Apache Hive with the Hive Warehouse Connector

The Apache Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC) is a library that allows you to work more easily with Apache Spark and Apache Hive. Easier by supporting tasks such as moving data between Spark DataFrames and Hive tables. And directing Spark streaming data into Hive tables. Hive Warehouse Connector works like a bridge between Spark and Hive. It supports Scala, Java, and Python for development.

The Hive Warehouse Connector allows you to take advantage of Hive and Spark unique features. Features used to build powerful big-data applications. Apache Hive offers support for database transactions that are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable (ACID). For more information on ACID and transactions in Hive, see [Hive Transactions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions). Hive also offers detailed security controls through Apache Ranger and Low Latency Analytical Processing not available in Apache Spark.

Apache Spark, has a Structured Streaming API that gives streaming capabilities not available in Apache Hive. Beginning with HDInsight 4.0, Apache Spark 2.3.1 and Apache Hive 3.1.0 have separate metastores. These separate metastores can make interoperability difficult. The Hive Warehouse Connector makes it easier to use Spark and Hive together. The HWC library loads data from LLAP (Low Latency Analytical Processing) daemons to Spark executors in parallel. This action makes it more efficient and adaptable than using a standard JDBC connection from Spark to Hive.

Some of the operations supported by the Hive Warehouse Connector are:

* Describing a table
* Creating a table for ORC-formatted data
* Selecting Hive data and retrieving a DataFrame
* Writing a DataFrame to Hive in batch
* Executing a Hive update statement
* Reading table data from Hive, transforming it in Spark, and writing it to a new Hive table
* Writing a DataFrame or Spark stream to Hive using HiveStreaming

## Hive Warehouse Connector setup

Follow these steps to set up the Hive Warehouse Connector between a Spark and Interactive Query cluster in Azure HDInsight:

### Create clusters

1. Create an HDInsight Spark **4.0** cluster with a storage account and a custom Azure virtual network. For information on creating a cluster in an Azure virtual network, see [Add HDInsight to an existing virtual network](../../hdinsight/hdinsight-plan-virtual-network-deployment.md#existingvnet).

1. Create an HDInsight Interactive Query (LLAP) **4.0** cluster with the same storage account and Azure virtual network as the Spark cluster.

### Modify hosts file

Copy the node information from the `/etc/hosts` file on headnode0 of your Interactive Query cluster and concatenate the information to the `/etc/hosts` file on the headnode0 of your Spark cluster. This step will allow your Spark cluster to resolve IP addresses of the nodes in Interactive Query cluster. View the contents of the updated file with `cat /etc/hosts`. The final output should look something like what is shown in the screenshot below.

![hive warehouse connector hosts file](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-hosts-file.png)

### Gather preliminary information

#### From your Interactive Query cluster

1. Navigate to the cluster's Apache Ambari Hive page using `https://LLAPCLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/#/main/services/HIVE/configs` where `LLAPCLUSTERNAME` is the name of your Interactive Query cluster.

1. Navigate to **Advanced** > **General** > **hive.metastore.uris** and note the value. The value may be similar to: `thrift://iqgiro.rekufuk2y2cezcbowjkbwfnyvd.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:9083,thrift://hn1-iqgiro.rekufuk2y2cezcbowjkbwfnyvd.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:9083`.

1. Navigate to **Advanced** > **Advanced hive-site** > **hive.zookeeper.quorum** and note the value. The value may be similar to: `zk0-iqgiro.rekufuk2y2cezcbowjkbwfnyvd.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:2181,zk1-iqgiro.rekufuk2y2cezcbowjkbwfnyvd.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:2181,zk4-iqgiro.rekufuk2y2cezcbowjkbwfnyvd.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:2181`.

#### From your Apache Spark cluster

1. Navigate to the cluster's Apache Ambari Hive page using `https://SPARKCLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/#/main/services/HIVE/configs` where `SPARKCLUSTERNAME` is the name of your Apache Spark cluster.

1. Navigate to **Advanced** > **Advanced hive-interactive-site** > **hive.llap.daemon.service.hosts** and note the value. The value may be similar to: `@llap0`.

### Configure Spark cluster settings

From your Spark Ambari web UI, navigate to **Spark2** > **CONFIGS** > **Custom spark2-defaults**.

![Apache Ambari Spark2 configuration](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-spark2-ambari.png)

Select **Add Property...** as needed to add/update the following value:

| Key | Value |
|----|----|
|`spark.hadoop.hive.llap.daemon.service.hosts`|The value you obtained earlier from **hive.llap.daemon.service.hosts**.|
|`spark.sql.hive.hiveserver2.jdbc.url`|`jdbc:hive2://LLAPCLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net:443/;user=admin;password=PWD;ssl=true;transportMode=http;httpPath=/hive2`. Set to the JDBC connection string, which connects to Hiveserver2 on the Interactive Query cluster. REPLACE `LLAPCLUSTERNAME` with the name of your Interactive Query cluster. Replace `PWD` with the actual password.|
|`spark.datasource.hive.warehouse.load.staging.dir`|`wasbs://STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME@STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME.blob.core.windows.net/tmp`. Set to a suitable HDFS-compatible staging directory. If you have two different clusters, the staging directory should be a folder in the staging directory of the LLAP clusterâ€™s storage account so that HiveServer2 has access to it.  Replace `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` with the name of the storage account being used by the cluster, and `STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME` with the name of the storage container.|
|`spark.datasource.hive.warehouse.metastoreUri`|The value you obtained earlier from **hive.metastore.uris**.|
|`spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled`|`false` for YARN client deploy mode.|
|`spark.hadoop.hive.zookeeper.quorum`|The value you obtained earlier from **hive.zookeeper.quorum**.|

Save changes and restart components as needed.

## Using the Hive Warehouse Connector

### Connecting and running queries

You can choose between a few different methods to connect to your Interactive Query cluster and execute queries using the Hive Warehouse Connector. Supported methods include the following tools:

* [spark-shell](../spark/apache-spark-shell.md)
* PySpark
* spark-submit
* [Zeppelin](../spark/apache-spark-zeppelin-notebook.md)
* [Livy](../spark/apache-spark-livy-rest-interface.md)

All examples provided in this article will be executed through spark-shell.

To start a spark-shell session, do the following steps:

1. SSH into the headnode for your Apache Spark cluster. For more information about connecting to your cluster with SSH, see [Connect to HDInsight (Apache Hadoop) using SSH](../../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

1. Enter the following command to start the spark shell:

    ```bash
    spark-shell --master yarn \
    --jars /usr/hdp/current/hive_warehouse_connector/hive-warehouse-connector-assembly-<STACK_VERSION>.jar \
    --conf spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled=false
    ```

    You'll see a welcome message and a `scala>` prompt where you can enter commands.

1. After starting the spark-shell, a Hive Warehouse Connector instance can be started using the following commands:

    ```scala
    import com.hortonworks.hwc.HiveWarehouseSession
    val hive = HiveWarehouseSession.session(spark).build()
    ```

### Connecting and running queries on Enterprise Security Package (ESP) clusters

The Enterprise Security Package (ESP) provides enterprise-grade capabilities like Active Directory-based authentication. And multi-user support, and role-based access control for Apache Hadoop clusters in Azure HDInsight. For more information on ESP, see [Use Enterprise Security Package in HDInsight](../domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-architecture.md).

1. SSH into the headnode for your Apache Spark cluster.

1. Type `kinit` and login with a domain user.

1. Start spark-shell with the full list of configuration parameters as shown below. All of the values in all capital letters between angle brackets must be specified based on your cluster. If you need to find out the values to input for any of the parameters below, see the section on [Hive Warehouse Connector setup](#hive-warehouse-connector-setup).

    ```bash
    spark-shell --master yarn \
    --jars /usr/hdp/current/hive_warehouse_connector/hive-warehouse-connector-assembly-<STACK_VERSION>.jar \
    --conf spark.security.credentials.hiveserver2.enabled=false
    --conf spark.hadoop.hive.llap.daemon.service.hosts='<LLAP_APP_NAME>'
    --conf spark.sql.hive.hiveserver2.jdbc.url='jdbc:hive2://<ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM>;serviceDiscoveryMode=zookeeper;zookeeperNamespace=hiveserver2-interactive'
    --conf spark.datasource.hive.warehouse.load.staging.dir='<STAGING_DIR>'
    --conf spark.datasource.hive.warehouse.metastoreUri='<METASTORE_URI>'
    --conf spark.hadoop.hive.zookeeper.quorum='<ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM>'
   ```

### Creating Spark DataFrames from Hive queries

The results of all queries using the HWC library are returned as a DataFrame. The following examples demonstrate how to create a basic query.

```scala
hive.setDatabase("default")
val df = hive.executeQuery("select * from hivesampletable")
df.filter("state = 'Colorado'").show()
```

The results of the query are Spark DataFrames, which can be used with Spark libraries like MLIB and SparkSQL.

### Writing out Spark DataFrames to Hive tables

Spark doesnâ€™t natively support writing to Hiveâ€™s managed ACID tables. Using HWC, however, you can write out any DataFrame to a Hive table. You can see this functionality at work in the following example:

1. Create a table called `sampletable_colorado` and specify its columns using the following command:

    ```scala
    hive.createTable("sampletable_colorado").column("clientid","string").column("querytime","string").column("market","string").column("deviceplatform","string").column("devicemake","string").column("devicemodel","string").column("state","string").column("country","string").column("querydwelltime","double").column("sessionid","bigint").column("sessionpagevieworder","bigint").create()
    ```

1. Filter the table `hivesampletable` where the column `state` equals `Colorado`. This query of the Hive table is returned as a Spark DataFrame. Then the DataFrame is saved in the Hive table `sampletable_colorado` using the `write` function.

    ```scala
    hive.table("hivesampletable").filter("state = 'Colorado'").write.format(HiveWarehouseSession.HIVE_WAREHOUSE_CONNECTOR).option("table","sampletable_colorado").save()
    ```

1. View the results with the following command:

    ```scala
    hive.table("sampletable_colorado").show()
    ```

    ![hive warehouse connector show hive table](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-show-hive-table.png)

### Structured streaming writes

Using Hive Warehouse Connector, you can use Spark streaming to write data into Hive tables.

Follow the steps below to create a Hive Warehouse Connector. The example ingests data from a Spark stream on localhost port 9999 into a Hive table.

1. Follow the steps under [Connecting and running queries](#connecting-and-running-queries).

1. Begin the spark stream with the following command:

    ```scala
    val lines = spark.readStream.format("socket").option("host", "localhost").option("port",9999).load()
    ```

1. Generate data for the Spark stream that you created, by doing the following steps:
    1. Open a second SSH session on the same Spark cluster.
    1. At the command prompt, type `nc -lk 9999`. This command uses the `netcat` utility to send data from the command line to the specified port.

1. Return to the first SSH session and create a new Hive table to hold the streaming data. At the spark-shell, enter the following command:

    ```scala
    hive.createTable("stream_table").column("value","string").create()
    ```

1. Then write the streaming data to the newly created table using the following command:

    ```scala
    lines.filter("value = 'HiveSpark'").writeStream.format(HiveWarehouseSession.STREAM_TO_STREAM).option("database", "default").option("table","stream_table").option("metastoreUri",spark.conf.get("spark.datasource.hive.warehouse.metastoreUri")).option("checkpointLocation","/tmp/checkpoint1").start()
    ```

    >[!Important]
    > The `metastoreUri` and `database` options must currently be set manually due to a known issue in Apache Spark. For more information about this issue, see [SPARK-25460](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25460).

1. Return to the second SSH session and enter the following values:

    ```bash
    foo
    HiveSpark
    bar
    ```

1. Return to the first SSH session and note the brief activity. Use the following command to view the data:

    ```scala
    hive.table("stream_table").show()
    ```

Use **Ctrl + C** to stop `netcat` on the second SSH session. Use `:q` to exit spark-shell on the first SSH session.

### Securing data on Spark ESP clusters

1. Create a table `demo` with some sample data by entering the following commands:

    ```scala
    create table demo (name string);
    INSERT INTO demo VALUES ('HDinsight');
    INSERT INTO demo VALUES ('Microsoft');
    INSERT INTO demo VALUES ('InteractiveQuery');
    ```

1. View the table's contents with the following command. Before applying the policy, the `demo` table shows the full column.

    ```scala
    hive.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM demo").show()
    ```

    ![demo table before applying ranger policy](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-table-before-ranger-policy.png)

1. Apply a column masking policy that only shows the last four characters of the column.  
    1. Go to the Ranger Admin UI at `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/ranger/`.
    1. Click on the Hive service for your cluster under **Hive**.
        ![ranger service manager](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-ranger-service-manager.png)
    1. Click on the **Masking** tab and then **Add New Policy**

        ![hive warehouse connector ranger hive policy list](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-ranger-hive-policy-list.png)

    a. Provide a policy name. Select database: **Default**, Hive table: **demo**, Hive column: **name**, User: **rsadmin2**, Access Types: **select**, and **Partial mask: show last 4** from the **Select Masking Option** menu. Click **Add**.
                ![create policy](./media/apache-hive-warehouse-connector/hive-warehouse-connector-ranger-create-policy.png)
1. View the table's contents again. After applying the ranger policy, we can see only the last four characters of the column.
