# Example Apache Storm topologies and components for Apache Storm on HDInsight

The following is a list of examples created and maintained by Microsoft for use with [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/) on HDInsight. These examples cover a variety of topics, from creating basic C# and Java topologies to working with Azure services such as Event Hubs, Cosmos DB, SQL Database, [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) on HDInsight, and Azure Storage. Some examples also demonstrate how to work with non-Azure, or even non-Microsoft technologies, such as SignalR and Socket.IO.

> [!WARNING]  
> The C# examples in this list were originally created and tested with Windows-based HDInsight, and may not work correctly with Linux-based HDInsight clusters. Linux-based clusters use Mono to run .NET code, and may have compatibility problems with the frameworks and packages used in the example.
>
> Linux is the only operating system used on HDInsight version 3.4 or later.

## Python only

See [Use Python with Apache Storm on HDInsight](apache-storm-develop-python-topology.md) for an example of Python components with a Flux topology.
