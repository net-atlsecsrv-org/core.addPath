# Manage Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight by using .NET SDK

[!INCLUDE [selector](../../includes/hdinsight-portal-management-selector.md)]

Learn how to manage HDInsight clusters using [HDInsight.NET SDK](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/hdinsight).

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin this article, you must have the following:

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).

## Connect to Azure HDInsight

You need the following NuGet packages:

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure.Authentication -Pre
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager -Pre
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Management.HDInsight
```

The following code sample shows you how to connect to Azure before you can administer HDInsight clusters under your Azure subscription.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Azure;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.HDInsight;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.HDInsight.Models;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
using Microsoft.Rest;
using Microsoft.Rest.Azure.Authentication;

namespace HDInsightManagement
{
    class Program
    {
        private static HDInsightManagementClient _hdiManagementClient;
        // Replace with your AAD tenant ID if necessary
        private const string TenantId = UserTokenProvider.CommonTenantId; 
        private const string SubscriptionId = "<Your Azure Subscription ID>";
        // This is the GUID for the PowerShell client. Used for interactive logins in this example.
        private const string ClientId = "1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Authenticate and get a token
            var authToken = Authenticate(TenantId, ClientId, SubscriptionId);
            // Flag subscription for HDInsight, if it isn't already.
            EnableHDInsight(authToken);
            // Get an HDInsight management client
            _hdiManagementClient = new HDInsightManagementClient(authToken);

            // insert code here

            System.Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to continue");
            System.Console.ReadLine();
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Authenticate to an Azure subscription and retrieve an authentication token
        /// </summary>
        static TokenCloudCredentials Authenticate(string TenantId, string ClientId, string SubscriptionId)
        {
            var authContext = new AuthenticationContext("https://login.microsoftonline.com/" + TenantId);
            var tokenAuthResult = authContext.AcquireToken("https://management.core.windows.net/", 
                ClientId, 
                new Uri("urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"), 
                PromptBehavior.Always, 
                UserIdentifier.AnyUser);
            return new TokenCloudCredentials(SubscriptionId, tokenAuthResult.AccessToken);
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// Marks your subscription as one that can use HDInsight, if it has not already been marked as such.
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>This is essentially a one-time action; if you have already done something with HDInsight
        /// on your subscription, then this isn't needed at all and will do nothing.</remarks>
        /// <param name="authToken">An authentication token for your Azure subscription</param>
        static void EnableHDInsight(TokenCloudCredentials authToken)
        {
            // Create a client for the Resource manager and set the subscription ID
            var resourceManagementClient = new ResourceManagementClient(new TokenCredentials(authToken.Token));
            resourceManagementClient.SubscriptionId = SubscriptionId;
            // Register the HDInsight provider
            var rpResult = resourceManagementClient.Providers.Register("Microsoft.HDInsight");
        }
    }
}
```

You shall see a prompt when you run this program.  If you don't want to see the prompt, see [Create non-interactive authentication .NET HDInsight applications](hdinsight-create-non-interactive-authentication-dotnet-applications.md).


## List clusters

The following code snippet lists clusters and some properties:

```csharp
var results = _hdiManagementClient.Clusters.List();
foreach (var name in results.Clusters) {
    Console.WriteLine("Cluster Name: " + name.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("\t Cluster type: " + name.Properties.ClusterDefinition.ClusterType);
    Console.WriteLine("\t Cluster location: " + name.Location);
    Console.WriteLine("\t Cluster version: " + name.Properties.ClusterVersion);
}
```

## Delete clusters

Use the following code snippet to delete a cluster synchronously or asynchronously: 

```csharp
_hdiManagementClient.Clusters.Delete("<Resource Group Name>", "<Cluster Name>");
_hdiManagementClient.Clusters.DeleteAsync("<Resource Group Name>", "<Cluster Name>");
```

## Scale clusters

The cluster scaling feature allows you to change the number of worker nodes used by a cluster that is running in Azure HDInsight without having to re-create the cluster.

> [!NOTE]  
> Only clusters with HDInsight version 3.1.3 or higher are supported. If you are unsure of the version of your cluster, you can check the Properties page.  See [List and show clusters](hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux.md#showClusters).

The impact of changing the number of data nodes for each type of cluster supported by HDInsight:

* Apache Hadoop
  
    You can seamlessly increase the number of worker nodes in a Hadoop cluster that is running without impacting any pending or running jobs. New jobs can also be submitted while the operation is in progress. Failures in a scaling operation are gracefully handled so that the cluster is always left in a functional state.
  
    When a Hadoop cluster is scaled down by reducing the number of data nodes, some of the services in the cluster are restarted. This causes all running and pending jobs to fail at the completion of the scaling operation. You can, however, resubmit the jobs once the operation is complete.
* Apache HBase
  
    You can seamlessly add or remove nodes to your HBase cluster while it is running. Regional Servers are automatically balanced within a few minutes of completing the scaling operation. However, you can also manually balance the regional servers by logging into the headnode of cluster and running the following commands from a command prompt window:
  

    ```bash
    >pushd %HBASE_HOME%\bin
    >hbase shell
    >balancer
    ```

* Apache Storm
  
    You can seamlessly add or remove data nodes to your Storm cluster while it is running. But after a successful completion of the scaling operation, you will need to rebalance the topology.
  
    Rebalancing can be accomplished in two ways:
  
  * Storm web UI
  * Command-line interface (CLI) tool
    
    Please refer to the [Apache Storm documentation](https://storm.apache.org/documentation/Understanding-the-parallelism-of-a-Storm-topology.html) for more details.
    
    The Storm web UI is available on the HDInsight cluster:
    
    ![HDInsight Storm scale rebalance](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-powershell/hdinsight-portal-scale-cluster-storm-rebalance.png)
    
    Here is an example how to use the CLI command to rebalance the Storm topology:
    

    ```console
    ## Reconfigure the topology "mytopology" to use 5 worker processes,
    ## the spout "blue-spout" to use 3 executors, and
    ## the bolt "yellow-bolt" to use 10 executors
    $ storm rebalance mytopology -n 5 -e blue-spout=3 -e yellow-bolt=10
    ```

The following code snippet shows how to resize a cluster synchronously or asynchronously:

```csharp
_hdiManagementClient.Clusters.Resize("<Resource Group Name>", "<Cluster Name>", <New Size>);   
_hdiManagementClient.Clusters.ResizeAsync("<Resource Group Name>", "<Cluster Name>", <New Size>);   
```

## Grant/revoke access

HDInsight clusters have the following HTTP web services (all of these services have RESTful endpoints):

* ODBC
* JDBC
* Apache Ambari
* Apache Oozie
* Apache Templeton

By default, these services are granted for access. You can revoke/grant the access. To revoke:

```csharp
var httpParams = new HttpSettingsParameters
{
    HttpUserEnabled = false,
    HttpUsername = "admin",
    HttpPassword = "*******",
};
_hdiManagementClient.Clusters.ConfigureHttpSettings("<Resource Group Name>, <Cluster Name>, httpParams);
```

To grant:

```csharp
var httpParams = new HttpSettingsParameters
{
    HttpUserEnabled = enable,
    HttpUsername = "admin",
    HttpPassword = "*******",
};
_hdiManagementClient.Clusters.ConfigureHttpSettings("<Resource Group Name>, <Cluster Name>, httpParams);
```

> [!NOTE]  
> By granting/revoking the access, you will reset the cluster user name and password.

This can also be done via the Portal. See [Manage Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight by using the Azure portal](hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux.md).

## Update HTTP user credentials

It is the same procedure as Grant/revoke HTTP access.  If the cluster has been granted the HTTP access, you must first revoke it.  And then grant the access with new HTTP user credentials.

## Find the default storage account

The following code snippet demonstrates how to get the default storage account name and the default storage account key for a cluster.

```csharp
var results = _hdiManagementClient.Clusters.GetClusterConfigurations(<Resource Group Name>, <Cluster Name>, "core-site");
foreach (var key in results.Configuration.Keys)
{
    Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{0} => {1}", key, results.Configuration[key]));
}
```
