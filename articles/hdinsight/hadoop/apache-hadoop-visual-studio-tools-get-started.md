# Use Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio to connect to Azure HDInsight and run Apache Hive queries

Learn how to use [Microsoft Azure Data Lake and Stream Analytics Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49504) (also called Data Lake Tools) to connect to Apache Hadoop clusters in [Azure HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-introduction.md) and submit Hive queries.  

For more information about using HDInsight, see [Introduction to HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-introduction.md) and [Get started with HDInsight](apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md).  

For more information about connecting to an Apache Storm cluster, see [Develop C# topologies for Apache Storm on HDInsight by using Visual Studio](../storm/apache-storm-develop-csharp-visual-studio-topology.md).

You can use Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio to access Azure Data Lake Analytics and HDInsight. For information about Data Lake Tools, see [Develop U-SQL scripts by using Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio](../../data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-data-lake-tools-get-started.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial and use Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio, you need the following items:

* An Azure HDInsight cluster. To create an HDInsight cluster, see [Get started by using Apache Hadoop in Azure HDInsight](apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md). To run interactive Apache Hive queries, you need an [HDInsight Interactive Query](../interactive-query/apache-interactive-query-get-started.md) cluster.  

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (2013 or newer).  The [Visual Studio Community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is free.  See also, [Install Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio) and [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Connect to Azure subscriptions
You can use Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio to connect to your HDInsight clusters, perform some basic management operations, and run Hive queries.

> [!NOTE]  
> For information about connecting to a generic Hadoop cluster, see [Write and submit Hive queries by using Visual Studio](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/xiaoyong/archive/2015/05/04/how-to-write-and-submit-hive-queries-using-visual-studio.aspx).

To connect to your Azure subscription:

1. Open Visual Studio.

2. From the menu bar, navigate to **View** > **Server Explorer**.

3. From Server Explorer, right-click **Azure**, select   **Connect to Microsoft Azure Subscription...**, and complete the sign in process.

4. From Server Explorer, a list of existing HDInsight clusters appears. If you don't have any clusters, you can create one by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the HDInsight SDK. For more information, see [Create HDInsight clusters](../hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md).

   ![Screenshot of the Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio cluster list in Server Explorer](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-server-explorer.png "Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio cluster list in Server Explorer")

5. Expand an HDInsight cluster. **Hive Databases**, a default storage account, linked storage accounts, and **Hadoop Service log** appear. You can further expand the entities.

After you've connected to your Azure subscription, you can perform the following tasks.

To connect to the Azure portal from Visual Studio:

1. From Server Explorer, navigate to **Azure** > **HDInsight** and select your cluster.

2. Right-click an HDInsight cluster, and select **Manage Cluster in Azure Portal**.

To ask questions and/or provide feedback from Visual Studio:

1. From Server Explorer, navigate to **Azure** > **HDInsight**.

2. Right-click **HDInsight** and select either **MSDN Forum** to ask questions, or **Give Feedback** to give feedback.
## Link a cluster
You could link a cluster by right clicking on **HDInsight** then select **Link a HDInsight Cluster**. Enter **Connection Url**, **user name** and **password**, click **Next** then **Finish**, the cluster should be listed under HDInsight node successful.

![Screenshot of Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio link cluster dialog](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-link-cluster-dialog.png)

## Run interactive Apache Hive queries
[Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org) is a data warehouse infrastructure that's built on Hadoop. Hive is used for data summarization, queries, and analysis. You can use Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio to run Hive queries from Visual Studio. For more information about Hive, see [Use Apache Hive with HDInsight](hdinsight-use-hive.md).

[Interactive Query](../interactive-query/apache-interactive-query-get-started.md) uses [Hive on LLAP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LLAP) in Apache Hive 2.1. Interactive Query brings interactivity to complex data warehouse-style queries on large, stored datasets. Running Hive queries on Interactive Query is much faster compared to traditional Hive batch jobs. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You can run interactive Hive queries only when you connect to an [HDInsight Interactive Query](../interactive-query/apache-interactive-query-get-started.md) cluster.

You can also use Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio to see whatâ€™s inside a Hive job. Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio collects and surfaces the Yarn logs of certain Hive jobs.

From Server Explorer, navigate to **Azure** > **HDInsight** and select your cluster.  This will be the starting point in Server Explorer for the sections to follow.

### View hivesampletable
All HDInsight clusters have a default sample Hive table called `hivesampletable`.  

From your cluster, navigate to **Hive Databases** > **default** > **hivesampletable**.

* To view `hivesampletable` schema:  
Expand **hivesampletable**.

* To view `hivesampletable` data:  
Right-click **hivesampletable**, and select **View Top 100 Rows**.  This is equivalent to running the following Hive query by using the Hive ODBC driver:

   `SELECT * FROM hivesampletable LIMIT 100`

  You can customize the row count.

### Create Hive tables
To create a Hive table, you can use the GUI or you can use Hive queries. For information about using Hive queries, see [Run Apache Hive queries](#run.queries).

1. From your cluster, navigate to **Hive Databases** > **default**.

2. Right-click **default**, and select **Create Table**.

3. Configure the table as desired.  

4. Select **Create Table** to submit the job to create the new Hive table.

    ![Screenshot of the HDInsight Visual Studio Tools Create Table window](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-create-hive-table.png "Create Hive table")

### <a name="run.queries"></a>Create and run Hive queries
You have two options for creating and running Hive queries:

* Create ad-hoc queries
* Create a Hive application

To create, and run ad-hoc queries:

1. Right-click the cluster where you want to run the query, and select **Write a Hive Query**.  

2. Enter the Hive queries.  

    The Hive editor supports IntelliSense. Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio supports loading remote metadata when you edit your Hive script. For example, if you type `SELECT * FROM`, IntelliSense lists all the suggested table names. When a table name is specified, IntelliSense lists the column names. The tools support most Hive DML statements, subqueries, and built-in UDFs.

    ![Screenshot of an HDInsight Visual Studio Tools IntelliSense example 1](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-intellisense-table-names.png "U-SQL IntelliSense")

    ![Screenshot of an HDInsight Visual Studio Tools IntelliSense example 2](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-intellisense-column-names.png "U-SQL IntelliSense")

   > [!NOTE]  
   > IntelliSense suggests only the metadata of the cluster that is selected in the HDInsight toolbar.

3. Choose execution mode:

    * **Interactive**  

      Ensure **Interactive** is selected and then select **Execute**.

      ![Screenshot of query and execute](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/execute.png)  

    * **Batch**  

      Ensure **Batch** is selected and then select **Submit**.  If you select the advanced submit option, configure **Job Name**, **Arguments**, **Additional Configurations**, and **Status Directory** for the script.

      ![Screenshot of query and batch](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/batch.png)  

      ![Screenshot of an HDInsight Hadoop Hive query](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-submit-jobs-advanced.png "Submit queries")

      > [!NOTE]  
      > You can not submit batches to Interactive Query clusters.  You must use interactive mode.

To create and run a Hive solution:

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **File** > **New** > **Project...**.

2. In the left pane, navigate to **Installed** > **Azure Data Lake** > **HIVE (HDInsight)**.  

3. In the middle pane, select **Hive Application**. Enter the properties, and then select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of an HDInsight Visual Studio Tools new Hive project](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-new-hive-project.png "Create Hive applications from Visual Studio")

4. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **Script.hql** to open the script.

### View job summary and output

The job summary varies slightly between **Batch** and **Interactive** mode.

![Job summary](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/jobSummary.png "Hive job summary")

Use the **Refresh** button to update the status until the job status changes to **Finished**.  

* For the job details from **Batch** mode, select the links at the bottom to see **Job Query**, **Job Output**, **Job log**, or **Yarn log**.

* For the job details from **Interactive** mode, see tabs **Output** and **HiveServer2 Output**.

  ![job details](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/tabs.png "Hive job details")

### View job graph

Currently, job graphs are only shown for Hive jobs that use Tez as the execution engine.  For information about enabling Tez, see [Use Apache Hive in HDInsight](hdinsight-use-hive.md).  See also, [Use Apache Tez instead of Map Reduce](../hdinsight-hadoop-optimize-hive-query.md#use-apache-tez-instead-of-map-reduce).  

To view all the operators inside the vertex, double-click on the vertices of the job graph. You can also point to a specific operator to see more details about the operator.

The job graph may not appear even if Tez is specified as the execution engine if no Tez application is launched.  This might happen because the job does not contain DML statements, or the DML statements can return without launching a Tez application. For example, `SELECT * FROM table1` will not launch the Tez application.

![Job graph](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-fast-path-hive-execution.png "Hive job summary")


### Task Execution Detail

From the job graph, you can select **Task Execution Detail** to get structured and visualized information for Hive jobs. You can also get more job details. If performance issues occur, you can use the view to get more details about the issue. For example, you can get information about how each task operates, and detailed information about each task
(data read/write, schedule/start/end time, and so on). Use the information to tune job configurations or system architecture based on the visualized information.

![Screenshot of the Data Lake Visual Studio Tools Task Execution View window](./media/apache-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/hdinsight-visual-studio-tools-task-execution-view.png "Task Execution View")


### View Hive jobs
You can view job queries, job output, job logs, and Yarn logs for Hive jobs.

In the most recent release of the tools, you can see whatâ€™s inside your Hive jobs by collecting and surfacing Yarn logs. A Yarn log can help you investigating performance issues. For more information about how HDInsight collects Yarn logs, see [Access HDInsight application logs programmatically](../hdinsight-hadoop-access-yarn-app-logs.md).

To view Hive jobs:

1. Right-click an HDInsight cluster, and select **View Jobs**. A list of the Hive jobs that ran on the cluster appears.  

2. Select a job. In the **Hive Job Summary** window, select one of the following:
    - **Job Query**
    - **Job Output**
    - **Job Log**  
    - **Yarn log**

## Run Apache Pig scripts

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **File** > **New** > **Project...**.

2. In the left pane, navigate to **Installed** > **Azure Data Lake** > **Pig (HDInsight)**.  

3. In the middle pane, select **Pig Application**. Enter the properties, and then select **OK**.

4. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **Script.pig** to open the script.

## Feedback and known issues
* An issue in which results that are started with null values aren't shown has been fixed. If you're blocked on this issue, contact the support team.
* The HQL script that Visual Studio creates is encoded, depending on the userâ€™s local region setting. The script doesn't execute correctly if you upload the script to a cluster as a binary file.
