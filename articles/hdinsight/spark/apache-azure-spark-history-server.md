# Use extended Apache Spark History Server to debug and diagnose Apache Spark applications

This article provides guidance on how to use extended Apache Spark History Server to debug and diagnose completed and running Spark applications. The extension includes data tab and graph tab and diagnosis tab. On the **Data** tab, users can check the input and output data of the Spark job. On the **Graph** tab, users can check the data flow and replay the job graph. On the **Diagnosis** tab, user can refer to **Data Skew**, **Time Skew** and **Executor Usage Analysis**.

## Get access to Apache Spark History Server

Apache Spark History Server is the web UI for completed and running Spark applications. 

### Open the Apache Spark History Server Web UI from Azure portal

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open the Spark cluster. For more information, see [List and show clusters](../hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux.md#showClusters).
2. From **Quick Links**, click **Cluster Dashboard**, and then click **Spark History Server**. When prompted, enter the admin credentials for the Spark cluster.

  + Data skew: data read size > average data read size of all tasks inside this stage * 2 and data read size > 10 MB.
  + Time skew: execution time > average execution time of all tasks inside this stage * 2 and execution time > 2 mins.

    ![graph skew icon](./media/apache-azure-spark-history-server/sparkui-graph-skew-icon.png)

+ The job graph node will display the following information of each stage:
  + ID.
  + Name or description.
  + Total task number.
  + Data read: the sum of input size and shuffle read size.
  + Data write: the sum of output size and shuffle write size.
  + Execution time: the time between start time of the first attempt and completion time of the last attempt.
  + Row count: the sum of input records, output records, shuffle read records and shuffle write records.
  + Progress.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > By default, the job graph node will display information from last attempt of each stage (except for stage execution time), but during playback graph node will show information of each attempt.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For data size of read and write we use 1MB = 1000 KB = 1000 * 1000 Bytes.

## Diagnosis tab in Apache Spark History Server
Select job ID then click **Diagnosis** on the tool menu to get the job Diagnosis view. The diagnosis tab includes **Data Skew**, **Time Skew**, and **Executor Usage Analysis**.
    
+ Check the **Data Skew**, **Time Skew**, and **Executor Usage Analysis** by selecting the tabs respectively.

    ![Diagnosis tabs](./media/apache-azure-spark-history-server/sparkui-diagnosis-tabs.png)

### Data Skew
Click **Data Skew** tab, the corresponding skewed tasks are displayed based on the specified parameters. 

+ **Specify Parameters** - The first section displays the parameters which are used to detect Data Skew. The built-in rule is: Task Data Read is greater than 3 times of the average task data read, and the task data read is more than 10MB. If you want to define your own rule for skewed tasks, you can choose your parameters, the **Skewed Stage**, and **Skew Char** section will be refreshed accordingly.

+ **Skewed Stage** - The second section displays stages which have skewed tasks meeting the criteria specified above. If there are more than one skewed task in a stage, the skewed stage table only displays the most skewed task (e.g. the largest data for data skew).

    ![Data skew section2](./media/apache-azure-spark-history-server/sparkui-diagnosis-dataskew-section2.png)

+ **Skew Chart** â€“ When a row in the skew stage table is selected, the skew chart displays more task distributions details based on data read and execution time. The skewed tasks are marked in red and the normal tasks are marked in blue. For performance consideration, the chart only displays up to 100 sample tasks. The task details are displayed in right bottom panel.

    ![Data skew section3](./media/apache-azure-spark-history-server/sparkui-diagnosis-dataskew-section3.png)

### Time Skew
The **Time Skew** tab displays skewed tasks based on task execution time. 

+ **Specify Parameters** - The first section displays the parameters which are used to detect Time Skew. The default criteria to detect time skew is: task execution time is greater than 3 times of average execution time and task execution time is greater than 30 seconds. You can change the parameters based on your needs. The **Skewed Stage** and **Skew Chart** display the corresponding stages and tasks information just like the **Data Skew** tab above.

+ Click **Time Skew**, then filtered result is displayed in **Skewed Stage** section according to the parameters set in section **Specify Parameters**. Click one item in **Skewed Stage** section, then the corresponding chart is drafted in section3, and the task details are displayed in right bottom panel.

    ![Time skew section2](./media/apache-azure-spark-history-server/sparkui-diagnosis-timeskew-section2.png)

### Executor Usage Analysis
The Executor Usage Graph visualizes the Spark job actual executor allocation and running status.  

+ Click **Executor Usage Analysis**, then four types curves about executor usage are drafted, including **Allocated Executors**, **Running Executors**,**idle Executors**, and **Max Executor Instances**. Regarding allocated executors, each "Executor added" or "Executor removed" event will increase or decrease the allocated executors, you can check "Event Timeline" in the â€œJobs" tab for more comparison.

        exit 1
    fi

    install_jar() {
        tmp_jar_path="/tmp/spark-enhancement-hotfix-$( date +%s )"

        if wget -O "$tmp_jar_path" "$2"; then
            for FILE in "$1"/spark-enhancement*.jar
            do
                back_up_path="$FILE.original.$( date +%s )"
                echo "Back up $FILE to $back_up_path"
                mv "$FILE" "$back_up_path"
                echo "Copy the hotfix jar file from $tmp_jar_path   to $FILE"
                cp "$tmp_jar_path" "$FILE"

                "Hotfix done."
                break
