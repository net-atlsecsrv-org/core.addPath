# Apache ZooKeeper server fails to form a quorum in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

Apache ZooKeeper server is unhealthy, symptoms could include: both Resource Managers/Name Nodes are in standby mode, simple HDFS operations do not work, `zkFailoverController` is stopped and cannot be started, Yarn/Spark/Livy jobs fail due to Zookeeper errors. LLAP Daemons may also fail to start on Secure Spark or Interactive Hive clusters. You may see an error message similar to:

```
19/06/19 08:27:08 ERROR ZooKeeperStateStore: Fatal Zookeeper error. Shutting down Livy server.
19/06/19 08:27:08 INFO LivyServer: Shutting down Livy server.
```

In the Zookeeper Server logs on any Zookeeper host at /var/log/zookeeper/zookeeper-zookeeper-server-\*.out, you may also see the following error:

```
2020-02-12 00:31:52,513 - ERROR [CommitProcessor:1:NIOServerCnxn@178] - Unexpected Exception:
java.nio.channels.CancelledKeyException
```

## Cause

When the volume of snapshot files is large or snapshot files are corrupted, ZooKeeper server will fail to form a quorum, which causes ZooKeeper related services unhealthy. ZooKeeper server will not remove old snapshot files from its data directory, instead, it is a periodic task to be performed by users to maintain the healthiness of ZooKeeper. For more information, see [ZooKeeper Strengths and Limitations](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.5/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_strengthsAndLimitations).

## Resolution

Check ZooKeeper data directory `/hadoop/zookeeper/version-2` and `/hadoop/hdinsight-zookeeper/version-2` to find out if the snapshots file size is large. Take the following steps if large snapshots exist:

1. Check the status of other ZooKeeper servers in the same quorum to make sure they are working fine with the command “`echo stat | nc {zk_host_ip} 2181 (or 2182)`”.  

1. Login the problematic ZooKeeper host, backup snapshots and transaction logs in `/hadoop/zookeeper/version-2` and `/hadoop/hdinsight-zookeeper/version-2`, then cleanup these files in the two directories. 

1. Restart the problematic ZooKeeper server in Ambari or the ZooKeeper host. Then restart the service which has problems.
