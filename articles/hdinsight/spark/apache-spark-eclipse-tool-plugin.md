# Use Azure Toolkit for Eclipse to create Apache Spark applications for an HDInsight cluster

Use HDInsight Tools in Azure Toolkit for [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) to develop [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) applications written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and submit them to an Azure HDInsight Spark cluster, directly from the Eclipse IDE. You can use the HDInsight Tools plug-in in a few different ways:

* To develop and submit a Scala Spark application on an HDInsight Spark cluster.
* To access your Azure HDInsight Spark cluster resources.
* To develop and run a Scala Spark application locally.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can use this tool to create and submit applications only for an HDInsight Spark cluster on Linux.
> 
> 

## Prerequisites

* Apache Spark cluster on HDInsight. For instructions, see [Create Apache Spark clusters in Azure HDInsight](apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql.md).
* Oracle Java Development Kit version 8, which is used for the Eclipse IDE runtime. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks).
* Eclipse IDE. This article uses Eclipse Neon. You can install it from the [Eclipse website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).



## Install HDInsight Tools in Azure Toolkit for Eclipse and the Scala plug-in

### Install Azure Toolkit for Eclipse
HDInsight Tools for Eclipse is available as part of Azure Toolkit for Eclipse. For installation instructions, see [Installing Azure Toolkit for Eclipse](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/eclipse/azure-toolkit-for-eclipse-installation).

### Install the Scala plug-in
When you open Eclipse, HDInsight Tool automatically detects whether you installed the Scala plug-in. Select **OK** to continue, and then follow the instructions to install the plug-in from the Eclipse Marketplace.

   ![Create New File dialog box](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/create-scala-proj-2.png)
1. Paste the following code in the text editor:
   
        import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
        import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
   
        object MyClusterApp{
          def main (arg: Array[String]): Unit = {
            val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("MyClusterApp")
            val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
   
            val rdd = sc.textFile("wasb:///HdiSamples/HdiSamples/SensorSampleData/hvac/HVAC.csv")
   
            //find the rows that have only one digit in the seventh column in the CSV
            val rdd1 =  rdd.filter(s => s.split(",")(6).length() == 1)
   
            rdd1.saveAsTextFile("wasb:///HVACOut")
          }        
        }
1. Run the application on an HDInsight Spark cluster:
   
   a. From Package Explorer, right-click the project name, and then select **Submit Spark Application to HDInsight**.        
   b. In the **Spark Submission** dialog box, provide the following values, and then select **Submit**:
      
   * For **Cluster Name**, select the HDInsight Spark cluster on which you want to run your application.
   * Select an artifact from the Eclipse project, or select one from a hard drive. The default value depends on the item that you right-click from Package Explorer.
   * In the **Main class name** drop-down list, the submission wizard displays all object names from your project. Select or enter one that you want to run. If you selected an artifact from a hard drive, you must enter the main class name manually. 
   * Because the application code in this example does not require any command-line arguments or reference JARs or files, you can leave the remaining text boxes empty.
        
     ![Spark Submission dialog box](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/create-scala-proj-3.png)
1. The **Spark Submission** tab should start displaying the progress. You can stop the application by selecting the red button in the **Spark Submission** window. You can also view the logs for this specific application run by selecting the globe icon (denoted by the blue box in the image).

## Access and manage HDInsight Spark clusters by using HDInsight Tools in Azure Toolkit for Eclipse
You can perform various operations by using HDInsight Tools, including accessing the job output.

### Access the job view
1. In Azure Explorer, expand **HDInsight**, expand the Spark cluster name, and then select **Jobs**. 

   ![Job view node](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/job-view-node.png)

1. Select the **Jobs** node. If Java version is lower than **1.8**, HDInsight Tools automatically reminder you install the **E(fx)clipse** plug-in. Select **OK** to continue, and then follow the wizard to install it from the Eclipse Marketplace and restart Eclipse. 

   ![Install E(fx)clipse](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/auto-install-efxclipse.png)

1. Open the Job View from the **Jobs** node. In the right pane, the **Spark Job View** tab displays all the applications that were run on the cluster. Select the name of the application for which you want to see more details.

   ![Application details](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/view-job-logs.png)

   You can then take any of these actions:

   * Hover on the job graph. It displays basic info about the running job. Select the job graph, and you can see the stages and info that every job generates.

     ![Job stage details](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/Job-graph-stage-info.png)

   * Select the **Log** tab to view frequently used logs, including **Driver Stderr**, **Driver Stdout**, and **Directory Info**.

     ![Log details](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/Job-log-info.png)

   * Open the Spark history UI and the Apache Hadoop YARN UI (at the application level) by selecting the hyperlinks at the top of the window.

### Access the storage container for the cluster
1. In Azure Explorer, expand the **HDInsight** root node to see a list of HDInsight Spark clusters that are available.
1. Expand the cluster name to see the storage account and the default storage container for the cluster.
   
   ![Storage account and default storage container](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/view-explorer-5.png)
1. Select the storage container name associated with the cluster. In the right pane, double-click the **HVACOut** folder. Open one of the **part-** files to see the output of the application.

### Access the Spark history server
1. In Azure Explorer, right-click your Spark cluster name, and then select **Open Spark History UI**. When you're prompted, enter the admin credentials for the cluster. You specified these while provisioning the cluster.
1. In the Spark history server dashboard, you use the application name to look for the application that you just finished running. In the preceding code, you set the application name by using `val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("MyClusterApp")`. So, your Spark application name was **MyClusterApp**.

### Start the Apache Ambari portal
1. In Azure Explorer, right-click your Spark cluster name, and then select **Open Cluster Management Portal (Ambari)**. 
1. When you're prompted, enter the admin credentials for the cluster. You specified these while provisioning the cluster.

### Manage Azure subscriptions
By default, HDInsight Tool in Azure Toolkit for Eclipse lists the Spark clusters from all your Azure subscriptions. If necessary, you can specify the subscriptions for which you want to access the cluster. 

1. In Azure Explorer, right-click the **Azure** root node, and then select **Manage Subscriptions**. 
1. In the dialog box, clear the check boxes for the subscription that you don't want to access, and then select **Close**. You can also select **Sign Out** if you want to sign out of your Azure subscription.

## Run a Spark Scala application locally
You can use HDInsight Tools in Azure Toolkit for Eclipse to run Spark Scala applications locally on your workstation. Typically, these applications don't need access to cluster resources such as a storage container, and you can run and test them locally.

### Prerequisite
While you're running the local Spark Scala application on a Windows computer, you might get an exception as explained in [SPARK-2356](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2356). This exception occurs because **WinUtils.exe** is missing in Windows. 

To resolve this error, you need [download the executable](https://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/hdp-win-alpha/winutils.exe) to a location like **C:\WinUtils\bin**, and then add the environment variable **HADOOP_HOME** and set the value of the variable to **C\WinUtils**.

### Run a local Spark Scala application
1. Start Eclipse and create a project. In the **New Project** dialog box, make the following choices, and then select **Next**.
   
   * In the left pane, select **HDInsight**.
   * In the right pane, select **Spark on HDInsight Local Run Sample (Scala)**.

   ![New Project dialog box](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/hdi-spark-app-local-run.png)
   
1. To provide the project details, follow steps 3 through 6 from the earlier section [Setup a Spark Scala project for an HDInsight Spark cluster](#set-up-a-spark-scala-project-for-an-hdinsight-spark-cluster).

1. The template adds a sample code (**LogQuery**) under the **src** folder that you can run locally on your computer.
   
   ![Location of LogQuery](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/local-app.png)
   
1. Right-click the **LogQuery** application, point to **Run As**, and then select **1 Scala Application**. Output like this appears on the **Console** tab:
   
   ![Spark application local run result](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/hdi-spark-app-local-run-result.png)

## Known problems
When link a cluster, I would suggest you to provide credential of storage.

![Interactive sign-in](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/link-cluster-with-storage-credential-eclipse.png)

There are two modes to submit the jobs. If storage credential is provided, batch mode will be used to submit the job. Otherwise, interactive mode will be used. If the cluster is busy, you might get the error below.

![eclipse get error when cluster busy](./media/apache-spark-eclipse-tool-plugin/eclipse-interactive-cluster-busy-upload.png)
