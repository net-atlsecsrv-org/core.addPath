# Use Caffe on Azure HDInsight Spark for distributed deep learning

## Introduction

Deep learning is impacting everything from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing, and more. Companies are turning to deep learning to solve hard problems,Â like [image classification](https://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2015/12/10/microsoft-researchers-win-imagenet-computer-vision-challenge/), [speech recognition](https://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2015/08/the-neural-networks-behind-google-voice.html), object recognition, and machine translation.

There are [many popular frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep_learning_software), including [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/), Theano, etc. [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) is one of the most famous non-symbolic (imperative) neural network frameworks, and widely used in many areas including computer vision. Furthermore, [CaffeOnSpark](https://yahoohadoop.tumblr.com/post/139916563586/caffeonspark-open-sourced-for-distributed-deep) combines Caffe with Apache Spark, in which case deep learning can be easily used on an existing Hadoop cluster. You can use deep learning together with Spark ETL pipelines, reducing system complexity, and latency for complete solution learning.

[HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) is a cloud Apache Hadoop offering that provides optimized open-source analytic clusters for Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Hadoop, Apache HBase, Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, and ML Services. HDInsight is backed by a 99.9% SLA. Each of these big data technologies and ISV applications is easily deployable as managed clusters with security and monitoring for enterprises.

This article demonstrates how to install [Caffe on Spark](https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark) for an HDInsight cluster. This article also uses the built-in MNIST demo to show how to use Distributed Deep Learning using HDInsight Spark on CPUs.

There are four steps to accomplish the task:

1. Install the required dependencies on all the nodes
2. Build Caffe on Spark for HDInsight on the head node
3. Distribute the required libraries to all the worker nodes
4. Compose a Caffe model and run it in a distributed manner.

Since HDInsight is a PaaS solution, it offers great platform features - so it is easy to perform some tasks. One of the features used in this blog post is called [Script Action](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux), with which you can execute shell commands to customize cluster nodes (head node, worker node, or edge node).

## Step 1:  Install the required dependencies on all the nodes

To get started, you need to install the dependencies. The Caffe site and [CaffeOnSpark site](https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark/wiki/GetStarted_yarn) offers some useful wiki for installing the dependencies for Spark on YARN mode. HDInsight also uses Spark on YARN mode. However, you need to add a few more dependencies for HDInsight platform. To do so, you use a script action and run it on all the head nodes and worker nodes. This script action takes about 20 minutes, as those dependencies also depend on other packages. You should put it in some location that is accessible to your HDInsight cluster, such as a GitHub location or the default BLOB storage account.

    #!/bin/bash
    #Please be aware that installing the below will add additional 20 mins to cluster creation because of the dependencies
    #installing all dependencies, including the ones mentioned in https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html, as well a few packages that are not included in HDInsight, such as gflags, glog, lmdb, numpy
    #It seems numpy will only needed during compilation time, but for safety purpose you install them on all the nodes

    sudo apt-get install -y libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler maven libatlas-base-dev libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev build-essential  libboost-all-dev python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

    #install protobuf
    wget https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
    sudo tar xzvf protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz -C /tmp/
    cd /tmp/protobuf-2.5.0/
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    echo "protobuf installation done"

There are two steps in the script action. The first step is to install all the required libraries. Those libraries include the necessary libraries for both compiling Caffe(such as gflags, glog) and running Caffe (such as numpy). you are using libatlas for CPU optimization, but you can always follow the CaffeOnSpark wiki on installing other optimization libraries, such as MKL or CUDA (for GPU).

The second step is to download, compile, and install protobuf 2.5.0 for Caffe during runtime. Protobuf 2.5.0 [is required](https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark/issues/87), however this version is not available as a package on Ubuntu 16, so you need to compile it from the source code. There are also a few resources on the Internet on how to compile it. For more information, see [here](https://jugnu-life.blogspot.com/2013/09/install-protobuf-25-on-ubuntu.html).

To get started, you can just run this script action against your cluster to all the worker nodes and head nodes (for HDInsight 3.5). You can either run the script actions on an existing cluster, or use script actions during the cluster creation. For more information on the script actions, see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux).

![Script Actions to Install Dependencies](./media/apache-spark-deep-learning-caffe/submit-script-action.png)

## Step 2: Build Caffe on Apache Spark for HDInsight on the head node

The second step is to build Caffe on the headnode, and then distribute the compiled libraries to all the worker nodes. In this step, you must [ssh into your headnode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix). After that, you must follow the [CaffeOnSpark build process](https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark/wiki/GetStarted_yarn). Below is the script you can use to build CaffeOnSpark with a few additional steps.

    #!/bin/bash
    git clone https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark.git --recursive
    export CAFFE_ON_SPARK=$(pwd)/CaffeOnSpark

    pushd ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/caffe-public/
    cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
    echo "INCLUDE_DIRS += ${JAVA_HOME}/include" >> Makefile.config
    #Below configurations might need to be updated based on actual cases. For example, if you are using GPU, or using a different BLAS library, you may want to update those settings accordingly.
    echo "CPU_ONLY := 1" >> Makefile.config
    echo "BLAS := atlas" >> Makefile.config
    echo "INCLUDE_DIRS += /usr/include/hdf5/serial/" >> Makefile.config
    echo "LIBRARY_DIRS += /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial/" >> Makefile.config
    popd

    #compile CaffeOnSpark
    pushd ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}
    #always clean up the environment before building (especially when rebuiding), or there will be errors such as "failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:1.7:run (proto) on project caffe-distri: An Ant BuildException has occurred: exec returned: 2"
    make clean 
    #the build step usually takes 20~30 mins, since it has a lot maven dependencies
    make build 
    popd
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/caffe-public/distribute/lib:${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/caffe-distri/distribute/lib

    hadoop fs -mkdir -p wasb:///projects/machine_learning/image_dataset

    ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/scripts/setup-mnist.sh
    hadoop fs -put -f ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/data/mnist_*_lmdb wasb:///projects/machine_learning/image_dataset/

    ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/scripts/setup-cifar10.sh
    hadoop fs -put -f ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/data/cifar10_*_lmdb wasb:///projects/machine_learning/image_dataset/

    #put the already compiled CaffeOnSpark libraries to wasb storage, then read back to each node using script actions. This is because CaffeOnSpark requires all the nodes have the libarries
    hadoop fs -mkdir -p /CaffeOnSpark/caffe-public/distribute/lib/
    hadoop fs -mkdir -p /CaffeOnSpark/caffe-distri/distribute/lib/
    hadoop fs -put CaffeOnSpark/caffe-distri/distribute/lib/* /CaffeOnSpark/caffe-distri/distribute/lib/
    hadoop fs -put CaffeOnSpark/caffe-public/distribute/lib/* /CaffeOnSpark/caffe-public/distribute/lib/

You may need to do more than what the documentation of CaffeOnSpark says. The changes are:
- Change to CPU only and use libatlas for this particular purpose.
- Put the datasets to the BLOB storage, which is a shared location that is accessible to all worker nodes for later use.
- Put the compiled Caffe libraries to BLOB storage, and later you copy those libraries to all the nodes using script actions to avoid additional compilation time.

### Troubleshooting: An Ant BuildException has occurred: exec returned: 2

When first trying to build CaffeOnSpark, sometimes it says

    failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:1.7:run (proto) on project caffe-distri: An Ant BuildException has occurred: exec returned: 2

Clean the code repository by "make clean" and then run "make build" to solve this issue, as long as you have the correct dependencies.

### Troubleshooting: Maven repository connection time-out

Sometimes maven gives a connection time-out error, similar to the  following snippet:

    Retry:
    [INFO] Downloading: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/twitter/chill_2.11/0.8.0/chill_2.11-0.8.0.jar
    Feb 01, 2017 5:14:49 AM org.apache.maven.wagon.providers.http.httpclient.impl.execchain.RetryExec execute
    INFO: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request to {s}->https://repo.maven.apache.org:443: Connection timed out (Read failed)

You must retry after a few minutes.

### Troubleshooting: Test failure for Caffe

You probably see a test failure when doing the final check for CaffeOnSpark. This is probably related with UTF-8 encoding, but should not impact the usage of Caffe

    Run completed in 32 seconds, 78 milliseconds.
    Total number of tests run: 7
    Suites: completed 5, aborted 0
    Tests: succeeded 6, failed 1, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
    *** 1 TEST FAILED ***

## Step 3: Distribute the required libraries to all the worker nodes

The next step is to distribute the libraries (basically the libraries in CaffeOnSpark/caffe-public/distribute/lib/ and CaffeOnSpark/caffe-distri/distribute/lib/) to all the nodes. In Step 2, you put those libraries on BLOB storage, and in this step, you use script actions to copy it to all the head nodes and worker nodes.

To do this, run a script action as shown in the following snippet:

    #!/bin/bash
    hadoop fs -get wasb:///CaffeOnSpark /home/changetoyourusername/

Make sure you need point to the right location specific to your cluster)

Because in step 2, you put it on the BLOB storage, which is accessible to all the nodes, in this step you just copy it to all the nodes.

## Step 4: Compose a Caffe model and run it in a distributed manner

Caffe is installed after running the preceding steps. The next step is to write a Caffe model. 

Caffe is using an "expressive architecture", where for composing a model, you just need to define a configuration file, and without coding at all (in most cases). So let's take a look there. 

The model that you train is a sample model for MNIST training. The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. CaffeOnSpark has some scripts to download the dataset and convert it into the right format.

CaffeOnSpark provides some network topologies example for MNIST training. It has a nice design of splitting the network architecture (the topology of the network) and optimization. In this case, There are two files required:

the "Solver" file (${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/data/lenet_memory_solver.prototxt) is used for overseeing the optimization and generating parameter updates. For example, it defines whether CPU or GPU is used, what's the momentum, how many iterations are, etc. It also defines which neuron network topology should the program use (which is the second file you need). For more information about Solver, see [Caffe documentation](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/solver.html).

For this example, since you are using CPU rather than GPU, you should change the last line to:

    # solver mode: CPU or GPU
    solver_mode: CPU

![HDInsight caffe configuration example](./media/apache-spark-deep-learning-caffe/caffe-configuration1.png
)

You can change other lines as needed.

The second file (${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/data/lenet_memory_train_test.prototxt) defines how the neuron network looks like, and the relevant input and output file. you also need to update the file to reflect the training data location. Change the following part in lenet_memory_train_test.prototxt (you need to point to the right location specific to your cluster):

- change the "file:/Users/mridul/bigml/demodl/mnist_train_lmdb" to "wasb:///projects/machine_learning/image_dataset/mnist_train_lmdb"
- change "file:/Users/mridul/bigml/demodl/mnist_test_lmdb/" to "wasb:///projects/machine_learning/image_dataset/mnist_test_lmdb"

![HDInsight caffe configuration example again](./media/apache-spark-deep-learning-caffe/caffe-configuration2.png)

For more information on how to define the network, check the [Caffe documentation on MNIST dataset](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/mnist.html)

For the purpose of this article, you use this MNIST example. Run the following commands from the head node:

    spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --num-executors 8 --files ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/data/lenet_memory_solver.prototxt,${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/data/lenet_memory_train_test.prototxt --conf spark.driver.extraLibraryPath="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" --conf spark.executorEnv.LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" --class com.yahoo.ml.caffe.CaffeOnSpark ${CAFFE_ON_SPARK}/caffe-grid/target/caffe-grid-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -train -features accuracy,loss -label label -conf lenet_memory_solver.prototxt -devices 1 -connection ethernet -model wasb:///mnist.model -output wasb:///mnist_features_result

The preceding command distributes the required files (lenet_memory_solver.prototxt and lenet_memory_train_test.prototxt) to each YARN container. The command also sets the relevant PATH of each Spark driver/executor to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. LD_LIBRARY_PATH is defined in the previous code snippet and points to the location that has CaffeOnSpark libraries. 

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

Since you are using YARN cluster mode, in which case the Spark driver will be scheduled to an arbitrary container (and an arbitrary worker node) you should only see in the console outputting something like:

    17/02/01 23:22:16 INFO Client: Application report for application_1485916338528_0015 (state: RUNNING)

If you want to know what happened, you usually need to get the Spark driver's log, which has more information. In this case, you need to go to the YARN UI to find the relevant YARN logs. You can get the YARN UI by this URL:

    https://yourclustername.azurehdinsight.net/yarnui

![apache yarn scheduler browser view](./media/apache-spark-deep-learning-caffe/apache-yarn-window-1.png)

You can take a look at how many resources are allocated for this particular application. You can click the "Scheduler" link, and then you will see that for this application, there are nine containers running. you ask YARN to provide eight executors, and another container is for driver process. 

![HDI apache YARN Scheduler view](./media/apache-spark-deep-learning-caffe/apache-yarn-scheduler.png)

You may want to check the  driver logs or container logs if there are failures. For driver logs, you can click the application ID in YARN UI, then click the "Logs" button. The driver logs are written into stderr.

![apache yarn window browser view](./media/apache-spark-deep-learning-caffe/apache-yarn-window-2.png)

For example, you might see some of the error below from the driver logs, indicating you allocate too many executors.

    17/02/01 07:26:06 ERROR ApplicationMaster: User class threw exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Insufficient training data. Please adjust hyperparameters or increase dataset.
    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Insufficient training data. Please adjust hyperparameters or increase dataset.

Sometimes, the issue can happen in executors rather than drivers. In this case, you need to check the container logs. You can always get the container logs, and then get the failed container. For example, you might meet this failure when running Caffe.

    Container exited with a non-zero exit code 134

In this case, you need to get the failed container ID (in the above case, it is container_1485916338528_0008_05_000005). Then you need to run 

    yarn logs -containerId container_1485916338528_0008_03_000005

from the headnode. After checking container failure, it is caused by using GPU mode (where you should use CPU mode instead) in lenet_memory_solver.prototxt.

## Getting results

Since you are allocating 8 executors, and the network topology is simple, it should only take around 30 minutes to run the result. From the command line, you can see that you put the model to wasb:///mnist.model, and put the results to a folder named wasb:///mnist_features_result.

You can get the results by running

    hadoop fs -cat hdfs:///mnist_features_result/*

and the result looks like:

    {"SampleID":"00009597","accuracy":[1.0],"loss":[0.028171852],"label":[2.0]}
    {"SampleID":"00009598","accuracy":[1.0],"loss":[0.028171852],"label":[6.0]}
