# Use Azure Monitor logs to monitor HDInsight clusters

Learn how to enable Azure Monitor logs to monitor Hadoop cluster operations in HDInsight. And how to add an HDInsight monitoring solution.

[Azure Monitor logs](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md) is an Azure Monitor service that monitors your cloud and on-premises environments. The monitoring is to maintain their availability and performance. It collects data generated by resources in your cloud, on-premises environments and from other monitoring tools. The data is used to provide analysis across multiple sources.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](../../includes/azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand.md)]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* A Log Analytics workspace. You can think of this workspace as a unique Azure Monitor logs environment with its own data repository, data sources, and solutions. For the instructions, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-azurevm.md#create-a-workspace).

* An Azure HDInsight cluster. Currently, you can use Azure Monitor logs with the following HDInsight cluster types:

  * Hadoop
  * HBase
  * Interactive Query
  * Kafka
  * Spark
  * Storm

  For the instructions on how to create an HDInsight cluster, see [Get started with Azure HDInsight](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md).  

* If using PowerShell, you'll need the [Az Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/). Ensure you have the latest version. If necessary, run `Update-Module -Name Az`.

* If wanting to use Azure CLI and you haven't yet installed it, see [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

> [!NOTE]  
> It is recommended to place both the HDInsight cluster and the Log Analytics workspace in the same region for better performance. Azure Monitor logs is not available in all Azure regions.

## Enable Azure Monitor using the portal

In this section, you configure an existing HDInsight Hadoop cluster to use an Azure Log Analytics workspace to monitor jobs, debug logs, and so on.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select your cluster. The cluster is opened in a new portal page.

1. From the left, under **Monitoring**, select **Azure Monitor**.

1. From the main view, under **Azure Monitor Integration**, select **Enable**.

1. From the **Select a workspace** drop-down list, select an existing Log Analytics workspace.

1. Select **Save**.  It takes a few moments to save the setting.

## Enable Azure Monitor using Azure PowerShell

You can enable Azure Monitor logs using the Azure PowerShell Az module [Enable-AzHDInsightMonitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.hdinsight/enable-azhdinsightmonitoring) cmdlet.

```powershell
# Enter user information
$resourceGroup = "<your-resource-group>"
$cluster = "<your-cluster>"
$LAW = "<your-Log-Analytics-workspace>"
# End of user input

# obtain workspace id for defined Log Analytics workspace
$WorkspaceId = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace `
                    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
                    -Name $LAW).CustomerId

# obtain primary key for defined Log Analytics workspace
$PrimaryKey = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace `
                    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
                    -Name $LAW | Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspaceSharedKeys).PrimarySharedKey

# Enables monitoring and relevant logs will be sent to the specified workspace.
Enable-AzHDInsightMonitoring `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
    -Name $cluster `
    -WorkspaceId $WorkspaceId `
    -PrimaryKey $PrimaryKey

# Gets the status of monitoring installation on the cluster.
Get-AzHDInsightMonitoring `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
    -Name $cluster
```

To disable, the use the [Disable-AzHDInsightMonitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.hdinsight/disable-azhdinsightmonitoring) cmdlet:

```powershell
Disable-AzHDInsightMonitoring -Name "<your-cluster>"
```

## Enable Azure Monitor using Azure CLI

You can enable Azure Monitor logs using the Azure CLI `[az hdinsight monitor enable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/hdinsight/monitor?view=azure-cli-latest#az-hdinsight-monitor-enable) command.

```azurecli
# set variables
export resourceGroup=RESOURCEGROUPNAME
export cluster=CLUSTERNAME
export LAW=LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACENAME

# Enable the Azure Monitor logs integration on an HDInsight cluster.
az hdinsight monitor enable --name $cluster --resource-group $resourceGroup --workspace $LAW

# Get the status of Azure Monitor logs integration on an HDInsight cluster.
az hdinsight monitor show --name $cluster --resource-group $resourceGroup
```

To disable, the use the [`az hdinsight monitor disable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/hdinsight/monitor?view=azure-cli-latest#az-hdinsight-monitor-disable) command.

```azurecli
az hdinsight monitor disable --name $cluster --resource-group $resourceGroup
```

## Install HDInsight cluster management solutions

HDInsight provides cluster-specific management solutions that you can add for Azure Monitor logs. [Management solutions](../log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions.md) add functionality to Azure Monitor logs, providing additional data and analysis tools. These solutions collect important performance metrics from your HDInsight clusters. And provide the tools to search the metrics. These solutions also provide visualizations and dashboards for most cluster types supported in HDInsight. By using the metrics that you collect with the solution, you can create custom monitoring rules and alerts.

Available HDInsight solutions:

* HDInsight Hadoop Monitoring
* HDInsight HBase Monitoring
* HDInsight Interactive Query Monitoring
* HDInsight Kafka Monitoring
* HDInsight Spark Monitoring
* HDInsight Storm Monitoring

For management solution instructions, see [Management solutions in Azure](../azure-monitor/insights/solutions.md#install-a-monitoring-solution). To experiment, install a HDInsight Hadoop Monitoring solution. When it's done, you see an **HDInsightHadoop** tile listed under **Summary**. Select the **HDInsightHadoop** tile. The HDInsightHadoop solution looks like:

![HDInsight monitoring solution view](media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-log-analytics-tutorial/hdinsight-oms-hdinsight-hadoop-monitoring-solution.png)

Because the cluster is a brand new cluster, the report doesn't show any activities.

## Configuring performance counters

Azure monitor supports collecting and analyzing performance metrics for the nodes in your cluster. For more information, see [Linux performance data sources in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-performance-counters#linux-performance-counters).

## Cluster auditing

HDInsight support cluster auditing with Azure Monitor logs, by importing the following types of logs:

* `log_gateway_audit_CL` - this table provides audit logs from cluster gateway nodes that show successful and failed login attempts.
* `log_auth_CL` - this table provides SSH logs with successful and failed login attempts.
* `log_ambari_audit_CL` - this table provides audit logs from Ambari.
* `log_ranger_audti_CL` - this table provides audit logs from Apache Ranger on ESP clusters.
