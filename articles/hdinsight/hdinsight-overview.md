# What is Azure HDInsight?

Azure HDInsight is a managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service in the cloud for enterprises. You can use open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, LLAP, Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, R, and more.

## What is HDInsight and the Hadoop technology stack?

Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of Hadoop components. Azure HDInsight makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. You can use the most popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, R, and more. With these frameworks, you can enable a broad range of scenarios such as extract, transform, and load (ETL), data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.

To see available Hadoop technology stack components on HDInsight, see [Components and versions available with HDInsight](./hdinsight-component-versioning.md). To read more about Hadoop in HDInsight, see the [Azure features page for HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/).

## What is big data?

Big data is collected in escalating volumes, at higher velocities, and in a greater variety of formats than ever before. It can be historical (meaning stored) or real time (meaning streamed from the source). See [Scenarios for using HDInsight](#scenarios-for-using-hdinsight) to learn about the most common use cases for big data.

## Why should I use Azure HDInsight?

## Scenarios for using HDInsight

Azure HDInsight can be used for a variety of scenarios in big data processing. It can be historical data (data that's already collected and stored) or real-time data (data that's directly streamed from the source). The scenarios for processing such data can be summarized in the following categories:

### Batch processing (ETL)

Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is a process where unstructured or structured data is extracted from heterogeneous data sources. It's then transformed into a structured format and loaded into a data store. You can use the transformed data for data science or data warehousing.

### Data warehousing

You can use HDInsight to perform interactive queries at petabyte scales over structured or unstructured data in any format. You can also build models connecting them to BI tools. For more information, [read this customer story](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/milliman).

### Internet of Things (IoT)

You can use HDInsight to process streaming data that's received in real time from different kinds of devices. For more information, [read this blog post from Azure that announces the public preview of Apache Kafka on HDInsight with Azure Managed disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-public-preview-of-apache-kafka-on-hdinsight-with-azure-managed-disks/).
