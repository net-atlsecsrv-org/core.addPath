### Behavior changes
#### ESP Spark cluster head node size change 
The minimum allowed head node size for ESP Spark cluster is changed to Standard_D13_V2. 
VMs with low cores and memory as head node could cause ESP cluster issues because of relatively low CPU and memory capacity. Starting from release, use SKUs higher than Standard_D13_V2 and Standard_E16_V3 as head node for ESP Spark clusters.
 
#### A minimum 4-core VM is required for Head Node 
A minimum 4-core VM is required for Head Node to ensure the high availability and reliability of HDInsight clusters. Starting from April 6 2020, customers can only choose 4-core or above VM as Head Node for the new HDInsight clusters. Existing clusters will continue to run as expected. 
 
#### Cluster worker node provisioning change
When 80% of the worker nodes are ready, the cluster enters **operational** stage. At this stage, customers can do all the data plane operations like running scripts and jobs. But customers can't do any control plane operation like scaling up/down. Only deletion is supported.
 
After the **operational** stage, the cluster waits another 60 minutes for the remaining 20% worker nodes. At the end of this 60 minutes, the cluster moves to the **running** stage, even if all of worker nodes are still not available. Once a cluster enters the **running** stage, you can use it as normal. Both control plan operations like scaling up/down, and data plan operations like running scripts and jobs are accepted. If some of the requested worker nodes are not available, the cluster will be marked as partial success. You are charged for the nodes that were deployed successfully. 
 
#### Create new service principal through HDInsight
Previously, with cluster creation, customers can create a new service principal to access the connected ADLS Gen 1 account in Azure portal. Starting June 15 2020, customers cannot create new service principal in HDInsight creation workflow, only existing service principal is supported. See [Create Service Principal and Certificates using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

#### Time out for script actions with cluster creation
HDInsight supports running script actions with cluster creation. From this release, all script actions with cluster creation must finish within **60 minutes**, or they time out. Script actions submitted to running clusters are not impacted. Learn more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux#script-action-in-the-cluster-creation-process).
 
### Upcoming changes
No upcoming breaking changes that you need to pay attention to.

## Release date: 01/09/2020

This release applies both for HDInsight 3.6 and 4.0. HDInsight release is made available to all regions over several days. The release date here indicates the first region release date. If you don't see below changes, wait for the release being live in your region in several days.

### New features
#### TLS 1.2 enforcement
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network. Learn more about [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0.2C_2.0_and_3.0). HDInsight uses TLS 1.2 on public HTTPs endpoints but TLS 1.1 is still supported for backward compatibility. 

With this release, customers can opt into TLS 1.2 only for all connections through the public cluster endpoint. To support this, the new property **minSupportedTlsVersion** is introduced and can be specified during cluster creation. If the property is not set, the cluster still supports TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, which is the same as today's behavior. Customers can set the value for this property to "1.2", which means that the cluster only supports TLS 1.2 and above. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security](./transport-layer-security.md).

#### Bring your own key for disk encryption
All managed disks in HDInsight are protected with Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE). Data on those disks is encrypted by Microsoft-managed keys by default. Starting from this release, you can Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) for disk encryption and manage it using Azure Key Vault. BYOK encryption is a one-step configuration during cluster creation with no additional cost. Just register HDInsight as a managed identity with Azure Key Vault and add the encryption key when you create your cluster. For more information, see [Customer-managed key disk encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/disk-encryption).

### New features

#### Service tags
Service tags simplify security for Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual networks by enabling you to easily restrict network access to the Azure services. You can use service tags in your network security group (NSG) rules to allow or deny traffic to a specific Azure service globally or per Azure region. Azure provides the maintenance of IP addresses underlying each tag. HDInsight service tags for network security groups (NSGs) are groups of IP addresses for health and management services. These groups help minimize complexity for security rule creation. HDInsight customers can enable service tag through Azure portal, PowerShell, and REST API. For more information, see [Network security group (NSG) service tags for Azure HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-service-tags).

#### Custom Ambari DB
HDInsight now allows you to use your own SQL DB for Apache Ambari. You can configure this custom Ambari DB from the Azure portal or through Resource Manager template.  This feature allows you to choose the right SQL DB for your processing and capacity needs. You can also upgrade easily to match business growth requirements. For more information, see [Set up HDInsight clusters with a custom Ambari DB](hdinsight-custom-ambari-db.md).

#### Mahout

In HDP-2.3.x and 2.4.x, instead of shipping a specific Apache release of Mahout, we synchronized to a particular revision point on Apache Mahout trunk. This revision point is after the 0.9.0 release, but before the 0.10.0 release. This provides a large number of bug fixes and functional enhancements over the 0.9.0 release, but provides a stable release of the Mahout functionality before the complete conversion to new Spark-based Mahout in 0.10.0.

The revision point chosen for Mahout in HDP 2.3.x and 2.4.x is from the "mahout-0.10.x" branch of Apache Mahout, as of 19 December 2014, revision 0f037cb03e77c096 in GitHub.

In HDP-2.5.x and 2.6.x, we removed the "commons-httpclient" library from Mahout because we view it as an obsolete library with possible security issues, and upgraded the Hadoop-Client in Mahout to version 2.7.3, the same version used in HDP-2.5. As a result:

-   Previously compiled Mahout jobs will need to be recompiled in the HDP-2.5 or 2.6 environment.

-   There is a small possibility that some Mahout jobs may encounter "ClassNotFoundException" or "could not load class" errors related to "org.apache.commons.httpclient", "net.java.dev.jets3t", or related class name prefixes. If these errors happen, you may consider whether to manually install the needed jars in your classpath for the job, if the risk of security issues in the obsolete library is acceptable in your environment.

-   There is an even smaller possibility that some Mahout jobs may encounter crashes in Mahout's hbase-client code calls to the hadoop-common libraries, due to binary compatibility problems. Regrettably, there is no way to resolve this issue except revert to the HDP-2.4.2 version of Mahout, which may have security issues. Again, this should be very unusual, and is unlikely to occur in any given Mahout job suite.

#### Oozie

### Fixed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

This section covers all Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) that are addressed in this release.

#### **​CVE-2017-7676**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger policy evaluation ignores characters after ‘\*’ wildcard character |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Critical                                                                           |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks                                                                          |
| **Versions Affected:** HDInsight 3.6 versions including Apache Ranger versions 0.5.x/0.6.x/0.7.0     |
| **Users affected:** Environments that use Ranger policies with characters after ‘\*’ wildcard character – like my\*test, test\*.txt |
| **Impact:** Policy resource matcher ignores characters after ‘\*’ wildcard character, which can result in unintended behavior.      |
| **Fix detail:** Ranger policy resource matcher was updated to correctly handle wildcard matches.           |
| **Recommended Action:** Upgrade to HDI 3.6 (with Apache Ranger 0.7.1+).                                |

### **​CVE-2017-7677**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger Hive Authorizer should check for RWX permission when external location is specified |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Critical                                                                           |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks                                                                          |
| **Versions Affected:** HDInsight 3.6 versions including Apache Ranger versions 0.5.x/0.6.x/0.7.0 |
| **Users affected:** Environments that use external location for hive tables |
| **Impact:** In environments that use external location for hive tables, Apache Ranger Hive Authorizer should check for RWX permission for the external location specified for create table. |
| **Fix detail:** Ranger Hive Authorizer was updated to correctly handle permission check with external location. |
| **Recommended Action:** Users should upgrade to HDI 3.6 (with Apache Ranger 0.7.1+). |

#### **​CVE-2017-9799**

| **Summary:** Potential execution of code as the wrong user in Apache Storm |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Severity:** Important |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks |
| **Versions Affected:** HDP 2.4.0, HDP-2.5.0, HDP-2.6.0 |
| **Users affected:** Users who use Storm in secure mode and are using blobstore to distribute topology based artifacts or using the blobstore to distribute any topology resources. |
| **Impact:** Under some situations and configurations of storm it is theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case, this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised. This vulnerability only applies to Apache Storm installations with security enabled. |
| **Mitigation:** Upgrade to HDP-2.6.2.1 as there are currently no workarounds.  |

#### **​CVE-2016-4970**

| **Summary:** handler/ssl/OpenSslEngine.java in Netty 4.0.x before 4.0.37.Final and 4.1.x before 4.1.1.Final allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Moderate  |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks  |
| **Versions Affected:** HDP 2.x.x since 2.3.x  |
| **Users Affected:** All users that use HDFS. |
| **Impact:** Impact is low as Hortonworks does not use OpenSslEngine.java directly in Hadoop codebase.     |
| **Recommended Action:** Upgrade to HDP 2.6.3.   |

#### **​CVE-2016-8746**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger path matching issue in policy evaluation                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Normal                                                                                                                   |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks                                                                                                                |
| **Versions Affected:** All HDP 2.5 versions including Apache Ranger versions 0.6.0/0.6.1/0.6.2                                         |
| **Users affected:** All users of the ranger policy admin tool.                                                                         |
| **Impact:** Ranger policy engine incorrectly matches paths in certain conditions when a policy contains wildcards and recursive flags. |
| **Fix detail:** Fixed policy evaluation logic                                                                                          |
| **Recommended Action:** Users should upgrade to HDP 2.5.4+ (with Apache Ranger 0.6.3+) or HDP 2.6+ (with Apache Ranger 0.7.0+)         |

#### **​CVE-2016-8751**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger stored cross site scripting issue  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Normal |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks |

|**Spark 2.3** |**N/A** |**Changes as documented in the Apache Spark release notes** |- There's a "Deprecation" document and a "Change of behavior" guide, https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-3-0.html#deprecations<br /><br />- For SQL part, there's another detailed "Migration" guide (from 2.2 to 2.3), https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#upgrading-from-spark-sql-22-to-23|
|Spark |[**HIVE-12505**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12505) |Spark job completes successfully but there is an HDFS disk quota full error |**Scenario:** Running **insert overwrite** when a quota is set on the Trash folder of the user who runs the command.<br /><br />**Previous Behavior:** The job succeeds even though it fails to move the data to the Trash. The result can wrongly contain some of the data previously present in the table.<br /><br />**New Behavior:** When the move to the Trash folder fails, the files are permanently deleted.|
|**Kafka 1.0**|**N/A**|**Changes as documented in the Apache Spark release notes** |https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation.html#upgrade_100_notable|
|**Hive/ Ranger** | |Additional ranger hive policies required for INSERT OVERWRITE |**Scenario:** Additional ranger hive policies required for **INSERT OVERWRITE**<br /><br />**Previous behavior:** Hive **INSERT OVERWRITE** queries succeed as usual.<br /><br />**New behavior:** Hive **INSERT OVERWRITE** queries are unexpectedly failing after upgrading to HDP-2.6.x with the error:<br /><br />Error while compiling statement: FAILED: HiveAccessControlException Permission denied: user jdoe does not have WRITE privilege on /tmp/\*(state=42000,code=40000)<br /><br />As of HDP-2.6.0, Hive **INSERT OVERWRITE** queries require a Ranger URI policy to allow write operations, even if the user has write privilege granted through HDFS policy.<br /><br />**Workaround/Expected Customer Action:**<br /><br />1. Create a new policy under the Hive repository.<br />2. In the dropdown where you see Database, select URI.<br />3. Update the path (Example: /tmp/*)<br />4. Add the users and group and save.<br />5. Retry the insert query.|

|**Zeppelin**|[**ZEPPELIN-3271**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3271)|Option for disabling scheduler |**Component Affected:** Zeppelin-Server<br /><br />**Previous Behavior:** In previous releases of Zeppelin, there was no option for disabling scheduler.<br /><br />**New Behavior:** By default, users will no longer see scheduler, as it is disabled by default.<br /><br />**Workaround/Expected Customer Action:** If you want to enable scheduler, you will need to add azeppelin.notebook.cron.enable with value of true under custom zeppelin site in Zeppelin settings from Ambari.|

### Known issues

- **HDInsight integration with ADLS Gen 2** 
  There are two issues on HDInsight ESP clusters using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 with user directories and permissions:
   
  1. Home directories for users are not getting created on Head Node 1. As a workaround, create the directories manually and change ownership to the respective user’s UPN.
   
  2. Permissions on /hdp directory is currently not set to 751. This needs to be set to 
     ```bash
     chmod 751 /hdp 
     chmod –R 755 /hdp/apps
     ```

- **Spark 2.3**

  -   \[[*SPARK-23523*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23523)\]\[SQL\] Incorrect result caused by the rule OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery

  -   \[[*SPARK-23406*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23406)\] Bugs in stream-stream self-joins

  -   Spark sample notebooks aren't available when Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2) is default storage of the cluster.

- **Enterprise Security Package**

  - Spark Thrift Server doesn't accept connections from ODBC clients.
    Workaround steps:
    1. Wait for about 15 minutes after cluster creation.
    2. Check ranger UI for existence of hivesampletable_policy.
    3. Restart Spark service.
       STS connection should work now.

- **Workaround for Ranger service check failure**

  -   [RANGER-1607](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-1607): Workaround for Ranger service check failure while upgrading to HDP 2.6.2 from previous HDP versions.

      > [!NOTE]  
      > Only when Ranger is SSL enabled. 
     
  This issue arises when attempting to upgrade to HDP-2.6.1 from previous HDP versions through Ambari. Ambari uses a curl call to do a service check to Ranger service in Ambari. If the JDK version used by Ambari is JDK-1.7, the curl call will fail with the below error:
    
  `curl: (35) error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure`
    
  The reason for this error is the tomcat version used in Ranger is Tomcat-7.0.7\*. Using JDK-1.7 conflicts with default ciphers provided in Tomcat-7.0.7\*.
    
  You can resolve this issue in two ways:
    
  -   Update the JDK used in Ambari from JDK-1.7 to JDK-1.8 (see the section [Change the JDK Version](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.2.0.0/bk_ambari_reference_guide/content/ch_changing_the_jdk_version_on_an_existing_cluster.html) in the Ambari Reference Guide).
    
  -   If you want to continue supporting a JDK-1.7 environment:
    
      1.  Add the property ranger.tomcat.ciphers in the ranger-admin-site section in your Ambari Ranger configuration with the below value:
            
          SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_MD5, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA, TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA
        
      2.  If your environment is configured for Ranger-KMS, add the property ranger.tomcat.ciphers in theranger-kms-site section in your Ambari Ranger configuration with the below value:
            
          SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_MD5, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA, TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA
    
  >[!NOTE]  
  >The noted values are working examples and may not be indicative of your environment. Ensure that the way you set these properties matches how your environment is configured.   

- **RangerUI: Escape of policy condition text entered in the policy form**
    
  **Component Affected:** Ranger
    
  **Description of Problem**
    
  If a user wants to create policy with custom policy conditions and the expression or text contains special characters, then policy enforcement won't work. Special characters are converted into ASCII before saving the policy into the database.
    
  **Special Characters:** & &lt; &gt; " \` '
    
  For example, the condition tags.attributes\['type'\]='abc' would get converted to the following once the policy is saved.
    
  tags.attds\[&\#x27;dsds&\#x27;\]=&\#x27;cssdfs&\#x27;
    
  You can see the policy condition with these characters by opening the policy in edit mode.
    
  **Workaround**
    
  - **Option \#1: Create/Update policy via Ranger Rest API**
        
      REST URL: http://&lt;host&gt;:6080/service/plugins/policies
        
      **Creating policy with policy condition:**
        
      The following example will create policy with tags as \`tags-test\` and assign it to \`public\` group with policy condition astags.attr\['type'\]=='abc' by selecting all hive component permissions like select, update, create, drop, alter, index, lock, all.
        
      **Example:**
        
      ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:6080/service/plugins/policies -u admin:admin -d '{"policyType":"0","name":"P100","isEnabled":true,"isAuditEnabled":true,"description":"","resources":{"tag":{"values":["tags-test"],"isRecursive":"","isExcludes":false}},"policyItems":[{"groups":["public"],"conditions":[{"type":"accessed-after-expiry","values":[]},{"type":"tag-expression","values":["tags.attr['type']=='abc'"]}],"accesses":[{"type":"hive:select","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:update","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:create","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:drop","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:alter","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:index","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:lock","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:all","isAllowed":true}]}],"denyPolicyItems":[],"allowExceptions":[],"denyExceptions":[],"service":"tagdev"}'
      ```
        
      **Update existing policy with policy condition:**
        
      The following example will update policy with tags as \`tags-test\` and assign it to \`public\` group with policy condition astags.attr\['type'\]=='abc' by selecting all hive component permissions like select, update, create, drop, alter, index, lock, all.
        
      REST URL: http://&lt;host-name&gt;:6080/service/plugins/policies/&lt;policy-id&gt;
        
      **Example:**
        
      ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:6080/service/plugins/policies/18 -u admin:admin -d '{"id":18,"guid":"ea78a5ed-07a5-447a-978d-e636b0490a54","isEnabled":true,"createdBy":"Admin","updatedBy":"Admin","createTime":1490802077000,"updateTime":1490802077000,"version":1,"service":"tagdev","name":"P0101","policyType":0,"description":"","resourceSignature":"e5fdb911a25aa7f77af5a9546938d9ed","isAuditEnabled":true,"resources":{"tag":{"values":["tags"],"isExcludes":false,"isRecursive":false}},"policyItems":[{"accesses":[{"type":"hive:select","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:update","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:create","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:drop","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:alter","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:index","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:lock","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:all","isAllowed":true}],"users":[],"groups":["public"],"conditions":[{"type":"ip-range","values":["tags.attributes['type']=abc"]}],"delegateAdmin":false}],"denyPolicyItems":[],"allowExceptions":[],"denyExceptions":[],"dataMaskPolicyItems":[],"rowFilterPolicyItems":[]}'
      ```
        
  - **Option \#2: Apply JavaScript changes**
        
      Steps to update JS file:
        
      1.  Find out PermissionList.js file under /usr/hdp/current/ranger-admin
        
      2.  Find out definition of renderPolicyCondtion function (line no:404).
        
      3.  Remove following line from that function i.e under display function(line no:434)
            
          val = \_.escape(val);//Line No:460
            
          After removing the above line, the Ranger UI will allow you to create policies with policy condition that can contain special characters and policy evaluation will be successful for the same policy.

**HDInsight Integration with ADLS Gen 2: User directories and permissions issue with ESP clusters**
    1.	Home directories for users are not getting created on Head Node 1. Workaround is to create these manually and change ownership  to the respective user’s UPN.
    2.	Permissions on /hdp is currently not set to 751. This needs to be set to 
    a.	chmod 751 /hdp 
    b.	chmod –R 755 /hdp/apps

### Deprecation

-   **OMS Portal:** We have removed the link from HDInsight resource page that was pointing to OMS portal. Azure Monitor logs initially used its own portal called the OMS portal to manage its configuration and analyze collected data. All functionality from this portal has been moved to the Azure portal where it will continue to be developed. HDInsight has deprecated the support for OMS portal. Customers will use HDInsight Azure Monitor logs integration in Azure portal.

-   **Spark 2.3**

    -   <https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-3-0.html#deprecations>

### ​Upgrading

All of these features are available in HDInsight 3.6. To get the latest version of Spark, Kafka and R Server (Machine Learning Services), please choose the Spark, Kafka, ML Services version when you [create a HDInsight 3.6 cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters). To get support for ADLS, you can choose the ADLS storage type as an option. Existing clusters won't be upgraded to these versions automatically.

All new clusters created after June 2018 will automatically get the 1000+ bug fixes across all the open-source projects. Please follow [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-upgrade-cluster) guide for best practices around upgrading to a newer HDInsight version.
