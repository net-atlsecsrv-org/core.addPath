# Tutorial: Use R in a Spark compute context in Azure HDInsight

This tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to using the R functions in Apache Spark that run on an Azure HDInsight Machine Learning services cluster.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download the sample data to local storage
> * Copy the data to default storage
> * Set up a dataset
> * Create data sources
> * Create a compute context for Spark
> * Fit a linear model
> * Use composite XDF files
> * Convert XDF to CSV

## Prerequisites

* An Azure HDInsight Machine Learning services cluster. Go to [Create Apache Hadoop clusters by using the Azure portal](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md) and, for **Cluster type**, select **ML Services**.

## Connect to RStudio Server

RStudio Server runs on the clusterâ€™s edge node. Go to the following site (where *CLUSTERNAME* in the URL is the name of the HDInsight Machine Learning services cluster you created):

```
https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/rstudio/
```

The first time you sign in, you authenticate twice. At the first authentication prompt, provide the cluster admin username and password (the default is *admin*). At the second authentication prompt, provide the SSH username and password (the default is *sshuser*). Subsequent sign-ins require only the SSH credentials.

## Download the sample data to local storage

The *Airline 2012 On-Time Data Set* consists of 12 comma-separated files that contain flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the US for the year 2012. This dataset is large, with over 6 million observations.

1. Initialize a few environment variables. In the RStudio Server console, enter the following code:

    ```R
    bigDataDirRoot <- "/tutorial/data" # root directory on cluster default storage
    localDir <- "/tmp/AirOnTimeCSV2012" # directory on edge node
    remoteDir <- "https://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets/AirOnTimeCSV2012" # location of data
    ```

1. In the right pane, select the **Environment** tab. The variables are displayed under **Values**.

    ![RStudio](./media/ml-services-tutorial-spark-compute/rstudio.png)

1.  Create a local directory, and download the sample data. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    # Create local directory
    dir.create(localDir)
    
    # Download data to the tmp folder(local)
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201201.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201201.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201202.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201202.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201203.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201203.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201204.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201204.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201205.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201205.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201206.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201206.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201207.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201207.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201208.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201208.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201209.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201209.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201210.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201210.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201211.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201211.csv"))
    download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201212.csv"), file.path(localDir, "airOT201212.csv"))
    ```

    The download should be complete in about 9.5 minutes.

## Copy the data to default storage

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) location is specified with the `airDataDir` variable. In RStudio, enter the following code:

```R
# Set directory in bigDataDirRoot to load the data into
airDataDir <- file.path(bigDataDirRoot,"AirOnTimeCSV2012")

# Create directory (default storage)
rxHadoopMakeDir(airDataDir)

# Copy data from local storage to default storage
rxHadoopCopyFromLocal(localDir, bigDataDirRoot)
    
# Optional. Verify files
rxHadoopListFiles(airDataDir)
```

The step should be complete in about 10 seconds.

## Set up a dataset

1. Create a file system object that uses the default values. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    # Define the HDFS (WASB) file system
    hdfsFS <- RxHdfsFileSystem()
    ```

1. Because the original CSV files have rather unwieldy variable names, you supply a *colInfo* list to make them more manageable. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    airlineColInfo <- list(
         MONTH = list(newName = "Month", type = "integer"),
        DAY_OF_WEEK = list(newName = "DayOfWeek", type = "factor",
            levels = as.character(1:7),
            newLevels = c("Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat",
                          "Sun")),
        UNIQUE_CARRIER = list(newName = "UniqueCarrier", type =
                                "factor"),
        ORIGIN = list(newName = "Origin", type = "factor"),
        DEST = list(newName = "Dest", type = "factor"),
        CRS_DEP_TIME = list(newName = "CRSDepTime", type = "integer"),
        DEP_TIME = list(newName = "DepTime", type = "integer"),
        DEP_DELAY = list(newName = "DepDelay", type = "integer"),
        DEP_DELAY_NEW = list(newName = "DepDelayMinutes", type =
                             "integer"),
        DEP_DEL15 = list(newName = "DepDel15", type = "logical"),
        DEP_DELAY_GROUP = list(newName = "DepDelayGroups", type =
                               "factor",
           levels = as.character(-2:12),
           newLevels = c("< -15", "-15 to -1","0 to 14", "15 to 29",
                         "30 to 44", "45 to 59", "60 to 74",
                         "75 to 89", "90 to 104", "105 to 119",
                         "120 to 134", "135 to 149", "150 to 164",
                         "165 to 179", ">= 180")),
        ARR_DELAY = list(newName = "ArrDelay", type = "integer"),
        ARR_DELAY_NEW = list(newName = "ArrDelayMinutes", type =
                             "integer"),  
        ARR_DEL15 = list(newName = "ArrDel15", type = "logical"),
        AIR_TIME = list(newName = "AirTime", type =  "integer"),
        DISTANCE = list(newName = "Distance", type = "integer"),
        DISTANCE_GROUP = list(newName = "DistanceGroup", type =
                             "factor",
         levels = as.character(1:11),
         newLevels = c("< 250", "250-499", "500-749", "750-999",
             "1000-1249", "1250-1499", "1500-1749", "1750-1999",
             "2000-2249", "2250-2499", ">= 2500")))
    
    varNames <- names(airlineColInfo)
    ```

## Create data sources

In a Spark compute context, you can create data sources by using the following functions:

|Function | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|`RxTextData` | A comma-delimited text data source. |
|`RxXdfData` | Data in the XDF data file format. In RevoScaleR, the XDF file format is modified for Hadoop to store data in a composite set of files rather than a single file. |
|`RxHiveData` | Generates a Hive Data Source object.|
|`RxParquetData` | Generates a Parquet Data Source object.|
|`RxOrcData` | Generates an Orc Data Source object.|

Create an [RxTextData](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxtextdata) object by using the files you copied to HDFS. In RStudio, enter the following code:

```R
airDS <- RxTextData( airDataDir,
                        colInfo = airlineColInfo,
                        varsToKeep = varNames,
                        fileSystem = hdfsFS ) 
```

## Create a compute context for Spark

To load data and run analyses on worker nodes, you set the compute context in your script to [RxSpark](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxspark). In this context, R functions automatically distribute the workload across all the worker nodes, with no built-in requirement for managing jobs or the queue. The Spark compute context is established through `RxSpark` or `rxSparkConnect()` to create the Spark compute context, and it uses `rxSparkDisconnect()` to return to a local compute context. In RStudio, enter the following code:

```R
# Define the Spark compute context
mySparkCluster <- RxSpark()

# Set the compute context
rxSetComputeContext(mySparkCluster)
```

## Fit a linear model

1. Use the [rxLinMod](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxlinmod) function to fit a linear model using your `airDS` data source. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    system.time(
         delayArr <- rxLinMod(ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek, data = airDS,
              cube = TRUE)
    )
    ```
    
    This step should be complete in 2 to 3 minutes.

1. View the results. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    summary(delayArr)
    ```

    You should see the following results:

    ```output
    Call:
    rxLinMod(formula = ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek, data = airDS, cube = TRUE)
    
    Cube Linear Regression Results for: ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek
    Data: airDataXdf (RxXdfData Data Source)

    Residual standard error: 35.48 on 6005374 degrees of freedom
    Multiple R-squared: 0.001827 (as if intercept included)
    Adjusted R-squared: 0.001826 
    F-statistic:  1832 on 6 and 6005374 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16 
    Condition number: 1 
    ```

    The results indicate that you've processed all the data, 6 million observations, using all the CSV files in the specified directory. Because you specified `cube = TRUE`, you have an estimated coefficient for each day of the week (and not the intercept).

## Use composite XDF files

As you've seen, you can analyze CSV files directly with R on Hadoop. But you can do the analysis more quickly if you store the data in a more efficient format. The R XDF file format is efficient, but it's modified somewhat for HDFS so that individual files remain within a single HDFS block. (The HDFS block size varies from installation to installation but is typically either 64 MB or 128 MB.) 

When you use [rxImport](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rximport) on Hadoop to create a set of composite XDF files, you specify an `RxTextData` data source such as `AirDS` as the inData and an `RxXdfData` data source with fileSystem set to an HDFS file system as the outFile argument. You can then use the `RxXdfData` object as the data argument in subsequent R analyses.

1. Define an `RxXdfData` object. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    airDataXdfDir <- file.path(bigDataDirRoot,"AirOnTimeXDF2012")
    
    airDataXdf <- RxXdfData( airDataXdfDir,
                            fileSystem = hdfsFS )
    ```

1. Set a block size of 250000 rows and specify that we read all the data. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    blockSize <- 250000
    numRowsToRead = -1
    ```

1. Import the data using `rxImport`. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    rxImport(inData = airDS,
             outFile = airDataXdf,
             rowsPerRead = blockSize,
             overwrite = TRUE,
             numRows = numRowsToRead )
    ```
    
    This step should be complete in a few minutes.

1. Re-estimate the same linear model, using the new, faster data source. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    system.time(
         delayArr <- rxLinMod(ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek, data = airDataXdf,
              cube = TRUE)
    )
    ```
    
    The step should be complete in less than a minute.

1. View the results. The results should be the same as from the CSV files. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    summary(delayArr)
    ```

## Convert XDF to CSV

### In a Spark context

If you converted your CSV files to XDF file format for greater efficiency while running the analyses, but now want to convert your data back to CSV, you can do so by using [rxDataStep](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxdatastep).

To create a folder of CSV files, first create an `RxTextData` object by using a directory name as the file argument. This object represents the folder in which to create the CSV files. This directory is created when you run the `rxDataStep`. Then, point to this `RxTextData` object in the `outFile` argument of the `rxDataStep`. Each CSV that's created is named based on the directory name and followed by a number.

Suppose that you want to write out a folder of CSV files in HDFS from your `airDataXdf` composite XDF after you perform the logistic regression and prediction, so that the new CSV files contain the predicted values and residuals. In RStudio, enter the following code:

```R
airDataCsvDir <- file.path(bigDataDirRoot,"AirDataCSV2012")
airDataCsvDS <- RxTextData(airDataCsvDir,fileSystem=hdfsFS)
rxDataStep(inData=airDataXdf, outFile=airDataCsvDS)
```

This step should be complete in about 2.5 minutes.

The `rxDataStep` wrote out one CSV file for every XDFD file in the input composite XDF file. This is the default behavior for writing CSV files from composite XDF files to HDFS when the compute context is set to `RxSpark`.

### In a local context

Alternatively, when you're done performing your analyses, you could switch your compute context back to `local` to take advantage of two arguments within `RxTextData` that give you slightly more control when you write out CSV files to HDFS: `createFileSet` and `rowsPerOutFile`. When you set `createFileSet` to `TRUE`, a folder of CSV files is written to the directory that you specify. When you set `createFileSet` to `FALSE`, a single CSV file is written. You can set the second argument, `rowsPerOutFile`, to an integer to indicate how many rows to write to each CSV file when `createFileSet` is `TRUE`.

In RStudio, enter the following code:

```R
rxSetComputeContext("local")
airDataCsvRowsDir <- file.path(bigDataDirRoot,"AirDataCSVRows2012")
airDataCsvRowsDS <- RxTextData(airDataCsvRowsDir, fileSystem=hdfsFS, createFileSet=TRUE, rowsPerOutFile=1000000)
rxDataStep(inData=airDataXdf, outFile=airDataCsvRowsDS)
```

This step should be complete in about 10 minutes.

When you use an `RxSpark` compute context, `createFileSet` defaults to `TRUE` and `rowsPerOutFile` has no effect. Therefore, if you want to create a single CSV or customize the number of rows per file, perform `rxDataStep` in a `local` compute context (the data can still be in HDFS).

## Final steps

1. Clean up the data. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    rxHadoopRemoveDir(airDataDir)
    rxHadoopRemoveDir(airDataXdfDir)
    rxHadoopRemoveDir(airDataCsvDir)
    rxHadoopRemoveDir(airDataCsvRowsDir)
    rxHadoopRemoveDir(bigDataDirRoot)
    ```

1. Stop the remote Spark application. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    rxStopEngine(mySparkCluster)
    ```

1. Quit the R session. In RStudio, enter the following code:

    ```R
    quit()
    ```

## Clean up resources

After you complete the tutorial, you might want to delete the cluster. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it's not in use. You're also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it's not in use. Because the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they're not in use.

To delete a cluster, see [Delete an HDInsight cluster by using your browser, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI](../hdinsight-delete-cluster.md).

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to use R functions in Apache Spark that are running on an HDInsight Machine Learning services cluster. For more information, see the following articles:
