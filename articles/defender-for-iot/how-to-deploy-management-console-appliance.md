# Deploy the management console
This article describes how to deploy the Azure Defender for IoT on-premises management console.

## The on-premises management console

The on-premises management console provides a consolidated view of all network assets and delivers a real-time view of key IoT and OT risk indicators and alerts across all your facilities. Tightly integrated with your SOC workflows and run books, it enables easy prioritization of mitigation activities and cross-site correlation of threats.

- Holistic - reduce complexity with a single unified platform for asset management, risk and vulnerability management, as well as threat monitoring with incident response.

- Aggregation and correlation – display, aggregate and analyze data and alerts collected from all sites.

- Control all sensors – configure and monitor all sensors from a single location.
