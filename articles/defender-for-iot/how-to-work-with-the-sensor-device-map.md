# Investigate sensor detections in the Device Map

The Device Map provides a graphical representation of network devices detected. Use the map to:

  - Retrieve, analyze, and manage device information.

  - Analyze network slices, for example-specific groups of interest or Purdue layers.

  - Generate reports, for example export device details and summaries.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/device-map-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the device map.":::

To access the map:

  - Select **Device Map** from the console main screen.

## Map search and layout tools

The following tools are used to working in the map.

Your user role determines which tools are available in the Device Map window. See [Create and manage users](how-to-create-and-manage-users.md) for details about user roles.

## View OT elements only

By default, IT devices are automatically aggregated by subnet, so that the map view is focused on OT and ICS networks. The presentation of the IT network elements is collapsed to a minimum, which reduces the total number of the devices presented on the map and provides a clear picture of the OT and ICS network elements.

Each subnet is presented as a single entity on the device map, including an interactive collapsing and expanding capability to look at the details of an IT subnet and back.

The figure below shows a collapsed IT subnet with 27 IT network elements.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/shrunk-it-subnet-v2.png" alt-text="collapsed IT subnet with 27 IT network elements":::

To enable the IT networks collapsing capability:

- In the **System Settings** window, ensure that the Toggle IT Networks Grouping capability is enabled.

  - Corrupted programming automation: Programming is erroneously carried out because of automation failure.

  - Hacked systems: Unauthorized users logged into a programming device.

You can display a programmed device and scroll through various programming changes carried out on it by other devices.

View code that was added, changed, removed, or reloaded by the programming device. Search for programming changes based on file types, dates, or times of interest.

### When to review programming activity 

You may need to review programming activity:

  - After viewing an alert regarding unauthorized programming

  - After a planned update to controllers

  - When a process or machine is not working correctly (to see who carried out the last update and when)

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/differences.png" alt-text="Programing Change Log":::

Other options let you:

  - Mark events of interest with a star.

  - Download a *.txt file with the current code.

### About authorized vs unauthorized programming events 

Unauthorized programming events are carried out by devices that have not been learned or manually defined as programming devices. Authorized programming events are carried out by devices that were resolved or manually defined as programming devices.

The Programming Analysis window displays both authorized and unauthorized programming events.

### Accessing programming details and changes

Access the Programming Analysis window from the:

- [Event Timeline](#event-timeline)

- [Unauthorized Programming Alerts](#unauthorized-programming-alerts)

## Manage device information from the map

The sensor does not update or impact devices directly on the network. Changes made here only impact how analyzes the device.

### Delete devices

You may want to delete a device if the information learned is not relevant. For example,

  - A partner contractor at an engineering workstation connects temporarily to perform configuration updates. After the task is completed, the device is removed.

  - Due to changes in the network, some devices are no longer connected.

If you do not delete the device, the sensor will continue monitoring it. After 60 days, a notification will appear, recommending that you delete.

You may receive an alert indicating that the device is unresponsive if another device tries to access it. In this case, your network may be misconfigured.

The device will be removed from the Device Map, Device Inventory, and Data Mining reports. Other information, for example: information stored in Widgets will be maintained.

The device must be inactive for at least 10 minutes to delete it.

To delete a device from the device map:

1. Select **Devices** on the side menu.

2. Right-click a device and select **Delete**.

### Merge devices

Under certain circumstances, you may need to merge devices. This may be required if the sensor discovered separate network entities that are associated with one unique device. For example,

  - A PLC with four network cards.

  - A Laptop with WIFI and physical card.
  
  - A Workstation with two, or more network cards.

When merging, you instruct the sensor to combine the device properties of two devices into one. When you do this, the Device Properties window and sensor reports will be updated with the new device property details.

For example, if you merge two devices, each with an IP address, both IP addresses will appear as separate interfaces in the Device Properties window. You can only merge authorized devices.

The event timeline presents the merge event.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/events-time.png" alt-text="The event timeline with merged events.":::

You cannot undo a device merge. If you mistakenly merged two devices, delete the device and wait for The sensor to rediscover both.

To merge devices:

1. Select two devices (shift-click), and then right-click one of them.

2. Select **Merge** to merge the devices. It can take up to 2 minutes complete the merge.

3. In the set merge device attributes dialog box, choose a device name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/name-the-device-v2.png" alt-text="attributes dialog box":::

4. Select **Save**.

### Authorize and unauthorize devices

During the Learning period, all the devices discovered in the network are identified as authorized devices. The **Authorized** label does not appear on these devices in the Device Map.

When a device is discovered after the Learning period, it appears as an unauthorized device. In addition to seeing unauthorized devices in the map, you can also see them in the Device Inventory.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/inventory-icon.png" alt-text="Device Inventory":::

**New device vs unauthorized**

New devices detected after the Learning period will appear with a `New` and `Unauthorized` label.

If you move a device on the map or manually change the device properties, the `New` label is removed from the device icon.

#### Unauthorized devices - attack vectors and risk assessment reports

Unauthorized devices are included in Risk Assessment reports and Attack Vectors reports.

- **Attack Vector Reports:** Devices marked as unauthorized are resolved in the Attack Vector as suspected rogue devices that might be a threat to the network.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/attack-vector-reports.png" alt-text="Vew your attack vector reports":::

- **Risk Assessment Reports:** Devices marked as unauthorized are:

  - Identified in Risk Assessment Reports

To authorize or unauthorize devices manually:

1. Right-click the device on the map and select **Unauthorize**

### Mark devices as important

You can mark significant network devices as important, for example business critical servers. These devices are marked with a star on the map. The star varies according to the map's zoom level.

:::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/star-one.png" border="false"::: :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/star-two.png" border="false"::: :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/star-3.png" border="false":::

### Important devices - attack vectors and risk assessment reports

Important devices are calculated when generating Risk Assessment reports and Attack Vectors reports.

  - Attack Vector reports devices marked as important are resolved in the Attack Vector as Attack Targets. 

  - Risk Assessment Reports: Devices marked as important are calculated when providing the security score in the Risk Assessment report.

## Generate Activity reports from the map

Generate an activity report for a selected device over the 1, 6, 12 or 24 hours. The following information is available:

  - Category: Basic detection information based on traffic scenarios.

  - Source and destination devices

  - Data: Additional information defected.

  - The time and date last seen.

You can save the report as a Microsoft Excel or Word file.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/historical-information.png" alt-text="Recent activity":::

To generate an activity report for a device:

1. Right-click a device from the Map.

2. Select an Activity Report.

## Generate Attack Vector reports from the map

Simulate an Attack Vector report to learn if a device on the map you select is a vulnerable attack target.

Attack Vector reports provide a graphical representation of a vulnerability chain of exploitable devices. These vulnerabilities can give an attacker access to key network devices. The Attack Vector simulator calculates attack vectors in real time and analyzes all attack vectors per a specific target.

To view a device in an Attack Vector reports:

1. Right-click a device from the map.

2. Select **Simulate Attack Vectors**. The Attack Vector dialog box opens with the device you select as the attack target.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/simulation.png" alt-text="Add attack vector simulation":::

3. Add the remaining parameters to the dialog box and select **Add Simulation**.

## Export device information from the map

Export the following device information from the Map.

  - Device details (Microsoft Excel)

  - A device summary (Microsoft Excel)

  - A word file with groups (Microsoft Word)

To export:

1. Select the Export icon from the Map.

1. Select an export option.
