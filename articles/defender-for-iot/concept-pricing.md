# Pricing and associated costs

This article explains Defender for IoT pricing model, summarizes all associated costs and explains how to manage them.

## Pricing

The Defender for IoT pricing model is comprised of two parts, and is billed once an IoT Hub is [enabled](quickstart-onboard-iot-hub.md) in Defender for IoT:

- Cost by device - built-in security capabilities based on analysis of IoT Hub logs.

- Cost by message - enhanced security capabilities based on security messages from IoT Edge or leaf devices.

For more information, see [Security Center pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/security-center/).

## Associated costs

Defender for IoT has associated costs, which are not part of the direct pricing:

- Log Analytics storage costs

You can reduce associated costs by opting out of certain solution features. Opt out by changing your settings.

To change your settings:

1. Open IoT Hub.

1. Under **Security**, click **Settings**.

1. Click **Data Collection**.

The following table provides a summary of associated costs and implications of each option.

| Option | Usage | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Log Analytics storage** |  |
| Device recommendation and alerts| Security recommendation and alerts generated by the service | Not optional |
| Raw security data| Raw security data from IoT devices, collected by security agents | Disable _store raw device security events_ |
|

>[!Important]
> Opting out has severe implications to Defender for IoT security feature availability.
