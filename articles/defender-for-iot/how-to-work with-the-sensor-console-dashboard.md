# The dashboard

The dashboard allows you to quickly view the security status of your network. It provides a high-level overview of threats to your whole system on a timeline along with information about related devices, including:

- Alerts at different severity levels:

- Critical

- Major

- Minor

- Warnings

- The two indicators in the center of the page show the Packets per Second (PPS), and Unacknowledged Alerts (UA). **PPS** is the number of packets acknowledged by the system per second. **UA** is the number of alerts that have not been acknowledged yet.

- List of unacknowledged alerts with their description.

- Timeline with the alert description.
