# Investigate all enterprise sensor detections in the device inventory

You can view device information from connected sensors by using the *device inventory* in the on-premises management console. This feature gives you a comprehensive view of all network information. Use import, export, and filtering tools to manage this information. The status information about the connected sensor versions also appears.

## Integrate data into the enterprise device inventory

Data integration capabilities let you enhance the data in the device inventory with information from other enterprise resources. These sources include CMDBs, DNS, firewalls, and Web APIs.

You can use this information to learn. For example:

- Device purchase dates and end-of-warranty dates

- Users responsible for each device

- Opened tickets for devices

- The last date when firmware was upgraded

- Devices allowed access to the internet

- Devices running active antivirus applications

- Users signed in to devices

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/asset-inventory-screen-with-items-highlighted-v2.png" alt-text="Data table on the device inventory screen.":::

You can integrate data by either:

- Adding it manually

- Running customized scripts that Defender for IoT provides

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/enterprise-data-integrator-graph.png" alt-text="Diagram of the enterprise data integrator.":::

You can work with Defender for IoT technical support to set up your system to receive Web API queries.

To add data manually:

1. On the side menu, select **Device Inventory** and then select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon.png" border="false":::.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/asset-inventory-settings-v2.png" alt-text="Edit your device's inventory settings.":::

2. In the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog box, select **ADD CUSTOM COLUMN**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/add-custom-column.png" alt-text="Add a custom column to your inventory.":::

3. In the **Add Custom Column** dialog box, add the new column name (up to 250 characters UTF), select **Manual**, and select **SAVE**. The new item appears in the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog box.

4. In the upper-right corner of the **Device Inventory** window, select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon-device-inventory.png" border="false"::: and select **Export All Device Inventory**. The CSV file is generated.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/sample-exported-csv-file.png" alt-text="The exported CSV file.":::

5. Manually add the information to the new column and save the file.

6. In the upper-right corner of the **Device Inventory** window, select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon-device-inventory.png" border="false":::, select **Import Manual Input Columns**, and browse to the CSV file. The new data appears in the **Device Inventory** table.

To integrate data from other enterprise entities:

1. In the upper-right corner of the **Device Inventory** window, select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon-device-inventory.png" border="false"::: and select **Export All Device Inventory**.

2. In the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog box, select **ADD CUSTOM COLUMN**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/add-custom-column.png" alt-text="Add a custom column to your inventory.":::

3. In the **Add Custom Column** dialog box, add the new column name (up to 250 characters UTF), and then select **Automatic**. The **UPLOAD SCRIPT** and **TEST SCRIPT** options appear.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/add-custom-column-automatic.png" alt-text="Automatically add custom columns.":::

4. Upload and test the script that you received from [Microsoft Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=82c88f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099).

## Retrieve information from the device inventory

You can retrieve an extensive range of device information detected by managed sensors and integrate that information with partner systems. For example, you can retrieve sensor, zone, site ID, IP address, MAC address, firmware, protocol, and vendor information. Filter information that you retrieve based on:

- Authorized and unauthorized devices.

- Devices associated with specific sites.

- Devices associated with specific zones.

- Devices associated with specific sensors.

Work with Defender for IoT API commands to retrieve and integrate this information. For more information, see [Defender for IoT API sensor and management console APIs](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis.md).

## Filter the device inventory

You can filter the device inventory to show columns of interest. For example, you can view PLC device information.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/asset-inventory-view-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the device inventory.":::

The filter is cleared when you leave the window.

To use the same filter multiple times, you can save a filter or a combination of filters that you need. You can open a left pane and view the filters that you've saved:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/view-your-asset-inventories-v2.png" alt-text="Device inventories screen.":::

To filter the device inventory:

1. In the column that you want to filter, select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/filter-a-column-icon.png" border="false":::.

2. In the **Filter** dialog box, select the filter type:

   - **Equals**: The exact value according to which you want to filter the column. For example, if you filter the protocol column according to **Equals** and `value=ICMP`, the column will present devices that use the ICMP protocol only.

   - **Contains**: The value that's contained among other values in the column. For example, if you filter the protocol column according to **Contains** and `value=ICMP`, the column will present devices that use the ICMP protocol as a part of the list of protocols that the device uses.

3. To organize the column information according to alphabetical order, select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/alphabetical-order-icon.png" border="false":::. Arrange the order by selecting the :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/alphabetical-a-z-order-icon.png" border="false"::: and :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/alphabetical-z-a-order-icon.png" border="false"::: arrows.

4. To save a new filter, define the filter and select **Save As**.

5. To change the filter definitions, change the definitions and select **Save Changes**.
