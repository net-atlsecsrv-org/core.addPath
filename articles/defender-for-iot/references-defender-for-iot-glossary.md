| **Access tokens** | Generate access tokens to access the Defender for IoT REST API. | **[API](#glossary-a)** |
| **Acknowledge alert event** | Instruct Defender for IoT to hide the alert once for the detected event. The alert will be triggered again if the event is detected again. | **[Alert](#glossary-a)<br /><br />[Learn alert event](#l)<br /><br />[Mute alert event](#m)** |
| **Alert** | A message that a Defender for IoT engine triggers regarding deviations from authorized network behavior, network anomalies, or suspicious network activity and traffic. | **[Forwarding rule](#f)<br /><br />[Exclusion rule](#e)<br /><br />[System notifications](#s)** |
| **Alert comment** | Comments that security analysts and administrators make in alert messages.
