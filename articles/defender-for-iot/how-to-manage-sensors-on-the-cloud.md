# Onboard and manage sensors in the Defender for IoT portal

This article describes how to onboard, view, and manage sensors in the Defender for IoT portal.

## Onboard sensors

You onboard a sensor by registering it with Azure Defender for IoT and downloading a sensor activation file.

### Register the sensor

To register:

1. Go to the **Welcome** page in the Defender for IoT portal.
1. Select **Onboard sensor**.
1. Create a sensor name. We recommend that you include the IP address of the sensor you installed as part of the name, or use an easily identifiable name. This will ensure easier tracking and consistent naming between the registration name in the Azure Defender for IoT portal and the IP of the deployed sensor displayed in the sensor console.
1. Associate the sensor with an Azure subscription.
1. Choose a sensor management mode by using the **Cloud connected** toggle. If the toggle is on, the sensor is cloud connected. If the toggle is off, the sensor is locally managed.

   - **Cloud-connected sensors**: Information that the sensor detects is displayed in the sensor console. Alert information is delivered through an IoT hub and can be shared with other Azure services, such as Azure Sentinel.

   - **Locally managed sensors**: Information that sensors detect is displayed in the sensor console. If you're working in an air-gapped network and want a unified view of all information detected by multiple locally managed sensors, work with the on-premises management console.

   For cloud-connected sensors, the name defined during onboarding is the name that appears in the sensor console. You can't change this name from the console directly. For locally managed sensors, the name applied during onboarding will be stored in Azure and can be updated in the sensor console.

1. Choose an IoT hub to serve as a gateway between this sensor and Azure Defender for IoT.
1. If the sensor is cloud connected, associate it with an IoT hub, and then define a site name and zone. You can also add descriptive tags. The site name, zone, and tags are descriptive entries on the [Sites and Sensors page](#view-onboarded-sensors).

### Download the sensor activation file

The sensor activation file contains instructions about the management mode of the sensor. You download a unique activation file for each sensor that you deploy. A user who signs in to the sensor console for the first time uploads the activation file to the sensor.

To download an activation file:

1. On the **Onboard Sensor** page, select **download activation file**.
1. Make the file accessible to the user who's signing in to the sensor console for the first time.

## View onboarded sensors

On the Defender for IoT portal, you can view basic information about onboarded sensors. 

1. Select **Sites and Sensors**.
1. On the **Sites and Sensors** page, use filter and search tools to find sensor information that you need.

The available information includes:

- How many sensors were onboarded
- The number of sensors that are cloud connected and locally managed
- The hub associated with an onboarded sensor
- Details added about a sensor, such as the name assigned to the sensor during onboarding, the zone associated with the sensor, or other descriptive information added with tags

## Manage onboarded sensors

You use the Defender for IoT portal for management tasks related to sensors.

### Export

To export onboarded sensor information, select the **Export** icon on the top of the **Sites and Sensors** page.

### Edit

Use the **Sites and Sensors** editing tools to add and edit the site name, zone, and tags.

### Delete

If you delete a cloud-connected sensor, information won't be sent to the IoT hub. Delete locally connected sensors when you're no longer working with them.

To delete a sensor:

1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) for the sensor you want to delete. 
1. Confirm the deletion.

### Reactivate

You might want to update the mode that your sensor is managed in. For example:

- **Work in cloud-connected mode instead of locally managed mode**: To do this, update the activation file for your locally connected sensor with an activation file for a cloud-connected sensor. After reactivation, sensor detections are displayed in both the sensor and the Defender for IoT portal. After the reactivation file is successfully uploaded, newly detected alert information is sent to Azure.

- **Work in locally connected mode instead of cloud-connected mode**: To do this, update the activation file for a cloud-connected sensor with an activation file for a locally managed sensor. After reactivation, sensor detection information is displayed only in the sensor.

- **Associate the sensor to a new IoT hub**:  To do this, re-register then sensor and upload a new activation file.

To reactivate a sensor:

1. Go to **Sites and Sensors** page on the Defender for IoT portal.

2. Select the sensor for which you want to upload a new activation file.

3. Delete the sensor.

4. Onboard the sensor again from the **Onboarding** page in the new mode or with a new IoT hub.

5. Download the activation file from the **Download Activation File** page.

6. Sign in to the Defender for IoT sensor console.

7. In the sensor console, select **System Settings** and then select **Reactivation**.

8. Select **Upload** and select the file you saved.

9. Select **Activate**.
