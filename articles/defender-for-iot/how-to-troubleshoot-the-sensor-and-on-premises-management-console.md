# Troubleshoot the sensor and on-premises management console

This article describes basic troubleshooting tools for the sensor and the on-premises management console. In addition to the items described here, you can check the health of your system in the following ways:

**Alerts**: An alert is created when the sensor interface that monitors the traffic is down. 

**SNMP**: Sensor health is monitored through SNMP. Azure Defender for IoT responds to SNMP queries sent from an authorized monitoring server. 

**System notifications**: When a management console controls the sensor, you can forward alerts about failed sensor backups and disconnected sensors.

## Sensor troubleshooting tools

### Investigate password failure at initial sign-in

When signing into a preconfigured Arrow sensor for the first time, you'll need to perform password recovery.

To recover your password:

1. On the Defender for IoT sign-in screen, select  **Password recovery**. The **Password recovery** screen opens.

1. Select either **CyberX** or **Support**, and copy the unique identifier.

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select **Sites and Sensors**.  

1. Select the **Recover on-premises management console password** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/password-recovery-images/recover-button.png" alt-text="Select the recover on-premises management button to download the recovery file.":::

1. Enter the unique identifier that you received on the **Password recovery** screen and select **Recover**. The `password_recovery.zip` file is downloaded.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Don't alter the password recovery file. It's a signed file and won't work if you tamper with it.

1. On the **Password recovery** screen, select **Upload**. **The Upload Password Recovery File** window will open.

1. Select **Browse** to locate your `password_recovery.zip` file, or drag the `password_recovery.zip` to the window.

1. Select **Next**, and your user, and system-generated password for your management console will then appear.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you sign in to a sensor or on-premise management console for the first time it will be linked to the subscription you connected it to. If you need to reset the password for the CyberX or Support user you will need to select that subscription. For more information on recovering a CyberX or Support user password, see [Resetting passwords](how-to-create-and-manage-users.md#resetting-passwords).

### Investigate a lack of traffic

An indicator appears at the top of the console when the sensor recognizes that there's no traffic on one of the configured ports. This indicator is visible to all users.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/no-traffic-detected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the alert that no traffic was detected.":::
 
When this message appears, you can investigate where there's no traffic. Make sure the span cable is connected and there was no change in the span architecture.  

For support and troubleshooting information, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=82c88f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099).

### Check system performance 

When a new sensor is deployed or, for example, the sensor is working slowly or not showing any alerts, you can check system performance.

To check system performance:

1. In the dashboard, make sure that `PPS > 0`.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/dashboard-view-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample dashboard."::: 

1. From the side menu, select **Devices**.

1. In the **Devices** window, make sure devices are being discovered.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/discovered-devices.png" alt-text="Ensure that devices are discovered.":::

1. From the side menu, select **Data Mining**.

1. In the **Data Mining** window, select **ALL** and generate a report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/new-report-generated.png" alt-text="Generate a new report by using data mining.":::

1. Make sure the report contains data.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/new-report-generated.png" alt-text="Ensure that the report contains data.":::

1. From the side menu, select **Trends & Statistics**.

1. In the **Trends & Statistics** window, select **Add Widget**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/add-widget.png" alt-text="Add a widget by selecting it.":::

1. Add a widget and make sure it shows data.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/widget-data.png" alt-text="Ensure that the widget is showing data.":::

1. From the side menu, select **Alerts**. The **Alerts** window appears.

1. Make sure the alerts were created.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/alerts-created.png" alt-text="Ensure that alerts were created.":::


### Investigate a lack of expected alerts

If the **Alerts** window doesn't show an alert that you expected, verify the following:

- Check if the same alert already appears in the **Alerts** window as a reaction to a different security instance. If yes, and this alert has not been handled yet, the sensor console does not show a new alert.

- Make sure you did not exclude this alert by using the **Alert Exclusion** rules in the management console. 

### Investigate widgets that show no data

When the widgets in the **Trends & Statistics** window show no data, do the following:

- [Check system performance](#check-system-performance).

- Make sure the time and region settings are properly configured and not set to a future time. 

### Investigate a device map that shows only broadcasting devices

When devices shown on the map appear not connected to each other, something might be wrong with the SPAN port configuration. That is, you might be seeing only broadcasting devices and no unicast traffic.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/broadcasting-devices.png" alt-text="View your broadcasting devices.":::

In such a case, validate that you only the broadcast traffic and then ask the network engineer to fix the SPAN port configuration so that you can see the unicast traffic as well.

To validate that you're seeing only the broadcast traffic:

- On the **Data Mining** screen, create a report by using the **All** option. Then see if only broadcast and multicast traffic (and no unicast traffic) appears in the report.

Or:

- Record a PCAP directly from the switch, or connect a laptop by using Wireshark.

### Connect the sensor to NTP

You can configure a standalone sensor and a management console, with the sensors related to it, to connect to NTP.

To connect a standalone sensor to NTP:

- [Contact the Support team for assistance](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportforbusiness/productselection?sapId=82c88f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099).

To connect a sensor controlled by the management console to NTP:

- The connection to NTP is configured on the management console. All the sensors that the management console controls get the NTP connection automatically.

### Investigate when devices aren't shown on the map, or you have multiple internet-related alerts

Sometimes ICS devices are configured with external IP addresses. These ICS devices are not shown on the map. Instead of the devices, an internet cloud appears on the map. The IP addresses of these devices are included in the cloud image.

Another indication of the same problem is when multiple internet-related alerts appear.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/alert-problems.png" alt-text="Multiple internet-related alerts.":::

To fix the configuration:

1. Right-click the cloud icon on the device map and select **Export IP Addresses**. Copy the public ranges that are private, and add them to the subnet list. For more information, see [Configure subnets](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md#configure-subnets).

1. Generate a new data-mining report for internet connections.

1. In the data-mining report, select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/administrator-mode.png" border="false"::: to enter the administrator mode and delete the IP addresses of your ICS devices.

### Tweak the sensor's Quality of Service (QoS)

To save your network resources, you can limit the interface bandwidth that the sensor uses for day-to-day procedures.

To limit the interface bandwidth, use the `cyberx-xsense-limit-interface` CLI tool that needs to be run with sudo permissions. The tool gets the following arguments:

  - `* -i`: interfaces (example: eth0).

  - `* -l`: limit (example: 30 kbit / 1 mbit). You can use the following bandwidth units: kbps, mbps, kbit, mbit, or bps.

  - `* -c`: clear (to clear the interface bandwidth limitation).

To tweak the quality of service:

1. Sign in to the sensor CLI as a Defender for IoT user, and enter `sudo cyberx-xsense-limit-interface-I eth0 -l value`.

   For example: `sudo cyberx-xsense-limit-interface -i eth0 -l 30kbit`

   > [!NOTE]
   > For a physical appliance, use the em1 interface.

1. To clear interface limitation, enter `sudo cyberx-xsense-limit-interface -i eth0 -l 1mbps -c`.

## On-premises management console troubleshooting tools

### Investigate a lack of expected alerts

If an expected alert is not shown in the **Alerts** window, verify the following:

- Check if the same alert already appears in the **Alerts** window as a reaction to a different security instance. If yes, and this alert has not been handled yet, a new alert is not shown.

- Verify that you did not exclude this alert by using the **Alert Exclusion** rules in the on-premises management console.  

### Tweak the Quality of Service (QoS)

To save your network resources, you can limit the number of alerts sent to external systems (such as emails or SIEM) in one sync operation between an appliance and the on-premises management console.

The default is 50. This means that in one communication session between an appliance and the on-premises management console, there will be no more than 50 alerts to external systems. 

To limit the number of alerts, use the `notifications.max_number_to_report` property available in `/var/cyberx/properties/management.properties`. No restart is needed after you change this property.

To tweak the quality of service:

1. Sign in as a Defender for IoT user. 

1. Verify the default values:

   ```bash
   grep \"notifications\" /var/cyberx/properties/management.properties
   ```

   The following default values appear:

   ```bash
   notifications.max_number_to_report=50
   notifications.max_time_to_report=10 (seconds)
   ```

1. Edit the default settings:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/cyberx/properties/management.properties
   ```

1. Edit the settings of the following lines:

   ```bash
   notifications.max_number_to_report=50
   notifications.max_time_to_report=10 (seconds)
   ```

1. Save the changes. No restart is required.

## Export information for troubleshooting

In addition to tools for monitoring and analyzing your network, you can send information to the support team for further investigation. When you export logs, the sensor will automatically generate a one-time password (OTP), unique for the exported logs, in a separate text file. 

To export logs:

1. On the left pane, select **System Settings**.

1. Select **Export Logs**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-export-information-for-troubleshooting/export-a-log.png" alt-text="Export a log to system support.":::

1. In the **File Name** box, enter the file name that you want to use for the log export. The default is the current date.

1. To define what data you want to export, select the data categories:  

    | Export category | Description |
    |--|--|
    | **Operating System Logs** | Select this option to get information about the operating system state. |
    | **Installation/Upgrade logs** | Select this option for investigation of the installation and upgrade configuration parameters. |
    | **System Sanity Output** | Select this option to check system performance. |
    | **Dissection Logs** | Select this option to allow advanced inspection of protocol dissection. |
    | **OS Kernel Dumps** | Select this option to export your kernel memory dump. A kernel memory dump contains all the memory that the kernel is using at the time of the problem that occurred in this kernel. The size of the dump file is smaller than the complete memory dump. Typically, the dump file is around one-third the size of the physical memory on the system. |
    | **Forwarding logs** | Select this option for investigation of the forwarding rules. |
    | **SNMP Logs** | Select this option to receive SNMP health check information. |
    | **Core Application Logs** | Select this option to export data about the core application configuration and operation. |
    | **Communication with CM logs** | Select this option if there are continuous problems or interruptions of connection with the management console. |
    | **Web Application Logs** | Select this option to get information about all the requests sent from the application's web interface. |
    | **System Backup** | Select this option to export a backup of all the system data for investigating the exact state of the system. |
    | **Dissection Statistics** | Select this option to allow advanced inspection of protocol statistics. |
    | **Database Logs** | Select this option to export logs from the system database. Investigating system logs helps identify system problems. |
    | **Configuration** | Select this option to export information about all the configurable parameters to make sure everything was configured correctly. |

1. To select all the options, select **Select All** next to **Choose Categories**.

1. Select **Export Logs**.

The exported logs are added to the **Archived Logs** list. Send the OTP to the support team in a separate message and medium from the exported logs. The support team will be able to extract exported logs only by using the unique OTP that's used to encrypt the logs.

The list of archived logs can contain up to five items. If the number of items in the list goes beyond that number, the earliest item is deleted.
