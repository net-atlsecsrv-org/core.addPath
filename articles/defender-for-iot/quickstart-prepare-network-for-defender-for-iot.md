# Quickstart: Prepare your network for Azure Defender for IoT deployment

## Choose your hardware
Azure Defender for IoT supports various certified appliances, including:
- Certified pre-configured appliances, on which software is already installed
- Non-configured certified appliances on which you can download and install sensor software
- On-premises management console appliance specifications. The on-premises management console is not available as a pre-configured appliance.

## Install components
After acquiring your hardware components and downloading your software package from the Azure Defender for IoT portal, you can install component software. 
For more information, see the [Installation Guide](https://aka.ms/AzureDefenderforIoTInstallSensorISO).

## Onboard Sensors to the Azure Defender for IoT portal
