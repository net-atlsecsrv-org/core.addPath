# About sensor alerts

Alerts help you enhance the security and operation of your network. Alerts provide you with information about:

- Deviations from authorized network activity

- Protocol and operational anomalies

- Suspected malware traffic

Alert management options let users:

- Instruct sensors to learn activity detected as authorized traffic.

- Acknowledge reviewing the alert.

- Instruct sensors to mute events detected with identical devices and comparable traffic.

Additional tools are available that help you enhance and expedite the alert investigation. For example:

  - Add instructional comments for alert reviewers.

  - Create alert groups for display at SOC solutions. 

  - Search for specific alerts; review related PCAP files; view the detected devices and other connected devices in the device map or send alert details to partner systems.

  - Forward alerts to partner vendors: SIEM systems, MSSP systems, and more.

## Alerts and engines

Alerts are triggered when sensor engines detect changes in network traffic and behavior that need your attention. This article describes the kind of alerts that each engine triggers.

| Alert type | Description |
|-|-|
| Policy violation alerts | Triggered when the Policy Violation engine detects a deviation from traffic previously learned. For example: <br /> - A new device is detected.  <br /> - A new configuration is detected on a device. <br /> - A device not defined as a programming device carries out a programming change. <br /> - A firmware version changed. |
| Protocol violation alerts | Triggered when the Protocol Violation engine detects packet structures or field values that don't comply with the protocol specification. | 
| Operational alerts | Triggered when the Operational engine detects network operational incidents or a device malfunctioning. For example, a network device was stopped through a Stop PLC command, or an interface on a sensor stopped monitoring traffic. |
| Malware alerts | Triggered when the Malware engine detects malicious network activity. For example, the engine detects a known attack such as Conficker. |
| Anomaly alerts | Triggered when the Anomaly engine detects a deviation. For example, a device is performing network scans but is not defined as a scanning device. |

Tools are available to enable and disable sensor engines. Alerts are not triggered from engines that are disabled. See [Control what traffic is monitored](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md).

## Alerts and sensor reporting

Activity reflected in alerts can be calculated when you're generating Data Mining, Risk Assessment, and Attack Vector reports. When you manage these events, the sensor updates the reports accordingly.

For example:

  - Unauthorized connectivity between a device in a defined subnet and devices located outside the subnet (public) will appear in the Data Mining *Internet Activity* report and the Risk Assessment *Internet Connections* section. After these devices are authorized (learned), they're calculated in generating these reports.

  - Malware events detected on network devices are reported in Risk Assessment reports. When alerts about malware events are *muted*, affected devices won't be calculated in the Risk Assessment report.
