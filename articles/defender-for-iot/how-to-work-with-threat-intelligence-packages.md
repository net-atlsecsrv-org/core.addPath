# Threat intelligence research and packages #
## Overview ##

Security teams in Microsoft carry out proprietary ICS threat intelligence and vulnerability research. These teams include MSTIC (Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center), DART (Microsoft Detection and Response Team), DCU (Digital Crimes Unit), and Section 52 (IoT/OT/ICS domain experts that track ICS-specific zero-days, reverse-engineering malware, campaigns, and adversaries)

The teams provide security detection, analytics, and response to Microsoft's:

- Cloud infrastructure and services.
- Traditional products and devices.
- Internal corporate resources.

Security teams gain the benefit of:

- Protection from known and relevant threats.
- Insights that help you triage and prioritize.
- An understanding of the full context of threats before they're affected.
- More relevant, accurate, and actionable data.

This intelligence provides contextual information to enrich Microsoft platform analytics and supports the company's managed services for incident response and breach investigation. Threat intelligence packages contain signatures (including malware signatures), CVEs, and other security content.

## When are packages delivered ##

Threat intelligence packages are provided approximately once a month, or if needed more frequently. Announcements about new packages are available from: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-defender-for-iot/bd-p/AzureDefenderIoT.

You can also see the most current package delivered from the **Threat intelligence update** section of the **Updates** page on the Defender for IoT portal.  

## Update threat intelligence packages to your sensors ##

Three options are available for updating threat intelligence packages to your sensors:

- Automatically push packages to sensors as they are delivered by Defender for IoT.
- Manually push threat intelligence package to sensors as required.
- Download a package and then upload it to a sensor or multiple sensors.

Users with Defender for IoT Security Reader permissions can automatically and manually push packages to sensors.

### Automatically push threat intelligence updates to sensors ###

Threat intelligence packages can be automatically updated to *cloud connected* sensors as they are released by Defender for IoT. Ensure automatic package update by onboarding your cloud connected sensor with the **Automatic Threat Intelligence Updates** option enabled. For more information, see [Onboard a sensor](getting-started.md#onboard-a-sensor).

### Manually push threat intelligence updates to sensors ###

Your *cloud connected* sensors can be automatically updated with threat intelligence packages. However, if you would like to take a more conservative approach, you can push packages from the Azure Defender for IoT portal to sensors only when you feel it is required.
This gives you the ability to control when a package is installed, without the need to download and then upload it to your sensors.

**To manually push packages:**

1. Go to the Azure Defender for IoT **Sites and Sensors** page.
1. Select the ellipsis (...) for a sensor and then select **Push Threat Intelligence update**. The **Threat Intelligence update status** field displays the update progress.

#### Change the threat intelligence update mode ####

You can change the sensor threat intelligence update mode after initial onboarding.

**To change the update mode:**

1. Select the ellipsis (...) for a sensor and then select **Edit**.
1. Enable or disable the **Automatic Threat Intelligence Updates** toggle.

### Download packages and upload to sensors ###

Packages can be download from the Defender for IoT portal and manually uploaded to individual sensors. If the on-premises management console manages your sensors, you can download threat intelligence packages to the management console and push them to multiple sensors simultaneously.

This option is available for both *cloud connected* and *locally managed* sensors.

**To upload to a single sensor:**

1. Go to the Azure Defender for IoT **Updates** page.

2. Download and save the **Threat Intelligence** package.

3. Sign in to the sensor console.

4. On the side menu, select **System Settings**.

5. Select **Threat Intelligence Data**, and then select **Update**.

6. Upload the new package.

**To upload to multiple sensors simultaneously:**

1. Go to the Azure Defender for IoT **Updates** page.

2. Download and save the **Threat Intelligence** package.

3. Sign in to the management console.

4. On the side menu, select **System Settings**.

5. In the **Sensor Engine Configuration** section, select the sensors that should receive the updated packages.  

6. In the **Select Threat Intelligence Data** section, select the plus sign (**+**).

7. Upload the package.

## Review package update status on the sensor ##

The package update status and version information is displayed in the sensor **System Settings**, **Threat Intelligence** section.  

## Review package information for cloud connected sensors ##

Review the following information about threat intelligence packages for your cloud connected sensors:

- Package version installed
- Threat intelligence update mode
- Threat intelligence update status

To review threat intelligence information:

1. Go to the Azure Defender for IoT **Sites and Sensors** page.
1. Review the **Threat Intelligence version** installed on each sensor. Version naming is based on the day the package was built by Defender for IoT.
1. Review the **Threat Intelligence mode** . *Automatic* indicates that newly available  packages will be automatically installed on sensors as they are released by Defender for IoT. *Manual* indicates that you can push newly available packages directly to sensors as needed.
1. Review the **Threat Intelligence update status**. The following statuses may be displayed:

- Failed
- In Progress
- Update Available
- Ok

If cloud connected threat intelligence updates fail, review  connection  information in the **Sensor status** and **Last connected UTC** columns in the **Sites and Sensors** page.
