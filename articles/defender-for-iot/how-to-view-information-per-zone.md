# View information per zone


## View a device map for a zone

View a Device map for a selected zone on a sensor. This view displays all network elements related to the selected zone, including the sensors, the devices connected to them, and other information.

The **Device Map** window appears. 
The following tools are available for viewing devices and device information from the map. For details about each of these features, see the *Defender for IoT platform user guide*.

- **Map zoom views**: Simplified View, Connections View, and Detailed View. The displayed map view varies depending on the map's zoom level. You switch between map views by adjusting the zoom levels.

## View additional zone information

The following additional zone information is available:

- **Zone details**: View the number of devices, alerts, and sensors associated with the zone.

- **Sensor details**: View the name, IP address, and version of each sensor assigned to the zone.

- **Connectivity status**: If a sensor is disconnected, connect from the sensor. See [Connect sensors to the on-premises management console](how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-on-premises-management-console.md#connect-sensors-to-the-on-premises-management-console). 

- **Update progress**: If the connected sensor is being upgraded, upgrade statuses will appear. During upgrade, the on-premises management console does not receive device information from the sensor.
