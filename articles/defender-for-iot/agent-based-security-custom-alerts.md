# Defender for IoT devices custom security alerts

Defender for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity.

We encourage you to create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior to ensure alerts act as the most efficient indicators of potential compromise in your unique organizational deployment and landscape.

The following lists of Defender for IoT alerts are definable by you based on your expected IoT device behavior. For more information about how to customize each alert, see [create custom alerts](quickstart-create-custom-alerts.md).

## Agent-based security custom alerts

| Severity | Alert name | Data source | Description | Suggested remediation |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Low | Custom alert - The number of active connections is outside the allowed range | Classic Defender-IoT-micro-agent, Azure RTOS | Number of active connections within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range. | Investigate the device logs. Learn where the connection originated and determine if it is benign or malicious. If malicious, remove possible malware and understand source. If benign, add the source to the allowed connection list. |
| Low | Custom alert - The outbound connection created to an IP that isn't allowed | Classic Defender-IoT-micro-agent, Azure RTOS | An outbound connection was created to an IP that is outside your allowed IP list. | Investigate the device logs. Learn where the connection originated and determine if it is benign or malicious. If malicious, remove possible malware and understand source. If benign, add the source to the allowed IP list. |
| Low | Custom alert - The number of failed local logins is outside the allowed range | Classic Defender-IoT-micro-agent, Azure RTOS | The number of failed local logins within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range. |  |
| Low | Custom alert - The sign in of a user that is not on the allowed user list | Classic Defender-IoT-micro-agent, Azure RTOS | A local user outside your allowed user list, logged in to the device. | If you are saving raw data, navigate to your log analytics account and use the data to investigate the device, identify the source, and then fix the allow/block list for those settings. If you are not currently saving raw data, go to the device and fix the allow/block list for those settings. |
| Low | Custom alert - A process was executed that is not allowed | Classic Defender-IoT-micro-agent, Azure RTOS | A process that is not allowed was executed on the device. | If you are saving raw data, navigate to your log analytics account and use the data to investigate the device, identify the source, and then fix the allow/block list for those settings. If you are not currently saving raw data, go to the device and fix the allow/block list for those settings. |
