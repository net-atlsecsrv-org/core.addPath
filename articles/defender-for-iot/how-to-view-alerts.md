# Filter and manage alerts from the Alerts page 

This article describes how to view alerts triggered by your sensor and manage them with alert tools.

You can view alerts based on various categories, such as alerts that have been archived or pinned. You also can search for alerts of interest, such as alerts based on an IP or MAC address.  

You can also view alerts from the sensor dashboard.

To view alerts:

- Select **Alerts** from the side menu. The Alerts window displays the alerts that your sensor has detected.

## View alerts by category

You can view alerts according to various categories from the **Alerts** main view. Select an alert to review details and manage the event.

| Sort by type | Description |
|--|--|
| **Important Alerts** | Alerts sorted by importance. |
| **Pinned Alerts** | Alerts that the user pinned for further investigation. Pinned alerts are not archived and are stored for 14 days in the pinned folder. |
| **Recent Alerts** | Alerts sorted by time. |
| **Acknowledged Alerts** | Alerts that were acknowledged and unhandled, or that were muted and unmuted. |
| **Archived Alerts** | Alerts that the system archived automatically. Only the administrator user can access them. |
