# Quickstart: Start monitoring your Node.js Web application with Azure Application Insights

In this quickstart, you add the Application Insights SDK version 0.22 for Node.js to an existing Node.js web application.

With Azure Application Insights, you can easily monitor your web application for availability, performance, and usage. You can also quickly identify and diagnose errors in your application without waiting for a user to report them. With the version 0.20 SDK release onward, you can monitor common third-party packages, including MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
* A functioning Node.js application.

## Enable Application Insights

Application Insights can gather telemetry data from any internet-connected application, whether or not it's running on-premises or in the cloud. Use the following steps to start viewing this data.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **Create a resource** > **Developer tools** > **Application Insights**.

   ![Add an Azure Application Insights resource](./media/nodejs-quick-start/azure-app-insights-create-resource.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   >If this is your first time creating an Application Insights resource you can learn more by visiting the [Create an Application Insights Resource](../app/create-new-resource.md) doc.

   A configuration page appears; use the following table to fill out the input fields. 

    | Settings        | Value           | Description  |
   | ------------- |:-------------|:-----|
   | **Name**      | Globally Unique Value | Name that identifies the app you're monitoring |
   | **Resource Group**     | myResourceGroup      | Name for the new resource group to host AppInsights data. You can create a new resource group or use an existing one. |
   | **Location** | East US | Choose a location near you, or near where your app is hosted |

3. Select **Create**.

## Configure AppInsights SDK

1. Select **Overview** and copy your application's **Instrumentation Key**.

   ![View the Application Insights Instrumentation Key](./media/nodejs-quick-start/azure-app-insights-instrumentation-key.png)

2. Add the Application Insights SDK for Node.js to your application. From your app's root folder run:

   ```bash
   npm install applicationinsights --save
   ```

3. Edit your app's first *.js* file and add the two lines below to the topmost part of your script. If you're using the [Node.js quickstart app](../../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-nodejs.md), you would modify the *index.js* file. Replace `<instrumentation_key>` with your application's instrumentation key. 

   ```JavaScript
   const appInsights = require('applicationinsights');
   appInsights.setup('<instrumentation_key>').start();
   ```

4. Restart your app.

> [!NOTE]
> It takes 3-5 minutes before data begins appearing in the portal. If this app is a low-traffic test app, keep in mind that most metrics are only captured when there are active requests or operations occurring.

## Start monitoring in the Azure portal

1. You can now reopen the Application Insights **Overview** page in the Azure portal, where you retrieved your instrumentation key, to view details about your currently running application.

   ![Application Insights Overview menu](./media/nodejs-quick-start/azure-app-insights-overview-menu.png)

2. Select **Application map** for a visual layout of the dependency relationships between your application components. Each component shows KPIs such as load, performance, failures, and alerts.

   ![Application Insights Application map](./media/nodejs-quick-start/azure-app-insights-application-map.png)

3. Select the **App Analytics** icon ![Application Map icon](./media/nodejs-quick-start/azure-app-insights-analytics-icon.png) **View in Analytics**.  This action opens **Application Insights Analytics**, which provides a rich query language for analyzing all data collected by Application Insights. In this case, a query is generated for you that renders the request count as a chart. You can write your own queries to analyze other data.

4. Return to the **Overview** page and examine the KPI graphs.  This dashboard provides statistics about your application health, including the number of incoming requests, the duration of those requests, and any failures that occur.

   To enable the **Page View Load Time** chart to populate with **client-side telemetry** data, add this script to each page that you want to track:

   ```HTML
   <!-- 
   To collect user behavior analytics tools about your application, 
   insert the following script into each page you want to track.
   Place this code immediately before the closing </head> tag,
   and before any other scripts. Your first data will appear 
   automatically in just a few seconds.
   -->
   <script type="text/javascript">
     var appInsights=window.appInsights||function(config){
       function i(config){t[config]=function(){var i=arguments;t.queue.push(function(){t[config].apply(t,i)})}}var t={config:config},u=document,e=window,o="script",s="AuthenticatedUserContext",h="start",c="stop",l="Track",a=l+"Event",v=l+"Page",y=u.createElement(o),r,f;y.src=config.url||"https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/a/ai.0.js";u.getElementsByTagName(o)[0].parentNode.appendChild(y);try{t.cookie=u.cookie}catch(p){}for(t.queue=[],t.version="1.0",r=["Event","Exception","Metric","PageView","Trace","Dependency"];r.length;)i("track"+r.pop());return i("set"+s),i("clear"+s),i(h+a),i(c+a),i(h+v),i(c+v),i("flush"),config.disableExceptionTracking||(r="onerror",i("_"+r),f=e[r],e[r]=function(config,i,u,e,o){var s=f&&f(config,i,u,e,o);return s!==!0&&t["_"+r](config,i,u,e,o),s}),t
       }({
           instrumentationKey:"<insert instrumentation key>"
       });
       
       window.appInsights=appInsights;
       appInsights.trackPageView();
   </script>
   ```

5. On the left, select **Metrics**. Use the metrics explorer to investigate the health and utilization of your resource. You can select **Add new chart** to create additional custom views or select **Edit** to modify the existing chart types, height, color palette, groupings, and metrics. For example, you can make a chart that displays the average browser page load time by selecting "Browser page load time" from the metrics drop down and "Avg" from aggregation. To learn more about Azure Metrics Explorer, visit [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../platform/metrics-getting-started.md).

To learn more about monitoring Node.js, check out the [additional AppInsights Node.js documentation](../app/nodejs.md).

## Clean up resources

When you're done testing, you can delete the resource group and all related resources. To do so follow the steps below.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used an existing resource group the instructions below will not work and you will need to just delete the individual Application Insights resource. Keep in mind anytime you delete a resource group all underyling resources that are members of that group will be deleted.

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** and then select **myResourceGroup**.
2. On your resource group page, select **Delete**, enter **myResourceGroup** in the text box, and then select **Delete**.
