This article describes some of the more advanced aggregation options available to Azure Monitor queries.

## Generating lists and sets
You can use `makelist` to pivot data by the order of values in a particular column. For example, you may want to explore the most common order events take place on your machines. You can essentially pivot the data by the order of EventIDs on each machine. 

```Kusto
Event
| where TimeGenerated > ago(12h)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| summarize makelist(EventID) by Computer
```

|Computer|list_EventID|
|---|---|
| computer1 | [704,701,1501,1500,1085,704,704,701] |
| computer2 | [326,105,302,301,300,102] |
| ... | ... |

`makelist` generates a list in the order that data was passed into it. To sort events from oldest to newest, use `asc` in the order statement instead of `desc`. 

It is also useful to create a list of just distinct values. This is called a _Set_ and can be generated with `makeset`:

```Kusto
Event
| where TimeGenerated > ago(12h)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| summarize makeset(EventID) by Computer
```

|Computer|list_EventID|
|---|---|
| computer1 | [704,701,1501,1500,1085] |
| computer2 | [326,105,302,301,300,102] |
| ... | ... |

Like `makelist`, `makeset` also works with ordered data and will generate the arrays based on the order of the rows that are passed into it.

## Expanding lists
The inverse operation of `makelist` or `makeset` is `mvexpand`, which expands a list of values to separate rows. It can expand across any number of dynamic columns, both JSON and array. For example, you could check  the *Heartbeat* table for solutions sending data from computers that sent a heartbeat in the last hour:

```Kusto
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| project Computer, Solutions
```

| Computer | Solutions | 
|--------------|----------------------|
| computer1 | "security", "updates", "changeTracking" |
| computer2 | "security", "updates" |
| computer3 | "antiMalware", "changeTracking" |
| ... | ... |

Use `mvexpand` to show each value in a separate row instead of a comma-separated list:

```Kusto
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| project Computer, split(Solutions, ",")
| mvexpand Solutions
```

| Computer | Solutions | 
|--------------|----------------------|
| computer1 | "security" |
| computer1 | "updates" |
| computer1 | "changeTracking" |
| computer2 | "security" |
| computer2 | "updates" |
| computer3 | "antiMalware" |
| computer3 | "changeTracking" |
| ... | ... |


You could then use `makelist` again to group items together, and this time see the list of computers per solution:

```Kusto
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| project Computer, split(Solutions, ",")
| mvexpand Solutions
| summarize makelist(Computer) by tostring(Solutions) 
```

|Solutions | list_Computer |
|--------------|----------------------|
| "security" | ["computer1", "computer2"] |
| "updates" | ["computer1", "computer2"] |
| "changeTracking" | ["computer1", "computer3"] |
| "antiMalware" | ["computer3"] |
| ... | ... |

## Handling missing bins
A useful application of `mvexpand` is the need to fill default values in for missing bins. For example, suppose you're looking for the uptime of a particular machine by exploring its heartbeat. You also want to see the source of the heartbeat  which is in the _category_ column. Normally, we would use a simple summarize statement as follows:

```Kusto
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(12h)
| summarize count() by Category, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```

| Category | TimeGenerated | count_ |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T17:00:00Z | 15 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T18:00:00Z | 60 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T20:00:00Z | 55 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T21:00:00Z | 57 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T22:00:00Z | 60 |
| ... | ... | ... |

In these results though the bucket associated with "2017-06-06T19:00:00Z" is missing because there isn't any heartbeat data for that hour. Use the `make-series` function to assign a default value to empty buckets. This will generate a row for each category with two extra array columns, one for values, and one for matching time buckets:

```Kusto
Heartbeat
| make-series count() default=0 on TimeGenerated in range(ago(1d), now(), 1h) by Category 
```

| Category | count_ | TimeGenerated |
|---|---|---|
| Direct Agent | [15,60,0,55,60,57,60,...] | ["2017-06-06T17:00:00.0000000Z","2017-06-06T18:00:00.0000000Z","2017-06-06T19:00:00.0000000Z","2017-06-06T20:00:00.0000000Z","2017-06-06T21:00:00.0000000Z",...] |
| ... | ... | ... |

The third element of the *count_* array is a 0 as expected, and there is a matching timestamp of "2017-06-06T19:00:00.0000000Z" in the _TimeGenerated_ array. This array format is difficult to read though. Use `mvexpand` to expand the arrays and produce the same format output as generated by `summarize`:

```Kusto
Heartbeat
| make-series count() default=0 on TimeGenerated in range(ago(1d), now(), 1h) by Category 
| mvexpand TimeGenerated, count_
| project Category, TimeGenerated, count_
```

| Category | TimeGenerated | count_ |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T17:00:00Z | 15 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T18:00:00Z | 60 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T19:00:00Z | 0 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T20:00:00Z | 55 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T21:00:00Z | 57 |
| Direct Agent | 2017-06-06T22:00:00Z | 60 |
| ... | ... | ... |



## Narrowing results to a set of elements: `let`, `makeset`, `toscalar`, `in`
A common scenario is to select the names of some specific entities based on a set of criteria and then filter a different data set down to that set of entities. For example you might find computers that are known to have missing updates and identify IPs that these computers called out to:


```Kusto
let ComputersNeedingUpdate = toscalar(
    Update
    | summarize makeset(Computer)
    | project set_Computer
);
WindowsFirewall
| where Computer in (ComputersNeedingUpdate)
```
