# Log Analytics smart analytics examples
This article includes examples that use smart analytics functions in Log Analytics to perform analysis of user activity. You can either use these examples to analyze your own applications monitored by Application Insights or use the concepts in these queries for similar analysis on other data. 

See the [Kusto language reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/) for details on the different keywords used in these samples. Go through a [lesson on creating queries](get-started-queries.md) if you're new to Log Analytics.

## Cohorts analytics

Cohort analysis tracks the activity of specific groups of users, known as cohorts. It attempts to measure how appealing a service is by measuring the rate of returning users. The users are grouped by the time they first used the service. When analyzing cohorts, we expect to find a decrease in activity over the first tracked periods. Each cohort is titled by the week its members were observed for the first time.

The following example analyzes the number of activities users perform over the course of 5 weeks, following their first use of the service.

```Kusto
let startDate = startofweek(bin(datetime(2017-01-20T00:00:00Z), 1d));
let week = range Cohort from startDate to datetime(2017-03-01T00:00:00Z) step 7d;
// For each user we find the first and last timestamp of activity
let FirstAndLastUserActivity = (end:datetime) 
{
    customEvents
    | where customDimensions["sourceapp"]=="ai-loganalyticsui-prod"
    // Check 30 days back to see first time activity
    | where timestamp > startDate - 30d
    | where timestamp < end      
    | summarize min=min(timestamp), max=max(timestamp) by user_AuthenticatedId
};
let DistinctUsers = (cohortPeriod:datetime, evaluatePeriod:datetime) {
    toscalar (
    FirstAndLastUserActivity(evaluatePeriod)
    // Find members of the cohort: only users that were observed in this period for the first time
    | where min >= cohortPeriod and min < cohortPeriod + 7d  
    // Pick only the members that were active during the evaluated period or after
    | where max > evaluatePeriod - 7d
    | summarize dcount(user_AuthenticatedId)) 
};
week 
| where Cohort == startDate
// Finally, calculate the desired metric for each cohort. In this sample we calculate distinct users but you can change
// this to any other metric that would measure the engagement of the cohort members.
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+7d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+14d),
    r2 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+21d),
    r3 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+28d),
    r4 = DistinctUsers(startDate, startDate+35d)
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 7d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+14d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+21d),
    r2 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+28d),
    r3 = DistinctUsers(startDate+7d, startDate+35d) )
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 14d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate+14d, startDate+21d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate+14d, startDate+28d),
    r2 = DistinctUsers(startDate+14d, startDate+35d) )
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 21d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers(startDate+21d, startDate+28d),
    r1 = DistinctUsers(startDate+21d, startDate+35d) ) 
| union (week | where Cohort == startDate + 28d 
| extend 
    r0 = DistinctUsers (startDate+28d, startDate+35d) )
// Calculate the retention percentage for each cohort by weeks
| project Cohort, r0, r1, r2, r3, r4,
          p0 = r0/r0*100,
          p1 = todouble(r1)/todouble (r0)*100,
          p2 = todouble(r2)/todouble(r0)*100,
          p3 = todouble(r3)/todouble(r0)*100,
          p4 = todouble(r4)/todouble(r0)*100 
| sort by Cohort asc
```
This example results in the following output.

## Rolling monthly active users and user stickiness
The following examples uses time-series analysis with the [series_fir](/azure/kusto/query/series-firfunction) function which allows you to perform sliding window computations. The sample application being monitored is an online store that tracks users' activity through custom events. The query tracks two types of user activities, _AddToCart_ and _Checkout_, and defines _active users_ as those who performed a check-out at least once in a given day.



```Kusto
let endtime = endofday(datetime(2017-03-01T00:00:00Z));
let window = 60d;
let starttime = endtime-window;
let interval = 1d;
let user_bins_to_analyze = 28;
// Create an array of filters coefficients for series_fir(). A list of '1' in our case will produce a simple sum.
let moving_sum_filter = toscalar(range x from 1 to user_bins_to_analyze step 1 | extend v=1 | summarize makelist(v)); 
// Level of engagement. Users will be counted as engaged if they performed at least this number of activities.
let min_activity = 1;
customEvents
| where timestamp > starttime  
| where customDimensions["sourceapp"] == "ai-loganalyticsui-prod"
// We want to analyze users who actually checked-out in our web site
| where (name == "Checkout") and user_AuthenticatedId <> ""
// Create a series of activities per user
| make-series UserClicks=count() default=0 on timestamp 
	in range(starttime, endtime-1s, interval) by user_AuthenticatedId
// Create a new column containing a sliding sum. 
// Passing 'false' as the last parameter to series_fir() prevents normalization of the calculation by the size of the window.
// For each time bin in the *RollingUserClicks* column, the value is the aggregation of the user activities in the 
// 28 days that preceded the bin. For example, if a user was active once on 2016-12-31 and then inactive throughout 
// January, then the value will be 1 between 2016-12-31 -> 2017-01-28 and then 0s. 
| extend RollingUserClicks=series_fir(UserClicks, moving_sum_filter, false)
// Use the zip() operator to pack the timestamp with the user activities per time bin
| project User_AuthenticatedId=user_AuthenticatedId , RollingUserClicksByDay=zip(timestamp, RollingUserClicks)
// Transpose the table and create a separate row for each combination of user and time bin (1 day)
| mvexpand RollingUserClicksByDay
| extend Timestamp=todatetime(RollingUserClicksByDay[0])
// Mark the users that qualify according to min_activity
| extend RollingActiveUsersByDay=iff(toint(RollingUserClicksByDay[1]) >= min_activity, 1, 0)
// And finally, count the number of users per time bin.
| summarize sum(RollingActiveUsersByDay) by Timestamp
// First 28 days contain partial data, so we filter them out.
| where Timestamp > starttime + 28d
// render as timechart
| render timechart
```

This example results in the following output.

THe following example turns the above query into a reusable function and uses it to calculate rolling user stickiness. Active users in this query are defined as only those users that performed check-out at least once in a given day.

``` Kusto
let rollingDcount = (sliding_window_size: int, event_name:string)
{
    let endtime = endofday(datetime(2017-03-01T00:00:00Z));
    let window = 90d;
    let starttime = endtime-window;
    let interval = 1d;
    let moving_sum_filter = toscalar(range x from 1 to sliding_window_size step 1 | extend v=1| summarize makelist(v));    
    let min_activity = 1;
    customEvents
    | where timestamp > starttime
    | where customDimensions["sourceapp"]=="ai-loganalyticsui-prod"
    | where (name == event_name)
    | where user_AuthenticatedId <> ""
    | make-series UserClicks=count() default=0 on timestamp 
		in range(starttime, endtime-1s, interval) by user_AuthenticatedId
    | extend RollingUserClicks=fir(UserClicks, moving_sum_filter, false)
    | project User_AuthenticatedId=user_AuthenticatedId , RollingUserClicksByDay=zip(timestamp, RollingUserClicks)
    | mvexpand RollingUserClicksByDay
    | extend Timestamp=todatetime(RollingUserClicksByDay[0])
    | extend RollingActiveUsersByDay=iff(toint(RollingUserClicksByDay[1]) >= min_activity, 1, 0)
    | summarize sum(RollingActiveUsersByDay) by Timestamp
    | where Timestamp > starttime + 28d
};
// Use the moving_sum_filter with bin size of 28 to count MAU.
rollingDcount(28, "Checkout")
| join
(
    // Use the moving_sum_filter with bin size of 1 to count DAU.
    rollingDcount(1, "Checkout")
)
on Timestamp
| project sum_RollingActiveUsersByDay1 *1.0 / sum_RollingActiveUsersByDay, Timestamp
| render timechart
```

This example results in the following output.

## Regression analysis
This example demonstrates how to create an automated detector for service disruptions based exclusively on an application's trace logs. The detector seeks abnormal  sudden increases in the relative amount of error and warning traces in the application.

Two techniques are used to evaluate the service status based on trace logs data:

- Use [make-series](/azure/kusto/query/make-seriesoperator) to convert semi-structured textual trace logs into a metric that represents the ratio between positive and negative trace lines.
- Use [series_fit_2lines](/azure/kusto/query/series-fit-2linesfunction) and [series_fit_line](/azure/kusto/query/series-fit-linefunction) to perform advanced step-jump detection using time-series analysis with a 2-line linear regression.

``` Kusto
let startDate = startofday(datetime("2017-02-01"));
let endDate = startofday(datetime("2017-02-07"));
let minRsquare = 0.8;  // Tune the sensitivity of the detection sensor. Values close to 1 indicate very low sensitivity.
// Count all Good (Verbose + Info) and Bad (Error + Fatal + Warning) traces, per day
traces
| where timestamp > startDate and timestamp < endDate
| summarize 
    Verbose = countif(severityLevel == 0),
    Info = countif(severityLevel == 1), 
    Warning = countif(severityLevel == 2),
    Error = countif(severityLevel == 3),
    Fatal = countif(severityLevel == 4) by bin(timestamp, 1d)
| extend Bad = (Error + Fatal + Warning), Good = (Verbose + Info)
// Determine the ratio of bad traces, from the total
| extend Ratio = (todouble(Bad) / todouble(Good + Bad))*10000
| project timestamp , Ratio
// Create a time series
| make-series RatioSeries=any(Ratio) default=0 on timestamp in range(startDate , endDate -1d, 1d) by 'TraceSeverity' 
// Apply a 2-line regression to the time series
| extend (RSquare2, SplitIdx, Variance2,RVariance2,LineFit2)=series_fit_2lines(RatioSeries)
// Find out if our 2-line is trending up or down
| extend (Slope,Interception,RSquare,Variance,RVariance,LineFit)=series_fit_line(LineFit2)
// Check whether the line fit reaches the threshold, and if the spike represents an increase (rather than a decrease)
| project PatternMatch = iff(RSquare2 > minRsquare and Slope>0, "Spike detected", "No Match")
```
