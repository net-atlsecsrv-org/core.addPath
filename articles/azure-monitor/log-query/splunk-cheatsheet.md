# Splunk to Azure Monitor log query

This article is intended to assist users who are familiar with Splunk to learn the Kusto query language to write log queries in Azure Monitor. Direct comparisons are made between the two to understand key differences and also similarities where you can leverage your existing knowledge.

## Structure and concepts

The following table compares concepts and data structures between Splunk and Azure Monitor logs.

 | Concept  | Splunk | Azure Monitor |  Comment
 | --- | --- | --- | ---
 | Deployment unit  | cluster |  cluster |  Azure Monitor allows arbitrary cross cluster queries. Splunk does not. |
 | Data caches |  buckets  |  Caching and retention policies |  Controls the period and caching level for the data. This setting directly impacts the performance of queries and cost of the deployment. |
 | Logical partition of data  |  index  |  database  |  Allows logical separation of the data. Both implementations allow unions and joining across these partitions. |
 | Structured event metadata | N/A | table |  Splunk does not have the concept exposed to the search language of event metadata. Azure Monitor logs has the concept of a table, which has columns. Each event instance is mapped to a row. |
 | Data record | event | row |  Terminology change only. |
 | Data record attribute | field |  column |  In Azure Monitor, this is predefined as part of the table structure. In Splunk, each event has its own set of fields. |
 | Types | datatype |  datatype |  Azure Monitor datatypes are more explicit as they are set on the columns. Both have the ability to work dynamically with data types  and roughly equivalent set of datatypes including JSON support. |
 | Query and search  | search | query |  Concepts are essentially the same between both Azure Monitor and Splunk. |
 | Event ingestion time | System Time | ingestion_time() |  In Splunk, each event gets a system timestamp of the time that the event was indexed. In Azure Monitor, you can define a policy called ingestion_time that exposes a system column that can be referenced through the ingestion_time() function. |

## Functions

The following table specifies functions in Azure Monitor that are equivalent to Splunk functions.

|Splunk | Azure Monitor |Comment
|---|---|---
|strcat | strcat()| (1) |
|split  | split() | (1) |
|if     | iff()   | (1) |
|tonumber | todouble()<br>tolong()<br>toint() | (1) |
|upper<br>lower |toupper()<br>tolower()|(1) |
| replace | replace() | (1)<br> Also note that while `replace()` takes three parameters in both products, the parameters are different. |
| substr | substring() | (1)<br>Also note that Splunk uses one-based indices. Azure Monitor notes zero-based indices. |
| tolower |  tolower() | (1) |
| toupper | toupper() | (1) |
| match | matches regex |  (2)  |
| regex | matches regex | In Splunk, `regex` is an operator. In Azure Monitor, it's a relational operator. |
| searchmatch | == | In Splunk, `searchmatch` allows searching for the exact string.
| random | rand()<br>rand(n) | Splunk's function returns a number from zero to 2<sup>31</sup>-1. Azure Monitor' returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0, or if a parameter provided, between 0 and n-1.
| now | now() | (1)
| relative_time | totimespan() | (1)<br>In Azure Monitor, Splunk's equivalent of relative_time(datetimeVal, offsetVal) is datetimeVal + totimespan(offsetVal).<br>For example, <code>search &#124; eval n=relative_time(now(), "-1d@d")</code> becomes <code>...  &#124; extend myTime = now() - totimespan("1d")</code>.

(1) In Splunk, the function is invoked with the `eval` operator. In Azure Monitor, it is used as part of `extend` or `project`.<br>(2) In Splunk, the function is invoked with the `eval` operator. In Azure Monitor, it can be used with the `where` operator.


## Operators

The following sections give examples of using different operators between Splunk and Azure Monitor.

> [!NOTE]
> For the purpose of the following example, the Splunk field _rule_ maps to a table in Azure Monitor, and Splunk's default timestamp maps to the Logs Analytics _ingestion_time()_ column.

### Search
In Splunk, you can omit the `search` keyword and specify an unquoted string. In Azure Monitor you must start each query with `find`, an unquoted string is a column name, and the lookup value must be a quoted string. 

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **search** | <code>search Session.Id="c8894ffd-e684-43c9-9125-42adc25cd3fc" earliest=-24h</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **find** | <code>find Session.Id=="c8894ffd-e684-43c9-9125-42adc25cd3fc" and ingestion_time()> ago(24h)</code> |


### Filter
Azure Monitor log queries start from a tabular result set where the filter. In Splunk, filtering is the default operation on the current index. You can also use `where` operator in Splunk, but it is not recommended.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **search** | <code>Event.Rule="330009.2" Session.Id="c8894ffd-e684-43c9-9125-42adc25cd3fc" _indextime>-24h</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **where** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; where Session_Id == "c8894ffd-e684-43c9-9125-42adc25cd3fc" and ingestion_time() > ago(24h)</code> |

### Getting n events/rows for inspection 
Azure Monitor log queries also support `take` as an alias to `limit`. In Splunk, if the results are ordered, `head` will return the first n results. In Azure Monitor, limit is not ordered but returns the first n rows that are found.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **head** | <code>Event.Rule=330009.2<br>&#124; head 100</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **limit** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; limit 100</code> |

### Getting the first n events/rows ordered by a field/column
For bottom results, in Splunk you use `tail`. In Azure Monitor you can specify the ordering direction with `asc`.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **head** |  <code>Event.Rule="330009.2"<br>&#124; sort Event.Sequence<br>&#124; head 20</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **top** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; top 20 by Event_Sequence</code> |

### Extending the result set with new fields/columns
Splunk also has an `eval` function, which is not to be comparable with the `eval` operator. Both the `eval` operator in Splunk and the `extend` operator in Azure Monitor only support scalar functions and arithmetic operators.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **eval** |  <code>Event.Rule=330009.2<br>&#124; eval state= if(Data.Exception = "0", "success", "error")</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **extend** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; extend state = iif(Data_Exception == 0,"success" ,"error")</code> |

### Rename 
Azure Monitor uses the `project-rename` operator to rename a field. `project-rename` allows the query to take advantage of any indexes pre-built for a field. Splunk has a `rename` operator to do the same.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **rename** |  <code>Event.Rule=330009.2<br>&#124; rename Date.Exception as execption</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **project-rename** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; project-rename exception = Date_Exception</code> |

### Format results/Projection
Splunk does not seem to have an operator similar to `project-away`. You can use the UI to filter away fields.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **table** |  <code>Event.Rule=330009.2<br>&#124; table rule, state</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **project**<br>**project-away** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; project exception, state</code> |

### Aggregation
See the [Aggregations in Azure Monitor log queries](aggregations.md) for the different aggregation functions.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **stats** |  <code>search (Rule=120502.*)<br>&#124; stats count by OSEnv, Audience</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **summarize** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; summarize count() by App_Platform, Release_Audience</code> |


### Join
Join in Splunk has significant limitations. The subquery has a limit of 10000 results (set in the deployment configuration file), and there a limited number of join flavors.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **join** |  <code>Event.Rule=120103* &#124; stats by Client.Id, Data.Alias \| join Client.Id max=0 [search earliest=-24h Event.Rule="150310.0" Data.Hresult=-2147221040]</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **join** | <code>cluster("OAriaPPT").database("Office PowerPoint").Office_PowerPoint_PPT_Exceptions<br>&#124; where  Data_Hresult== -2147221040<br>&#124; join kind = inner (Office_System_SystemHealthMetadata<br>&#124; summarize by Client_Id, Data_Alias)on Client_Id</code>   |

### Sort
In Splunk, to sort in ascending order you must use the `reverse` operator. Azure Monitor also supports defining where to put nulls, at the beginning or at the end.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **sort** |  <code>Event.Rule=120103<br>&#124; sort Data.Hresult<br>&#124; reverse</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **order by** | <code>Office_Hub_OHubBGTaskError<br>&#124; order by Data_Hresult,  desc</code> |

### Multivalue expand
This is a similar operator in both Splunk and Azure Monitor.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **mvexpand** |  `mvexpand foo` |
| **Azure Monitor** | **mvexpand** | `mvexpand foo` |

### Results facets, interesting fields
In Log Analytics in the Azure portal, only the first column is exposed. All columns are available through the API.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **fields** |  <code>Event.Rule=330009.2<br>&#124; fields App.Version, App.Platform</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **facets** | <code>Office_Excel_BI_PivotTableCreate<br>&#124; facet by App_Branch, App_Version</code> |

### De-duplicate
You can use `summarize arg_min()` instead to reverse the order of which record gets chosen.

| | Operator | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Splunk** | **dedup** |  <code>Event.Rule=330009.2<br>&#124; dedup device_id sortby -batterylife</code> |
| **Azure Monitor** | **summarize arg_max()** | <code>Office_Excel_BI_PivotTableCreate<br>&#124; summarize arg_max(batterylife, *) by device_id</code> |
