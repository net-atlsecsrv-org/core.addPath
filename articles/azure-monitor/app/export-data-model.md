# Application Insights Export Data Model
This table lists the properties of telemetry sent from the [Application Insights](../../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md) SDKs to the portal.
You'll see these properties in data output from [Continuous Export](export-telemetry.md).
They also appear in property filters in [Metric Explorer](../../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-charts.md) and [Diagnostic Search](../../azure-monitor/app/diagnostic-search.md).

Points to note:

* `[0]` in these tables denotes a point in the path where you have to insert an index; but it isn't always 0.
* Time durations are in tenths of a microsecond, so 10000000 == 1 second.
* Dates and times are UTC, and are given in the ISO format `yyyy-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ`


## Example

## Metrics
Generated by TrackMetric().

The metric value is found in context.custom.metrics[0]

For example:

    {
     "metric": [ ],
     "context": {
     ...
     "custom": {
        "dimensions": [
          { "ProcessId": "4068" }
        ],
        "metrics": [
          {
            "dispatchRate": {
              "value": 0.001295,
              "count": 1.0,
              "min": 0.001295,
              "max": 0.001295,
              "stdDev": 0.0,
              "sampledValue": 0.001295,
              "sum": 0.001295
            }
          }
         } ] }
    }

## About metric values
Metric values, both in metric reports and elsewhere, are reported with a standard object structure. For example:

      "durationMetric": {
        "name": "contoso.org",
        "type": "Aggregation",
        "value": 468.71603053650279,
        "count": 1.0,
        "min": 468.71603053650279,
        "max": 468.71603053650279,
        "stdDev": 0.0,
        "sampledValue": 468.71603053650279
      }

Currently - though this might change in the future - in all values reported from the standard SDK modules, `count==1` and only the `name` and `value` fields are useful. The only case where they would be different would be if you write your own TrackMetric calls in which you set the other parameters.

The purpose of the other fields is to allow metrics to be aggregated in the SDK, to reduce traffic to the portal. For example, you could average several successive readings before sending each metric report. Then you would calculate the min, max, standard deviation and aggregate value (sum or average) and set count to the number of readings represented by the report.

In the tables above, we have omitted the rarely-used fields count, min, max, stdDev and sampledValue.

Instead of pre-aggregating metrics, you can use [sampling](../../azure-monitor/app/sampling.md) if you need to reduce the volume of telemetry.

### Durations
Except where otherwise noted, durations are represented in tenths of a microsecond, so that 10000000.0 means 1 second.
