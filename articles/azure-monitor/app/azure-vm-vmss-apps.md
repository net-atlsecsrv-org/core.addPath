# Monitor application performance hosted on Azure VM and Azure virtual machine scale sets

Enabling monitoring on your .NET based web applications running on [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/) and [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/) is now easier than ever. Get all the benefits of using Application Insights without modifying your code.

This article will walk you through enabling Application Insights monitoring using the ApplicationMonitoringWindows extension and provide preliminary guidance for automating the process for large-scale deployments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure ApplicationMonitoringWindows extension is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Some features might not be supported, and some might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Enable Application Insights

There are two ways to enable application monitoring for Azure VM and Azure virtual machine scale set hosted applications:

* **Agent-based application monitoring** (ApplicationMonitoringWindows extension).
    * This method is the easiest to enable, and no advanced configuration is required. It is often referred to as "runtime" monitoring. For Azure VMs and Azure virtual machine scale sets we recommend at a minimum enabling this level of monitoring. After that, based on your specific scenario, you can evaluate whether manual instrumentation is needed.
    * Currently only .Net IIS-hosted applications are supported.

* **Manually instrumenting the application through code** by installing the Application Insights SDK.

    * This approach is much more customizable, but it requires [adding a dependency on the Application Insights SDK NuGet packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net). This method, also means you have to manage the updates to the latest version of the packages yourself.

    * If you need to make custom API calls to track events/dependencies not captured by default with agent-based monitoring, you would need to use this method. Check out the [API for custom events and metrics article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics) to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> If both agent based monitoring and manual SDK based instrumentation is detected only the manual instrumentation settings will be honored. This is to prevent duplicate data from being sent. To learn more about this check out the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.

## Manage agent-based monitoring for .NET applications on VM using PowerShell

Install or update the application monitoring extension for VM
```powershell
$publicCfgJsonString = '
{
  "RedfieldConfiguration": {
    "InstrumentationKeyMap": {
      "Filters": [
        {
          "AppFilter": ".*",
          "MachineFilter": ".*",
          "InstrumentationSettings" : {
            "InstrumentationKey": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
';
$privateCfgJsonString = '{}';

Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "<myVmResourceGroup>" -VMName "<myVmName>" -Location "South Central US" -Name "ApplicationMonitoring" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics" -Type "ApplicationMonitoringWindows" -Version "2.8" -SettingString $publicCfgJsonString -ProtectedSettingString $privateCfgJsonString
```

Uninstall application monitoring extension from VM
```powershell
Remove-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "<myVmResourceGroup>" -VMName "<myVmName>" -Name "ApplicationMonitoring"
```

Query application monitoring extension status for VM
```powershell
Get-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "<myVmResourceGroup>" -VMName "<myVmName>" -Name ApplicationMonitoring -Status
```

Get list of installed extensions for VM
```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceId "/subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myVmResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<myVmName>/extensions"

# Name              : ApplicationMonitoring
# ResourceGroupName : <myVmResourceGroup>
# ResourceType      : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions
# Location          : southcentralus
# ResourceId        : /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myVmResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<myVmName>/extensions/ApplicationMonitoring
```

## Manage agent-based monitoring for .NET applications on Azure virtual machine scale set using powershell

Install or update the application monitoring extension for Azure virtual machine scale set
```powershell
$publicCfgHashtable =
@{
  "RedfieldConfiguration"= @{
    "InstrumentationKeyMap"= @{
      "Filters"= @(
        @{
          "AppFilter"= ".*";
          "MachineFilter"= ".*";
          "InstrumentationSettings"= @{
            "InstrumentationKey"= "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"; # Application Insights Instrumentation Key, create new Application Insights resource if you don't have one. https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/microsoft.insights%2Fcomponents
          }
        }
      )
    }
  }
};
$privateCfgHashtable = @{};

$vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName "<myResourceGroup>" -VMScaleSetName "<myVmssName>"

Add-AzVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -Name "ApplicationMonitoring" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics" -Type "ApplicationMonitoringWindows" -TypeHandlerVersion "2.8" -Setting $publicCfgHashtable -ProtectedSetting $privateCfgHashtable

Update-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName $vmss.ResourceGroupName -Name $vmss.Name -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss

# Note: depending on your update policy, you might need to run Update-AzVmssInstance for each instance
```

Uninstall application monitoring extension from Azure virtual machine scale set
```powershell
$vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName "<myResourceGroup>" -VMScaleSetName "<myVmssName>"

Remove-AzVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -Name "ApplicationMonitoring"

Update-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName $vmss.ResourceGroupName -Name $vmss.Name -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss

# Note: depending on your update policy, you might need to run Update-AzVmssInstance for each instance
```

Query application monitoring extension status for Azure virtual machine scale set
```powershell
# Not supported by extensions framework
```

Get list of installed extensions for Azure virtual machine scale set
```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/<myVmssName>/extensions

# Name              : ApplicationMonitoringWindows
# ResourceGroupName : <myResourceGroup>
# ResourceType      : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/extensions
# Location          :
# ResourceId        : /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/<myVmssName>/extensions/ApplicationMonitoringWindows
```

## Troubleshooting

Below is our step-by-step troubleshooting guide for extension-based monitoring for .NET applications running on Azure VM and Azure virtual machine scale sets.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Core, Java, and Node.js applications are only supported on Azure VM and Azure virtual machine scale sets via manual SDK based instrumentation and therefore the steps below do not apply to these scenarios.

Extension execution output is logged to files found in the following directories:
```Windows
C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics.ApplicationMonitoringWindows\<version>\
```

## Next steps
* Learn how to [deploy an application to an Azure virtual machine scale set](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-deploy-app.md).
* [Set up Availability web tests](monitor-web-app-availability.md) to be alerted if your endpoint is down.
