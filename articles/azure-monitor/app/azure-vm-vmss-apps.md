# Deploy the Azure Monitor Application Insights Agent on Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual machine scale sets

Enabling monitoring on your .NET based web applications running on [Azure virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/) and [Azure virtual machine scale sets](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/index.yml) is now easier than ever. Get all the benefits of using Application Insights without modifying your code.

This article walks you through enabling Application Insights monitoring using the Application Insights Agent and provides preliminary guidance for automating the process for large-scale deployments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Application Insights Agent for ASP.NET applications running on **Azure VMs and VMSS** is currently in public preview. For monitoring your ASP.Net applications running **on-premises**, use the [Azure Application Insights Agent for on-premises servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/status-monitor-v2-overview), which is generally available and fully supported.
> The preview version for Azure VMs and VMSS is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Some features might not be supported, and some might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Enable Application Insights

There are two ways to enable application monitoring for Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual machine scale sets hosted applications:

* **Codeless** via Application Insights Agent
    * This method is the easiest to enable, and no advanced configuration is required. It is often referred to as "runtime" monitoring.

    * For Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual machine scale sets we recommend at a minimum enabling this level of monitoring. After that, based on your specific scenario, you can evaluate whether manual instrumentation is needed.

    * The Application Insights Agent auto-collects the same dependency signals out-of-the-box as the .NET SDK. See [Dependency auto-collection](./auto-collect-dependencies.md#net) to learn more.
        > [!NOTE]
        > Currently only .Net IIS-hosted applications are supported. Use an SDK to instrument ASP.NET Core, Java, and Node.js applications hosted on an Azure virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets.

* **Code-based** via SDK

    * This approach is much more customizable, but it requires [adding a dependency on the Application Insights SDK NuGet packages](./asp-net.md). This method, also means you have to manage the updates to the latest version of the packages yourself.

    * If you need to make custom API calls to track events/dependencies not captured by default with agent-based monitoring, you would need to use this method. Check out the [API for custom events and metrics article](./api-custom-events-metrics.md) to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> If both agent based monitoring and manual SDK based instrumentation is detected only the manual instrumentation settings will be honored. This is to prevent duplicate data from being sent. To learn more about this check out the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.

## Manage Application Insights Agent for .NET applications on Azure virtual machines using PowerShell

> [!NOTE]
> Before installing the Application Insights Agent, you'll need a connection string. [Create a new Application Insights Resource](./create-new-resource.md) or copy the connection string from an existing application insights resource.

> [!NOTE]
> New to powershell? Check out the [Get Started Guide](/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps?view=azps-2.5.0).

Install or update the Application Insights Agent as an extension for Azure virtual machines
```powershell
$publicCfgJsonString = '
{
  "redfieldConfiguration": {
    "instrumentationKeyMap": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "appFilter": ".*",
          "machineFilter": ".*",
          "virtualPathFilter": ".*",
          "instrumentationSettings" : {
            "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
';
$privateCfgJsonString = '{}';

Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "<myVmResourceGroup>" -VMName "<myVmName>" -Location "<myVmLocation>" -Name "ApplicationMonitoring" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics" -Type "ApplicationMonitoringWindows" -Version "2.8" -SettingString $publicCfgJsonString -ProtectedSettingString $privateCfgJsonString
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may install or update the Application Insights Agent as an extension across multiple Virtual Machines at-scale using a Powershell loop.

Uninstall Application Insights Agent extension from Azure virtual machine
```powershell
Remove-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "<myVmResourceGroup>" -VMName "<myVmName>" -Name "ApplicationMonitoring"
```

Query Application Insights Agent extension status for Azure virtual machine
```powershell
Get-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "<myVmResourceGroup>" -VMName "<myVmName>" -Name ApplicationMonitoring -Status
```

Get list of installed extensions for Azure virtual machine
```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceId "/subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myVmResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<myVmName>/extensions"

# Name              : ApplicationMonitoring
# ResourceGroupName : <myVmResourceGroup>
# ResourceType      : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions
# Location          : southcentralus
# ResourceId        : /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myVmResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<myVmName>/extensions/ApplicationMonitoring
```
You may also view installed extensions in the [Azure virtual machine blade](../../virtual-machines/extensions/overview.md) in the Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Verify installation by clicking on Live Metrics Stream within the Application Insights Resource associated with the connection string you used to deploy the Application Insights Agent Extension. If you are sending data from multiple Virtual Machines, select the target Azure virtual machines under Server Name. It may take up to a minute for data to begin flowing.
