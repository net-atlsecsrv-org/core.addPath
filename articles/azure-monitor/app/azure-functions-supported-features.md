# Application Insights for Azure Functions supported features

Azure Functions offers [built-in integration](../../azure-functions/functions-monitoring.md) with Application Insights, which is available through the ILogger Interface. Below is the list of currently supported features. Review Azure Functions' guide for [Getting started](../../azure-functions/configure-monitoring.md#enable-application-insights-integration).

For more information about Functions runtime versions, see [here](../../azure-functions/functions-versions.md).

For more information about compatible versions of Application Insights, see [Dependencies](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights/).

## Performance Counters

Automatic collection of Performance Counters only work Windows machines.


## Live Metrics & Secure Control Channel

The custom filters criteria you specify are sent back to the Live Metrics component in the Application Insights SDK. The filters could potentially contain sensitive information such as customerIDs. You can make the channel secure with a secret API key. See [Secure the control channel](./live-stream.md#secure-the-control-channel) for instructions.

## Sampling

Azure Functions enables Sampling by default in their configuration. For more information, see [Configure Sampling](../../azure-functions/configure-monitoring.md#configure-sampling).

If your project takes a dependency on the Application Insights SDK to do manual telemetry tracking, you may experience strange behavior if your sampling configuration is different than the Functions' sampling configuration. 

We recommend using the same configuration as Functions. With **Functions v2**, you can get the same configuration using dependency injection in your constructor:

```csharp
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;

public class Function1 
{

    private readonly TelemetryClient telemetryClient;

    public Function1(TelemetryConfiguration configuration)
    {
        this.telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(configuration);
    }

    [FunctionName("Function1")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req, ILogger logger)
    {
        this.telemetryClient.TrackTrace("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
    }
}
```
