# Memory leak detection (preview)

Application Insights automatically analyzes the memory consumption of each process in your application, and can warn you about potential memory leaks or increased memory consumption.

This feature requires no special setup, other than [configuring performance counters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-performance-counters) for your app. It's active when your app generates enough memory performance counters telemetry (for example, Private Bytes).

## When would I get this type of smart detection notification?
A typical notification will follow a consistent increase in memory consumption over a long period of time, in one or more processes and/or one or more machines, which are part of your application. Machine learning algorithms are used for detecting increased memory consumption that matches the pattern of a memory leak.

## Does my app really have a problem?
No, a notification doesn't mean that your app definitely has a problem. Although memory leak patterns usually indicate an application issue, these patterns could be typical to your specific process, or could have a natural business justification, and can be ignored.

## How do I fix it?
The notifications include diagnostic information to support in the diagnostic analysis process:
1. **Triage.** The notification shows you the amount of memory increase (in GB), and the time range in which the memory has increased. This can help you assign a priority to the problem.
2. **Scope.** How many machines exhibited the memory leak pattern? How many exceptions were triggered during the potential memory leak? This information can be obtained from the notification.
3. **Diagnose.** The detection contains the memory leak pattern, showing memory consumption of the process over time. You can also use the related items and reports linking to supporting information, to help you further diagnose the issue.
