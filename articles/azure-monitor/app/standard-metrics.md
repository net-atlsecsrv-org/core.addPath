# Application Insights standard metrics

Standard metrics are pre-aggregated during collection, they have better performance at query time. This makes them the best choice for dashboards and real-time alerting.

## Availability metrics

Metrics in the Availability category enable you to see the health of your web application as observed from points around the world. [Configure the availability tests](../app/monitor-web-app-availability.md) to start using any metrics from this category.

### Availability (availabilityResults/availabilityPercentage)
The *Availability* metric shows the percentage of the web test runs that didn't detect any issues. The lowest possible value is 0, which indicates that all of the web test runs have failed. The value of 100 means that all of the web test runs passed the validation criteria.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations|Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Percentage|Average|`Run location`, `Test name`|


### Availability test duration (availabilityResults/duration)

The *Availability test duration* metric shows how much time it took for the web test to run. For the [multi-step web tests](../app/availability-multistep.md), the metric reflects the total execution time of all steps.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations|Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Milliseconds|Average, Min, Max|`Run location`, `Test name`, `Test result`

### Availability tests (availabilityResults/count)

The *Availability tests* metric reflects the count of the web tests runs by Azure Monitor.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations|Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Count|Count|`Run location`, `Test name`, `Test result`|


## Browser metrics

Browser metrics are collected by the Application Insights JavaScript SDK from real end-user browsers. They provide great insights into your users' experience with your web app. Browser metrics are typically not sampled, which means that they provide higher precision of the usage numbers compared to server-side metrics which might be skewed by sampling.

> [!NOTE]
> To collect browser metrics, your application must be instrumented with the [Application Insights JavaScript SDK](../app/javascript.md).

### Browser page load time (browserTimings/totalDuration)

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations| Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|
|Milliseconds|Average, Min, Max|None|

### Client processing time (browserTiming/processingDuration)

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations|Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|
|Milliseconds|Average, Min, Max|None|

### Page load network connect time (browserTimings/networkDuration)

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations| Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|
|Milliseconds|Average, Min, Max|None|

### Receiving response time (browserTimings/receiveDuration)

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations| Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|
|Milliseconds|Average, Min, Max|None|

### Send request time (browserTimings/sendDuration)

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations| Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|
|Milliseconds|Average, Min, Max|None|

## Failure metrics

The metrics in **Failures** show problems with processing requests, dependency calls, and thrown exceptions.

### Browser exceptions (exceptions/browser)

This metric reflects the number of thrown exceptions from your application code running in browser. Only exceptions that are tracked with a ```trackException()``` Application Insights API call are included in the metric.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations | Supported dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|
| Count | Count | `Cloud role name` |

### Dependency call failures (dependencies/failed)

The number of failed dependency calls.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations | Supported dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
|Count|Count| `Cloud role instance`, `Cloud role name`, `Dependency performance`, `Dependency type`, `Is traffic synthetic`, `Result code`, `Rarget of dependency call`.


### Exceptions (exceptions/count)

Each time when you log an exception to Application Insights, there is a call to the [trackException() method](../app/api-custom-events-metrics.md#trackexception) of the SDK. The Exceptions metric shows the number of logged exceptions.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations | Supported dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
|Count|Count|`Cloud role instance`, `Cloud role name`, `Device type`|

### Failed requests (requests/failed)

The count of tracked server requests that were marked as *failed*. By default, the Application Insights SDK automatically marks each server request that returned HTTP response code 5xx or 4xx as a failed request. You can customize this logic by modifying  *success* property of request telemetry item in a [custom telemetry initializer](../app/api-filtering-sampling.md#addmodify-properties-itelemetryinitializer).


|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations | Supported dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
|Count|Count|`Cloud role instance`, `Cloud role name`, `Is synthetic traffic`, `Request performance`, `Result code`|


### Server exceptions (exceptions/server)

This metric shows the number of server exceptions.

|Unit of measure|Supported aggregations | Supported dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
|Count|Count|`Cloud role instance`, `Cloud role name`|

## Performance counters

Use metrics in the **Performance counters** category to access [system performance counters collected by Application Insights](../app/performance-counters.md).
