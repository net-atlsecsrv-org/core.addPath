# System performance counters in Application Insights

Windows provides a wide variety of [performance counters](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/PerfCtrs/about-performance-counters) such as CPU occupancy, memory, disk, and network usage. You can also define your own performance counters. Performance counters collection is supported as long as your application is running under IIS on an on-premises host, or virtual machine to which you have administrative access. Though applications running as Azure Web Apps don't have direct access to performance counters, a subset of available counters are collected by Application Insights.

## View counters

The Metrics pane shows the default set of performance counters.

![Performance counters reported in Application Insights](./media/performance-counters/performance-counters.png)

The current default counters that are configured to be collected for ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core web applications are:
- % Process\\Processor Time
- % Process\\Processor Time Normalized
- Memory\\Available Bytes
- ASP.NET Requests/Sec
- .NET CLR Exceptions Thrown / sec
- ASP.NET ApplicationsRequest Execution Time
- Process\\Private Bytes
- Process\\IO Data Bytes/sec
- ASP.NET Applications\\Requests In Application Queue
- Processor(_Total)\\% Processor Time

## Add counters

If the performance counter you want isn't included in the list of metrics, you can add it.

1. Find out what counters are available in your server by using this PowerShell command on the local server:

    `Get-Counter -ListSet *`

    (See [`Get-Counter`](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh849685.aspx).)
2. Open ApplicationInsights.config.

   * If you added Application Insights to your app during development, edit ApplicationInsights.config in your project, and then redeploy it to your servers.
3. Edit the performance collector directive:

    ```XML

        <Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.PerfCounterCollector.PerformanceCollectorModule, Microsoft.AI.PerfCounterCollector">
          <Counters>
            <Add PerformanceCounter="\Objects\Processes"/>
            <Add PerformanceCounter="\Sales(photo)\# Items Sold" ReportAs="Photo sales"/>
          </Counters>
        </Add>
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> ASP.NET Core applications do not have `ApplicationInsights.config`, and hence the above method is not valid for ASP.NET Core Applications.

You can capture both standard counters and those you've implemented yourself. `\Objects\Processes` is an example of a standard counter that is available on all Windows systems. `\Sales(photo)\# Items Sold` is an example of a custom counter that might be implemented in a web service.

The format is `\Category(instance)\Counter"`, or for categories that don't have instances, just `\Category\Counter`.

`ReportAs` is required for counter names that do not match `[a-zA-Z()/-_ \.]+` - that is, they contain characters that are not in the following sets: letters, round brackets, forward slash, hyphen, underscore, space, dot.

If you specify an instance, it will be collected as a dimension "CounterInstanceName" of the reported metric.

### Collecting performance counters in code for ASP.NET Web Applications or .NET/.NET Core Console Applications
To collect system performance counters and send them to Application Insights, you can adapt the snippet below:


```csharp
    var perfCollectorModule = new PerformanceCollectorModule();
    perfCollectorModule.Counters.Add(new PerformanceCounterCollectionRequest(
      @"\Process([replace-with-application-process-name])\Page Faults/sec", "PageFaultsPerfSec")));
    perfCollectorModule.Initialize(TelemetryConfiguration.Active);
```

Or you can do the same thing with custom metrics you created:

```csharp
    var perfCollectorModule = new PerformanceCollectorModule();
    perfCollectorModule.Counters.Add(new PerformanceCounterCollectionRequest(
      @"\Sales(photo)\# Items Sold", "Photo sales"));
    perfCollectorModule.Initialize(TelemetryConfiguration.Active);
```

### Collecting performance counters in code for ASP.NET Core Web Applications

Modify `ConfigureServices` method in your `Startup.cs` class as below.

```csharp
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.PerfCounterCollector;

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry();

        // The following configures PerformanceCollectorModule.
  services.ConfigureTelemetryModule<PerformanceCollectorModule>((module, o) =>
            {
                // the application process name could be "dotnet" for ASP.NET Core self-hosted applications.
                module.Counters.Add(new PerformanceCounterCollectionRequest(
    @"\Process([replace-with-application-process-name])\Page Faults/sec", "DotnetPageFaultsPerfSec"));
            });
    }
```

## Performance counters in Analytics
You can search and display performance counter reports in [Analytics](../../azure-monitor/app/analytics.md).

The **performanceCounters** schema exposes the `category`, `counter` name, and `instance` name of each performance counter.  In the telemetry for each application, you'll see only the counters for that application. For example, to see what counters are available: 

![Performance counters in Application Insights analytics](./media/performance-counters/analytics-performance-counters.png)

('Instance' here refers to the performance counter instance,  not the role, or server machine instance. The performance counter instance name typically segments counters such as processor time by the name of the process or application.)

To get a chart of available memory over the recent period: 

![Memory timechart in Application Insights analytics](./media/performance-counters/analytics-available-memory.png)

Like other telemetry, **performanceCounters** also has a column `cloud_RoleInstance` that indicates the identity of the host server instance on which your app is running. For example, to compare the performance of your app on the different machines:

## ASP.NET and Application Insights counts

*What's the difference between the Exception rate and Exceptions metrics?*

* *Exception rate* is a system performance counter. The CLR counts all the handled and unhandled exceptions that are thrown, and divides the total in a sampling interval by the length of the interval. The Application Insights SDK collects this result and sends it to the portal.

* *Exceptions* is a count of the TrackException reports received by the portal in the sampling interval of the chart. It includes only the handled exceptions where you have written TrackException calls in your code, and doesn't include all [unhandled exceptions](../../azure-monitor/app/asp-net-exceptions.md). 

## Performance counters for applications running in Azure Web Apps

Both ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core applications deployed to Azure Web Apps run in a special sandbox environment. This environment does not allow direct access to system performance counters. However, a limited subset of counters are exposed as environment variables as described [here](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Perf-Counters-exposed-as-environment-variables). Application Insights SDK for ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core collects performance counters from Azure Web Apps from these special environment variables. Only a subset of counters are available in this environment, and the full list can be found [here.](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet-server/blob/develop/Src/PerformanceCollector/Perf.Shared/Implementation/WebAppPerformanceCollector/CounterFactory.cs)

## Performance counters in ASP.NET Core applications

* [ASP.NET Core SDK](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore) version 2.4.1 and above collects performance counters if the application is running in Azure Web App (Windows)

* SDK version 2.7.0-beta3 and above collects performance counters if the application is running in Windows, and targeting `NETSTANDARD2.0` or higher.
* For applications targeting the .NET Framework, performance counters are supported in all versions of SDK.
* This article will be updated when performance counter support in non-Windows is added.

## Alerts
Like other metrics, you can [set an alert](../../azure-monitor/app/alerts.md) to warn you if a performance counter goes outside a limit you specify. Open the Alerts pane and click Add Alert.
