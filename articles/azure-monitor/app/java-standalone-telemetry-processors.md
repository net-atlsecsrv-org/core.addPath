# Telemetry processors (preview) for Azure Monitor Application Insights Java

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is still under preview.

Java 3.0 Agent for Application Insights now has the capabilities to process telemetry data before the data is exported.

### Some use cases:
 * Mask sensitive data
 * Conditionally add custom dimensions
 * Update the telemetry name used for aggregation and display

### Supported processors:
 * Attribute Processor
 * Span Processor

## To get started

Create a configuration file named `applicationinsights.json`, and place it in the same directory as `applicationinsights-agent-***.jar`, with the following template.

```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "attribute",
        ...
      },
      {
        "type": "attribute",
        ...
      },
      {
        "type": "span",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Include/exclude spans

The attribute processor and the span processor expose the option to provide a set of properties of a span to match against, to determine if the span should be included or excluded from the processor. To configure this option, under `include` and/or `exclude` at least one `matchType` and one of `spanNames` or `attributes` is required. The include/exclude configuration  is supported to have more than one specified condition. All of the specified conditions must evaluate to true for a match to occur. 

**Required field**: 
* `matchType` controls how items in `spanNames` and `attributes` arrays are interpreted. Possible values are `regexp` or `strict`. 

**Optional fields**: 
* `spanNames` must match at least one of the items. 
* `attributes` specifies the list of attributes to match against. All of these attributes must match exactly for a match to occur.

> [!NOTE]
> If both `include` and `exclude` are specified, the `include` properties are checked before the `exclude` properties.

#### Sample usage

The following demonstrates specifying the set of span properties to
indicate which spans this processor should be applied to. The `include` of
properties say which ones should be included and the `exclude` properties
further filter out spans that shouldn't be processed.

```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "attribute",
        "include": {
          "matchType": "strict",
          "spanNames": [
            "svcA",
            "svcB"
          ]
        },
        "exclude": {
          "matchType": "strict",
          "attributes": [
            {
              "key": "redact_trace",
              "value": "false"
            }
          ]
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "key": "credit_card",
            "action": "delete"
          },
          {
            "key": "duplicate_key",
            "action": "delete"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following spans match the properties and processor actions are applied:

* Span1 Name: 'svcB' Attributes: {env: production, test_request: 123, credit_card: 1234, redact_trace: "false"}

* Span2 Name: 'svcA' Attributes: {env: staging, test_request: false, redact_trace: true}

The following spans do not match the include properties and processor actions are not applied:

* Span3 Name: 'svcB' Attributes: {env: production, test_request: true, credit_card: 1234, redact_trace: false}

* Span4 Name: 'svcC' Attributes: {env: dev, test_request: false}

## Attribute processor 

The attributes processor modifies attributes of a span. It optionally supports the ability to include/exclude spans.
It takes a list of actions which are performed in order specified in the configuration file. The supported actions are:

* `insert` : Inserts a new attribute in spans where the key does not already exist
* `update` : Updates an attribute in spans where the key does exist
* `delete` : Deletes an attribute from a span
* `hash`   : Hashes (SHA1) an existing attribute value

For the actions `insert` and `update`
* `key` is required
* one of `value` or `fromAttribute` is required
* `action` is required.

For the `delete` action,
* `key` is required
* `action`: `delete` is required.

For the `hash` action,
* `key` is required
* `action` : `hash` is required.

The list of actions can be composed to create rich scenarios, such as back filling attribute, copying values to a new key, redacting sensitive information.

#### Sample usage

The following example demonstrates inserting keys/values into spans:

```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "attribute",
        "actions": [
          {
            "key": "attribute1",
            "value": "value1",
            "action": "insert"
          },
          {
            "key": "key1",
            "fromAttribute": "anotherkey",
            "action": "insert"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following example demonstrates configuring the processor to only update existing keys in an attribute:

```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "attribute",
        "actions": [
          {
            "key": "piiattribute",
            "value": "redacted",
            "action": "update"
          },
          {
            "key": "credit_card",
            "action": "delete"
          },
          {
            "key": "user.email",
            "action": "hash"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following example demonstrates how to process spans that have a span name that match regexp patterns.
This processor will remove "token" attribute and will obfuscate "password" attribute in spans where span name matches "auth.\*" 
and where span name does not match "login.\*".

```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "attribute",
        "include": {
          "matchType": "regexp",
          "spanNames": [
            "auth.*"
          ]
        },
        "exclude": {
          "matchType": "regexp",
          "spanNames": [
            "login.*"
          ]
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "key": "password",
            "value": "obfuscated",
            "action": "update"
          },
          {
            "key": "token",
            "action": "delete"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Span processors

The span processor modifies either the span name or attributes of a span based on the span name. It optionally supports the ability to include/exclude spans.

### Name a span

The following setting is required as part of the name section:

* `fromAttributes`: The attribute value for the keys are used to create a new name in the order specified in the configuration. All attribute keys needs to be specified in the span for the processor to rename it.

The following setting can be optionally configured:

* `separator`: A string, which is specified will be used to split values
> [!NOTE]
> If renaming is dependent on attributes being modified by the attributes processor, ensure the span processor is specified after the attributes processor in the pipeline specification.

#### Sample usage

The following example specifies the values of attribute "db.svc", "operation", and "id" will form the new name of the span, in that order, separated by the value "::".
```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "span",
        "name": {
          "fromAttributes": [
            "db.svc",
            "operation",
            "id"
          ],
          "separator": "::"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Extract attributes from span name

Takes a list of regular expressions to match span name against and extract attributes from it based on subexpressions. Must be specified under the `toAttributes` section.

The following settings are required:

`rules` : A list of rules to extract attribute values from span name. The values in the span name are replaced by extracted attribute names. Each rule in the list is regex pattern string. Span name is checked against the regex. If the regex matches, all named subexpressions of the regex are extracted as attributes and are added to the span. Each subexpression name becomes an attribute name and subexpression matched portion becomes the attribute value. The matched portion in the span name is replaced by extracted attribute name. If the attributes already exist in the span, they will be overwritten. The process is repeated for all rules in the order they are specified. Each subsequent rule works on the span name that is the output after processing the previous rule.

#### Sample usage

Let's assume the input span name is /api/v1/document/12345678/update. Applying the following results in the output span name /api/v1/document/{documentId}/update will add a new attribute "documentId"="12345678" to the span.
```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "span",
        "name": {
          "toAttributes": {
            "rules": [
              "^/api/v1/document/(?<documentId>.*)/update$"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following demonstrates renaming the span name to "{operation_website}" and adding the attribute {Key: operation_website, Value: oldSpanName } when the span has the following properties:
- The span name contains '/' anywhere in the string.
- The span name is not 'donot/change'.
```json
{
  "connectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "preview": {
    "processors": [
      {
        "type": "span",
        "include": {
          "matchType": "regexp",
          "spanNames": [
            "^(.*?)/(.*?)$"
          ]
        },
        "exclude": {
          "matchType": "strict",
          "spanNames": [
            "donot/change"
          ]
        },
        "name": {
          "toAttributes": {
            "rules": [
              "(?<operation_website>.*?)$"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
