# Set up Azure Monitor for your Python application

Azure Monitor supports distributed tracing, metric collection, and logging of Python applications through integration with [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io). This article walks you through the process of setting up OpenCensus for Python and sending your monitoring data to Azure Monitor.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- Python installation. This article uses [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/), although other versions will likely work with minor changes. The SDK only supports Python v2.7 and v3.4-v3.7.
- Create an Application Insights [resource](./create-new-resource.md). You'll be assigned your own instrumentation key (ikey) for your resource.

## Instrument with OpenCensus Python SDK for Azure Monitor

Install the OpenCensus Azure Monitor exporters:

```console
python -m pip install opencensus-ext-azure
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `python -m pip install opencensus-ext-azure` command assumes that you have a `PATH` environment variable set for your Python installation. If you haven't configured this variable, you need to give the full directory path to where your Python executable is located. The result is a command like this: `C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe -m pip install opencensus-ext-azure`.

The SDK uses three Azure Monitor exporters to send different types of telemetry to Azure Monitor. They're trace, metrics, and logs. For more information on these telemetry types, see [the data platform overview](../platform/data-platform.md). Use the following instructions to send these telemetry types via the three exporters.

## Telemetry type mappings

Here are the exporters that OpenCensus provides mapped to the types of telemetry that you see in Azure Monitor.

| Pillar of observability | Telemetry type in Azure Monitor    | Explanation                                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Logs                    | Traces,  exceptions,  customEvents   | Log telemetry,  exception telemetry,  event telemetry |
| Metrics                 | customMetrics,  performanceCounters | Custom metrics  performance counters                |
| Tracing                 | Requests  dependencies             | Incoming requests,  outgoing requests                |

### Logs

1. First, let's generate some local log data.

    ```python
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def valuePrompt():
        line = input("Enter a value: ")
        logger.warning(line)

    def main():
        while True:
            valuePrompt()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

1. The code continuously asks for a value to be entered. A log entry is emitted for every entered value.

    ```output
    Enter a value: 24
    24
    Enter a value: 55
    55
    Enter a value: 123
    123
    Enter a value: 90
    90
    ```

1. Although entering values is helpful for demonstration purposes, ultimately we want to emit the log data to Azure Monitor. Pass your connection string directly into the exporter. Or, you can specify it in an environment variable, `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`. Modify your code from the previous step based on the following code sample:

    ```python
    import logging
    from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # TODO: replace the all-zero GUID with your instrumentation key.
    logger.addHandler(AzureLogHandler(
        connection_string='InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')
    )

    def valuePrompt():
        line = input("Enter a value: ")
        logger.warning(line)

    def main():
        while True:
            valuePrompt()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

1. The exporter sends log data to Azure Monitor. You can find the data under `traces`. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this context, `traces` isn't the same as `tracing`. Here, `traces` refers to the type of telemetry that you'll see in Azure Monitor when you utilize `AzureLogHandler`. But `tracing` refers to a concept in OpenCensus and relates to [distributed tracing](./distributed-tracing.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The root logger is configured with the level of WARNING. That means any logs that you send that have less of a severity are ignored, and in turn, won't be sent to Azure Monitor. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.setLevel).

1. You can also add custom properties to your log messages in the *extra* keyword argument by using the custom_dimensions field. These properties appear as key-value pairs in `customDimensions` in Azure Monitor.
    > [!NOTE]
    > For this feature to work, you need to pass a dictionary to the custom_dimensions field. If you pass arguments of any other type, the logger ignores them.

    ```python
    import logging

    from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    # TODO: replace the all-zero GUID with your instrumentation key.
    logger.addHandler(AzureLogHandler(
        connection_string='InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')
    )

    properties = {'custom_dimensions': {'key_1': 'value_1', 'key_2': 'value_2'}}

    # Use properties in logging statements
    logger.warning('action', extra=properties)
    ```

#### Configure logging for Django applications

You can configure logging explicitly in your application code like above for your Django applications, or you can specify it in Django's logging configuration. This code can go into whatever file you use for Django settings configuration. For how to configure Django settings, see [Django settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/settings/). For more information on configuring logging, see [Django logging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/logging/).

```json
LOGGING = {
    "handlers": {
        "azure": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
        "class": "opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter.AzureLogHandler",
            "instrumentation_key": "<your-ikey-here>",
         },
        "console": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "stream": sys.stdout,
         },
      },
    "loggers": {
        "logger_name": {"handlers": ["azure", "console"]},
    },
}
```

Be sure you use the logger with the same name as the one specified in your configuration.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("logger_name")
logger.warning("this will be tracked")
```

#### Send exceptions

OpenCensus Python doesn't automatically track and send `exception` telemetry. They're sent through `AzureLogHandler` by using exceptions through the Python logging library. You can add custom properties just like with normal logging.

```python
import logging

from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# TODO: replace the all-zero GUID with your instrumentation key.
logger.addHandler(AzureLogHandler(
    connection_string='InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')
)

properties = {'custom_dimensions': {'key_1': 'value_1', 'key_2': 'value_2'}}

# Use properties in exception logs
try:
    result = 1 / 0  # generate a ZeroDivisionError
except Exception:
    logger.exception('Captured an exception.', extra=properties)
```
Because you must log exceptions explicitly, it's up to the user how they want to log unhandled exceptions. OpenCensus doesn't place restrictions on how a user wants to do this, as long as they explicitly log an exception telemetry.

#### Send events

You can send `customEvent` telemetry in exactly the same way that you send `trace` telemetry except by using `AzureEventHandler` instead.

```python
import logging

from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureEventHandler

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.addHandler(AzureEventHandler(connection_string='InstrumentationKey=<your-instrumentation_key-here>'))
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.info('Hello, World!')
```

#### Sampling

For information on sampling in OpenCensus, take a look at [sampling in OpenCensus](sampling.md#configuring-fixed-rate-sampling-for-opencensus-python-applications).

#### Log correlation

For details on how to enrich your logs with trace context data, see OpenCensus Python [logs integration](./correlation.md#log-correlation).

#### Modify telemetry

For details on how to modify tracked telemetry before it's sent to Azure Monitor, see OpenCensus Python [telemetry processors](./api-filtering-sampling.md#opencensus-python-telemetry-processors).


### Metrics

1. First, let's generate some local metric data. We'll create a simple metric to track the number of times the user selects the **Enter** key.

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    from opencensus.stats import aggregation as aggregation_module
    from opencensus.stats import measure as measure_module
    from opencensus.stats import stats as stats_module
    from opencensus.stats import view as view_module
    from opencensus.tags import tag_map as tag_map_module

    stats = stats_module.stats
    view_manager = stats.view_manager
    stats_recorder = stats.stats_recorder

    prompt_measure = measure_module.MeasureInt("prompts",
                                               "number of prompts",
                                               "prompts")
    prompt_view = view_module.View("prompt view",
                                   "number of prompts",
                                   [],
                                   prompt_measure,
                                   aggregation_module.CountAggregation())
    view_manager.register_view(prompt_view)
    mmap = stats_recorder.new_measurement_map()
    tmap = tag_map_module.TagMap()

    def prompt():
        input("Press enter.")
        mmap.measure_int_put(prompt_measure, 1)
        mmap.record(tmap)
        metrics = list(mmap.measure_to_view_map.get_metrics(datetime.utcnow()))
        print(metrics[0].time_series[0].points[0])

    def main():
        while True:
            prompt()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
1. Running the code repeatedly prompts you to select **Enter**. A metric is created to track the number of times **Enter** is selected. With each entry, the value is incremented and the metric information appears in the console. The information includes the current value and the current time stamp when the metric was updated.

    ```output
    Press enter.
    Point(value=ValueLong(5), timestamp=2019-10-09 20:58:04.930426)
    Press enter.
    Point(value=ValueLong(6), timestamp=2019-10-09 20:58:06.570167)
    Press enter.
    Point(value=ValueLong(7), timestamp=2019-10-09 20:58:07.138614)
    ```

1. Although entering values is helpful for demonstration purposes, ultimately we want to emit the metric data to Azure Monitor. Pass your connection string directly into the exporter. Or, you can specify it in an environment variable, `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`. Modify your code from the previous step based on the following code sample:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    from opencensus.ext.azure import metrics_exporter
    from opencensus.stats import aggregation as aggregation_module
    from opencensus.stats import measure as measure_module
    from opencensus.stats import stats as stats_module
    from opencensus.stats import view as view_module
    from opencensus.tags import tag_map as tag_map_module

    stats = stats_module.stats
    view_manager = stats.view_manager
    stats_recorder = stats.stats_recorder

    prompt_measure = measure_module.MeasureInt("prompts",
                                               "number of prompts",
                                               "prompts")
    prompt_view = view_module.View("prompt view",
                                   "number of prompts",
                                   [],
                                   prompt_measure,
                                   aggregation_module.CountAggregation())
    view_manager.register_view(prompt_view)
    mmap = stats_recorder.new_measurement_map()
    tmap = tag_map_module.TagMap()

    # TODO: replace the all-zero GUID with your instrumentation key.
    exporter = metrics_exporter.new_metrics_exporter(
        connection_string='InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')

    view_manager.register_exporter(exporter)

    def prompt():
        input("Press enter.")
        mmap.measure_int_put(prompt_measure, 1)
        mmap.record(tmap)
        metrics = list(mmap.measure_to_view_map.get_metrics(datetime.utcnow()))
        print(metrics[0].time_series[0].points[0])

    def main():
        while True:
            prompt()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

1. The exporter sends metric data to Azure Monitor at a fixed interval. The default is every 15 seconds. We're tracking a single metric, so this metric data, with whatever value and time stamp it contains, is sent every interval. You can find the data under `customMetrics`.

#### Performance counters

By default, the metrics exporter sends a set of performance counters to Azure Monitor. You can disable this by setting the `enable_standard_metrics` flag to `False` in the constructor of the metrics exporter.

```python
...
exporter = metrics_exporter.new_metrics_exporter(
  enable_standard_metrics=False,
  connection_string='InstrumentationKey=<your-instrumentation-key-here>')
...
```

These performance counters are currently sent:

- Available Memory (bytes)
- CPU Processor Time (percentage)
- Incoming Request Rate (per second)
- Incoming Request Average Execution Time (milliseconds)
- Process CPU Usage (percentage)
- Process Private Bytes (bytes)

You should be able to see these metrics in `performanceCounters`. For more information, see [performance counters](./performance-counters.md).

#### Modify telemetry

For information on how to modify tracked telemetry before it's sent to Azure Monitor, see OpenCensus Python [telemetry processors](./api-filtering-sampling.md#opencensus-python-telemetry-processors).

### Tracing

> [!NOTE]
> In OpenCensus, `tracing` refers to [distributed tracing](./distributed-tracing.md). The `AzureExporter` sends `requests` and `dependency` telemetry to Azure Monitor.

1. First, let's generate some trace data locally. In Python IDLE, or your editor of choice, enter the following code:

    ```python
    from opencensus.trace.samplers import ProbabilitySampler
    from opencensus.trace.tracer import Tracer

    tracer = Tracer(sampler=ProbabilitySampler(1.0))

    def valuePrompt():
        with tracer.span(name="test") as span:
            line = input("Enter a value: ")
            print(line)

    def main():
        while True:
            valuePrompt()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

1. Running the code repeatedly prompts you to enter a value. With each entry, the value is printed to the shell. The OpenCensus Python Module generates a corresponding piece of `SpanData`. The OpenCensus project defines a [trace as a tree of spans](https://opencensus.io/core-concepts/tracing/).
    
    ```output
    Enter a value: 4
    4
    [SpanData(name='test', context=SpanContext(trace_id=8aa41bc469f1a705aed1bdb20c342603, span_id=None, trace_options=TraceOptions(enabled=True), tracestate=None), span_id='15ac5123ac1f6847', parent_span_id=None, attributes=BoundedDict({}, maxlen=32), start_time='2019-06-27T18:21:22.805429Z', end_time='2019-06-27T18:21:44.933405Z', child_span_count=0, stack_trace=None, annotations=BoundedList([], maxlen=32), message_events=BoundedList([], maxlen=128), links=BoundedList([], maxlen=32), status=None, same_process_as_parent_span=None, span_kind=0)]
    Enter a value: 25
    25
    [SpanData(name='test', context=SpanContext(trace_id=8aa41bc469f1a705aed1bdb20c342603, span_id=None, trace_options=TraceOptions(enabled=True), tracestate=None), span_id='2e512f846ba342de', parent_span_id=None, attributes=BoundedDict({}, maxlen=32), start_time='2019-06-27T18:21:44.933405Z', end_time='2019-06-27T18:21:46.156787Z', child_span_count=0, stack_trace=None, annotations=BoundedList([], maxlen=32), message_events=BoundedList([], maxlen=128), links=BoundedList([], maxlen=32), status=None, same_process_as_parent_span=None, span_kind=0)]
    Enter a value: 100
    100
    [SpanData(name='test', context=SpanContext(trace_id=8aa41bc469f1a705aed1bdb20c342603, span_id=None, trace_options=TraceOptions(enabled=True), tracestate=None), span_id='f3f9f9ee6db4740a', parent_span_id=None, attributes=BoundedDict({}, maxlen=32), start_time='2019-06-27T18:21:46.157732Z', end_time='2019-06-27T18:21:47.269583Z', child_span_count=0, stack_trace=None, annotations=BoundedList([], maxlen=32), message_events=BoundedList([], maxlen=128), links=BoundedList([], maxlen=32), status=None, same_process_as_parent_span=None, span_kind=0)]
    ```

1. Although entering values is helpful for demonstration purposes, ultimately we want to emit `SpanData` to Azure Monitor. Pass your connection string directly into the exporter. Or, you can specify it in an environment variable, `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`. Modify your code from the previous step based on the following code sample:

    ```python
    from opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter import AzureExporter
    from opencensus.trace.samplers import ProbabilitySampler
    from opencensus.trace.tracer import Tracer

    # TODO: replace the all-zero GUID with your instrumentation key.
    tracer = Tracer(
        exporter=AzureExporter(
            connection_string='InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'),
        sampler=ProbabilitySampler(1.0),
    )

    def valuePrompt():
        with tracer.span(name="test") as span:
            line = input("Enter a value: ")
            print(line)

    def main():
        while True:
            valuePrompt()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

1. Now when you run the Python script, you should still be prompted to enter values, but only the value is being printed in the shell. The created `SpanData` is sent to Azure Monitor. You can find the emitted span data under `dependencies`. For more information about outgoing requests, see OpenCensus Python [dependencies](./opencensus-python-dependency.md).
For more information on incoming requests, see OpenCensus Python [requests](./opencensus-python-request.md).

#### Sampling

For information on sampling in OpenCensus, take a look at [sampling in OpenCensus](sampling.md#configuring-fixed-rate-sampling-for-opencensus-python-applications).

#### Trace correlation

For more information on telemetry correlation in your trace data, take a look at OpenCensus Python [telemetry correlation](./correlation.md#telemetry-correlation-in-opencensus-python).

#### Modify telemetry

For more information on how to modify tracked telemetry before it's sent to Azure Monitor, see OpenCensus Python [telemetry processors](./api-filtering-sampling.md#opencensus-python-telemetry-processors).

## Configure Azure Monitor exporters

As shown, there are three different Azure Monitor exporters that support OpenCensus. Each one sends different types of telemetry to Azure Monitor. To see what types of telemetry each exporter sends, see the following list.

Each exporter accepts the same arguments for configuration, passed through the constructors. You can see details about each one here:

- `connection_string`: The connection string used to connect to your Azure Monitor resource. Takes priority over `instrumentation_key`.
- `enable_standard_metrics`: Used for `AzureMetricsExporter`. Signals the exporter to send [performance counter](../platform/app-insights-metrics.md#performance-counters) metrics automatically to Azure Monitor. Defaults to `True`.
- `export_interval`: Used to specify the frequency in seconds of exporting.
- `instrumentation_key`: The instrumentation key used to connect to your Azure Monitor resource.
- `logging_sampling_rate`: Used for `AzureLogHandler`. Provides a sampling rate [0,1.0] for exporting logs. Defaults to 1.0.
- `max_batch_size`: Specifies the maximum size of telemetry that's exported at once.
- `proxies`: Specifies a sequence of proxies to use for sending data to Azure Monitor. For more information, see [proxies](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies).
- `storage_path`: A path to where the local storage folder exists (unsent telemetry). As of `opencensus-ext-azure` v1.0.3, the default path is the OS temp directory + `opencensus-python` + `your-ikey`. Prior to v1.0.3, the default path is $USER + `.opencensus` + `.azure` + `python-file-name`.

## View your data with queries

You can view the telemetry data that was sent from your application through the **Logs (Analytics)** tab.

![Screenshot of the overview pane with "Logs (Analytics)" selected in a red box](./media/opencensus-python/0010-logs-query.png)

In the list under **Active**:

- For telemetry sent with the Azure Monitor trace exporter, incoming requests appear under `requests`. Outgoing or in-process requests appear under `dependencies`.
- For telemetry sent with the Azure Monitor metrics exporter, sent metrics appear under `customMetrics`.
- For telemetry sent with the Azure Monitor logs exporter, logs appear under `traces`. Exceptions appear under `exceptions`.

For more detailed information about how to use queries and logs, see [Logs in Azure Monitor](../platform/data-platform-logs.md).
