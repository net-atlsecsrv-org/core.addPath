# React plugin for Application Insights JavaScript SDK

React plugin for the Application Insights JavaScript SDK, enables:

- Tracking of route changes
- React components usage statistics

## Getting started

Install npm package:

```bash

npm install @microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js

```

## Basic usage

Initialize a connection to Application Insights:

```javascript
// AppInsights.js
import { ApplicationInsights } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';
import { ReactPlugin } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

const browserHistory = createBrowserHistory({ basename: '' });
const reactPlugin = new ReactPlugin();
const appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({
    config: {
        instrumentationKey: 'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE',
        extensions: [reactPlugin],
        extensionConfig: {
          [reactPlugin.identifier]: { history: browserHistory }
        }
    }
});
appInsights.loadAppInsights();
export { reactPlugin, appInsights };
```

Wrap your component with the higher-order component function to enable Application Insights on it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { withAITracking } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js';
import { reactPlugin, appInsights } from './AppInsights';

// To instrument various React components usage tracking, apply the `withAITracking` higher-order
// component function.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    ...
}

export default withAITracking(reactPlugin, appInsights, MyComponent);
```

## Configuration

| Name    | Default | Description                                                                                                    |
|---------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| history | null    | React router history. For more information, see the [react-router package documentation](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/history). To learn how to access the history object outside of components, see the [React-router FAQ](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-do-i-access-the-history-object-outside-of-components)    |

### React components usage tracking

To instrument various React components usage tracking, apply the `withAITracking` higher-order component function.

It will measure time from the `ComponentDidMount` event through the `ComponentWillUnmount` event. However, in order to make this more accurate, it will subtract the time in which the user was idle `React Component Engaged Time = ComponentWillUnmount timestamp - ComponentDidMount timestamp - idle time`.

To see this metric in the Azure portal you need to navigate to the Application Insights resource, select the "Metrics" tab and configure the empty charts to display custom metric name "React Component Engaged Time (seconds)", select aggregation (sum, avg, etc.) of your metric and apply split be "Component Name".

You can also run custom queries to divide Application Insights data to generate report and visualizations as per your requirements. In the Azure portal navigate to the Application Insights resource, select "Analytics" from the top menu of the Overview tab and run your query.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 10 minutes for new custom metrics to appear in the Azure Portal.

## Using React Hooks

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) are an approach to state and life-cycle management in a React application without relying on class-based React components. The Application Insights React plugin provides a number of Hooks integrations that operate in a similar way to the higher-order component approach.

### Using React Context

The React Hooks for Application Insights are designed to use [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) as a containing aspect for it. To use Context, initialize Application Insights as above, and then import the Context object:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { AppInsightsContext } from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js";
import { reactPlugin } from "./AppInsights";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <AppInsightsContext.Provider value={reactPlugin}>
            /* your application here */
        </AppInsightsContext.Provider>
    );
};
```

This Context Provider will make Application Insights available as a `useContext` Hook within all children components of it.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAppInsightsContext } from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js";

const MyComponent = () => {
    const appInsights = useAppInsightsContext();
    
    appInsights.trackMetric("Component 'MyComponent' is in use");
    
    return (
        <h1>My Component</h1>
    );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

### `useTrackMetric`

The `useTrackMetric` Hook replicates the functionality of the `withAITracking` higher-order component, without adding an additional component to the component structure. The Hook takes two arguments, first is the Application Insights instance (which can be obtained from the `useAppInsightsContext` Hook), and an identifier for the component for tracking (such as its name).

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAppInsightsContext, useTrackMetric } from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js";

const MyComponent = () => {
    const appInsights = useAppInsightsContext();
    const trackComponent = useTrackMetric(appInsights, "MyComponent");
    
    return (
        <h1 onHover={trackComponent} onClick={trackComponent}>My Component</h1>
    );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

It will operate like the higher-order component, but respond to Hooks life-cycle events, rather than a component life-cycle. The Hook needs to be explicitly provided to user events if there is a need to run on particular interactions.

### `useTrackEvent`

The `useTrackEvent` Hook is used to track any custom event that an application may need to track, such as a button click or other API call. It takes two arguments, the first is the Application Insights instance (which can be obtained from the `useAppInsightsContext` Hook), and a name for the event.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useAppInsightsContext, useTrackEvent } from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js";

const ProductCart = () => {
    const appInsights = useAppInsightsContext();
    const trackCheckout = useTrackEvent(appInsights, "Checkout");
    const trackCartUpdate = useTrackEvent(appInsights, "Cart Updated");
    const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        trackCartUpdate({ cartCount: cart.length });
    }, [cart]);
    
    const performCheckout = () => {
        trackCheckout();
        // submit data
    };
    
    return (
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Product 1 <button onClick={() => setCart([...cart, "Product 1"])}>Add to Cart</button>
                <li>Product 2 <button onClick={() => setCart([...cart, "Product 2"])}>Add to Cart</button>
                <li>Product 3 <button onClick={() => setCart([...cart, "Product 3"])}>Add to Cart</button>
                <li>Product 4 <button onClick={() => setCart([...cart, "Product 4"])}>Add to Cart</button>
            </ul>
            <button onClick={performCheckout}>Checkout</button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

When the Hook is used, a data payload can be provided to it to add additional data to the event when it is stored in Application Insights.

## React Error Boundaries

[Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) provide a way to gracefully handle an exception when it occurs within a React application, and when such error occurs it's likely that the exception needs to be logged. The React Plugin for Application Insights provides an Error Boundary component that will automatically log the error when it occurs.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { reactPlugin } from "./AppInsights";
import { AppInsightsErrorBoundary } from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <AppInsightsErrorBoundary onError={() => <h1>I believe something went wrong</h1>} appInsights={reactPlugin}>
            /* app here */
        </AppInsightsErrorBoundary>
    );
};
```

The `AppInsightsErrorBoundary` requires two props to be passed to it, the `ReactPlugin` instance created for the application and a component to be rendered when an error occurs. When an unhandled error occurs, `trackException` is called with the information provided to the Error Boundary and the `onError` component is displayed.
