# Application Insights Agent API: Enable-InstrumentationEngine

This article describes a cmdlet that's a member of the [Az.ApplicationMonitor PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.ApplicationMonitor/).

## Description

Enables the instrumentation engine by setting some registry keys.
Restart IIS for the changes to take effect.

The instrumentation engine can supplement data collected by the .NET SDKs.
It collects events and messages that describe the execution of a managed process. These events and messages include dependency result codes, HTTP verbs, and [SQL command text](asp-net-dependencies.md#advanced-sql-tracking-to-get-full-sql-query).

Enable the instrumentation engine if:
- You've already enabled monitoring with the Enable cmdlet but didn't enable the instrumentation engine.
- You've manually instrumented your app with the .NET SDKs and want to collect additional telemetry.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This cmdlet requires a PowerShell session with Admin permissions.

> [!NOTE] 
> - This cmdlet requires that you review and accept our license and privacy statement.
> - The instrumentation engine adds additional overhead and is off by default.

## Examples

```powershell
PS C:\> Enable-InstrumentationEngine
```

## Parameters

### -AcceptLicense
**Optional.** Use this switch to accept the license and privacy statement in headless installations.

### -Verbose
**Common parameter.** Use this switch to output detailed logs.

## Output

## Next steps

  View your telemetry:
 - [Explore metrics](../../azure-monitor/app/metrics-explorer.md) to monitor performance and usage.
- [Search events and logs](../../azure-monitor/app/diagnostic-search.md) to diagnose problems.
- Use [analytics](../../azure-monitor/app/analytics.md) for more advanced queries.
- [Create dashboards](../../azure-monitor/app/overview-dashboard.md).
 
 Add more telemetry:
 - [Create web tests](monitor-web-app-availability.md) to make sure your site stays live.
- [Add web client telemetry](../../azure-monitor/app/javascript.md) to see exceptions from web page code and to enable trace calls.
- [Add the Application Insights SDK to your code](../../azure-monitor/app/asp-net.md) so you can insert trace and log calls.
 
 Do more with Application Insights Agent:
 - Use our guide to [troubleshoot](status-monitor-v2-troubleshoot.md) Application Insights Agent.
 - [Get the config](status-monitor-v2-api-get-config.md) to confirm that your settings were recorded correctly.
 - [Get the status](status-monitor-v2-api-get-status.md) to inspect monitoring.
