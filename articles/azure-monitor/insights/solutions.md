# Monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor

Monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor provide analysis of the operation of a particular Azure application or service. This article provides a brief overview of monitoring solutions in Azure and details on using and installing them. You can add monitoring solutions to Azure Monitor for any applications and services that you use. They're typically available at no cost but collect data that could invoke usage charges.

## Use monitoring solutions

The solutions **Overview** page in Azure Monitor displays a tile for each solution installed in a Log Analytics workspace. To open this page, go to **Azure Monitor** in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com). Under the **Insights** menu, select **More** to open the **Insights Hub**, and then click on **Log Analytics workspaces**.

[![Insights Hub](media/solutions/insights-hub.png)](media/solutions/insights-hub.png#lightbox)


Use the dropdown boxes at the top of the screen to change the workspace or the time range used for the tiles. Click on the tile for a solution to open its view that includes more detailed analysis its collected data.

Monitoring solutions can contain multiple types of Azure resources, and you can view any resources included with a solution just like any other resource. For example, any log queries included in the solution are listed under **Solution Queries** in [Query explorer](../log-query/get-started-portal.md#load-queries) You can use those queries when performing ad hoc analysis with [log queries](../log-query/log-query-overview.md).

## List installed monitoring solutions

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Use the following procedure to list the monitoring solutions installed in your subscription.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com). Search for and select **Solutions**.
1. Solutions installed in all your workspaces are listed. The name of the solution is followed by the name of the workspace it's installed in.
1. Use the dropdown boxes at the top of the screen to filter by subscription or resource group.

### Install a solution from the community

Members of the community can submit management solutions to Azure Quickstart Templates. You can install these solutions directly or download them templates for later installation.

1. Follow the process described in [Log Analytics workspace and Automation account](#log-analytics-workspace-and-automation-account) to link a workspace and account.
2. Go to [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/).
3. Search for a solution that you're interested in.
4. Select the solution from the results to view its details.
5. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button.
6. You're prompted to provide information such as the resource group and location in addition to values for any parameters in the solution.
7. Click **Purchase** to install the solution.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

### Prepare your environment

1. Install the Azure CLI

   You need to [install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) before running CLI reference commands.  If you prefer, you can also use Azure Cloud Shell to complete the steps in this article.  Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment that you use through your browser.  Start Cloud Shell by using one of these methods:

   - Open Cloud Shell by going to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com)

   - Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu bar at the upper right corner in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

1. Sign in.

   If you're using a local install of the CLI, sign in using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.  Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Install the `log-analytics-solution` extension

   The `log-analytics-solution` command is an experimental extension of the core Azure CLI. Learn more about extension references in [Use extension with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview?).

   ```azurecli
   az extension add --name log-analytics-solution
   ```

   The following warning is expected.

   ```output
   The installed extension `log-analytics-solution` is experimental and not covered by customer support.  Please use with discretion.
   ```

### Install a solution with the Azure CLI

When you install a solution, you must select a [Log Analytics workspace](../platform/manage-access.md) where the solution will be installed and where its data will be collected.  With the Azure CLI, you manage workspaces by using the [az monitor log-analytics workspace](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace) reference commands.  Follow the process described in [Log Analytics workspace and Automation account](#log-analytics-workspace-and-automation-account) to link a workspace and account.

Use the [az monitor log-analytics solution create](/cli/azure/ext/log-analytics-solution/monitor/log-analytics/solution) to install a monitoring solution.  Parameters in square brackets are optional.

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics solution create --name
                                         --plan-product
                                         --plan-publisher
                                         --resource-group
                                         --workspace
                                         [--no-wait]
                                         [--tags]
```

Here is a code sample that creates a log-analytics solution for the plan product of OMSGallery/Containers.

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics solution create --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
                                         --name Containers({SolutionName}) \
                                         --tags key=value \
                                         --plan-publisher Microsoft  \
                                         --plan-product "OMSGallery/Containers" \
                                         --workspace "/subscriptions/{SubID}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/ \
                                           Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{WorkspaceName}"
```

## Log Analytics workspace and Automation account

All monitoring solutions require a [Log Analytics workspace](../platform/manage-access.md) to store data collected by the solution and to host its log searches and views. Some solutions also require an [Automation account](../../automation/automation-security-overview.md) to contain runbooks and related resources. The workspace and account must meet the following requirements.

* Each installation of a solution can only use one Log Analytics workspace and one Automation account. You can install the solution separately into multiple workspaces.
* If a solution requires an Automation account, then the Log Analytics workspace and Automation account must be linked to one another. A Log Analytics workspace may only be linked to one Automation account, and an Automation account may only be linked to one Log Analytics workspace.

When you install a solution through Azure Marketplace, you're prompted for a workspace and Automation account. The link between them is created if they aren't already linked.

### Verify the link between a Log Analytics workspace and Automation account

You can verify the link between a Log Analytics workspace and an Automation account using the following procedure.

1. Select the Automation account in the Azure portal.
1. Scroll to the **Related Resources** section of the menu and select **Linked workspace**.
1. If the **Workspace** is linked to an Automation account, then this page lists the workspace it is linked to. If you select the name of the workspace listed, you are redirected to the overview page for that workspace.

## Remove a monitoring solution

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

To remove an installed solution using the portal, locate it in the [list of installed solutions](#list-installed-monitoring-solutions). Click on the name of the solution to open its summary page and then click on **Delete**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To remove an installed solution using the Azure CLI, use the [az monitor log-analytics solution delete](/cli/azure/ext/log-analytics-solution/monitor/log-analytics/solution#ext-log-analytics-solution-az-monitor-log-analytics-solution-delete) command.

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics solution delete --name
                                         --resource-group
                                         [--no-wait]
                                         [--yes]
```
