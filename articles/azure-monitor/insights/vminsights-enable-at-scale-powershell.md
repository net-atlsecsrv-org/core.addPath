# Enable Azure Monitor for VMs (preview) using Azure PowerShell or Resource Manager template

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

This article explains how to enable Azure Monitor for VMs (preview) for Azure virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets using Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. At the end of this process you will have successfully begun monitoring all of your virtual machines and learn if any are experiencing performance or availability issues. 

## Set up a Log Analytics workspace 

If you don't have a Log Analytics workspace, create one by reviewing the methods that are suggested in the [Prerequisites](vminsights-enable-overview.md#log-analytics) section before proceeding with the steps to configure it in order to complete the deployment of Azure Monitor for VMs using the Azure Resource Manager template method.

### Enable performance counters

If the Log Analytics workspace that's referenced by the solution isn't already configured to collect the performance counters required by the solution, you need to enable them. You can do so in either of two ways:
* Manually, as described in [Windows and Linux performance data sources in Log Analytics](../../azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-performance-counters.md)
* By downloading and running a PowerShell script that's available from [Azure PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters/1.1)

### Install the ServiceMap and InfrastructureInsights solutions
This method includes a JSON template that specifies the configuration for enabling the solution components in your Log Analytics workspace.

If you're unfamiliar with deploying resources by using a template, see:
* [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md)
* [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and the Azure CLI](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-cli.md)

If you choose to use the Azure CLI, you first need to install and use the CLI locally. You must be running the Azure CLI version 2.0.27 or later. To identify your version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade the Azure CLI, see [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

1. Copy and paste the following JSON syntax into your file:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "WorkspaceName": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "WorkspaceLocation": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "resources": [
            {
                "apiVersion": "2017-03-15-preview",

                "name": "[parameters('WorkspaceName')]",
                "location": "[parameters('WorkspaceLocation')]",
                "resources": [
                    {
                        "apiVersion": "2015-11-01-preview",
                        "location": "[parameters('WorkspaceLocation')]",
                        "name": "[concat('ServiceMap', '(', parameters('WorkspaceName'),')')]",
                        "type": "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions",
                        "dependsOn": [
                            "[concat('Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/', parameters('WorkspaceName'))]"
                        ],
                        "properties": {
                            "workspaceResourceId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/', parameters('WorkspaceName'))]"
                        },

                        "plan": {
                            "name": "[concat('ServiceMap', '(', parameters('WorkspaceName'),')')]",
                            "publisher": "Microsoft",
                            "product": "[Concat('OMSGallery/', 'ServiceMap')]",
                            "promotionCode": ""
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "apiVersion": "2015-11-01-preview",
                        "location": "[parameters('WorkspaceLocation')]",
                        "name": "[concat('InfrastructureInsights', '(', parameters('WorkspaceName'),')')]",
                        "type": "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions",
                        "dependsOn": [
                            "[concat('Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/', parameters('WorkspaceName'))]"
                        ],
                        "properties": {
                            "workspaceResourceId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/', parameters('WorkspaceName'))]"
                        },
                        "plan": {
                            "name": "[concat('InfrastructureInsights', '(', parameters('WorkspaceName'),')')]",
                            "publisher": "Microsoft",
                            "product": "[Concat('OMSGallery/', 'InfrastructureInsights')]",
                            "promotionCode": ""
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Save this file as *installsolutionsforvminsights.json* to a local folder.

1. Capture the values for *WorkspaceName*, *ResourceGroupName*, and *WorkspaceLocation*. The value for *WorkspaceName* is the name of your Log Analytics workspace. The value for *WorkspaceLocation* is the region the workspace is defined in.

1. You're ready to deploy this template.
 
    * Use the following PowerShell commands in the folder that contains the template:

        ```powershell
        New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name DeploySolutions -TemplateFile InstallSolutionsForVMInsights.json -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -WorkspaceName <WorkspaceName> -WorkspaceLocation <WorkspaceLocation - example: eastus>
        ```

        The configuration change can take a few minutes to complete. When it's complete, a message is displayed that's similar to the following and includes the result:

        ```powershell
        provisioningState       : Succeeded
        ```

    * To run the following command by using the Azure CLI:
    
        ```azurecli
        az login
        az account set --subscription "Subscription Name"
        az group deployment create --name DeploySolutions --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --template-file InstallSolutionsForVMInsights.json --parameters WorkspaceName=<workspaceName> WorkspaceLocation=<WorkspaceLocation - example: eastus>
        ```

The configuration change can take a few minutes to complete. When it's completed, a message is displayed that's similar to the following and includes the result:

```azurecli
provisioningState       : Succeeded
```

## Enable with Azure Resource Manager template
We have created example Azure Resource Manager templates for onboarding your virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets. These templates include scenarios for enabling monitoring on an existing resource and for creating a new resource that will have monitoring enabled.

>[!NOTE]
>The template needs to be deployed in the same resource group as the resource to be onboarded.

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of deploying resources by using a template, see:
* [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md)
* [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and the Azure CLI](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-cli.md)

If you choose to use the Azure CLI, you first need to install and use the CLI locally. You must be running the Azure CLI version 2.0.27 or later. To identify your version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade the Azure CLI, see [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

### Download templates

The Azure Resource Manager templates are provided in an archive file (.zip) that you can [download](https://aka.ms/VmInsightsARMTemplates) from our GitHub repo. Contents of the file include folders representing each deployment scenario with a template and parameter file. Before running, modify the parameters file and specify the values required. Do not modify the template file unless you need to customize it to support your particular requirements. After you have modified the parameter file you can deploy it using the following methods described later in this article. 

The download file contains the following templates for different scenarios:

- **ExistingVmOnboarding** template enables Azure Monitor for VMs if the virtual machines already exists.
- **NewVmOnboarding** template creates a virtual machine and enables Azure Monitor for VMs to monitor it.
- **ExistingVmssOnboarding** template enables Azure Monitor for VMs if the virtual machine scale set already exists.
- **NewVmssOnboarding** template creates a virtual machine scale sets and enables Azure Monitor for VMs to monitor them.
- **ConfigureWorksapce*** template configures your Log Analytics workspace to support Azure Monitor for VMs by enabling the solutions and collection of Linux and Windows operating system performance counters.

>[!NOTE]
>If virtual machine scale sets were already present and the upgrade policy is set to **Manual**, Azure Monitor for VMs will not be enabled for instances by default after running the **ExistingVmssOnboarding** Azure Resource Manager template. You have to manually upgrade the instances.

### Deploy using Azure PowerShell

The following step enables monitoring using Azure PowerShell.

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name OnboardCluster -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -TemplateFile <Template.json> -TemplateParameterFile <Parameters.json>
```
The configuration change can take a few minutes to complete. When it's completed, a message is displayed that's similar to the following and includes the result:

```powershell
provisioningState       : Succeeded
```
### Deploy using Azure CLI

The following step enables monitoring using Azure CLI.   

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription "Subscription Name"
az group deployment create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --template-file <Template.json> --parameters <Parameters.json>
```

The output will resemble the following:

```azurecli
provisioningState       : Succeeded
```

## Enable with PowerShell

To enable Azure Monitor for VMs for multiple VMs or virtual machine scale sets, you can use the PowerShell script [Install-VMInsights.ps1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Install-VMInsights/1.0), available from the Azure PowerShell Gallery. This script iterates through every virtual machine and virtual machine scale set in your subscription, in the scoped resource group that's specified by *ResourceGroup*, or to a single VM or virtual machine scale set that's specified by *Name*. For each VM or virtual machine scale set, the script verifies whether the VM extension is already installed. If the VM extension is not installed, the script tries to reinstall it. If the VM extension is installed, the script installs the Log Analytics and Dependency agent VM extensions.

This script requires Azure PowerShell module Az version 1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

To get a list of the script's argument details and example usage, run `Get-Help`.

```powershell
Get-Help .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -Detailed
