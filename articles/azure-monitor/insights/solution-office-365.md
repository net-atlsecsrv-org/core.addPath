# Office 365 management solution in Azure (Preview)

![Office 365 logo](media/solution-office-365/icon.png)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Solution update
> This solution has been replaced by the [Office 365](../../sentinel/connect-office-365.md) General Availability solution in [Azure Sentinel](../../sentinel/overview.md) and the [Azure AD reporting and monitoring solution](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/plan-monitoring-and-reporting.md). Together they provide an updated version of the previous Azure Monitor Office 365 solution with an improved configuration experience. You can continue to use the existing solution until April 30, 2020.
> 
> Azure Sentinel is a cloud native Security Information and Event Management solution that ingests logs and provides additional SIEM functionality including detections, investigations, hunting and machine learning driven insights. Using Azure Sentinel will now provide you with ingestion of Office 365 SharePoint activity and Exchange management logs.
> 
> Azure AD reporting provides a more comprehensive view of logs from Azure AD activity in your environment, including sign in events, audit events, and changes to your directory. To connect Azure AD logs, you can use either the [Azure Sentinel Azure AD connector](../../sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory.md) or configure [Azure AD logs integration with Azure Monitor](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics.md). 
>
> The collection of Azure AD log is subjected to Azure Monitor pricing.  See [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for more information.
>
> To use the Azure Sentinel Office 365 solution:
> 1. Using Office 365 connector in Azure Sentinel affects the pricing for your workspace. For more information, see [Azure Sentinel pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-sentinel/).
> 2. If you are already using the Azure Monitor Office 365 solution, you must first uninstall it using the script in the [Uninstall section below](#uninstall).
> 3. [Enable the Azure Sentinel solution](../../sentinel/quickstart-onboard.md) on your workspace.
> 4. Go to the **Data connectors** page in Azure Sentinel and enable the **Office 365** connector.
>
> ## Frequently asked questions
> 
> ### Q: Is it possible to on-board the Office 365 Azure Monitor solution between now and April 30th?
> No, the Azure Monitor Office 365 solution onboarding scripts are no longer available. The solution will be removed on April 30th.
> 
> ### Q: Will the tables and schemas be changed?
> The **OfficeActivity** table name and schema will remain the same as in the current solution. You can continue using the same queries in the new solution excluding queries that reference Azure AD data.
> 
> The new [Azure AD reporting and monitoring solution](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/plan-monitoring-and-reporting.md) logs will be ingested into the [SigninLogs](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md) and [AuditLogs](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md) tables instead of **OfficeActivity**. For more information, see [how to analyze Azure AD logs](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-analyze-activity-logs-log-analytics.md), which is also relevant for Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor users.
> 
> Following are samples for converting queries from **OfficeActivity** to **SigninLogs**:
> 
> **Query failed sign-ins, by user:**
> 
> ```Kusto
> OfficeActivity
> | where TimeGenerated >= ago(1d) 
> | where OfficeWorkload == "AzureActiveDirectory"                      
> | where Operation == 'UserLoginFailed'
> | summarize count() by UserId	
> ```
> 
> ```Kusto
> SigninLogs
> | where ConditionalAccessStatus == "failure" or ConditionalAccessStatus == "notApplied"
> | summarize count() by UserDisplayName
> ```
> 
> **View Azure AD operations:**
> 
> ```Kusto
> OfficeActivity
> | where OfficeWorkload =~ "AzureActiveDirectory"
> | sort by TimeGenerated desc
> | summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Operation
> ```
> 
> ```Kusto
> AuditLogs
> | summarize count() by OperationName
> ```
> 
> ### Q: How can I on-board Azure Sentinel?
> Azure Sentinel is a solution that you can enable on new or existing Log Analytics workspace. To learn more, see [Azure Sentinel on-boarding documentation](../../sentinel/quickstart-onboard.md).
>
> ### Q: Do I need Azure Sentinel to connect the Azure AD logs?
> You can configure [Azure AD logs integration with Azure Monitor](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics.md), which is not related to the Azure Sentinel solution. Azure Sentinel provides a native connector and out-of-the box content for Azure AD logs. For more information, see the question below on out-of-the-box security-oriented content.
>
> ###	Q: What are the differences when connecting Azure AD logs from Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor?
> Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor connect to Azure AD logs based on the same [Azure AD reporting and monitoring solution](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/plan-monitoring-and-reporting.md). Azure Sentinel provides a one-click, native connector that connects the same data and provides monitoring information.
>
> ###	Q: What do I need to change when moving to the new Azure AD reporting and monitoring tables?
> All queries using Azure AD data, including queries in alerts, dashboards, and any content that you created using Office 365 Azure AD data, must be recreated using the new tables.
>
> Azure Sentinel and Azure AD provide built-in content that you can use when moving to the Azure AD reporting and monitoring solution. For more information, see the next question on out-of-the-box security-oriented content and [How to use Azure Monitor workbooks for Azure Active Directory reports](../../active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-use-azure-monitor-workbooks.md). 
>
> ### Q: How I can use the Azure Sentinel out-of-the-box security-oriented content?
> Azure Sentinel provides out-of-the-box security-oriented dashboards, custom alert queries, hunting queries, investigation, and automated response capabilities based on the Office 365 and Azure AD logs. Explore the Azure Sentinel GitHub and tutorials to learn more:
>
> - [Detect threats out-of-the-box](../../sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-built-in.md)
> - [Create custom analytic rules to detect suspicious threats](../../sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-custom.md)
> - [Monitor your data](../../sentinel/tutorial-monitor-your-data.md)
> - [Investigate incidents with Azure Sentinel](../../sentinel/tutorial-investigate-cases.md)
> - [Set up automated threat responses in Azure Sentinel](../../sentinel/tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md)
> - [Azure Sentinel GitHub community](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks)
> 
> ### Q: Does Azure Sentinel provide additional connectors as part of the solution?
> Yes, see [Azure Sentinel connect data sources](../../sentinel/connect-data-sources.md).
> 
> ###	Q: What will happen on April 30? Do I need to offboard beforehand?
> 
> - You won’t be able to receive data from the **Office365** solution. The solution will no longer be available in the Marketplace
> - For Azure Sentinel customers, the Log Analytics workspace solution **Office365** will be included in the Azure Sentinel **SecurityInsights** solution.
> - If you don’t offboard your solution manually, your data will be disconnected automatically on April 30.
> 
> ### Q: Will my data transfer to the new solution?
> Yes. When you remove the **Office 365** solution from your workspace, its data will become temporarily unavailable because the schema is removed. When you enable the new **Office 365** connector in Sentinel, the schema is restored to the workspace and any data already collected will become available. 
 

The Office 365 management solution allows you to monitor your Office 365 environment in Azure Monitor.

- Monitor user activities on your Office 365 accounts to analyze usage patterns as well as identify behavioral trends. For example, you can extract specific usage scenarios, such as files that are shared outside your organization or the most popular SharePoint sites.
- Monitor administrator activities to track configuration changes or high privilege operations.
- Detect and investigate unwanted user behavior, which can be customized for your organizational needs.
- Demonstrate audit and compliance. For example, you can monitor file access operations on confidential files, which can help you with the audit and compliance process.
- Perform operational troubleshooting by using [log queries](../log-query/log-query-overview.md) on top of Office 365 activity data of your organization.


## Uninstall

You can remove the Office 365 management solution using the process in [Remove a management solution](solutions.md#remove-a-monitoring-solution). This will not stop data being collected from Office 365 into Azure Monitor though. Follow the procedure below to unsubscribe from Office 365 and stop collecting data.

1. Save the following script as *office365_unsubscribe.ps1*.

    $global:authResultARM.Wait()
    $authHeader = $global:authResultARM.Result.CreateAuthorizationHeader()
    $authHeader
    }
    
    Function Office-UnSubscribe-Call{
    
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    $authHeader = $global:authResultARM.Result.CreateAuthorizationHeader()
    $ResourceName = "https://manage.office.com"
    $SubscriptionId   = $Subscription[0].Subscription.Id
    $OfficeAPIUrl = $ARMResource + 'subscriptions/' + $SubscriptionId + '/resourceGroups/' + $ResourceGroupName + '/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/' + $WorkspaceName + '/datasources/office365datasources_'  + $SubscriptionId + $OfficeTennantId + '?api-version=2015-11-01-preview'
    
    $Officeparams = @{

    }
    
    #GetDetails 
    RESTAPI-Auth -ErrorAction Stop
    Office-UnSubscribe-Call -ErrorAction Stop
    ```

2. Run the script with the following command:

    ```
    .\office365_unsubscribe.ps1 -WorkspaceName <Log Analytics workspace name> -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group name> -SubscriptionId <Subscription ID> -OfficeTennantID <Tenant ID> 
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    .\office365_unsubscribe.ps1 -WorkspaceName MyWorkspace -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -SubscriptionId '60b79d74-f4e4-4867-b631-yyyyyyyyyyyy' -OfficeTennantID 'ce4464f8-a172-4dcf-b675-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
    ```

You will be prompted for credentials. Provide the credentials for your Log Analytics workspace.

## Data collection

It may take a few hours for data to initially be collected. Once it starts collecting, Office 365 sends a [webhook notification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office-365/office-365-management-activity-api-reference#receiving-notifications) with detailed data to Azure Monitor each time a record is created. This record is available in Azure Monitor within a few minutes after being received.

## Using the solution

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-solutions-overview-page](../../../includes/azure-monitor-solutions-overview-page.md)]

When you add the Office 365 solution to your Log Analytics workspace, the **Office 365** tile will be added to your dashboard. This tile displays a count and graphical representation of the number of computers in your environment and their update compliance.<br><br>
![Office 365 Summary Tile](media/solution-office-365/tile.png)  

Click on the **Office 365** tile to open the **Office 365** dashboard.

![Office 365 Dashboard](media/solution-office-365/dashboard.png)  

The dashboard includes the columns in the following table. Each column lists the top ten alerts by count matching that column's criteria for the specified scope and time range. You can run a log search that provides the entire list by clicking See all at the bottom of the column or by clicking the column header.

| Column | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Operations | Provides information about the active users from your all monitored Office 365 subscriptions. You will also be able to see the number of activities that happen over time.
| Exchange | Shows the breakdown of Exchange Server activities such as Add-Mailbox Permission, or Set-Mailbox. |
| SharePoint | Shows the top activities that users perform on SharePoint documents. When you drill down from this tile, the search page shows the details of these activities, such as the target document and the location of this activity. For example, for a File Accessed event, you will be able to see the document that’s being accessed, its associated account name, and IP address. |
| Azure Active Directory | Includes top user activities, such as Reset User Password and Login Attempts. When you drill down, you will be able to see the details of these activities like the Result Status. This is mostly helpful if you want to monitor suspicious activities on your Azure Active Directory. |




## Azure Monitor log records
