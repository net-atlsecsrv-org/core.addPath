# Region mappings supported by Azure Monitor for containers

 When enabling Azure Monitor for containers, only certain regions are supported for linking a Log Analytics workspace and an AKS cluster, and collecting custom metrics submitted to Azure Monitor.

## Log Analytics workspace supported mappings

The AKS cluster resources or Log Analytics workspace can reside in other regions, and the following table shows our mappings.

|**AKS Cluster region** | **Log Analytics Workspace region** |

<sup>1</sup> Due to capacity restraints, the region isn't available when creating new resources. This includes a Log Analytics workspace. However, preexisting linked resources in the region should continue to work.

## Custom metrics supported regions

Collecting metrics from Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) clusters nodes and pods are supported for publishing as custom metrics only in the following [Azure regions](../platform/metrics-custom-overview.md#supported-regions).

## Next steps

To begin monitoring your AKS cluster, review [How to enable the Azure Monitor for containers](container-insights-onboard.md) to understand the requirements and available methods to enable monitoring.
