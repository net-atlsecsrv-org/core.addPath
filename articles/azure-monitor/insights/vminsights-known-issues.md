# Known issues with Azure Monitor for VMs (preview)

This article covers known issues with Azure Monitor for VMs, a solution in Azure that combines health, discovery of application components, and performance monitoring of the Azure VM operating system. 

## Health 
The following are known issues with the current release of the Health feature:

- If an Azure VM is removed or deleted, it's displayed in the VM list view for sometime. Additionally, clicking the state of a removed or deleted VM opens the **Health Diagnostics** view and then initiates a loading loop. Selecting the name of the deleted VM opens a pane with a message stating that the VM has been deleted.
- Configuration changes, such as updating a threshold, take up to 30 minutes even if the portal or Workload Monitor API might update them immediately. 
- The Health Diagnostics experience updates faster than the other views. The information might be delayed when you switch between them. 
- For Linux VMs, the title of the page listing the health criteria for a single VM view has the entire domain name of the VM instead of the user-defined VM name. 
- After you disable monitoring for a VM using one of the supported methods and you try deploying it again, you should deploy it in the same workspace. If you choose a different workspace and try to view the health state for that VM, it might show inconsistent behavior.
- After removing the solution components from your workspace, you may continue to see health state from your Azure VMs; specifically performance and map data when you navigate to either view in the portal. Data will eventually stop appearing from the Performance and Map view after sometime; however the Health view will continue to show health status for your VMs. The **Try now** option will be available to re-onboard from Performance and Map views only.
