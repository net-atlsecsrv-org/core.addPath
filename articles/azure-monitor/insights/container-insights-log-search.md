# How to query logs from Azure Monitor for containers

Azure Monitor for containers collects performance metrics, inventory data, and health state information from container hosts and containers. The data is collected every three minutes and forwarded to the Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor. This data is available for [query](../log-query/log-query-overview.md) in Azure Monitor. You can apply this data to scenarios that include migration planning, capacity analysis, discovery, and on-demand performance troubleshooting.

## Container records

In the following table, details of the records collected by Azure Monitor for containers are provided. 

| Data | Data source | Data type | Fields |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Container inventory | Kubelet | `ContainerInventory` | TimeGenerated, Computer, container name, ContainerHostname, Image, ImageTag, ContainerState, ExitCode, EnvironmentVar, Command, CreatedTime, StartedTime, FinishedTime, SourceSystem, ContainerID, ImageID |
| Container log | Docker | `ContainerLog` | TimeGenerated, Computer, image ID, container name, LogEntrySource, LogEntry, SourceSystem, ContainerID |

| Services in the Kubernetes cluster | Kube API | `KubeServices` | TimeGenerated, ServiceName_s, Namespace_s, SelectorLabels_s, ClusterId_s, ClusterName_s, ClusterIP_s, ServiceType_s, SourceSystem | 
| Performance metrics for nodes part of the Kubernetes cluster | Usage metrics are obtained from cAdvisor and limits from Kube api | Perf &#124; where ObjectName == "K8SNode" | Computer, ObjectName, CounterName &#40;cpuAllocatableNanoCores, memoryAllocatableBytes, cpuCapacityNanoCores, memoryCapacityBytes, memoryRssBytes, cpuUsageNanoCores, memoryWorkingsetBytes, restartTimeEpoch&#41;, CounterValue, TimeGenerated, CounterPath, SourceSystem | 
| Performance metrics for containers part of the Kubernetes cluster | Usage metrics are obtained from cAdvisor and limits from Kube api | Perf &#124; where ObjectName == "K8SContainer" | CounterName &#40; cpuRequestNanoCores, memoryRequestBytes, cpuLimitNanoCores, memoryWorkingSetBytes, restartTimeEpoch, cpuUsageNanoCores, memoryRssBytes&#41;, CounterValue, TimeGenerated, CounterPath, SourceSystem | 
| Custom Metrics ||`InsightsMetrics` | Computer, Name, Namespace, Origin, SourceSystem, Tags<sup>1</sup>, TimeGenerated, Type, Va, _ResourceId | 

<sup>1</sup> The *Tags* property represents [multiple dimensions](../platform/data-platform-metrics.md#multi-dimensional-metrics) for the corresponding metric. For more information about the metrics collected and stored in the `InsightsMetrics` table and a description of the record properties, see [InsightsMetrics overview](https://github.com/microsoft/OMS-docker/blob/vishwa/june19agentrel/docs/InsightsMetrics.md).

## Search logs to analyze data

Azure Monitor Logs can help you look for trends, diagnose bottlenecks, forecast, or correlate data that can help you determine whether the current cluster configuration is performing optimally. Pre-defined log searches are provided for you to immediately start using or to customize to return the information the way you want.

You can perform interactive analysis of data in the workspace by selecting the **View Kubernetes event logs** or **View container logs** option in the preview pane from the **View in analytics** drop-down list. The **Log Search** page appears to the right of the Azure portal page that you were on.

![Analyze data in Log Analytics](./media/container-insights-analyze/container-health-log-search-example.png)

The container logs output that's forwarded to your workspace are STDOUT and STDERR. Because Azure Monitor is monitoring Azure-managed Kubernetes (AKS), Kube-system is not collected today because of the large volume of generated data. 

### Example log search queries

It's often useful to build queries that start with an example or two and then modify them to fit your requirements. To help build more advanced queries, you can experiment with the following sample queries:

| Query | Description | 
|-------|-------------|
| ContainerInventory<br> &#124; project Computer, Name, Image, ImageTag, ContainerState, CreatedTime, StartedTime, FinishedTime<br> &#124; render table | List all of a container's lifecycle information| 
| KubeEvents_CL<br> &#124; where not(isempty(Namespace_s))<br> &#124; sort by TimeGenerated desc<br> &#124; render table | Kubernetes events|
| ContainerImageInventory<br> &#124; summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Image, ImageTag, Running | Image inventory | 
| **Select the Line chart display option**:<br> Perf<br> &#124; where ObjectName == "K8SContainer" and CounterName == "cpuUsageNanoCores" &#124; summarize AvgCPUUsageNanoCores = avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 30m), InstanceName | Container CPU | 
| **Select the Line chart display option**:<br> Perf<br> &#124; where ObjectName == "K8SContainer" and CounterName == "memoryRssBytes" &#124; summarize AvgUsedRssMemoryBytes = avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 30m), InstanceName | Container memory |
| InsightsMetrics<br> &#124; where Name == "requests_count"<br> &#124; summarize Val=any(Val) by TimeGenerated=bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)<br> &#124; sort by TimeGenerated asc<br> &#124; project RequestsPerMinute = Val - prev(Val), TimeGenerated <br> &#124; render barchart  | Requests Per Minute with Custom Metrics |

## Query Prometheus metrics data

The following example is a Prometheus metrics query showing disk reads per second per disk per node.

```
InsightsMetrics
| where Namespace == 'container.azm.ms/diskio'
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where Name == 'reads'
| extend Tags = todynamic(Tags)
| extend HostName = tostring(Tags.hostName), Device = Tags.name
| extend NodeDisk = strcat(Device, "/", HostName)
| order by NodeDisk asc, TimeGenerated asc
| serialize
| extend PrevVal = iif(prev(NodeDisk) != NodeDisk, 0.0, prev(Val)), PrevTimeGenerated = iif(prev(NodeDisk) != NodeDisk, datetime(null), prev(TimeGenerated))
| where isnotnull(PrevTimeGenerated) and PrevTimeGenerated != TimeGenerated
| extend Rate = iif(PrevVal > Val, Val / (datetime_diff('Second', TimeGenerated, PrevTimeGenerated) * 1), iif(PrevVal == Val, 0.0, (Val - PrevVal) / (datetime_diff('Second', TimeGenerated, PrevTimeGenerated) * 1)))
| where isnotnull(Rate)
| project TimeGenerated, NodeDisk, Rate
| render timechart

```

To view Prometheus metrics scraped by Azure Monitor filtered by Namespace, specify "prometheus". Here is a sample query to view Prometheus metrics from the `default` kubernetes namespace.

```
InsightsMetrics 
| where Namespace == "prometheus"
| extend tags=parse_json(Tags)
| summarize count() by Name
```

Prometheus data can also be directly queried by name.

```
InsightsMetrics 
| where Namespace == "prometheus"
| where Name contains "some_prometheus_metric"
```

### Query config or scraping errors

To investigate any configuration or scraping errors, the following example query returns informational events from the `KubeMonAgentEvents` table.

```
KubeMonAgentEvents | where Level != "Info" 
```

The output shows results similar to the following example:
