### Verify that the virtual machine meets configuration requirements

1. Verify that the virtual machine is an Azure virtual machine. Azure Arc for servers is not currently supported.
2. Verify that the virtual machine is running a [supported operating system](vminsights-health-enable.md?current-limitations.md).
3. Verify that the virtual machine is installed in a [supported region](vminsights-health-enable.md?current-limitations.md).
4. Verify that the Log Analytics workspace is installed in a [supported region](vminsights-health-enable.md?current-limitations.md).

### Verify that the VM is properly onboarded
Verify that the Azure Monitor agent extension and Guest VM Health agent are successfully provisioned on the virtual machine. Select **Extensions** from the virtual machine's menu in the Azure portal and make sure that the two agents are listed.

### Verify the system assigned identity is enabled on the virtual machine
Verify that the system assigned identity is enabled on the virtual machine. Select **Identity** from the virtual machine's menu in the Azure portal. If user managed identity is enabled, regardless of the status of the system managed identity, Azure Monitor agent will not be able to communicate with the configuration service, and the guest health extension will not work.

### Verify data collection rule
Verify that the data collection rule specifying health extension as a data source is associated with the virtual machine.
