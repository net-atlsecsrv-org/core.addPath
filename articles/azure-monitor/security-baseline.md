# Azure security baseline for Azure Monitor

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Monitor. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Monitor. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Monitor have been excluded. 

 
To see how Azure Monitor completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Monitor security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Private Link to allow access to Azure SaaS Services (for example, Azure Monitor) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet.

To allow traffic to reach Azure Monitor, use the "AzureMonitor" service tags to allow inbound and outbound traffic through network security groups. To allow Availability Monitoring test traffic to reach Azure Monitor, use the "ApplicationInsightsAvailability" service tag to all inbound traffic through network security groups. To allow alert notifications to reach customer endpoints, use the "ActionGroup" service tag to allow inbound traffic through network security groups.

Virtual network rules enable Azure Monitor to only accept communications that are sent from selected subnets inside a virtual network.

Use Log Analytics gateway to send data to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor on behalf of the computers that cannot directly connect to the internet preventing need of computers to be connected to internet.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Azure Monitor is a core service and does not support deploying directly into a virtual network, its underlying infrastructure is handled by Microsoft. However, for resources that make network connections to the Azure Monitor offering, secure their network with a network security group. Enable network security group flow logs and send logs into a Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send flow logs to a Log Analytics Workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

When using Azure Monitor with Private Link, you get access to network logging such as 'Data processed by the Private Endpoint (IN/OUT)'.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: To allow traffic to reach Azure Monitor, use the "AzureMonitor" service tags to allow inbound and outbound traffic through Network Security Groups. To allow availability monitoring test traffic to reach Azure Monitor, use the "ApplicationInsightsAvailability" service tag to all inbound traffic through network security groups. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

## Data Recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Manager to export the Azure Monitor and related resources in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) template which can be used as backup for Azure Monitor and related configurations.  Use Azure Automation to run the backup scripts automatically.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Use Azure DevOps to securely store and manage your code like custom Azure policies, Azure Resource Manager templates. To protect resources you manage in Azure DevOps, you can grant or deny permissions to specific users, built-in security groups, or groups defined in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) if integrated with Azure DevOps, or Active Directory if integrated with TFS.  Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to protect customer-managed keys.

Additionally, Enable Soft-Delete and purge protection in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion. If Azure Storage is used to store Azure Resource Manager template backups, enable soft delete to save and recover your data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

- [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
