# Monitoring usage and estimated costs in Azure Monitor

> [!NOTE]
> This article, describes how to view usage and estimated costs across multiple Azure monitoring features for different pricing models. Related articles for specific components of Azure Monitor include:
> - [Manage usage and costs with Azure Monitor Logs](manage-cost-storage.md) describes how to control your costs by changing your data retention period, and how to analyze and alert on your data usage.
> - [Manage usage and costs for Application Insights](../../azure-monitor/app/pricing.md) describes how to analyze data usage in Application Insights.

In the Monitor hub of the Azure portal, the **Usage and estimated costs** page explains the usage of core monitoring features such as [alerting, metrics, notifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/), [Azure Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/), and [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-insights/). For customers on the pricing plans available before April 2018, this also includes Log Analytics usage purchased through the Insights and Analytics offer.

On this page, users can view their resource usage for the past 31 days, aggregated per subscription. Drill-ins show usage trends over the 31-day period. A lot of data needs to come together for this estimate, so please be patient as the page loads.

This example shows monitoring usage and an estimate of the resulting costs:

Select the link in the monthly usage column to open a chart that shows usage trends over the last 31-day period:

Here’s another similar usage and cost summary. This example shows a subscription in the new April 2018 consumption-based pricing model. Note the lack of any node-based billing. Data ingestion and retention for Log Analytics and Application Insights are now reported on a new common meter.

## Pricing model

In April 2018, a [new monitoring pricing model was released](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-a-new-way-to-purchase-azure-monitoring-services/).  This features cloud-friendly, consumption-based pricing ("Pay-As-You-Go"). You only pay for what you use, without node-based commitments. Details of the new pricing model are available for [alerting, metrics, notifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/), [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/) and [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-insights/). 

In addition to the Pay-As-You-Go model, in September 2019, we added Capacity Reservations for Log Analytics which enable you to save as much as 25% compared to the Pay-As-You-Go price. The capacity reservation pricing enables you to buy a reservation starting at 100 GB/day. Any usage above the reservation level will be billed at the Pay-As-You-Go rate. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) about Capacity Reservation pricing.

For customers onboarding to Log Analytics or Application Insights after April 2, 2018, the new pricing model is the only option. For customers who already use these services, moving to the new pricing model is optional.

## Assessing the impact of the new pricing model
The new pricing model will have different impacts on each customer based on their monitoring usage patterns. For customers who were using Log Analytics or Application Insights before April 2, 2018, the **Usage and estimated cost** page in Azure Monitor estimates any change in costs if they move to the new pricing model. It provides the way to move a subscription into the new model. For most customers, the new pricing model will be advantageous. For customers with especially high data usage patterns or in higher-cost regions, this may not be the case.

To see an estimate of your costs for the subscriptions that you chose on the **Usage and estimated costs** page, select the blue banner near the top of the page. It’s best to do this one subscription at a time, because that's the level at which the new pricing model can be adopted.

The new page shows a similar version of the prior page with a green banner:

![Monitor usage and estimated costs in current pricing model screenshot](./media/usage-estimated-costs/005.png)

The page also shows a different set of meters that correspond to the new pricing model. This list is an example:

- Insight and Analytics\Overage per Node
- Insight and Analytics\Included per Node
- Application Insights\Basic Overage Data
- Application Insights\Included Data

The new pricing model doesn't have node-based included data allocations. Therefore, these data ingestion meters are combined into a new common data ingestion meter called **Shared Services\Data Ingestion**. 

There's another change to data ingested into Log Analytics or Application Insights in regions with higher costs. Data for these high-cost regions will be shown with the new regional meters. An example is **Data Ingestion (US West Central)**.

> [!NOTE]
> The per subscription estimated costs do not factor into the account-level per node entitlements of the Operations Management Suite (OMS) subscription. Consult your account representative for a more in-depth discussion of the new pricing model in this case.

## New pricing model and Operations Management Suite subscription entitlements

Customers who purchased Microsoft Operations Management Suite E1 and E2 are eligible for per-node data ingestion entitlements for [Log Analytics](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite) and [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-pricing). To receive these entitlements for Log Analytics workspaces or Application Insights resources in a given subscription: 

- The subscription's pricing model must remain in the pre-April 2018 model.
- Log Analytics workspaces should use the "Per-node (OMS)" pricing tier.
- Application Insights resources should use the "Enterprise" pricing plan.

Depending on the number of nodes of the suite that your organization purchased, moving some subscriptions to the new pricing model could be advantageous, but this requires careful consideration. In general, it is advisable simply to stay in the pre-April 2018 model as described above.

> [!WARNING]
> If your organization has purchased the Microsoft Operations Management Suite E1 and E2, it is usually best to keep your subscriptions in the pre-April 2018 pricing model. 
>

## Changes when you're moving to the new pricing model

The new pricing model simplifies Log Analytics and Application Insights pricing options to only a single tier (or plan). Moving a subscription into the new pricing model will:

- Change the pricing tier for each Log Analytics to a new Per-GB tier (called “pergb2018” in Azure Resource Manager)
- Any Application Insights resources in the Enterprise plan is changed to the Basic plan.

The cost estimation shows the effects of these changes.

> [!WARNING]
> Here an important note if you use Azure Resource Manager or PowerShell to deploy [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-template-workspace-configuration) or [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-powershell) in a subscription you have moved to the new pricing model. If you specify a pricing tier/plan other than the “pergb2018” for Log Analytics or “Basic” for Application Insights, rather than failing the deployment due to specifying an invalid pricing tier/plan, it will succeed **but it will use only the valid pricing tier/plan** (This does not apply to the Log Analytics Free tier where an invalid pricing tier message is generated).

## Moving to the new pricing model

If you’ve decided to adopt the new pricing model for a given subscription, go to each Application Insights resource, open the **Usage and estimated costs** and be sure that it is in the Basic pricing tier, and go to each Log Analytics workspace, open each the **Pricing tier** page and change to the **Per GB (2018)** pricing tier. 

> [!NOTE]
> The requirement that all Application Insights resources and Log Analytics workspaces within a given subscription adopt the newest pricing model has now been removed, allowing greater flexability and easier configuration. 

## Automate moving to the new pricing model

As noted above, the is no longer a requirement to move all monitoring resources in a subscription to the new pricing model at the same time, and hence the ``migratetonewpricingmodel`` action will no longer have any effect. Now you can move Application Insights resources and Log Analytics workspaces separately into the newest pricing tiers.  

Automating this change is documented for Application Insights using [Set-AzureRmApplicationInsightsPricingPlan](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.applicationinsights/set-azurermapplicationinsightspricingplan) with ``-PricingPlan "Basic"`` 
and Log Analytics using [Set-AzureRmOperationalInsightsWorkspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureRM.OperationalInsights/Set-AzureRmOperationalInsightsWorkspace) with ``-sku "PerGB2018"``.
