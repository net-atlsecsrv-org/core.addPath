# Collecting custom JSON data sources with the Log Analytics agent for Linux in Azure Monitor
[!INCLUDE [log-analytics-agent-note](../../../includes/log-analytics-agent-note.md)]

Custom JSON data sources can be collected into [Azure Monitor](data-platform.md) using the Log Analytics agent for Linux.  These custom data sources can be simple scripts returning JSON such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or one of [FluentD's 300+ plugins](https://www.fluentd.org/plugins/all). This article describes the configuration required for this data collection.


> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics agent for Linux v1.1.0-217+ is required for Custom JSON Data

## Configuration

### Configure input plugin

To collect JSON data in Azure Monitor, add `oms.api.` to the start of a FluentD tag in an input plugin.

For example, following is a separate configuration file `exec-json.conf` in `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/conf/omsagent.d/`.  This uses the FluentD plugin `exec` to run a curl command every 30 seconds.  The output from this command is collected by the JSON output plugin.

```
<source>
  type exec
  command 'curl localhost/json.output'
  format json
  tag oms.api.httpresponse
  run_interval 30s
</source>

<match oms.api.httpresponse>
  type out_oms_api
  log_level info

  buffer_chunk_limit 5m
  buffer_type file
  buffer_path /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/state/out_oms_api_httpresponse*.buffer
  buffer_queue_limit 10
  flush_interval 20s
  retry_limit 10
  retry_wait 30s
</match>
```
The configuration file added under `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/conf/omsagent.d/` will require to have its ownership changed with the following command.

`sudo chown omsagent:omiusers /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/conf/omsagent.d/exec-json.conf`

### Configure output plugin 
Add the following output plugin configuration to the main configuration in `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/conf/omsagent.conf` or as a separate configuration file placed in `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/conf/omsagent.d/`

```
<match oms.api.**>
  type out_oms_api
  log_level info

  buffer_chunk_limit 5m
  buffer_type file
  buffer_path /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/state/out_oms_api*.buffer
  buffer_queue_limit 10
  flush_interval 20s
  retry_limit 10
  retry_wait 30s
</match>
```

### Restart Log Analytics agent for Linux
Restart the Log Analytics agent for Linux service with the following command.

	sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart 

## Output
The data will be collected in Azure Monitor with a record type of `<FLUENTD_TAG>_CL`.

For example, the custom tag `tag oms.api.tomcat` in Azure Monitor with a record type of `tomcat_CL`.  You could retrieve all records of this type with the following log query.

	Type=tomcat_CL

Nested JSON data sources are supported, but are indexed based off of parent field. For example, the following JSON data is returned from a log query as `tag_s : "[{ "a":"1", "b":"2" }]`.

```
{
    "tag": [{
    	"a":"1",
    	"b":"2"
    }]
}
```
