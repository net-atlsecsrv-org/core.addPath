# Cross-resource query Azure Data Explorer by using Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor supports cross-service queries between Azure Data Explorer, [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), and [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-logs). You can then query your Azure Data Explorer cluster by using Log Analytics/Application Insights tools and refer to it in a cross-service query. The article shows how to make a cross-service query.

The following diagram shows the Azure Monitor cross-service flow:

>[!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor cross-service query is in private preview. Allowlisting is required. Contact the [Service Team](mailto:ADXProxy@microsoft.com) with any questions.

## Cross-query your Log Analytics or Application Insights resources and Azure Data Explorer

You can run cross-resource queries by using client tools that support Kusto queries. Examples of these tools include the Log Analytics web UI, Workbooks, PowerShell, and the REST API.

Enter the identifier for an Azure Data Explorer cluster in a query within the `adx` pattern, followed by the database name and table.

```kusto
adx('https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples').StormEvents
```

> [!NOTE]
>* Database names are case sensitive.
>* Cross-resource query as an alert is not supported.

## Combine Azure Data Explorer cluster tables with a Log Analytics workspace

Use the `union` command to combine cluster tables with a Log Analytics workspace.

```kusto
union customEvents, adx('https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples').StormEvents
| take 10
```
```kusto
let CL1 = adx('https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples').StormEvents;
union customEvents, CL1 | take 10
```

> [!Tip]
> Shorthand format is allowed: *ClusterName*/*InitialCatalog*. For example, `adx('help/Samples')` is translated to `adx('help.kusto.windows.net/Samples')`.

## Join data from an Azure Data Explorer cluster in one tenant with an Azure Monitor resource in another

Cross-tenant queries between the services are not supported. You're signed in to a single tenant for running the query that spans both resources.

If the Azure Data Explorer resource is in Tenant A and the Log Analytics workspace is in Tenant B, use one of the following methods:

*  Azure Data Explorer allows you to add roles for principals in different tenants. Add your user ID in Tenant B as an authorized user on the Azure Data Explorer cluster. Validate that the [TrustedExternalTenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.kusto/update-azkustocluster) property on the Azure Data Explorer cluster contains Tenant B. Run the cross-query fully in Tenant B.
*  Use [Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/) to project the Azure Monitor resource into Tenant A.

## Connect to Azure Data Explorer clusters from different tenants

Kusto Explorer automatically signs you in to the tenant to which the user account originally belongs. To access resources in other tenants with the same user account, you must explicitly specify `TenantId` in the connection string:

`Data Source=https://ade.applicationinsights.io/subscriptions/SubscriptionId/resourcegroups/ResourceGroupName;Initial Catalog=NetDefaultDB;AAD Federated Security=True;Authority ID=TenantId`
