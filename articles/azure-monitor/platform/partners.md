## Datadog

![DataDog Logo](./media/partners/datadog.png)

Azure enables customers to migrate and modernize their applications to run in the cloud, in coordination with many partner solutions. One such partner is Datadog, which provides observability and security tools for users to understand the health and performance of their applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  But configuring the necessary integrations often requires navigating between the Azure portal and Datadog.  This process adds complexity, takes time, and makes it difficult to troubleshoot if things aren’t working.  To reduce the burden of managing across multiple portals, Microsoft has worked with Datadog to create an integrated Datadog solution on the Azure cloud platform.  Available via the Azure Marketplace, this solution provides a seamless experience for using the Datadog’s cloud monitoring solution in Azure.  

With the new Azure-Datadog integration, organizations can now fully map their legacy and cloud-based systems, monitoring real-time data during every phase of the cloud transition, and ensure that migrated applications meet performance targets. This integration combines Azure’s global presence, flexibility, security, and compliance with Datadog's logging and monitoring capabilities to create the best experience for enterprises. 
Through this unified experience, you will be able to: 

- Provision a new Datadog organization and configure their Azure resources to send logs and metrics to Datadog—a fully managed setup with no infrastructure for customers to set up and operate.  
- Seamlessly send logs and metrics to Datadog. The log-forwarding process has been completely automated; rather than building out a log-forwarding pipeline with Diagnostic Settings, Event Hubs, and Functions, you can configure everything with just a few clicks.
-	Easily install the Datadog agent on VM hosts through a single-click.
-	Streamline single-sign on (SSO) to Datadog—a separate sign-on from the Datadog portal is no longer required. 
-	Get unified billing for the Datadog service through Azure subscription invoicing.

Sign up for the [Public Preview](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR4z3T2aGXUZPslUNJ3YpcapURFBHSUJIMVJTWDM5VUFPMVkyTVhMVlYzMS4u) of the new Datadog integration with Azure.  Public preview will be available on Azure Marketplace starting October 2020.

If you are still using the previous manually configured integration, see the [documentation on the DataDog website](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/azure/).
