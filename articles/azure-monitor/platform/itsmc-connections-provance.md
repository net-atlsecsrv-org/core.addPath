# Connect Provance with IT Service Management Connector

This article provides information about how to configure the connection between your Provance instance and the IT Service Management Connector (ITSMC) in Log Analytics to centrally manage your work items.

> [!NOTE]
> We propose our Cherwell and Provance customers to use [Webhook action](./action-groups.md#webhook) to Cherwell and Provance endpoint as another solution to the integration.

The following sections provide details about how to connect your Provance product to ITSMC in Azure.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- ITSMC installed. More information: [Adding the IT Service Management Connector Solution](./itsmc-definition.md#add-it-service-management-connector).
- Provance App should be registered with Azure AD - and client ID is made available. For detailed information, see [how to configure active directory authentication](../../app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad.md).

- User role:  Administrator.

## Connection procedure

Use the following procedure to create a Provance connection:

1. In Azure portal, go to **All Resources** and look for **ServiceDesk(YourWorkspaceName)**
