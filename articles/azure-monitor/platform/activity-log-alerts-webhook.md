# Webhooks for Azure activity log alerts
As part of the definition of an action group, you can configure webhook endpoints to receive activity log alert notifications. With webhooks, you can route these notifications to other systems for post-processing or custom actions. This article shows what the payload for the HTTP POST to a webhook looks like.

For more information on activity log alerts, see how to [create Azure activity log alerts](activity-log-alerts.md).

For information on action groups, see how to [create action groups](../../azure-monitor/platform/action-groups.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the [common alert schema](https://aka.ms/commonAlertSchemaDocs), which provides the advantage of having a single extensible and unified alert payload across all the alert services in Azure Monitor, for your webhook integrations. [Learn about the common alert schema definitions.](https://aka.ms/commonAlertSchemaDefinitions)â€‹


## Authenticate the webhook
The webhook can optionally use token-based authorization for authentication. The webhook URI is saved with a token ID, for example, `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue`.

## Payload schema
The JSON payload contained in the POST operation differs based on the payload's data.context.activityLog.eventSource field.

| properties |Properties of the event. |
| status |String. Status of the operation. Common values include Started, In Progress, Succeeded, Failed, Active, and Resolved. |
