# Understand the automatic migration process for your classic alert rules

As [previously announced](monitoring-classic-retirement.md), classic alerts in Azure Monitor are being retired in September 2019 (was originally July 2019). As part of the retirement process, [a migration tool](alerts-using-migration-tool.md) is available in the Azure portal for customers to trigger migration themselves. If you haven't used the migration tool by August 31, 2019, Azure Monitor will start the process of automatic migration of your classic alerts starting September 1, 2019.
This article walks you through the the automatic migration process and help you resolve any issues you might run into.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This article only applies to Azure public cloud. Retirement process for Azure Monitor classic alerts in Azure Government cloud and Azure China 21Vianet will be announced at future date.

## What will happen during the automatic migration process?

- Starting **September 1, 2019**, customers won't be able to create any new classic alert rules except on [certain metrics](alerts-understand-migration.md#classic-alert-rules-that-will-not-be-migrated).
  - For the exceptions, customer can continue to create new classic alert rules and use their classic alerts until June 2020.
- Starting **September 1, 2019**, migration of classic alerts will be triggered in batches for any customers that have classic alerts.
- As with the voluntary migration tool, certain classic alert rules that aren't migratable will be left as they are. These classic alert rules will continue to be supported until June 2020. However, any invalid classic alert rules will be deleted as they're non-functional.
Any classic alert rules that are monitoring deleted target resources or on [metrics that are no longer supported](alerts-understand-migration.md#classic-alert-rules-on-deprecated-metrics) are considered invalid.
- Once migration for your subscription starts, unless there are any issues, migration should be complete within an hour. Customers can monitor the status of migration on [the migration blade in Azure Monitor](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring/MigrationBladeViewModel).
- Subscription owners will receive an email on successful completion of migration.
- If there are any issues during the migration, subscription owners will also receive an email informing them of the same. Customers can use the migration blade to see full details of the issue.
- In case an action is needed from customer like temporarily disabling a resource lock or changing a policy assignment, customers will need to resolve any issues by October 31, 2019. If the issues are not resolved by then, successful migration of your classic alerts can't be guaranteed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't want to wait for the automatic migration process to start, you can still trigger the migration voluntarily using the migration tool.

## Important things to note

The migration process converts classic alert rules to new, equivalent alert rules, and creates action groups. In preparation, be aware of the following points:

- The notification payload formats for new alert rules are different from those of the classic alert rules because they support more features. If you have logic apps, runbooks or webhooks that are triggered by classic alert rule they might stop functioning as expected once migration is complete because of differences in notification payloads. [Learn how to prepare for the migration](alerts-prepare-migration.md).

- Some classic alert rules can't be migrated by using the tool. [Learn which rules can't be migrated and what to do with them](alerts-understand-migration.md#classic-alert-rules-that-will-not-be-migrated).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The migration process won't impact the evaluation of your classic alert rules. They'll continue to run and send alerts until they're migrated and the new alert rules take effect.

## What if the automatic migration fails?

When the automatic migration process fails, subscription owners will receive an email notifying them of the issue. You can use the migration blade in Azure Monitor to see the full details of the issue.

See the [troubleshooting guide](alerts-understand-migration.md#common-problems-and-remedies) for help with problems you might face during migration.
