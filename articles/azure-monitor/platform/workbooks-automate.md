# Programmatically manage workbooks

Resource owners have the option to create and manage their workbooks programmatically via Resource Manager templates. 

This can be useful in scenarios like:
* Deploying org- or domain-specific analytics reports along with resources deployments. For instance, you may deploy org-specific performance and failure workbooks for your new apps or virtual machines.
* Deploying standard reports or dashboards using workbooks for existing resources.

The workbook will be created in the desired sub/resource-group and with the content specified in the Resource Manager templates.

## Azure Resource Manager template for deploying workbooks
1. Open a workbook that you want to deploy programmatically.
2. Switch the workbook to edit mode by clicking on the _Edit_ toolbar item.
3. Open the _Advanced Editor_ using the _</>_ button on the toolbar.
4. In the editor, switch _Template Type_ to _Resource Manager template_.
5. The Resource Manager template for creating shows up in the editor. Copy the content and use as-is or merge it with a larger template that also deploys the target resource.

## Sample Azure Resource Manager template
This template shows how to deploy a simple workbook that displays a 'Hello World!'

### Template parameters

| Parameter | Explanation |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| `workbookDisplayName` | The friendly name for the workbook that is used in the Gallery or Saved List. Needs to be unique in the scope of the resource group and source |
| `workbookType` | The gallery that the workbook will be shown under. Supported values include workbook, `tsg`, Azure Monitor, etc. |
| `workbookSourceId` | The ID of the resource instance to which the workbook will be associated. The new workbook will show up related to this resource instance - for example in the resource's table of content under _Workbook_. If you want your workbook to show up in the workbook gallery in Azure Monitor, use the string _Azure Monitor_ instead of a resource ID. |
| `workbookId` | The unique guid for this workbook instance. Use _[newGuid()]_ to automatically create a new guid. |
| `kind` | Used to specify if the created workbook is shared or private. Use value _shared_ for shared workbooks and _user_ for private ones. |
| `location` | The Azure location where the workbook will be created. Use _[resourceGroup().location]_ to create it in the same location as the resource group |
| `serializedData` | Contains the content or payload to be used in the workbook. Use the Resource Manager template from the workbooks UI to get the value |

### Workbook types
Workbook types specify which workbook gallery type the new workbook instance will show up under. Options include:

| Type | Gallery location |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| `workbook` | The default used in most reports, including the Workbooks gallery of Application Insights, Azure Monitor, etc.  |
| `tsg` | The Troubleshooting Guides gallery in Application Insights |
| `usage` | The _More_ gallery under _Usage_ in Application Insights |

### Limitations
For a technical reason, this mechanism cannot be used to create workbook instances in the _Workbooks_ gallery of Application Insights. We are working on addressing this limitation. In the meanwhile, we recommend that you use the Troubleshooting Guide gallery (workbookType: `tsg`) to deploy Application Insights related workbooks.
