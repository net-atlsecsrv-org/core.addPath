# Azure Activity Log event schema
The **Azure Activity Log** is a log that provides insight into any subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure. This article describes the event schema per category of data. The schema of the data differs depending on if you are reading the data in the portal, PowerShell, CLI, or directly via the REST API versus [streaming the data to storage or Event Hubs using a Log Profile](activity-log-export.md). The examples below show the schema as made available via the portal, PowerShell, CLI, and REST API. A mapping of those properties to the [Azure logs schema](diagnostic-logs-schema.md) is provided at the end of the article.

## Administrative
This category contains the record of all create, update, delete, and action operations performed through Resource Manager. Examples of the types of events you would see in this category include "create virtual machine" and "delete network security group" Every action taken by a user or application using Resource Manager is modeled as an operation on a particular resource type. If the operation type is Write, Delete, or Action, the records of both the start and success or fail of that operation are recorded in the Administrative category. The Administrative category also includes any changes to role-based access control in a subscription.

### Sample event

    "authorization": {
        "action": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/write",

## Resource health
This category contains the record of any resource health events that have occurred to your Azure resources. An example of the type of event you would see in this category is "Virtual Machine health status changed to unavailable." Resource health events can represent one of four health statuses: Available, Unavailable, Degraded, and Unknown. Additionally, resource health events can be categorized as being Platform Initiated or User Initiated.

## Alert
This category contains the record of all activations of Azure alerts. An example of the type of event you would see in this category is "CPU % on myVM has been over 80 for the past 5 minutes." A variety of Azure systems have an alerting concept -- you can define a rule of some sort and receive a notification when conditions match that rule. Each time a supported Azure alert type 'activates,' or the conditions are met to generate a notification, a record of the activation is also pushed to this category of the Activity Log.

## Autoscale
This category contains the record of any events related to the operation of the autoscale engine based on any autoscale settings you have defined in your subscription. An example of the type of event you would see in this category is "Autoscale scale up action failed." Using autoscale, you can automatically scale out or scale in the number of instances in a supported resource type based on time of day and/or load (metric) data using an autoscale setting. When the conditions are met to scale up or down, the start and succeeded or failed events will be recorded in this category.

### Sample event

resource.

### Policy event property descriptions

| Element Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| authorization | Array of RBAC properties of the event. For new resources, this is the action and scope of the request that triggered evaluation. For existing resources, the action is "Microsoft.Resources/checkPolicyCompliance/read". |
| caller | For new resources, the identity that initiated a deployment. For existing resources, the GUID of the Microsoft Azure Policy Insights RP. |
| channels | Policy events use only the "Operation" channel. |
| claims | The JWT token used by Active Directory to authenticate the user or application to perform this operation in Resource Manager. |
| correlationId | Usually a GUID in the string format. Events that share a correlationId belong to the same uber action. |
| description | This field is blank for Policy events. |
| eventDataId | Unique identifier of an event. |
| eventName | Either "BeginRequest" or "EndRequest". "BeginRequest" is used for delayed auditIfNotExists and deployIfNotExists evaluations and when a deployIfNotExists effect starts a template deployment. All other operations return "EndRequest". |
| category | Declares the activity log event as belonging to "Policy". |
| eventTimestamp | Timestamp when the event was generated by the Azure service processing the request corresponding the event. |
| id | Unique identifier of the event on the specific resource. |
| level | Level of the event. Audit uses "Warning" and Deny uses "Error". An auditIfNotExists or deployIfNotExists error can generate "Warning" or "Error" depending on severity. All other Policy events use "Informational". |
| operationId | A GUID shared among the events that correspond to a single operation. |
| operationName | Name of the operation and directly correlates to the Policy effect. |
| resourceGroupName | Name of the resource group for the evaluated resource. |
| resourceProviderName | Name of the resource provider for the evaluated resource. |
| resourceType | For new resources, it is the type being evaluated. For existing resources, returns "Microsoft.Resources/checkPolicyCompliance". |
| resourceId | Resource ID of the evaluated resource. |
| status | String describing the status of the Policy evaluation result. Most Policy evaluations return "Succeeded", but a Deny effect returns "Failed". Errors in auditIfNotExists or deployIfNotExists also return "Failed". |
| subStatus | Field is blank for Policy events. |
| submissionTimestamp | Timestamp when the event became available for querying. |
| subscriptionId | Azure Subscription ID. |
| properties.isComplianceCheck | Returns "False" when a new resource is deployed or an existing resource's Resource Manager properties are updated. All other [evaluation triggers](../../governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md#evaluation-triggers) result in "True". |
| properties.resourceLocation | The Azure region of the resource being evaluated. |
| properties.ancestors | A comma-separated list of parent management groups ordered from direct parent to farthest grandparent. |
| properties.policies | Includes details about the policy definition, assignment, effect, and parameters that this Policy evaluation is a result of. |
| relatedEvents | This field is blank for Policy events. |

## Mapping to resource logs schema

When streaming the Azure Activity Log to a storage account or Event Hubs namespace, the data follows the [Azure resource logs schema](./diagnostic-logs-schema.md). Here is the mapping of properties from the schema above to the resource logs schema:

| Resource logs schema property | Activity Log REST API schema property | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time | eventTimestamp |  |
| resourceId | resourceId | subscriptionId, resourceType, resourceGroupName are all inferred from the resourceId. |
| operationName | operationName.value |  |
| category | Part of operation name | Breakout of the operation type - "Write"/"Delete"/"Action" |
| resultType | status.value | |
| resultSignature | substatus.value | |
| resultDescription | description |  |
| durationMs | N/A | Always 0 |
| callerIpAddress | httpRequest.clientIpAddress |  |
| correlationId | correlationId |  |
| identity | claims and authorization properties |  |
| Level | Level |  |
| location | N/A | Location of where the event was processed. *This is not the location of the resource, but rather where the event was processed. This property will be removed in a future update.* |
| Properties | properties.eventProperties |  |
| properties.eventCategory | category | If properties.eventCategory is not present, category is "Administrative" |
| properties.eventName | eventName |  |
| properties.operationId | operationId |  |
| properties.eventProperties | properties |  |
