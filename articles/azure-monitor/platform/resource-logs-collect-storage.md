# Archive Azure resource logs to storage account
[Platform logs](resource-logs-overview.md) in Azure, including Azure Activity log and resource logs, provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on.  This article describes collecting platform logs to an Azure storage account to retain data for archiving.

## Prerequisites
You need to [create an Azure storage account](../../storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md) if you don't already have one. The storage account does not have to be in the same subscription as the resource sending logs as long as the user who configures the setting has appropriate RBAC access to both subscriptions.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts are not currently supported as a destination for diagnostic settings even though they may be listed as a valid option in the Azure portal.


You should not use an existing storage account that has other, non-monitoring data stored in it so that you can better control access to the data. If you are archiving the Activity log and resource logs together though, you may choose to use the same storage account to keep all monitoring data in a central location.

## Create a diagnostic setting
Send platform logs to storage and other destinations by creating a diagnostic setting for an Azure resource. See [Create diagnostic setting to collect logs and metrics in Azure](diagnostic-settings.md) for details.


## Collect data from compute resources
Diagnostic settings will collect resource logs for Azure compute resources like any other resource, but not their guest operating system or workloads. To collect this data, install the [Windows Azure Diagnostics agent](diagnostics-extension-overview.md). See [Store and view diagnostic data in Azure Storage
](diagnostics-extension-to-storage.md) for details.


## Schema of platform logs in storage account

Once you have created the diagnostic setting, a storage container is created in the storage account as soon as an event occurs in one of the enabled log categories. The blobs within the container use the following naming convention:

```
insights-logs-{log category name}/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscription ID}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{resource group name}/PROVIDERS/{resource provider name}/{resource type}/{resource name}/y={four-digit numeric year}/m={two-digit numeric month}/d={two-digit numeric day}/h={two-digit 24-hour clock hour}/m=00/PT1H.json
```

For example, the blob for a network security group might have a name similar to the following:

```
insights-logs-networksecuritygrouprulecounter/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/RESOURCEGROUPS/TESTRESOURCEGROUP/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUP/TESTNSG/y=2016/m=08/d=22/h=18/m=00/PT1H.json
```

Each PT1H.json blob contains a JSON blob of events that occurred within the hour specified in the blob URL (for example, h=12). During the present hour, events are appended to the PT1H.json file as they occur. The minute value (m=00) is always 00, since resource log events are broken into individual blobs per hour.

Within the PT1H.json file, each event is stored with the following format. This will use a common top level schema but be unique for each Azure services as described in [Resource logs schema](diagnostic-logs-schema.md) and [Activity log schema](activity-log-schema.md).

``` JSON
{"time": "2016-07-01T00:00:37.2040000Z","systemId": "46cdbb41-cb9c-4f3d-a5b4-1d458d827ff1","category": "NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter","resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/s1id1234-5679-0123-4567-890123456789/RESOURCEGROUPS/TESTRESOURCEGROUP/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/TESTNSG","operationName": "NetworkSecurityGroupCounters","properties": {"vnetResourceGuid": "{12345678-9012-3456-7890-123456789012}","subnetPrefix": "10.3.0.0/24","macAddress": "000123456789","ruleName": "/subscriptions/ s1id1234-5679-0123-4567-890123456789/resourceGroups/testresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/testnsg/securityRules/default-allow-rdp","direction": "In","type": "allow","matchedConnections": 1988}}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Platform logs are written to blob storage using [JSON lines](http://jsonlines.org/), where each event is a line and the newline character indicates a new event. This format was implemented in November 2018. Prior to this date, logs were written to blob storage as a json array of records as described in [Prepare for format change to Azure Monitor platform logs archived to a storage account](resource-logs-blob-format.md).
