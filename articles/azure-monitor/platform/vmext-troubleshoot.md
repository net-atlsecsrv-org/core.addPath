## Troubleshooting Azure Windows VM extension

If the *Microsoft Monitoring Agent* VM extension is not installing or reporting, you can perform the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.

1. Check if the Azure VM agent is installed and working correctly by using the steps in [KB 2965986](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2965986#mt1).
   * You can also review the VM agent log file `C:\WindowsAzure\logs\WaAppAgent.log`
   * If the log does not exist, the VM agent is not installed.
   * [Install the Azure VM Agent](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-azurevm.md#enable-the-log-analytics-vm-extension)
2. Review the Microsoft Monitoring Agent VM extension log files in `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent`
3. Ensure the virtual machine can run PowerShell scripts
4. Ensure permissions on C:\Windows\temp havenâ€™t been changed
5. View the status of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent by typing the following in an elevated PowerShell window on the virtual machine `(New-Object -ComObject 'AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg').GetCloudWorkspaces() | Format-List`
6. Review the Microsoft Monitoring Agent setup log files in `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\SCOM\Logs`

If the *Log Analytics agent for Linux* VM extension is not installing or reporting, you can perform the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.

1. If the extension status is *Unknown* check if the Azure VM agent is installed and working correctly by reviewing the VM agent log file `/var/log/waagent.log`
   * If the log does not exist, the VM agent is not installed.
   * [Install the Azure VM Agent on Linux VMs](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-azurevm.md#enable-the-log-analytics-vm-extension)
2. For other unhealthy statuses, review the Log Analytics agent for Linux VM extension logs files in `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.OmsAgentForLinux/*/extension.log` and `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.OmsAgentForLinux/*/CommandExecution.log`
3. If the extension status is healthy, but data is not being uploaded review the Log Analytics agent for Linux log files in `/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`

For more information, see [troubleshooting Linux extensions](../../virtual-machines/extensions/oms-linux.md).
