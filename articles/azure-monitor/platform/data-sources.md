# Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is based on a [common monitoring data platform](data-platform.md) that includes [Logs](data-platform-logs.md) and [Metrics](data-platform-metrics.md). Collecting data into this platform allows data from multiple resources to be analyzed together using a common set of tools in Azure Monitor. Monitoring data may also be sent to other locations to support certain scenarios, and some resources may write to other locations before they can be collected into Logs or Metrics.

This article describes the different sources of monitoring data collected by Azure Monitor in addition to the monitoring data created by Azure resources. Links are provided to detailed information on configuration required to collect this data to different locations.

## Application tiers

Sources of monitoring data from Azure applications can be organized into tiers, the highest tiers being your application itself and the lower tiers being components of Azure platform. The method of accessing data from each tier varies. The application tiers are summarized in the table below, and the sources of monitoring data in each tier are presented in the following sections. See [Monitoring data locations in Azure](../monitor-reference.md) for a description of each data location and how you can access its data.

## Azure resources
Metrics and resource logs provide information about the _internal_ operation of Azure resources. These are available for most Azure services, and monitoring solutions and insights collect additional data for particular services.

![Azure resource collection](media/data-sources/data-source-azure-resources.svg)


### Platform metrics 
Most Azure services will send [platform metrics](data-platform-metrics.md) that reflect their performance and operation directly to the metrics database. The specific [metrics will vary for each type of resource](metrics-supported.md). 

| Destination | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
