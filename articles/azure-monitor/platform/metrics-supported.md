# Supported metrics with Azure Monitor

> [!NOTE]
> This list is largely auto-generated from the Azure Monitor Metrics REST API. Any modification made to this list via GitHub may be written over without warning. Contact the author of this article for details on how to make permanent updates.

Azure Monitor provides several ways to interact with metrics, including charting them in the portal, accessing them through the REST API, or querying them using PowerShell or CLI. 

This article is a complete list of all platform (that is, automatically collected) metrics currently available with Azure Monitor's consolidated metric pipeline. The list was last updated March 27th, 2020. Metrics changed or added after this date may not appear below. To query for and access the list of metrics programmatically, please use the [2018-01-01 api-version](/rest/api/monitor/metricdefinitions). Other metrics not on this list may be available in the portal or using legacy APIs.

The metrics are organized by resource providers and resource type. For a list of services and the resource providers that belong to them, see [Resource providers for Azure services](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers.md). 

## Exporting platform metrics to other locations

You can export the platform metrics from the Azure monitor pipeline to other locations in one of two ways.
1. Use the [metrics REST API](/rest/api/monitor/metrics/list)
2. Use [diagnostics settings](diagnostic-settings.md) to route platform metrics to 
    - Azure Storage
    - Azure Monitor Logs (and thus Log Analytics)
    - Event hubs, which is how you get them to non-Microsoft systems 

Using diagnostic settings is the easiest way to route the metrics, but there are some limitations: 

- **Some not exportable** - All metrics are exportable using the REST API, but some cannot be exported using Diagnostic Settings because of intricacies in the Azure Monitor backend. The column *Exportable via Diagnostic Settings* in the tables below list which metrics can be exported in this way.  

- **Multi-dimensional metrics** - Sending multi-dimensional metrics to other locations via diagnostic settings is not currently supported. Metrics with dimensions are exported as flattened single dimensional metrics, aggregated across dimension values. *For example*: The 'Incoming Messages' metric on an Event Hub can be explored and charted on a per queue level. However, when exported via diagnostic settings the metric will be represented as all incoming messages across all queues in the Event Hub.

## Guest OS and Host OS Metrics

> [!WARNING]
> Metrics for the guest operating system (guest OS) which runs in Azure Virtual Machines, Service Fabric, and Cloud Services are **NOT** listed here. Guest OS metrics must be collected through the one or more agents which run on or as part of the guest operating system.  Guest OS metrics include performance counters which track guest CPU percentage or memory usage, both of which are  frequently used for auto-scaling or alerting. 
>
> **Host OS metrics ARE available and listed below.** They are not the same. The Host OS metrics relate to the Hyper-V session hosting your guest OS session. 

> [!TIP]
> Best practice is to use and configure the [Azure Diagnostics extension](diagnostics-extension-overview.md) to send guest OS performance metrics into the same Azure Monitor metric database where platform metrics are stored. The extension routes guest OS metrics through the [custom metrics](metrics-custom-overview.md) API. Then you can chart, alert and otherwise use guest OS metrics like platform metrics. Alternatively or in addition, you can use the Log Analytics agent to send guest OS metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics. There you can query on those metrics in combination with non-metric data. 

For important additional information, see [Monitoring Agents Overview](agents-overview.md).    

## Table formatting

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This latest update adds a new column and reordered the metrics to be alphabetic. The addition information means that the tables below may have a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom, depending on the width of your browser window. If you believe you are missing information, use the scroll bar to see the entirety of the table.
