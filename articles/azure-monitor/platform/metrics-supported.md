# Supported metrics with Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor provides several ways to interact with metrics, including charting them in the portal, accessing them through the REST API, or querying them using PowerShell or CLI. Below is a complete list of all metrics currently available with Azure Monitor's metric pipeline. Other metrics may be available in the portal or using legacy APIs. This list below only includes metrics available using the consolidated Azure Monitor metric pipeline. The metrics are organized by namespace. For a list of services and the namespaces that belong to them, see [Resource providers for Azure services](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers.md). To query for and access these metrics programmatically, please use the [2018-01-01 api-version](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/metricdefinitions)

> [!NOTE]
> Sending multi-dimensional metrics via diagnostic settings is not currently supported. Metrics with dimensions are exported as flattened single dimensional metrics, aggregated across dimension values.
>
> *For example*: The 'Incoming Messages' metric on an Event Hub can be explored and charted on a per queue level. However, when exported via diagnostic settings the metric will be represented as all incoming messages across all queues in the Event Hub.
>
> For a list of platform metrics exportable via diagnostic settings, see [this article](metrics-supported-export-diagnostic-settings.md).
