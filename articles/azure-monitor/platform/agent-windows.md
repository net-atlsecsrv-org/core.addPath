# Install Log Analytics agent on Windows computers
This article provides details on installing the Log Analytics agent on Windows computers using the following methods:

* Manual installation using the [setup wizard](#install-agent-using-setup-wizard) or [command line](#install-agent-using-command-line).
* [Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC)](#install-agent-using-dsc-in-azure-automation). 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The installation methods described in this article are typically used for virtual machines on-premises or in other clouds. See [Installation options](log-analytics-agent.md#installation-options) for more efficient options you can use for Azure virtual machines.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to configure the agent to report to more than one workspace, this cannot be performed during initial setup, only afterwards by updating the settings from Control Panel or PowerShell as described in [Adding or removing a workspace](agent-manage.md#adding-or-removing-a-workspace).  

## Supported operating systems

See [Overview of Azure Monitor agents](agents-overview.md#supported-operating-systems) for a list of Windows versions supported by the Log Analytics agent.

### SHA-2 Code Signing Support Requirement 
The Windows agent will begin to exclusively use SHA-2 signing on August 17, 2020. This change will impact customers using the Log Analytics agent on a legacy OS as part of any Azure service (Azure Monitor, Azure Automation, Azure Update Management, Azure Change Tracking, Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel, Windows Defender ATP). The change does not require any customer action unless you are running the agent on a legacy OS version (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008). Customers running on a legacy OS version are required to take the following actions on their machines before August 17, 2020 or their agents will stop sending data to their Log Analytics workspaces:

1. Install the latest Service Pack for your OS. The required service pack versions are:
    - Windows 7 SP1
    - Windows Server 2008 SP2
    - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1

2. Install the SHA-2 signing Windows updates for your OS as described in [2019 SHA-2 Code Signing Support requirement for Windows and WSUS](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4472027/2019-sha-2-code-signing-support-requirement-for-windows-and-wsus)
3. Update to the latest version of the Windows agent (version 10.20.18029).
4. Recommended to configure the agent to [use TLS 1.2](agent-windows.md#configure-agent-to-use-tls-12). 

## Network requirements
See [Log Analytics agent overview](log-analytics-agent.md#network-requirements) for the network requirements for the Windows agent.


   
## Configure Agent to use TLS 1.2
[TLS 1.2](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings#tls-12) protocol ensure the security of data in transit for communication between the Windows agent and the Log Analytics service. If you're installing on an [operating system without TLS 1.2 enabled by default](data-security.md#sending-data-securely-using-tls-12), then you should configure TLS 1.2 using the steps below.

1. Locate the following registry subkey: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols**
2. Create a subkey under **Protocols** for TLS 1.2 **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2**
3. Create a **Client** subkey under the TLS 1.2 protocol version subkey you created earlier. For example, **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client**.
4. Create the following DWORD values under **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client**:

    * **Enabled** [Value = 1]
    * **DisabledByDefault** [Value = 0]  

Configure .NET Framework 4.6 or later to support secure cryptography, as by default it is disabled. The [strong cryptography](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls#schusestrongcrypto) uses more secure network protocols like TLS 1.2, and blocks protocols that are not secure. 

1. Locate the following registry subkey: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319**.  
2. Create the DWORD value **SchUseStrongCrypto** under this subkey with a value of **1**.  
3. Locate the following registry subkey: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319**.  
4. Create the DWORD value **SchUseStrongCrypto** under this subkey with a value of **1**. 
5. Restart the system for the settings to take effect. 

## Install agent using setup wizard
The following steps install and configure the Log Analytics agent in Azure and Azure Government cloud by using the setup wizard for the agent on your computer. If you want to learn how to configure the agent to also report to a System Center Operations Manager management group, see [deploy the Operations Manager agent with the Agent Setup Wizard](/system-center/scom/manage-deploy-windows-agent-manually#to-deploy-the-operations-manager-agent-with-the-agent-setup-wizard).

1. In your Log Analytics workspace, from the **Windows Servers** page you navigated to earlier, select the appropriate **Download Windows Agent** version to download depending on the processor architecture of the Windows operating system.   
2. Run Setup to install the agent on your computer.
2. On the **Welcome** page, click **Next**.
3. On the **License Terms** page, read the license and then click **I Agree**.
4. On the **Destination Folder** page, change or keep the default installation folder and then click **Next**.
5. On the **Agent Setup Options** page, choose to connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics and then click **Next**.   
6. On the **Azure Log Analytics** page, perform the following:
   1. Paste the **Workspace ID** and **Workspace Key (Primary Key)** that you copied earlier.  If the computer should report to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Government cloud, select **Azure US Government** from the **Azure Cloud** drop-down list.  
   2. If the computer needs to communicate through a proxy server to the Log Analytics service, click **Advanced** and provide the URL and port number of the proxy server.  If your proxy server requires authentication, type the username and password to authenticate with the proxy server and then click **Next**.  
7. Click **Next** once you have completed providing the necessary configuration settings.<br><br> ![paste Workspace ID and Primary Key](media/agent-windows/log-analytics-mma-setup-laworkspace.png)<br><br>
8. On the **Ready to Install** page, review your choices and then click **Install**.
9. On the **Configuration completed successfully** page, click **Finish**.

When complete, the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** appears in **Control Panel**. To confirm it is reporting to Log Analytics, review [Verify agent connectivity to Log Analytics](#verify-agent-connectivity-to-azure-monitor). 

## Install agent using command line
The downloaded file for the agent is a self-contained installation package.  The setup program for the agent and supporting files are contained in the package and need to be extracted in order to properly install using the command line shown in the following examples.    

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to upgrade an agent, you need to use the Log Analytics scripting API. See the topic [Managing and maintaining the Log Analytics agent for Windows and Linux](agent-manage.md) for further information.

The following table highlights the specific parameters supported by setup for the agent, including when deployed using Automation DSC.

|MMA-specific options                   |Notes         |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| NOAPM=1                               | Optional parameter. Installs the agent without .NET Application Performance Monitoring.|   
|ADD_OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE               | 1 = Configure the agent to report to a workspace                |
|OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID                | Workspace ID (guid) for the workspace to add                    |
|OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY               | Workspace key used to initially authenticate with the workspace |
|OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_AZURE_CLOUD_TYPE  | Specify the cloud environment where the workspace is located <br> 0 = Azure commercial cloud (default) <br> 1 = Azure Government |
|OPINSIGHTS_PROXY_URL               | URI for the proxy to use |
|OPINSIGHTS_PROXY_USERNAME               | Username to access an authenticated proxy |
|OPINSIGHTS_PROXY_PASSWORD               | Password to access an authenticated proxy |

1. To extract the agent installation files, from an elevated command prompt run `MMASetup-<platform>.exe /c` and it will prompt you for the path to extract files to.  Alternatively, you can specify the path by passing the arguments `MMASetup-<platform>.exe /c /t:<Full Path>`.  
2. To silently install the agent and configure it to report to a workspace in Azure commercial cloud, from the folder you extracted the setup files to type: 
   
     ```dos
    setup.exe /qn NOAPM=1 ADD_OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE=1 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_AZURE_CLOUD_TYPE=0 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID="<your workspace ID>" OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY="<your workspace key>" AcceptEndUserLicenseAgreement=1
    ```

   or to configure the agent to report to Azure US Government cloud, type: 

     ```dos
    setup.exe /qn NOAPM=1 ADD_OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE=1 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_AZURE_CLOUD_TYPE=1 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID="<your workspace ID>" OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY="<your workspace key>" AcceptEndUserLicenseAgreement=1
    ```
    >[!NOTE]
    >The string values for the parameters *OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID* and *OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY* need to be encapsulated in double-quotes to instruct Windows Installer to interprit as valid options for the package. 

## Install agent using DSC in Azure Automation

You can use the following script example to install the agent using Azure Automation DSC.   If you do not have an Automation account, see [Get started with Azure Automation](../../automation/index.yml) to understand requirements and steps for creating an Automation account required before using Automation DSC.  If you are not familiar with Automation DSC, review [Getting started with Automation DSC](../../automation/automation-dsc-getting-started.md).

The following example installs the 64-bit agent, identified by the `URI` value. You can also use the 32-bit version by replacing the URI value. The URIs for both versions are:

- Windows 64-bit agent - https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828603
- Windows 32-bit agent - https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828604


>[!NOTE]
>This procedure and script example does not support upgrading the agent already deployed to a Windows computer.

The 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the agent package have different product codes and new versions released also have a unique value.  The product code is a GUID that is the principal identification of an application or product and is represented by the Windows Installer **ProductCode** property.  The `ProductId` value in the **MMAgent.ps1** script has to match the product code from the 32-bit or 64-bit agent installer package.

To retrieve the product code from the agent install package directly, you can use Orca.exe from the [Windows SDK Components for Windows Installer Developers](/windows/win32/msi/platform-sdk-components-for-windows-installer-developers) that is a component of the Windows Software Development Kit or using PowerShell following an [example script](https://www.scconfigmgr.com/2014/08/22/how-to-get-msi-file-information-with-powershell/)  written by a Microsoft Valuable Professional (MVP).  For either approach, you first need to extract the **MOMagent.msi** file from the MMASetup installation package.  This is shown earlier in the first step under the section [Install the agent using the command line](#install-agent-using-command-line).  

1. Import the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration DSC Module from [https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration) into Azure Automation.  
2.    Create Azure Automation variable assets for *OPSINSIGHTS_WS_ID* and *OPSINSIGHTS_WS_KEY*. Set *OPSINSIGHTS_WS_ID* to your Log Analytics workspace ID and set *OPSINSIGHTS_WS_KEY* to the primary key of your workspace.
3.    Copy the script and save it as MMAgent.ps1.

```powershell
Configuration MMAgent
{
    $OIPackageLocalPath = "C:\Deploy\MMASetup-AMD64.exe"
    $OPSINSIGHTS_WS_ID = Get-AutomationVariable -Name "OPSINSIGHTS_WS_ID"
    $OPSINSIGHTS_WS_KEY = Get-AutomationVariable -Name "OPSINSIGHTS_WS_KEY"

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xPSDesiredStateConfiguration
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    Node OMSnode {
        Service OIService
        {
            Name = "HealthService"
            State = "Running"
            DependsOn = "[Package]OI"
        }

        xRemoteFile OIPackage {
            Uri = "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828603"
            DestinationPath = $OIPackageLocalPath
        }

        Package OI {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Path  = $OIPackageLocalPath
            Name = "Microsoft Monitoring Agent"
            ProductId = "8A7F2C51-4C7D-4BFD-9014-91D11F24AAE2"
            Arguments = '/C:"setup.exe /qn NOAPM=1 ADD_OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE=1 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID=' + $OPSINSIGHTS_WS_ID + ' OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY=' + $OPSINSIGHTS_WS_KEY + ' AcceptEndUserLicenseAgreement=1"'
            DependsOn = "[xRemoteFile]OIPackage"
        }
    }
}

```

4. Update the `ProductId` value in the script with the product code extracted from the latest version of the agent install package using the methods recommended earlier. 
5. [Import the MMAgent.ps1 configuration script](../../automation/automation-dsc-getting-started.md#import-a-configuration-into-azure-automation) into your Automation account. 
6. [Assign a Windows computer or node](../../automation/automation-dsc-getting-started.md#enable-an-azure-resource-manager-vm-for-management-with-state-configuration) to the configuration. Within 15 minutes, the node checks its configuration and the agent is pushed to the node.

## Verify agent connectivity to Azure Monitor

Once installation of the agent is complete, verifying it is successfully connected and reporting can be accomplished in two ways.  

From the computer in **Control Panel**, find the item **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**.  Select it and on the **Azure Log Analytics** tab, the agent should display a message stating: **The Microsoft Monitoring Agent has successfully connected to the Microsoft Operations Management Suite service.**<br><br> ![MMA connection status to Log Analytics](media/agent-windows/log-analytics-mma-laworkspace-status.png)

You can also perform a simple log query in the Azure portal.  

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Monitor**.
1. Select **Logs** in the menu.
1. On the **Logs** pane, in the query field type:  

    ```
    Heartbeat 
    | where Category == "Direct Agent" 
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)  
    ```

In the search results returned, you should see heartbeat records for the computer indicating it is connected and reporting to the service.

## Cache information

Data from the Log Analytics agent is cached on the local machine at *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\Health Service State* before it's sent to Azure Monitor. The agent attempts to upload every 20 seconds. If it fails, it will wait an exponentially increasing length of time until it succeeds. It will wait 30 seconds before the second attempt, 60 seconds before the next, 120 seconds, and so on to a maximum of 8.5 hours between retries until it successfully connects again. This wait time is slightly randomized to avoid all agents simultaneously attempting connection. Oldest data is discarded when the maximum buffer is reached.

The default cache size is 50 MB but can be configured between a minimum of 5 MB and maximum of 1.5 GB. It's stored in the registry key *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HealthService\Parameters\Persistence Cache Maximum*. The value represents the number of pages, with 8 KB per page.
