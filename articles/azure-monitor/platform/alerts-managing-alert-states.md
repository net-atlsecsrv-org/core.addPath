# Manage alert and smart group states
Alerts in Azure Monitor now have an [alert state and a monitor condition](https://aka.ms/azure-alerts-overview) and, similarly, Smart Groups have a [smart group state](https://aka.ms/smart-groups). Changes to the state are now captured in history associated with the respective alert or smart group. This article walks you through the process of changing the state, for both an alert and a smart group.

## Change the state of an alert
1. You can change the state of an alert in the following different ways: 
    * In the All Alerts page, click the checkbox next to the alerts you wish to change the state of, and click change state.
