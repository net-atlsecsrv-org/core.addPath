# Tutorial: Deploy the Azure Industrial IoT Platform

In this tutorial, you learn:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * About the main components of the IIoT Platform
> * About the different installation types
> * How to deploy the Industrial IoT Platform

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription must be created
- Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- The Azure Active Directory (AAD) app registrations used for authentication require Global Administrator, Application
Administrator, or Cloud Application Administrator rights to provide tenant-wide admin consent (see below for further options)
- The supported operating systems for deployment are Windows, Linux and Mac
- IoT Edge supports Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC and Ubuntu Linux 16.08/18.04 LTS Linux

## Main Components

- Minimum dependencies: IoT Hub, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Event Hub, Key Vault, Storage
- Standard dependencies: Minimum + SignalR Service, AAD app
registrations, Device Provisioning Service, Time Series Insights, Workbook, Log Analytics,
Application Insights
- Microservices: App Service Plan, App Service
- UI (Web app): App Service Plan (shared with microservices), App Service
- Simulation: Virtual machine, Virtual network, IoT Edge
- Azure Kubernetes Service

## Installation types

- Minimum: Minimum dependencies
- Local: Minimum and the standard dependencies
- Services: Local and the microservices
- Simulation: Minimum dependencies and the simulation components
- App: Services and the UI
- All (default): App and the simulation

## Deployment

1. To get started with the deployment of the IIoT Platform, clone the repository from the command prompt or terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/Azure/Industrial-IoT
    cd Industrial-IoT

2. Start the guided deployment, the script will collect the required information, such as Azure account, subscription, target resource and group and application name.

On Windows:
    ```
    .\deploy
    ```

On Linux or Mac:
    ```
    ./deploy.sh
    ```

3. The microservices and the UI are web applications that require authentication, this requires three app registrations in the AAD. If the required rights are missing, there are two possible solutions:

- Ask the AAD admin to grant tenant-wide admin consent for the application
- An AAD admin can create the AAD applications. The deploy/scripts folder contains the aad- register.ps1 script to perform the AAD registration separately from the deployment. The output of the script is a file containing the relevant information to be used as part of deployment and must be passed to the deploy.ps1 script in the same folder using the -
aadConfig argument.
    ```bash
    cd deploy/scripts
    ./aad-register.ps1 -Name <application-name> -Output aad.json
    ./deploy.ps1 -aadConfig aad.json
    ```

For production deployments that require staging, rollback, scaling, and resilience, the platform can be deployed into [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://github.com/Azure/Industrial-IoT/blob/master/docs/deploy/howto-deploy-aks.md)

## Next steps
Now that you have deployed the IIoT Platform, you can learn how to customize configuration of the components:
