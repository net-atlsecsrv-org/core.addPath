# Configure or disable remote access to compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool

By default, Batch allows a [node user](/rest/api/batchservice/computenode/adduser) with network connectivity to connect externally to a compute node in a Batch pool. For example, a user can connect by Remote Desktop (RDP) on port 3389 to a compute node in a Windows pool. Similarly, by default, a user can connect by Secure Shell (SSH) on port 22 to a compute node in a Linux pool. 

In your environment, you might need to restrict or disable these default external access settings. You can modify these settings by using the Batch APIs to set the [PoolEndpointConfiguration](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/add#poolendpointconfiguration) property. 

## About the pool endpoint configuration
The endpoint configuration consists of one or more [network address translation (NAT) pools](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/add#inboundnatpool) of frontend ports. (Do not confuse a NAT pool with the Batch pool of compute nodes.) You set up each NAT pool to override the default connection settings on the pool's compute nodes. 

Each NAT pool configuration includes one or more [network security group (NSG) rules](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/add#networksecuritygrouprule). Each NSG rule allows or denies certain network traffic to the endpoint. You can choose to allow or deny all traffic, traffic identified by a [service tag](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags) (such as "Internet"), or traffic from specific IP addresses or subnets.

### Considerations
* The pool endpoint configuration is part of the pool's [network configuration](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/add#NetworkConfiguration). The network configuration can optionally include settings to join the pool to an [Azure virtual network](batch-virtual-network.md). If you set up the pool in a virtual network, you can create NSG rules that use address settings in the virtual network.
* You can configure multiple NSG rules when you configure a NAT pool. The rules are checked in the order of priority. Once a rule applies, no more rules are tested for matching.


## Example: Deny all RDP traffic

The following C# snippet shows how to configure the RDP endpoint on compute nodes in a Windows pool to deny all network traffic. The endpoint uses a frontend pool of ports in the range *60000 - 60099*. 

```csharp
pool.NetworkConfiguration = new NetworkConfiguration
{
    EndpointConfiguration = new PoolEndpointConfiguration(new InboundNatPool[]
    {
      new InboundNatPool("RDP", InboundEndpointProtocol.Tcp, 3389, 60000, 60099, new NetworkSecurityGroupRule[]
        {
            new NetworkSecurityGroupRule(162, NetworkSecurityGroupRuleAccess.Deny, "*"),
        })
    })    
};
```

## Example: Deny all SSH traffic from the internet

The following Python snippet shows how to configure the SSH endpoint on compute nodes in a Linux pool to deny all internet traffic. The endpoint uses a frontend pool of ports in the range *4000 - 4100*. 

```python
pool.network_configuration=batchmodels.NetworkConfiguration(
    endpoint_configuration=batchmodels.PoolEndpointConfiguration(
        inbound_nat_pools=[batchmodels.InboundNATPool(
            name='SSH',
            protocol='tcp',
            backend_port=22,
            frontend_port_range_start=4000,
            frontend_port_range_end=4100,
            network_security_group_rules=[
                batchmodels.NetworkSecurityGroupRule(
                priority=170,
                access=batchmodels.NetworkSecurityGroupRuleAccess.deny,
                source_address_prefix='Internet'
                )
            ]
        )
        ]
    ) 
)
```

## Example: Allow RDP traffic from a specific IP address

The following C# snippet shows how to configure the RDP endpoint on compute nodes in a Windows pool to allow RDP access only from IP address *198.51.100.7*. The second NSG rule denies traffic that does not match the IP address.

```csharp
pool.NetworkConfiguration = new NetworkConfiguration
{
    EndpointConfiguration = new PoolEndpointConfiguration(new InboundNatPool[]
    {
        new InboundNatPool("RDP", InboundEndpointProtocol.Tcp, 3389, 7500, 8000, new NetworkSecurityGroupRule[]
        {   
            new NetworkSecurityGroupRule(179,NetworkSecurityGroupRuleAccess.Allow, "198.51.100.7"),
            new NetworkSecurityGroupRule(180,NetworkSecurityGroupRuleAccess.Deny, "*")
        })
    })    
};
```

## Example: Allow SSH traffic from a specific subnet

The following Python snippet shows how to configure the SSH endpoint on compute nodes in a Linux pool to allow access only from the subnet *192.168.1.0/24*. The second NSG rule denies traffic that does not match the subnet.

```python
pool.network_configuration=batchmodels.NetworkConfiguration(
    endpoint_configuration=batchmodels.PoolEndpointConfiguration(
        inbound_nat_pools=[batchmodels.InboundNATPool(
            name='SSH',
            protocol='tcp',
            backend_port=22,
            frontend_port_range_start=4000,
            frontend_port_range_end=4100,
            network_security_group_rules=[
                batchmodels.NetworkSecurityGroupRule(
                priority=170,
                access='allow',
                source_address_prefix='192.168.1.0/24'
                ),
                batchmodels.NetworkSecurityGroupRule(
                priority=175,
                access='deny',
                source_address_prefix='*'
                )
            ]
        )
        ]
    )
)
```
