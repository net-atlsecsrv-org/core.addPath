# Configure managed identities in Batch pools

[Managed identities for Azure resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) eliminate the need for developers having to manage credentials by providing an identity for the Azure resource in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and using it to obtain Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens.

This topic explains how to enable user-assigned managed identities on Batch pools and how to use managed identities within the nodes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for Azure Batch pools with user-assigned managed identities is currently in public preview for the following regions: West US 2, South Central US, East US, US Gov Arizona and US Gov Virginia.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Create a user-assigned identity

First, [create your user-assigned managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity) in the same tenant as your Batch account. This managed identity does not need to be in the same resource group or even in the same subscription.

## Create a Batch pool with user-assigned managed identities

After you've created one or more user-assigned managed identities, you can create a Batch pool with that managed identity by using the [Batch .NET management library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/batch#management-library).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pools must be configured using [Virtual Machine Configuration](nodes-and-pools.md#virtual-machine-configuration) in order to use managed identities.

```csharp
var poolParameters = new Pool(name: "yourPoolName")
    {
        VmSize = "standard_d1_v2",
        ScaleSettings = new ScaleSettings
        {
            FixedScale = new FixedScaleSettings
            {
                TargetDedicatedNodes = 1
            }
        },
        DeploymentConfiguration = new DeploymentConfiguration
        {
            VirtualMachineConfiguration = new VirtualMachineConfiguration(
                new ImageReference(
                    "Canonical",
                    "UbuntuServer",
                    "18.04-LTS",
                    "latest"),
                "batch.node.ubuntu 18.04")
        },
        Identity = new BatchPoolIdentity
        {
            Type = PoolIdentityType.UserAssigned,
            UserAssignedIdentities = new Dictionary<string, BatchPoolIdentityUserAssignedIdentitiesValue>
            {
                ["Your Identity Resource Id"] =
                    new BatchPoolIdentityUserAssignedIdentitiesValue()
            }
        }
    };

var pool = await managementClient.Pool.CreateWithHttpMessagesAsync(
    poolName:"yourPoolName",
    resourceGroupName: "yourResourceGroupName",
    accountName: "yourAccountName",
    parameters: poolParameters,
    cancellationToken: default(CancellationToken)).ConfigureAwait(false);    
```

> [!NOTE]
> Creating pools with managed identities is not currently supported with the [Batch .NET client library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/batch#client-library).

## Use user-assigned managed identities in Batch nodes

After you've created your pools, your user-assigned managed identities can access the pool nodes via Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop (RDP). You can also configure your tasks so that the managed identities can directly access [Azure resources that support managed identities](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md).

Within the Batch nodes, you can get managed identity tokens and use them to authenticate through Azure AD authentication via the [Azure Instance Metadata Service](../virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service.md).

For Windows, the PowerShell script to get an access token to authenticate is:

```powershell
$Response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource={Resource App Id Url}' -Method GET -Headers @{Metadata="true"} 
```

For Linux, the Bash script is:

```bash
curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource={Resource App Id Url}' -H Metadata:true
```
