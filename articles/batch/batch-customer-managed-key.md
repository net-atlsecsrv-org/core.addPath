# Configure customer-managed keys for your Azure Batch account with Azure Key Vault and Managed Identity

By default Azure Batch uses platform-managed keys to encrypt all the customer data stored in the Azure Batch Service, like certificates, job/task metadata. Optionally, you can use your own keys, i.e., customer-managed keys, to encrypt data stored in Azure Batch.

The keys you provide must be generated in [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md), and the Batch accounts you want to configure with customer-managed keys have to be enabled with [Azure Managed Identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for customer-managed keys in Azure Batch is currently in public preview for the West Europe, North Europe, Switzerland North, Central US, South Central US, West Central US, East US, East US 2, West US 2, US Gov Virginia, and US Gov Arizona regions.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Create a Batch Account with system-assigned managed identity

### Azure portal

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), when you create Batch accounts, pick **System assigned** in the identity type under the **Advanced** tab.

After the account is created, you can find a unique GUID in the **Identity principal id** field under the **Property** section. The **Identity Type** will show `SystemAssigned`.

### Azure CLI

When you create a new Batch account, specify `SystemAssigned` for the `--identity` parameter.

```powershell
resourceGroupName='myResourceGroup'
accountName='mybatchaccount'

az batch account create \
    -n $accountName \
    -g $resourceGroupName \
    --locations regionName='West US 2' \
    --identity 'SystemAssigned'
```

After the account is created, you can verify that system-assigned managed identity has been enabled on this account. Be sure to note the `PrincipalId`, as this value will be needed to grant this batch account access to the Key Vault.

```powershell
az batch account show \
    -n $accountName \
    -g $resourceGroupName \
    --query identity
```

> [!NOTE]
> The system-assigned managed identity created in a Batch account is only used for retrieving customer-managed keys from the Key Vault. This identity is not available on Batch pools.

## Configure your Azure Key Vault instance

### Create an Azure Key Vault

When creating an Azure Key Vault instance with customer-managed keys for Azure Batch, make sure that **Soft Delete** and **Purge Protection** are both enabled.

![Key Vault creation screen](./media/batch-customer-managed-key/create-key-vault.png)

### Add an access policy to your Azure Key Vault instance

In the Azure portal, after the Key Vault is created, In the **Access Policy** under **Setting**, add the Batch account access using managed identity. Under **Key Permissions**, select **Get**, **Wrap Key** and **Unwrap Key**. 

![Add access policy](./media/batch-customer-managed-key/key-permissions.png)

In the **Select** field under **Principal**, fill in the `principalId` that you previously retrieved, or the name of the batch account.

![Enter principalId](./media/batch-customer-managed-key/principal-id.png)

### Generate a key in Azure Key Vault

In the Azure portal, go to the Key Vault instance in the **key** section, select **Generate/Import**. Select the **Key Type** to be `RSA` and **RSA Key Size** to be at least `2048` bits. `EC` key types are currently not supported as a customer-managed key on a Batch account.

![Create a key](./media/batch-customer-managed-key/create-key.png)

After the key is created, click on the newly created key and the current version, copy the **Key Identifier** under **properties** section.  Be sure sure that under **Permitted Operations**, **Wrap Key** and **Unwrap Key** are both checked.

## Enable customer-managed keys on Azure Batch Account

### Azure portal

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the Batch account page. Under the **Encryption** section, enable **Customer-managed key**. You can directly use the Key Identifier, or you can select the key vault and then click **Select a key vault and key**.

![Under Encryption, enable Customer-managed key](./media/batch-customer-managed-key/encryption-page.png)

### Azure CLI

After the Batch account is created with system-assigned managed identity and the access to Key Vault is granted, update the Batch account with the `{Key Identifier}` URL under `keyVaultProperties` parameter. Also set **encryption_key_source** as `Microsoft.KeyVault`.

```powershell
az batch account set \
    -n $accountName \
    -g $resourceGroupName \
    --encryption_key_source Microsoft.KeyVault \
    --encryption_key_identifier {YourKeyIdentifier} 
```

## Update the customer-managed key version

When you create a new version of a key, update the Batch account to use the new version. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Batch account in Azure portal and display the Encryption settings.
2. Enter the URI for the new key version. Alternately, you can select the key vault and the key again to update the version.
3. Save your changes.

You can also use Azure CLI to update the version.

```powershell
az batch account set \
    -n $accountName \
    -g $resourceGroupName \
    --encryption_key_identifier {YourKeyIdentifierWithNewVersion} 
```
## Use a different key for Batch encryption

To change the key used for Batch encryption, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Batch account and display the Encryption settings.
2. Enter the URI for the new key. Alternately, you can select the key vault and choose a new key.
3. Save your changes.

You can  also use Azure CLI to use a different key.

```powershell
az batch account set \
    -n $accountName \
    -g $resourceGroupName \
    --encryption_key_identifier {YourNewKeyIdentifier} 
```
## Frequently asked questions
  * **Are customer-managed keys supported for existing Batch accounts?** No. Customer-managed keys are only supported for new Batch accounts.
  * **Can I select RSA key sizes larger than 2048 bits?** Yes, RSA key sizes of `3072` and `4096` bits are also supported.
  * **What operations are available after a customer-managed key is revoked?** The only operation allowed is account deletion if Batch loses access to the customer-managed key.
  * **How should I restore access to my Batch account if I accidentally delete the Key Vault key?** Since purge protection and soft delete are enabled, you could restore the existing keys. For more information, see [Recover an Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery.md).
  * **Can I disable customer-managed keys?** You can set the encryption type of the Batch Account back to "Microsoft managed key" at any time. After this, you are free to delete or change the key.
  * **How can I rotate my keys?** Customer-managed keys are not automatically rotated. To rotate the key, update the Key Identifier that the account is associated with.
  * **After I restore access how long will it take for the Batch account to work again?** It can take up to 10 minutes for the account to be accessible again once access is restored.
  * **While the Batch Account is unavailable what happens to my resources?** Any pools that are running when Batch access to customer-managed keys is lost will continue to run. However, the nodes will transition into an unavailable state, and tasks will stop running (and be requeued). Once access is restored, nodes will become available again and tasks will be restarted.
  * **Does this encryption mechanism apply to VM disks in a Batch pool?** No. For Cloud Service Configuration Pools, no encryption is applied for the OS and temporary disk. For Virtual Machine Configuration Pools, the OS and any specified data disks will be encrypted with a Microsoft platform managed key by default. Currently, you cannot specify your own key for these disks. To encrypt the temporary disk of VMs for a Batch pool with a Microsoft platform managed key, you must enable the [diskEncryptionConfiguration](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/add#diskencryptionconfiguration) property in your [Virtual Machine Configuration](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/add#virtualmachineconfiguration) Pool. For highly sensitive environments, we recommend enabling temporary disk encryption and avoiding storing sensitive data on OS and data disks. For more information, see [Create a pool with disk encryption enabled](./disk-encryption.md)
  * **Is the system-assigned managed identity on the Batch account available on the compute nodes?** No. This managed identity is currently used only for accessing the Azure Key Vault for the customer-managed key.
