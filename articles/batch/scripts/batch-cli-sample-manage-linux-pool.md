# CLI example: Create and manage a Linux pool in Azure Batch

This script demonstrates some of the commands available in the Azure CLI to create and manage a pool of Linux compute nodes in Azure Batch.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This tutorial requires version 2.0.20 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Example script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/manage-pool/manage-pool-linux.sh "Manage Linux Virtual Machine Pool")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the
resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
