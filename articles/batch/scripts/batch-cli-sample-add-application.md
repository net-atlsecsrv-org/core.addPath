# CLI example: Add an application to an Azure Batch account

This script demonstrates how to add an application for use with an Azure Batch pool or task. To set up an application to add to your Batch account, package your executable, together with any dependencies, into a zip file. 

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.20 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Example script

resource group and all resources associated with it.
