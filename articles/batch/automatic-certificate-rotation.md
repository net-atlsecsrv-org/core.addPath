# Enable automatic certificate rotation in a Batch pool

 You can create a Batch pool with a certificate that will automatically be renewed. To do so, your pool must be created with a [user-assigned managed identity](managed-identity-pools.md) that will have access to the certificate in [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for Azure Batch pools with user-assigned managed identities is currently in public preview for the following regions: West US 2, South Central US, East US, US Gov Arizona and US Gov Virginia.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Create a user-assigned identity

First, [create your user-assigned managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity) in the same tenant as your Batch account. This managed identity does not need to be in the same resource group or even in the same subscription.

Be sure to note the **Client ID** of the user-assigned managed identity. You'll need this value later.

## Create your certificate

Next, you'll need to create a certificate and add it to Azure Key Vault. If you haven't already created a key vault, you'll need to do that first. For instructions, see [Quickstart: Set and retrieve a certificate from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](../key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal.md).

When creating your certificate, be sure to set **Lifetime Action Type** to automatically renew, and specify the number of days after which the certificate should renew.

After your certificate has been created, make note of its **Secret Identifier**. You'll need this value later.

## Add an access policy in Azure Key Vault

In your key vault, assign a Key Vault access policy that allows your user-assigned managed identity to access secrets and certificates. For detailed instructions, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy using the Azure portal](../key-vault/general/assign-access-policy-portal.md).

## Create a Batch pool with a user-assigned managed identity

Create a Batch pool with your managed identity by using the [Batch .NET management library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/batch#management-library). For more information, see [Configure managed identities in Batch pools](managed-identity-pools.md).

The following example uses the Batch Management REST API to create a pool. Be sure to use your certificate's **Secret Identifier** for `observedCertificates` and your managed identity's **Client ID** for `msiClientId`, replacing the example data below.

REST API URI

```http

## Validate the certificate

To confirm that the certificate has been successfully deployed, log in to the compute node. You should see output similar to the following:

```
