# Azure Batch runtime environment variables

The [Azure Batch service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/batch/) sets the following environment variables on compute nodes. You can reference these environment variables in task command lines, and in the programs and scripts run by the command lines.

For more information about using environment variables with Batch, see [Environment settings for tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#environment-settings-for-tasks).

## Environment variable visibility

These environment variables are visible only in the context of the **task user**, the user account on the node under which a task is executed. You will *not* see these if you [connect remotely](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-api-basics/#connecting-to-compute-nodes) to a compute node via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH) and list the environment variables. This is because the user account that is used for remote connection is not the same as the account that is used by the task.

To get the current value of an environment variable, launch `cmd.exe` on a Windows compute node or `/bin/sh` on a Linux node:

`cmd /c set <ENV_VARIABLE_NAME>`

`/bin/sh printenv <ENV_VARIABLE_NAME>`

## Command-line expansion of environment variables

The command lines executed by tasks on compute nodes do not run under a shell. Therefore, these command lines cannot natively take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion (this includes the `PATH`). To take advantage of such features, you must **invoke the shell** in the command line. For example, launch `cmd.exe` on Windows compute nodes or `/bin/sh` on Linux nodes:

`cmd /c MyTaskApplication.exe %MY_ENV_VAR%`

`/bin/sh -c MyTaskApplication $MY_ENV_VAR`

## Environment variables

| Variable name                     | Description                                                              | Availability | Example |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|
| AZ_BATCH_ACCOUNT_NAME           | The name of the Batch account that the task belongs to.                  | All tasks.   | mybatchaccount |
| AZ_BATCH_ACCOUNT_URL            | The URL of the Batch account. | All tasks. | `https://myaccount.westus.batch.azure.com` |
| AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE            | A prefix of all the app package environment variables. For example, if Application "FOO" version "1" is installed onto a pool, the environment variable is AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO_1 (on Linux) or AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO#1 (on Windows). AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO_1 points to the location that the package was downloaded (a folder). When using the default version of the app package, use the AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE environment variable without the version numbers. If in Linux, and the application package name is "Agent-linux-x64" and the version is "1.1.46.0, the environment name is actually: AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_agent_linux_x64_1_1_46_0, using underscores and lower case. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-application-packages#execute-the-installed-applications) for more details. | Any task with an associated app package. Also available for all tasks if the node itself has application packages. | AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO_1 (Linux) or AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO#1 (Windows) |
| AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN   | An authentication token that grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. This environment variable is only present if the [authenticationTokenSettings](/rest/api/batchservice/task/add#authenticationtokensettings) are set when the [task is added](/rest/api/batchservice/task/add#request-body). The token value is used in the Batch APIs as credentials to create a Batch client, such as in the [BatchClient.Open() .NET API](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.batchclient.open#Microsoft_Azure_Batch_BatchClient_Open_Microsoft_Azure_Batch_Auth_BatchTokenCredentials_). | All tasks. | OAuth2 access token |
| AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR       | A directory within the [task working directory][files_dirs] in which certificates are stored for Linux compute nodes. This environment variable does not apply to Windows compute nodes.                                                  | All tasks.   |  /mnt/batch/tasks/workitems/batchjob001/job-1/task001/certs |
| AZ_BATCH_HOST_LIST              | The list of nodes that are allocated to a [multi-instance task][multi_instance] in the format `nodeIP,nodeIP`. | Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | `10.0.0.4,10.0.0.5` |
| AZ_BATCH_IS_CURRENT_NODE_MASTER | Specifies whether the current node is the master node for a [multi-instance task][multi_instance]. Possible values are `true` and `false`.| Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | `true` |
| AZ_BATCH_JOB_ID                 | The ID of the job that the task belongs to. | All tasks except start task. | batchjob001 |
| AZ_BATCH_JOB_PREP_DIR           | The full path of the job preparation [task directory][files_dirs] on the node. | All tasks except start task and job preparation task. Only available if the job is configured with a job preparation task. | C:\user\tasks\workitems\jobprepreleasesamplejob\job-1\jobpreparation |
| AZ_BATCH_JOB_PREP_WORKING_DIR   | The full path of the job preparation [task working directory][files_dirs] on the node. | All tasks except start task and job preparation task. Only available if the job is configured with a job preparation task. | C:\user\tasks\workitems\jobprepreleasesamplejob\job-1\jobpreparation\wd |
| AZ_BATCH_MASTER_NODE            | The IP address and port of the compute node on which the primary task of a [multi-instance task][multi_instance] runs. Do not use the port specified here for MPI or NCCL communication - it is reserved for the Azure Batch service. Use the variable MASTER_PORT instead, either by setting it with a value passed in through command line argument (port 6105 is a good default choice), or using the value AML sets if it does so. | Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | `10.0.0.4:6000` |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_ID                | The ID of the node that the task is assigned to. | All tasks. | tvm-1219235766_3-20160919t172711z |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_IS_DEDICATED      | If `true`, the current node is a dedicated node. If `false`, it is a [low-priority node](batch-low-pri-vms.md). | All tasks. | `true` |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_LIST              | The list of nodes that are allocated to a [multi-instance task][multi_instance] in the format `nodeIP;nodeIP`. | Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | `10.0.0.4;10.0.0.5` |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_MOUNTS_DIR        | The full path of the node level [file system mount](virtual-file-mount.md) location where all mount directories reside. Windows file shares use a drive letter, so for Windows, the mount drive is part of devices and drives.  |  All tasks including start task have access to the user, given the user is aware of the mount permissions for the mounted directory. | In Ubuntu, for example, the location is: `/mnt/batch/tasks/fsmounts` |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR          | The full path of the root of all [Batch directories][files_dirs] on the node. | All tasks. | C:\user\tasks |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR        | The full path of the [shared directory][files_dirs] on the node. All tasks that execute on a node have read/write access to this directory. Tasks that execute on other nodes do not have remote access to this directory (it is not a "shared" network directory). | All tasks. | C:\user\tasks\shared |
| AZ_BATCH_NODE_STARTUP_DIR       | The full path of the [start task directory][files_dirs] on the node. | All tasks. | C:\user\tasks\startup |

| AZ_BATCH_TASK_SHARED_DIR | A directory path that is identical for the primary task and every subtask of a [multi-instance task][multi_instance]. The path exists on every node on which the multi-instance task runs, and is read/write accessible to the task commands running on that node (both the [coordination command][coord_cmd] and the [application command][app_cmd]). Subtasks or a primary task that execute on other nodes do not have remote access to this directory (it is not a "shared" network directory). | Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | C:\user\tasks\workitems\multiinstancesamplejob\job-1\multiinstancesampletask |
| AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR       | The full path of the [task working directory][files_dirs] on the node. The currently running task has read/write access to this directory. | All tasks. | C:\user\tasks\workitems\batchjob001\job-1\task001\wd |
