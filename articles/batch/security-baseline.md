# Azure security baseline for Batch

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Batch. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Batch. **Controls** not applicable to Batch have been excluded.

 
To see how Batch completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Batch security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Batch pool(s) within a virtual network. To allow pool compute nodes to communicate securely with other virtual machines, or with an on-premises network, you can provision the pool in a subnet of an Azure virtual network. Also, deploying your Pool within a virtual network gives you control over the network security group (NSG) used to secure the individual nodes' network interfaces (NIC), as well as the subnet. Configure the NSG to allow traffic from only trusted IP(s)/locations on the Internet.

When applicable, disable public network access by using Azure Private Link to connect to the Azure Batch account via a private endpoint. The Azure Private Link service is secured and accepts connections only from authenticated and authorized private endpoints. You can additionally limit connectivity and discoverability by disabling publicly exposed RDP/SSH endpoints for compute nodes in a Batch pool.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations related to the virtual network/ network security group (NSG) associated with your Batch pool. Enable flow logs on the NSG being used to protect your Batch pool, and send logs into a Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Azure Log Analytics workspace and use Azure Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network mis-configurations.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: If required for compliance purposes, select a network virtual appliance from the Azure Marketplace that supports intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)  functionality with payload inspection capabilities.

If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with threat intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

Deploy Azure Firewall with a public IP address in the same virtual network as your Azure Batch Pool nodes. Configure network address translation (NAT) rules between trusted locations on the Internet and the private IP addresses of your individual pool nodes. On the Azure Firewall, under Threat Intelligence, configure "Alert and deny" to block  to alert and block traffic to/from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed, and only highest confidence records are included.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewalls associated with your Azure Batch pool(s). You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
