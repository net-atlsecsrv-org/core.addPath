# Azure Active Directory authentication

HTTP requests may be authenticated using the **Bearer** authentication scheme with a token acquired from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). These requests must be transmitted over TLS.

## Prerequisites

The principal that will be used to request an Azure AD token must be assigned to one of the applicable [App Configuration roles](./rest-api-authorization-azure-ad.md)

Provide each request with all HTTP headers required for Authentication. The minimum required are:

|  Request Header | Description  |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Authorization** | Authentication information required by **Bearer** scheme. Format and details are explained below. |

**Example:**

```http
Host: {myconfig}.azconfig.io
Authorization: Bearer {{AadToken}}
```

## Azure Active Directory token acquisition

Before acquiring an Azure AD token one must identify what user they want to authenticate as, what audience they are requesting the token for, and what Azure AD endpoint (authority) they should use.

### Audience

The Azure AD token must be requested with a proper audience. For Azure App Configuration, one of the following audiences should be specified when requesting a token. The audience may also be referred to as the "resource" that the token is being requested for.

- {configurationStoreName}.azconfig.io
- *.azconfig.io

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the audience requested is {configurationStoreName}.azconfig.io, it must exactly match the "Host" request header (case sensitive) used to send the request.

### Azure AD authority

The Azure AD authority is the endpoint that is used for acquiring an Azure AD token. It is in the form of `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}`. The `{tenantId}` segment refers to the Azure Active Directory tenant ID to which the user/application who is trying to authenticate belongs.

### Authentication libraries

Azure provides a set of libraries called Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries (ADAL) to simplify the process of acquiring an Azure AD token. These libraries are built for multiple languages. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries).

## **Errors**

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: HMAC-SHA256, Bearer
```

**Reason:** Authorization request header with Bearer scheme is not provided.
**Solution:** Provide valid ```Authorization``` HTTP request header

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: HMAC-SHA256, Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="Authorization token failed validation"
```

**Reason:** The Azure AD token is not valid.
**Solution:** Acquire an Azure AD token from the Azure AD Authority and ensure the proper audience is used.

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: HMAC-SHA256, Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The access token is from the wrong issuer. It must match the AD tenant associated with the subscription to which the configuration store belongs. If you just transferred your subscription and see this error message, please try back later."
```

**Reason:** The Azure AD token is not valid.
**Solution:** Acquire an Azure AD token from the Azure AD Authority and ensure the Azure AD Tenant is the one associated with the subscription, to which the configuration store belongs. This error may appear if the principal belongs to more than one Azure AD tenant.
