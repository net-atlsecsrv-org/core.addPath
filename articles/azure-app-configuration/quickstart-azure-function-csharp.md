# Quickstart: Create an Azure function with App Configuration

Azure App Configuration is a managed configuration service in Azure. You can use it to easily store and manage all your application settings in one place that's separated from your code. This quickstart shows you how to incorporate the service into an Azure function. 

You can use any code editor to do the steps in this quickstart. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an excellent option available on the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

## Prerequisites

To do this quickstart, install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs). Make sure that the **Azure development** workload is also installed. Also install the [latest Azure Functions tools](../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md#check-your-tools-version).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create an app configuration store

[!INCLUDE [azure-app-configuration-create](../../includes/azure-app-configuration-create.md)]

6. Select **Configuration Explorer** > **+ Create** to add the following key-value pairs:

    | Key | Value |
    |---|---|
    | TestApp:Settings:Message | Data from Azure App Configuration |

    Leave **Label** and **Content Type** empty for now.

## Create a function app

[!INCLUDE [Create a project using the Azure Functions template](../../includes/functions-vstools-create.md)]

## Connect to an app configuration store

1. Right-click your project, and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. On the **Browse** tab, search and add the following NuGet packages to your project. If you can't find them, select the **Include prerelease** check box.

    ```
    Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration 1.0.0 preview or later
    ```

2. Open *Function1.cs*, and add a reference to the .NET Core App Configuration provider.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration;
    ```

3. Update the `Run` method to use App Configuration by calling `builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration()`.

    ```csharp
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

        var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
        builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ConnectionString"));
        var config = builder.Build();
        string message = config["TestApp:Settings:Message"];
        message = message ?? req.Query["message"];

        string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
        dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
        message = message ?? data?.message;

        return message != null
            ? (ActionResult) new OkObjectResult(message)
            : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a message from a configuration store, on the query string or in the request body");
    }
    ```

## Test the function locally

1. Set an environment variable named **ConnectionString**, and set it to the access key to your app configuration store. If you use the Windows command prompt, run the following command and restart the command prompt to allow the change to take effect:

        setx ConnectionString "connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store"

    If you use Windows PowerShell, run the following command:

        $Env:ConnectionString = "connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store"

    If you use macOS or Linux, run the following command:

        export ConnectionString='connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store'

2. To test your function, press F5. If prompted, accept the request from Visual Studio to download and install **Azure Functions Core (CLI)** tools. You might also need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests.

3. Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.

4. Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar. The following image shows the response in the browser to the local GET request returned by the function.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a new app configuration store and used it with an Azure function. To learn more about how to use App Configuration, continue to the next tutorial that demonstrates authentication.
