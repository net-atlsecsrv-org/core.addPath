# Quickstart: Add feature flags to an Azure Functions app

In this quickstart, you create an implementation of feature management in an Azure Functions app using Azure App Configuration. You will use the App Configuration service to centrally store all your feature flags and control their states. 

The .NET Feature Management libraries extend the framework with feature flag support. These libraries are built on top of the .NET configuration system. They integrate with App Configuration through its .NET configuration provider.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) with the **Azure development** workload.
- [Azure Functions tools](../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md#check-your-tools-version)

## Create an App Configuration store

[!INCLUDE [azure-app-configuration-create](../../includes/azure-app-configuration-create.md)]

7. Select **Feature Manager** > **+Add** to add a feature flag called `Beta`.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enable feature flag named Beta](media/add-beta-feature-flag.png)

    Leave `label` and `Description` undefined for now.

8. Select **Apply** to save the new feature flag.

## Create a Functions app

[!INCLUDE [Create a project using the Azure Functions template](../../includes/functions-vstools-create.md)]

## Connect to an App Configuration store

1. Right-click your project, and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. On the **Browse** tab, search and add the following NuGet packages to your project. Verify for `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` that you are on the most recent stable build. 

    ```
    Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
    Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
    Microsoft.FeatureManagement
    ```


1. Open *Function1.cs*, and add the namespaces of these packages.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
    ```

1. Add the `Function1` static constructor below to bootstrap the Azure App Configuration provider. Next add two `static` members, a field named `ServiceProvider` to create a singleton instance of `ServiceProvider`, and a property below `Function1` named `FeatureManager` to create a singleton instance of `IFeatureManager`. Then connect to App Configuration in `Function1` by calling `AddAzureAppConfiguration()`. This process will load the configuration at application startup. The same configuration instance will be used for all Functions calls later. 

    ```csharp
        // Implements IDisposable, cached for life time of function
        private static ServiceProvider ServiceProvider; 

        static Function1()
        {
            IConfigurationRoot configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                .AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
                {
                    options.Connect(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ConnectionString"))
                           .UseFeatureFlags();
                }).Build();

            var services = new ServiceCollection();                                                                             
            services.AddSingleton<IConfiguration>(configuration).AddFeatureManagement();

            ServiceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider(); 
        }

        private static IFeatureManager FeatureManager => ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFeatureManager>();
    ```

1. Update the `Run` method to change value of the displayed message depending on the state of the feature flag.

    ```csharp
        [FunctionName("Function1")]
        public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
                [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
                ILogger log)
            {
                string message = await FeatureManager.IsEnabledAsync("Beta")
                     ? "The Feature Flag 'Beta' is turned ON"
                     : "The Feature Flag 'Beta' is turned OFF";
                
                return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult(message); 
            }
    ```

## Test the function locally

1. Set an environment variable named **ConnectionString**, where the value is the access key you retrieved earlier in your App Configuration store under **Access Keys**. If you use the Windows command prompt, run the following command and restart the command prompt to allow the change to take effect:

    ```cmd
        setx ConnectionString "connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store"
    ```

    If you use Windows PowerShell, run the following command:

    ```azurepowershell
        $Env:ConnectionString = "connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store"
    ```

    If you use macOS or Linux, run the following command:

    ```bash
        export ConnectionString='connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store'
    ```

1. Press F5 to test your function. If prompted, accept the request from Visual Studio to download and install **Azure Functions Core (CLI)** tools. You might also need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests.

1. Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.

    ![Quickstart Function debugging in VS](./media/quickstarts/function-visual-studio-debugging.png)

1. Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar. The following image shows the response indicating that the feature flag `Beta` is disabled. 

    ![Quickstart Function feature flag disabled](./media/quickstarts/functions-launch-ff-disabled.png)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **All resources**, and select the App Configuration store instance that you created.

1. Select **Feature Manager**, and change the state of the **Beta** key to **On**.

1. Return to your command prompt and cancel the running process by pressing `Ctrl-C`.  Restart your application by pressing F5. 

1. Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output using the same process as in Step 3. Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar. The browser response should have changed to indicate the feature flag `Beta` is turned on, as shown in the image below.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a feature flag and used it with an Azure Functions app via the [App Configuration provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074664).
