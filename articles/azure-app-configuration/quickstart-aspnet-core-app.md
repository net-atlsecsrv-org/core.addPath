# Quickstart: Create an ASP.NET Core app with Azure App Configuration

In this quickstart, you'll use Azure App Configuration to centralize storage and management of application settings for an ASP.NET Core app. ASP.NET Core builds a single, key-value-based configuration object using settings from one or more data sources specified by an app. These data sources are known as *configuration providers*. Because App Configuration's .NET Core client is implemented as a configuration provider, the service appears like another data source.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet)
* [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

> [!TIP]
> The Azure Cloud Shell is a free, interactive shell that you can use to run the command line instructions in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled, including the .NET Core SDK. If you're logged in to your Azure subscription, launch your [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) from shell.azure.com. You can learn more about Azure Cloud Shell by [reading our documentation](../cloud-shell/overview.md)

## Create an App Configuration store

[!INCLUDE[Azure App Configuration resource creation steps](../../includes/azure-app-configuration-create.md)]

7. Select **Operations** > **Configuration explorer** > **Create** > **Key-value** to add the following key-value pairs:

    | Key                                | Value                               |
    |------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | `TestApp:Settings:BackgroundColor` | *#FFF*                              |
    | `TestApp:Settings:FontColor`       | *#000*                              |
    | `TestApp:Settings:FontSize`        | *24*                                |
    | `TestApp:Settings:Message`         | *Data from Azure App Configuration* |

    Leave **Label** and **Content type** empty for now. Select **Apply**.

## Create an ASP.NET Core web app

Use the [.NET Core command-line interface (CLI)](/dotnet/core/tools) to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project. The [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) provides these tools for you. They're also available across the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

Run the following command to create an ASP.NET Core MVC project in a new *TestAppConfig* folder:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new mvc --no-https --output TestAppConfig
```

[!INCLUDE[Add Secret Manager support to an ASP.NET Core project](../../includes/azure-app-configuration-add-secret-manager.md)]

## Connect to the App Configuration store

1. Run the following command to add a [Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore) NuGet package reference:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore
    ```

1. Run the following command in the same directory as the *.csproj* file. The command uses Secret Manager to store a secret named `ConnectionStrings:AppConfig`, which stores the connection string for your App Configuration store. Replace the `<your_connection_string>` placeholder with your App Configuration store's connection string. You can find the connection string under **Access Keys** in the Azure portal.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet user-secrets set ConnectionStrings:AppConfig "<your_connection_string>"
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Some shells will truncate the connection string unless it's enclosed in quotes. Ensure that the output of the `dotnet user-secrets` command shows the entire connection string. If it doesn't, rerun the command, enclosing the connection string in quotes.

    Secret Manager is used only to test the web app locally. When the app is deployed to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web), use the **Connection Strings** application setting in App Service instead of Secret Manager to store the connection string.

    Access this secret using the .NET Core Configuration API. A colon (`:`) works in the configuration name with the Configuration API on all supported platforms. For more information, see [Configuration keys and values](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration#configuration-keys-and-values).

1. In *Program.cs*, add a reference to the .NET Core Configuration API namespace:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

1. Update the `CreateWebHostBuilder` method to use App Configuration by calling the `AddAzureAppConfiguration` method.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > `CreateHostBuilder` replaces `CreateWebHostBuilder` in .NET Core 3.x. Select the correct syntax based on your environment.

    #### [.NET Core 3.x](#tab/core3x)

    ```csharp
    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
                webBuilder.ConfigureAppConfiguration(config =>
                {
                    var settings = config.Build();
                    var connection = settings.GetConnectionString("AppConfig");
                    config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(connection);
                }).UseStartup<Startup>());
    ```

    #### [.NET Core 2.x](#tab/core2x)

    ```csharp
    public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration(config =>
            {
                var settings = config.Build();
                var connection = settings.GetConnectionString("AppConfig");
                config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(connection);
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
    ```

    ---

    With the preceding change, the [configuration provider for App Configuration](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration) has been registered with the .NET Core Configuration API.

## Read from the App Configuration store

Complete the following steps to read and display values stored in the App Configuration store. The .NET Core Configuration API will be used to access the store. Razor syntax will be used to display the keys' values.

Open *\<app root>/Views/Home/Index.cshtml*, and replace its content with the following code:

```cshtml
@using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
@inject IConfiguration Configuration

<style>
    body {
        background-color: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:BackgroundColor"]
    }
    h1 {
        color: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:FontColor"];
        font-size: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:FontSize"]px;
    }
</style>

<h1>@Configuration["TestApp:Settings:Message"]</h1>
```

In the preceding code, the App Configuration store's keys are used as follows:

* The `TestApp:Settings:BackgroundColor` key's value is assigned to the CSS `background-color` property.
* The `TestApp:Settings:FontColor` key's value is assigned to the CSS `color` property.
* The `TestApp:Settings:FontSize` key's value is assigned to the CSS `font-size` property.
* The `TestApp:Settings:Message` key's value is displayed as a heading.

## Build and run the app locally

1. To build the app using the .NET Core CLI, navigate to the root directory of your project. Run the following command in the command shell:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet build
    ```

1. After the build completes successfully, run the following command to run the web app locally:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

1. If you're working on your local machine, use a browser to navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. This address is the default URL for the locally hosted web app. If you're working in the Azure Cloud Shell, select the **Web Preview** button followed by **Configure**.

    ![Locate the Web Preview button](./media/quickstarts/cloud-shell-web-preview.png)

    When prompted to configure the port for preview, enter *5000* and select **Open and browse**. The web page will read "Data from Azure App Configuration."
