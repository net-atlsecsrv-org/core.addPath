# Quickstart: Create an ASP.NET Core app with Azure App Configuration

In this quickstart, you incorporate Azure App Configuration into an ASP.NET Core app to centralize storage and management of application settings separate from your code. ASP.NET Core builds a single key-value-based configuration object by using settings from one or more data sources that are specified by an application. These data sources are known as *configuration providers*. Because App Configuration's .NET Core client is implemented as such a provider, the service appears like another data source.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Create an app configuration store

[!INCLUDE [azure-app-configuration-create](../../includes/azure-app-configuration-create.md)]

6. Select **Configuration Explorer** > **+ Create** to add the following key-value pairs:

    | Key | Value |
    |---|---|
    | TestApp:Settings:BackgroundColor | White |
    | TestApp:Settings:FontSize | 24 |
    | TestApp:Settings:FontColor | Black |
    | TestApp:Settings:Message | Data from Azure App Configuration |

    Leave **Label** and **Content Type** empty for now.

## Create an ASP.NET Core web app

You use the [.NET Core command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/) to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC web app project. The advantage of using the .NET Core CLI over Visual Studio is that it's available across the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

1. Create a new folder for your project. For this quickstart, name it *TestAppConfig*.

2. In the new folder, run the following command to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC web app project:

        dotnet new mvc

## Add Secret Manager

Add the [Secret Manager tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) to your project. The Secret Manager tool stores sensitive data for development work outside of your project tree. This approach helps prevent the accidental sharing of app secrets within source code.

- Open the *.csproj* file. Add a `UserSecretsId` element as shown here, and replace its value with your own, which typically is a GUID. Save the file.

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
        <UserSecretsId>79a3edd0-2092-40a2-a04d-dcb46d5ca9ed</UserSecretsId>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Design" Version="2.1.2" PrivateAssets="All" />
    </ItemGroup>

    </Project>
    ```

## Connect to an app configuration store

1. Add a reference to the `Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore` NuGet package by running the following command:

        dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore --version 2.0.0-preview-009200001-7

2. Run the following command to restore packages for your project:

        dotnet restore

3. Add a secret named *ConnectionStrings:AppConfig* to Secret Manager.

    This secret contains the connection string to access your app configuration store. Replace the value in the following command with the connection string for your app configuration store.

    This command must be executed in the same directory as the *.csproj* file.

        dotnet user-secrets set ConnectionStrings:AppConfig <your_connection_string>

    Secret Manager is used only to test the web app locally. When the app is deployed to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web), for example, you use an application setting **Connection Strings** in App Service instead of with Secret Manager to store the connection string.

    This secret is accessed with the configuration API. A colon (:) works in the configuration name with the configuration API on all supported platforms. See [Configuration by environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/index?tabs=basicconfiguration&view=aspnetcore-2.0).

4. Open *Program.cs*, and add a reference to the .NET Core App Configuration provider.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration;
    ```

5. Update the `CreateWebHostBuilder` method to use App Configuration by calling the `config.AddAzureAppConfiguration()` method.

    ```csharp
    public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
            {
                var settings = config.Build();
                config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(settings["ConnectionStrings:AppConfig"]);
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
    ```

6. Open *Index.cshtml* in the Views > Home directory, and replace its content with the following code:

    ```html
    @using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
    @inject IConfiguration Configuration

    <style>
        body {
            background-color: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:BackgroundColor"]
        }
        h1 {
            color: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:FontColor"];
            font-size: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:FontSize"];
        }
    </style>

    <h1>@Configuration["TestApp:Settings:Message"]</h1>
    ```

7. Open *_Layout.cshtml* in the Views > Shared directory, and replace its content with the following code:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>@ViewData["Title"] - hello_world</title>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container body-content">
            @RenderBody()
        </div>

        <script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
        <script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
        <script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>

        @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Build and run the app locally

1. To build the app by using the .NET Core CLI, run the following command in the command shell:

        dotnet build

2. After the build successfully completes, run the following command to run the web app locally:

        dotnet run

3. Open a browser window, and go to `http://localhost:5000`, which is the default URL for the web app hosted locally.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a new app configuration store and used it with an ASP.NET Core web app via the [App Configuration provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074664). To learn more about how to use App Configuration, continue to the next tutorial that demonstrates authentication.
