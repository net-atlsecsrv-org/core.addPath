# Device bundles and indirectly connected devices

To support devices that interact with Azure through a device, SaaS or PaaS offerings, our submission portal (https://certify.azure.com/), and device catalog (https://devicecatalog.azure.com) enable concepts of bundling and dependencies to promote and enable these device combinations access to our Azure Certified Device program.

Depending on your product line and services offered, your situation may require a combination of these steps:

## Sensors and indirect devices
Many sensors require a device to connect to Azure. In addition, you may have multiple compatible devices that will work with the sensor device. **To accommodate these scenarios, you must first certify the device(s) before certifying the sensor that will pass information through them.**

Example matrix of submission combinations

To certify your sensor, which requires a separate device:
1.	First, [certify the device](https://certify.azure.com) and publish to the Azure Certified Device Catalog
    - If you have multiple, compatible passthrough devices (as in the example above), Submit them separately for certification and publish to the catalog as well
2.	With the sensor connected through the device, submit the sensor for certification
    * In the “Dependencies” tab of the “Device details” section, set the following values
        * Dependency type = “Hardware gateway”
        * Dependency URL = “URL link to the device on the device catalog”
        * Used during testing = “Yes”
        * Add any Customer-facing comments that should be provided to a user who sees the product description in the device catalog. (example: “Series 100 devices are required for sensors to connect to Azure”)

3.	If you have more devices you would like added as optional for this device, you can select “+ Add additional dependency”. Then follow the same guidance and note that it was not used during testing. In the Customer-facing comments, ensure your customers are aware that other devices are associated with this sensor are available (as an alternative to the device that was used during testing).

## PaaS and SaaS offerings
As part of your product portfolio, you may have devices that you certify, but your device also requires other services from your company or other third-party companies. To add this dependency, follow these steps:
1. Start the submission process for your device
2. In the “Dependencies” tab, set the following values
    - Dependency type = “Software service”
    - Service name = “[your product name]”
    - Dependency URL = “URL link to a product page that describes the service”
    - Add any customer facing comments that should be provided to a user who sees the product description in the Azure Certified Device Catalog
3. If you have other software, services or hardware dependencies you would like added as optional for this device, you can select “+ Add additional dependency” and follow the same guidance.

## Bundled products
Bundled product listings are simply the successful certification of a device with another components that will be sold as part of the bundle in one product listing. You have the ability to submit a device that includes extra components such as a temperature sensor and a camera sensor (#1) or you could submit a touch sensor that includes a passthrough device (#2). Through the “Component” feature, you have the ability to add multiple components to your listing.

If you intend to do this, you format the product listing image to indicate this product comes with other components.  In addition, if your bundle requires additional services to certify, you will need to identify those through the services dependency.

For a more detailed description on how to use the component functionality in the Azure Certified Device portal, see our [help documentation](./how-to-using-the-components-feature.md). 

If a device is a passthrough device with a separate sensor in the same product, create one component to reflect the passthrough device, and another component to reflect the sensor. Components can be added to your project in the Product details tab of the Device details section:

![Adding components](./media/indirect-connected-device/picture-6.png )

For the passthrough device, set the Component type as a Customer Ready Product, and fill in the other fields as relevant for your product. Example:

![Component details](./media/indirect-connected-device/picture-7.png )

For the sensor, add a second component, setting the Component type as Peripheral and Attachment method as Discrete. Example:

![Second component details](./media/indirect-connected-device/picture-8.png )

Once the Sensor component has been created, Edit the details, navigate to the Sensors tab, and then add the sensor details. Example:

Complete your projects details and Submit your device for certification as normal.
