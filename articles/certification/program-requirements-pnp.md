# IoT Plug and Play Certification Requirements

This document outlines the device specific capabilities that will be represented in the Azure IoT Device catalog. A capability is singular device attribute that may be software implementation or combination of software and hardware implementations.

## Program Purpose

IoT Plug and Play Preview enables solution builders to integrate smart devices with their solutions without any manual configuration. At the core of IoT Plug and Play, is a device model that a device uses to advertise its capabilities to an IoT Plug and Play-enabled application. This model is structured as a set of elements: Telemetry, Properties and Commands.

Promise of IoT Plug and Play certification are:

1.  Defined device models and interfaces are compliant with the  [Digital Twin Definition Language](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl)  
2.  Secure provisioning and easy transfer of ID scope ownership in Device Provisioning Services
3.  Easy integration with Azure IoT based solutions using the [Digital Twin APIs](../iot-pnp/concepts-digital-twin.md)  : Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Central
4.  Validated product truth on certified devices

## Requirements

**[Required] Device to cloud: The purpose of test is to make sure devices that send telemetry works with IoT Hub**
