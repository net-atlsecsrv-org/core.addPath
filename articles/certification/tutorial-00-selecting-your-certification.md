# Tutorial: Select your certification program

Congratulations on choosing the Azure Certified Device program! We're excited to have you join our ecosystem of certified devices. To begin, you must first determine which certification programs best suit your device capabilities.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

## Selecting a certification program for your device

All devices are required to meet the baseline requirements outlined by the [**Azure Certified Device**](./program-requirements-azure-certified-device.md) certification. The other three certification badges build on this program and deliver a different customer value. You can select one or more of the three incremental badges (IoT Plug and Play, Edge Managed, and Edge Secured Core *preview).

1. Review each of the certification programs' requirements in the table below. Detailed requirements for each program can be seleted from the headers.

    |Requirement|[IoT Plug and Play](./program-requirements-edge-secured-core.md)|[Edge Managed](./program-requirements-edge-managed.md)|[Edge Secured-core](./program-requirements-edge-secured-core.md)|
    ---|---|---|---
    | Processor | Any|MPU/CPU|MPU/CPU|
    | OS | Any|[Tier 1 OS](../iot-edge/support.md?view=iotedge-2018-06&preserve-view=true))|[Tier 1 OS](../iot-edge/support.md?view=iotedge-2018-06&preserve-view=true)|
    | IoT Edge runtime | Not supported |Required|Required|
    | Defender for IoT | Not supported|Required|Required|
    | ADU/Windows Update | Not supported|Required|Required|

1. Once you feel that you understand what is required of your device, review teh technical requirements for the program. This may be the Azure Certified Device certification, or a combination of the baseline certification with one of the three incremental badges.
