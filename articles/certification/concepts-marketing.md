# Marketing properties

In the process of [adding your device details](tutorial-02-adding-device-details.md), you will be required to supply marketing information that will be displayed on the [Azure Certified Device catalog](https://devicecatalog.azure.com). This information is collected within the Azure Certified Device portal during the certification submission process and will be used as filter parameters on the catalog. This article provides a mapping between the fields collected in the portal to how they appear on the catalog. After reading this article, partners should better understand what information to provide during the certification process to best represent their product on the catalog.
