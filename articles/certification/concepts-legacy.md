# Legacy devices on the Azure Certified Device catalog

You may have noticed on the Azure Certified Device catalog that some devices don't have the blue outline or the "Azure Certified Device" label. These devices (dubbed "legacy devices") were previously certified under the legacy program.

## Certified for Azure IoT program

Before the launch of the Azure Certified Device program, hardware partners could previously certify their products under the Certified for Azure IoT program. The Azure Certified Device certification program refocuses its mission to deliver on customer promises rather than technical device capabilities.

Devices that have been certified as an ‘IoT Hub certified device’ appear on the Azure Certified Device catalog as a ‘legacy device.’ This label indicates devices have previously qualified through the now-retired program, but haven't been certified through the updated Azure Certified Device program. These devices are clearly noted in the catalog by their lack of blue outline, and can be found through the "IoT Hub Certified devices (legacy)" filter.
