# What's new in Azure SQL Data Warehouse? August 2018
Azure SQL Data Warehouse receives improvements continually. This article describes the new features and changes that have been introduced in August 2018.

## Automatic Intelligent Insights
Microsoft has introduced [Automatic intelligent insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/automatic-intelligent-insights-to-optimize-performance-with-sql-data-warehouse/) to deliver on the cloud promise of automation for your data warehouse. You will no longer need to monitor your data warehouse for data skew and suboptimal table statistics. At no additional cost, SQL Data Warehouse surfaces intelligent insights for all Gen2 instances. By integrating with [Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-performance-recommendations), you can automatically receive best practice recommendations to improve the performance of your active workloads. SQL Data Warehouse analyzes your workload and surfaces recommendations based on your usage. This analysis happens daily allowing you to monitor the usage reports and recommendations for improvements to your workload.

You can view the recommendations in the Azure Advisor portal:

You can drill into each category to see the recommendations for the specific alert:

## Bug fixes

| Title | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Potential Query failures when the split count exceeds max limit** |When the 1 million upper bound file-split limit is exceeded an unhandled exception caused the SQL Engine to dump, and all queries failed. This fix addressed the issue by handling the exception correctly and returning an error without causing queries to fail. |
| **Increased ExternalMoveReadersPerNode default value to improve load performance** |This issue was caused by the ExternalMoveReadersPerNode property setting being out of sync with the service fabric setting. This regression caused a degraded Gen2 load performance. The fix brings Gen2 load performance back within optimized design parameters.|
