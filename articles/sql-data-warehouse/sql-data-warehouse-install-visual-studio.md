# Install Visual Studio and SSDT for SQL Data Warehouse
Use Visual Studio 2019 to develop applications for SQL Data Warehouse. Currently Visual Studio 2019 SSDT isn't supported for SQL Data Warehouse. 

Using Visual Studio with SSDT allows you to use the SQL Server Object Explorer to explore tables, views, stored procedures, and many more objects visually in your SQL Data Warehouse. It also allows you to run queries.
