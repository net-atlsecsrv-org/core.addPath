# Getting started with Visual Studio 2019
Visual Studio **2019** SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is a single tool allowing you to do the following:

- Connect, query, and develop applications
- Leverage an object explorer to visually explore all objects in your data model including tables, views, stored procedures, and etc.
- Generate T-SQL data definition language (DDL) scripts for your objects
- Develop your data warehouse using a state-based approach with SSDT Database Projects
- Integrate your database project with source control systems such as Git with Azure Repos
- Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines with automation servers such as Azure DevOps

## Install Visual Studio 2019
See [Download Visual Studio 2019][] to download and install Visual Studio **16.3 and above**. During install, select the data storage and processing workload. Standalone SSDT installation is no longer required in Visual Studio 2019.
