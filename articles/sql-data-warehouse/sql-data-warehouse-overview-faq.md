# SQL Data Warehouse Frequently asked questions

## General

Q. What does SQL DW offer for data security?

A. SQL DW offers several solutions for protecting data such as TDE and auditing. For more information, see [Security].

Q. Where can I find out what legal or business standards is SQL DW compliant with?

A. Visit the [Microsoft Compliance] page for various compliance offerings by product such as SOC and ISO. 
First choose by Compliance title, then expand Azure in the Microsoft in-scope cloud services section on the right side of the page to see what services are Azure services are compliant.

Q. Can I connect PowerBI?

A. Yes! Though PowerBI supports direct query with SQL DW, itâ€™s not intended for large number of users or real-time data. For production use of PowerBI, we recommend using PowerBI on top of Azure Analysis Services or Analysis Service IaaS. 

Q. What are SQL Data Warehouse Capacity Limits?

A. See our current [capacity limits] page. 

Q. Why is my Scale/Pause/Resume taking so long?

A. A variety of factors can influence the time for compute management operations. A common case for  long running operations is transactional rollback. When a scale or pause operation is initiated, all incoming sessions are blocked and queries are drained. In order to leave the system in a stable state, transactions must be rolled back before an operation can commence. The greater the number and larger the log size of transactions, the longer the operation will be stalled restoring the system to a stable state.

## User support

Q. I have a feature request, where do I submit it?

A. If you have a feature request, submit it on our [UserVoice] page

Q. How can I do x?

A. For help in developing with SQL Data Warehouse, you can ask questions on our [Stack Overflow] page. 

Q. How do I submit a support ticket?

A. [Support Tickets] can be filed through Azure portal.

## SQL language/feature support 

Q. What datatypes does SQL Data Warehouse support?

A. See SQL Data Warehouse [data types].

Q. What table features do you support?

A. While SQL Data Warehouse supports many features, some are not supported and are documented in [Unsupported Table Features].

## Tooling and administration

Q. Do you support Database projects in Visual Studio.

A. We currently do not support Database projects in Visual Studio for SQL Data Warehouse. If you'd like to cast a vote to get this feature, visit our User Voice 
[Database projects feature request].

Q. Does SQL Data Warehouse support REST APIs?

A. Yes. Most REST functionality that can be used with SQL Database is also available with SQL Data Warehouse. You can find API information within REST documentation pages or
[MSDN].


## Loading

Q. What client drivers do you support?

A. Driver support for DW can be found on the [Connection Strings] page

Q: What file formats are supported by PolyBase with SQL Data Warehouse?

A: Orc, RC, Parquet, and flat delimited text

Q: What can I connect to from SQL DW using PolyBase? 

A: [Azure Data Lake Store] and [Azure Storage Blobs]

Q: Is computation pushdown possible  when connecting to Azure Storage Blobs or ADLS? 

A: No, SQL DW PolyBase only interacts the storage components. 

Q: Can I connect to HDI?

A: HDI can use either ADLS or WASB as the HDFS layer. If you have either as your HDFS layer, then you can load that data into SQL DW. However, you cannot generate pushdown computation to the HDI instance.
