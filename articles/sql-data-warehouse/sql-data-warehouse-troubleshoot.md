# Troubleshooting Azure SQL Data Warehouse
This article lists common troubleshooting question.

## Connecting
| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18456) | This error occurs when an AAD user tries to connect to the master database, but does not have a user in master.  To correct this issue, either specify the SQL Data Warehouse you wish to connect to at connection time or add the user to the master database.  See [Security overview][Security overview] article for more details. |
| The server principal "MyUserName" is not able to access the database "master" under the current security context. Cannot open user default database. Login failed. Login failed for user 'MyUserName'. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 916) | This error occurs when an AAD user tries to connect to the master database, but does not have a user in master.  To correct this issue, either specify the SQL Data Warehouse you wish to connect to at connection time or add the user to the master database.  See [Security overview][Security overview] article for more details. |
| CTAIP error                                                  | This error can occur when a login has been created on the SQL server master database, but not in the SQL Data Warehouse database.  If you encounter this error, take a look at the [Security overview][Security overview] article.  This article explains how to create a login and user on master, and then how to create a user in the SQL Data Warehouse database. |
| Blocked by Firewall                                          | Azure SQL databases are protected by server and database level firewalls to ensure only known IP addresses have access to a database. The firewalls are secure by default, which means that you must explicitly enable and IP address or range of addresses before you can connect.  To configure your firewall for access, follow the steps in [Configure server firewall access for your client IP][Configure server firewall access for your client IP] in the [Provisioning instructions][Provisioning instructions]. |
| Cannot connect with tool or driver                           | SQL Data Warehouse recommends using [SSMS][SSMS], [SSDT for Visual Studio][SSDT for Visual Studio], or [sqlcmd][sqlcmd] to query your data. For more information on drivers and connecting to SQL Data Warehouse, see [Drivers for Azure SQL Data Warehouse][Drivers for Azure SQL Data Warehouse] and [Connect to Azure SQL Data Warehouse][Connect to Azure SQL Data Warehouse] articles. |

## Tools
| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual Studio object explorer is missing AAD users           | This is a known issue.  As a workaround, view the users in [sys.database_principals][sys.database_principals].  See [Authentication to Azure SQL Data Warehouse][Authentication to Azure SQL Data Warehouse] to learn more about using Azure Active Directory with SQL Data Warehouse. |
| Manual scripting, using the scripting wizard, or connecting via SSMS is slow, not responding, or producing errors | Ensure that users have been created in the master database. In scripting options, also make sure that the engine edition is set as “Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse Edition” and engine type is “Microsoft Azure SQL Database”. |
| Generate scripts fails in SSMS                               | Generating a script for SQL data warehouse fails if the option "Generate script for dependent objects" option is set to "True." As a workaround, users must manually go to Tools -> Options ->SQL Server Object Explorer -> Generate script for dependent options and set to false |

## Performance
| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query performance troubleshooting                            | If you are trying to troubleshoot a particular query, start with [Learning how to monitor your queries][Learning how to monitor your queries]. |
| Poor query performance and plans often is a result of missing statistics | The most common cause of poor performance is lack of statistics on your tables.  See [Maintaining table statistics][Statistics] for details on how to create statistics and why they are critical to your performance. |
| Low concurrency / queries queued                             | Understanding [Workload management][Workload management] is important in order to understand how to balance memory allocation with concurrency. |
| How to implement best practices                              | The best place to start to learn ways to improve query performance is [SQL Data Warehouse best practices][SQL Data Warehouse best practices] article. |
| How to improve performance with scaling                      | Sometimes the solution to improving performance is to simply add more compute power to your queries by [Scaling your SQL Data Warehouse][Scaling your SQL Data Warehouse]. |
| Poor query performance as a result of poor index quality     | Some times queries can slow down because of [Poor columnstore index quality][Poor columnstore index quality].  See this article for more information and how to [Rebuild indexes to improve segment quality][Rebuild indexes to improve segment quality]. |

## System management
| Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Msg 40847: Could not perform the operation because server would exceed the allowed Database Transaction Unit quota of 45000. | Either reduce the [DWU][DWU] of the database you are trying to create or [request a quota increase][request a quota increase]. |
| Investigating space utilization                              | See [Table sizes][Table sizes] to understand the space utilization of your system. |
| Help with managing tables                                    | See the [Table overview][Overview] article for help with managing your tables.  This article also includes links into more detailed topics like [Table data types][Data types], [Distributing a table][Distribute], [Indexing a table][Index],  [Partitioning a table][Partition], [Maintaining table statistics][Statistics] and [Temporary tables][Temporary]. |
| Transparent data encryption (TDE) progress bar is not updating in the Azure portal | You can view the state of TDE via [powershell](/powershell/module/az.sql/get-azsqldatabasetransparentdataencryption). |


## Differences from SQL Database
| Issue                                 | Resolution                                                   |
| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsupported SQL Database features     | See [Unsupported table features][Unsupported table features]. |
| Unsupported SQL Database data types   | See [Unsupported data types][Unsupported data types].        |
| DELETE and UPDATE limitations         | See [UPDATE workarounds][UPDATE workarounds], [DELETE workarounds][DELETE workarounds] and [Using CTAS to work around unsupported UPDATE and DELETE syntax][Using CTAS to work around unsupported UPDATE and DELETE syntax]. |
| MERGE statement is not supported      | See [MERGE workarounds][MERGE workarounds].                  |
| Stored procedure limitations          | See [Stored procedure limitations][Stored procedure limitations] to understand some of the limitations of stored procedures. |
| UDFs do not support SELECT statements | This is a current limitation of our UDFs.  See [CREATE FUNCTION][CREATE FUNCTION] for the syntax we support. |
