# Memory and concurrency limits for Azure SQL Data Warehouse
View the memory and concurrency limits allocated to the various performance levels and resource classes in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. For more information, and to apply these capabilities to your workload management plan, see [Resource classes for workload management](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md). 

Currently there are two generations available with SQL Data Warehouse â€“ Gen1 and Gen2. We recommend you leverage Gen2 of SQL Data Warehouse to get the best performance for your data warehouse workload. Gen2 introduces a new NVMe Solid State Disk cache that keeps the most frequently accessed data close to the CPUs. This removes the remote I/O for your most intensive and demanding workloads. In addition to performance, Gen2 offers the greatest level of scale by enabling you to scale up to 30,000 Data Warehouse Units and providing unlimited columnar storage. We will still support the previous generation (Gen1) of SQL Data Warehouse and retain the same features; however, we encourage you to [upgrade to Gen2](upgrade-to-latest-generation.md) at your earliest convenience. 

## Data warehouse capacity settings
The following tables show the maximum capacity for the data warehouse at different performance levels. To change the performance level, see [Scale compute - portal](quickstart-scale-compute-portal.md).

### Gen2

Gen2 provides 2.5x more memory per query than the Gen1. This extra memory helps the Gen2 deliver its fast performance.  The performance levels for the Gen2 range from DW100c to DW30000c.

The maximum Gen2 DWU is DW30000c, which has 60 Compute nodes and one distribution per Compute node. For example, a 600 TB data warehouse at DW30000c processes approximately 10 TB per Compute node.

### Gen1

The service levels for Gen1 range from DW100 to DW6000.

## Concurrency maximums
To ensure each query has enough resources to execute efficiently, SQL Data Warehouse tracks resource utilization by assigning concurrency slots to each query. The system puts queries into a queue based on importance and concurrency slots. Queries wait in the queue until enough concurrency slots are available. [Importance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-workload-importance) and concurrency slots determine CPU prioritization. For more information, see [Analyze your workload](analyze-your-workload.md)

**Dynamic resource classes**

> [!NOTE]
> The smallrc resource class on Gen2 dynamically adds memory as the service level increases and only supports a max 32 concurrent queries at DW1000c and 4 and DW100c.  Once the instance is scaled beyond DW1500c, the concurrency slots and memory used by smallrc increases as the service level increases.

The following table shows the maximum concurrent queries and concurrency slots for each [dynamic resource class](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md). Unlike Gen1, dynamic resource classes on Gen2 are truly dynamic.  Gen2 uses a 3-10-22-70 memory percentage allocation for small-medium-large-xlarge resource classes across all service levels.

Dynamic resource classes
> [!NOTE]
> The smallrc resource class on Gen1 allocates a fixed amount of memory per query, similar in fashion to the static resource class staticrc10.  Because smallrc is static, it has the ability to scale to 128 concurrent queries.

When one of these thresholds is met, new queries are queued and executed on a first-in, first-out basis.  As a queries finishes and the number of queries and slots fall below the limits, SQL Data Warehouse releases queued queries.
