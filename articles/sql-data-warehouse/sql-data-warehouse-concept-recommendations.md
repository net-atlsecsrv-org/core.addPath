# SQL Data Warehouse Recommendations

This article describes the recommendations served by SQL Data Warehouse through Azure Advisor.  

SQL Data Warehouse provides recommendations to ensure your data warehouse is consistently optimized for performance. Data warehouse recommendations are tightly integrated with [Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-performance-recommendations) to provide you with best practices directly within the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/Azureadvisor). SQL Data Warehouse analyzes the current state of your data warehouse, collects telemetry, and surfaces recommendations for your active workload on a daily cadence. The supported data warehouse recommendation scenarios are outlined below along with how to apply recommended actions.

If you have any feedback on the SQL Data Warehouse Advisor or run into any issues, reach out to [sqldwadvisor@service.microsoft.com](mailto:sqldwadvisor@service.microsoft.com).   

Click [here](https://aka.ms/Azureadvisor) to check your recommendations today! Currently this feature is applicable to Gen2 data warehouses only. 

## Data Skew

Data skew can cause additional data movement or resource bottlenecks when running your workload. The following documentation describes show to identify data skew and prevent it from happening by selecting an optimal distribution key.

- [Identify and remove skew](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-distribute#how-to-tell-if-your-distribution-column-is-a-good-choice) 

## No or Outdated Statistics

Having suboptimal statistics can severely impact query performance as it can cause the SQL Data Warehouse query optimizer to generate suboptimal query plans. The following documentation describes the best practices around creating and updating statistics:

- [Creating and updating table statistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics)

To see the list of impacted tables by these recommendations, run the following  [T-SQL script](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-data-warehouse-samples/blob/master/samples/sqlops/MonitoringScripts/ImpactedTables). Advisor continuously runs the same T-SQL script to generate these recommendations.

## Replicate Tables

For replicated table recommendations, Advisor detects table candidates based on the following
physical characteristics:

- Replicated table size
- Number of columns
- Table distribution type
- Number of partitions

Advisor continuously leverages workload-based heuristics such as table access frequency, rows returned on average, and thresholds around data warehouse size and activity to ensure high-quality recommendations are generated. 

The following describes workload-based heuristics you may find in the Azure portal for each replicated table recommendation:

- Scan avg- the average percent of rows that were returned from the table for each table access over the past seven days
- Frequent read, no update - indicates that the table has not been updated in the past seven days while showing access activity
- Read/update ratio - the ratio of how frequent the table was accessed relative to when it gets updated over the past seven days
- Activity - measures the usage based on access activity. This compares the table access activity relative to the average table access activity across the data warehouse over the past seven days. 

Currently Advisor will only show at most four replicated table candidates at once with clustered columnstore indexes prioritizing the highest activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The replicated table recommendation is not full proof and does not take into account data movement operations. We are working on adding this as a heuristic but in the meantime, you should always validate your workload after applying the recommendation. Please contact sqldwadvisor@service.microsoft.com if you discover replicated table recommendations that causes your workload to regress.
