# Sensor partner integration

This article provides information about the Azure FarmBeats **Translator** component, which enables sensor partner integration.

Using this component, partners can integrate with FarmBeats using FarmBeats Datahub APIs and send customer device data and telemetry to FarmBeats Datahub. Once the data is available in FarmBeats, it is visualized using the FarmBeats Accelerator and can be used for data fusion and for building machine learning/artificial intelligence models.

## Before you start

To develop the Translator component, you will need the following credentials that will enable access to the FarmBeats APIs.

- API Endpoint
- Tenant ID
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- EventHub Connection String

See this section for getting the above credentials: [Enable Device Integration](get-sensor-data-from-sensor-partner.md#enable-device-integration-with-farmbeats)

## Translator development

**REST API-based integration**

Sensor data integration capabilities of FarmBeats are exposed via the REST API. Capabilities include metadata definition, device and sensor provisioning, and device and sensor management.

**Telemetry ingestion**

The telemetry data is mapped to a canonical message that's published on Azure Event Hubs for processing. Azure Event Hubs is a service that enables real-time data (telemetry) ingestion from connected devices and applications.

**API development**

The APIs contain Swagger technical documentation. For more information on the APIs and their corresponding requests or responses, see [Swagger](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsSwagger).

**Authentication**

FarmBeats uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory authentication. Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support.

For more information, see [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).

FarmBeats Datahub uses bearer authentication, which needs the following credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - Tenant ID

Using these credentials, the caller can request an access token. The token needs to be sent in the subsequent API requests, in the header section, as follows:

```
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token, …} 
```

The following sample Python code gives the access token, which can be used for subsequent API calls to FarmBeats.

```python
import requests
import json
import msal

# Your service principal App ID
CLIENT_ID = "<CLIENT_ID>"
# Your service principal password
CLIENT_SECRET = "<CLIENT_SECRET>"
# Tenant ID for your Azure subscription
TENANT_ID = "<TENANT_ID>"

AUTHORITY_HOST = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com'
AUTHORITY = AUTHORITY_HOST + '/' + TENANT_ID

ENDPOINT = "https://<yourfarmbeatswebsitename-api>.azurewebsites.net"
SCOPE = ENDPOINT + "/.default"

context = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(CLIENT_ID, authority=AUTHORITY, client_credential=CLIENT_SECRET)
token_response = context.acquire_token_for_client(SCOPE)
# We should get an access token here
access_token = token_response.get('access_token')
```


**HTTP request headers**

Here are the most common request headers that need to be specified when you make an API call to FarmBeats Datahub.


**Header** | **Description and example**
--- | ---
Content-Type | The request format (Content-Type: application/<format>). For FarmBeats Datahub APIs, the format is JSON. Content-Type: application/json
Authorization | Specifies the access token required to make an API call. Authorization: Bearer <Access-Token>
Accept | The response format. For FarmBeats Datahub APIs, the format is JSON. Accept: application/json

**API requests**

To make a REST API request, you combine the HTTP (GET, POST, or PUT) method, the URL to the API service, the  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to a resource to query, submit data to, update, or delete, and one or more HTTP request headers. The URL to the API service is the API endpoint you provide. Here's a sample: https://\<yourdatahub-website-name>.azurewebsites.net

Optionally, you can include query parameters on GET calls to filter, limit the size of, and sort the data in the responses.

The following sample request is to get the list of devices.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://microsoft-farmbeats.azurewebsites.net/Device" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <Access-Token>"
```
Most GET, POST, and PUT calls require a JSON request body.

The following sample request is to create a device. (This sample has an input JSON with the request body.)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://microsoft-farmbeats.azurewebsites.net/Device" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <Access-Token>" -d "{  \"deviceModelId\": \"ID123\",  \"hardwareId\": \"MHDN123\",  \"reportingInterval\": 900,  \"name\": \"Device123\",  \"description\": \"Test Device 123\",}"
```

## Data format

JSON is a common language-independent data format that provides a simple text representation of arbitrary data structures. For more information, see [json.org](http://json.org).

## Metadata specifications

FarmBeats Datahub has the following APIs that enable device partners to create and manage device or sensor metadata.

- /**DeviceModel**: DeviceModel corresponds to the metadata of the device, such as the manufacturer and the type of device, which is either gateway or node.
- /**Device**: Device corresponds to a physical device present on the farm.
- /**SensorModel**: SensorModel corresponds to the metadata of the sensor, such as the manufacturer, the type of sensor, which is either analog or digital, and the sensor measure, such as ambient temperature and pressure.
- /**Sensor**: Sensor corresponds to a physical sensor that records values. A sensor is typically connected to a device with a device ID.

  DeviceModel | Description |
  --- | ---
  Type (node, gateway)  | Type of the device - Node or Gateway |
  Manufacturer  | Name of the manufacturer |
  ProductCode  | Device product code or model name or number. For example, EnviroMonitor#6800. |

 For information on each of the objects and their properties, see [Swagger](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsDatahubSwagger).

 > [!NOTE]
 > The APIs return unique IDs for each instance created. This ID needs to be retained by the Translator for device management and metadata sync.


**Metadata sync**

The Translator should send updates on the metadata. For example, update scenarios are change of device or sensor name and change of device or sensor location.

The Translator should have the ability to add new devices or sensors that were installed by the user post linking of FarmBeats. Similarly, if a device or sensor was updated by the user, the same should be updated in FarmBeats for the corresponding device or sensor. Typical scenarios that require updating a device or sensor are a change in a device location or the addition of sensors in a node.


> [!NOTE]
> Delete isn't supported for device or sensor metadata.
>
> To update metadata, it's mandatory to call /Get/{id} on the device or sensor, update the changed properties, and then do a /Put/{id} so that any properties set by the user aren't lost.

### Add new types and units

FarmBeats supports adding new sensor measure types and units. For more information about the /ExtendedType API, see [Swagger](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsSwagger).

## Telemetry specifications

The telemetry data is mapped to a canonical message that's published on Azure Event Hubs for processing. Azure Event Hubs is a service that enables real-time data (telemetry) ingestion from connected devices and applications.

## Send telemetry data to FarmBeats

To send telemetry data to FarmBeats, create a client that sends messages to an event hub in FarmBeats. For more information about telemetry data, see [Sending telemetry to an event hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-dotnet-standard-getstarted-send).

Here's a sample Python code that sends telemetry as a client to a specified event hub.

```python
import azure
from azure.eventhub import EventHubClient, Sender, EventData, Receiver, Offset
EVENTHUBCONNECTIONSTRING = "<EventHub Connection String provided by customer>"
EVENTHUBNAME = "<EventHub Name provided by customer>"

write_client = EventHubClient.from_connection_string(EVENTHUBCONNECTIONSTRING, eventhub=EVENTHUBNAME, debug=False)
sender = write_client.add_sender(partition="0")
write_client.run()
for i in range(5):
    telemetry = "<Canonical Telemetry message>"
    print("Sending telemetry: " + telemetry)
    sender.send(EventData(telemetry))
write_client.stop()

```

The canonical message format is as follows:

```json
{
"deviceid": "<id of the Device created>",
"timestamp": "<timestamp in ISO 8601 format>",
"version" : "1",
"sensors": [
    {
      "id": "<id of the sensor created>",
      "sensordata": [
        {
          "timestamp": "< timestamp in ISO 8601 format >",
          "<sensor measure name (as defined in the Sensor Model)>": <value>
        },
        {
          "timestamp": "<timestamp in ISO 8601 format>",
          "<sensor measure name (as defined in the Sensor Model)>": <value>
        }
      ]
    }
 ]
}
```
All key names in the telemetry JSON should be lowercase. Examples are deviceid and sensordata.

For example, here's a telemetry message:


```json
{
  "deviceid": "7f9b4b92-ba45-4a1d-a6ae-c6eda3a5bd12",
  "timestamp": "2019-06-22T06:55:02.7279559Z",
  "version" : "1",
  "sensors": [
    {
      "id": "d8e7beb4-72de-4eed-9e00-45e09043a0b3",
      "sensordata": [
        {
          "timestamp": "2019-06-22T06:55:02.7279559Z",
          "hum_max": 15
        },
        {
          "timestamp": "2019-06-22T06:55:02.7279559Z",
          "hum_min": 42
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "d8e7beb4-72de-4eed-9e00-45e09043a0b3",
      "sensordata": [
        {
          "timestamp": "2019-06-22T06:55:02.7279559Z",
          "hum_max": 20
        },
        {
          "timestamp": "2019-06-22T06:55:02.7279559Z",
          "hum_min": 89
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

> [!NOTE]
> The following sections are related to other changes (eg. UI, error management etc.) that the sensor partner can refer to in developing the Translator component.


## Link a FarmBeats account

After customers have purchased and deployed devices or sensors, they can access the device data and telemetry on the device partners' software as a service (SaaS) portal. Device partners can enable customers to link their account to their FarmBeats instance on Azure by providing a way to input the following credentials:

   - Display name (an optional field for users to define a name for this integration)
   - API endpoint
   - Tenant ID
   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - EventHub connection string
   - Start date

   > [!NOTE]
   > The start date enables the historical data feed, that is, the data from the date specified by the user.

## Unlink FarmBeats

Device partners can enable customers to unlink an existing FarmBeats integration. Unlinking FarmBeats shouldn't delete any device or sensor metadata that was created in FarmBeats Datahub. Unlinking does the following:

   - Stops telemetry flow.
   - Deletes and erases the integration credentials on the device partner.

## Edit FarmBeats integration

Device partners can enable customers to edit the FarmBeats integration settings if the client secret or connection string changes. In this case, only the following fields are editable:

   - Display name (if applicable)
   - Client secret (should be displayed in "2x8***********" format or the Show/Hide feature rather than clear text)
   - Connection string (should be displayed in "2x8***********" format or Show/Hide feature rather than clear text)

## View the last telemetry sent

Device partners can enable customers to view the timestamp of the last telemetry that was sent, which is found under **Telemetry Sent**. This is the time at which the latest telemetry was successfully sent to FarmBeats.

## Troubleshooting and error management

**Troubleshoot option or support**

If customer is unable to receive device data or telemetry in the FarmBeats instance specified, the device partner should provide support and a mechanism for troubleshooting.

**Telemetry data retention**

The telemetry data should also be retained for a predefined time period so that it can be useful in debugging or resending the telemetry if an error or data loss occurs.

**Error management or error notification**

If an error affects the device or sensor metadata or the data integration or telemetry data flow in the device partner system, customer should receive a notification. A mechanism to resolve any errors should also be designed and implemented.

**Connection checklist**

Device manufacturers or partners can use the following checklist to ensure that the credentials provided by the customer are accurate:

   - Check to see whether an access token is received with the credentials that were provided.
   - Check to see whether an API call succeeds with the access token that was received.
   - Check to see whether the EventHub client connection is established.

## Next steps
