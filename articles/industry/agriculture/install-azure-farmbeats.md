# Install Azure FarmBeats

This article describes how to install Azure FarmBeats in your Azure subscription.

Azure FarmBeats is a business-to-business offering available in Azure Marketplace. It enables aggregation of agriculture data sets across providers and generation of actionable insights. Azure FarmBeats does this by enabling you to build artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) models based on fused data sets. The two main components of Azure FarmBeats are:

- **Datahub**: An API layer that enables aggregation, normalization, and contextualization of various agriculture data sets across different providers.

- **Accelerator**: Web application that is built on top of Datahub. It jump-starts your model development and visualization. The accelerator uses Azure FarmBeats APIs to demonstrate visualization of ingested sensor data as charts and visualization of model output as maps.

## General information

### Time taken

The entire setup of Azure FarmBeats, including the preparation and installation will take less than an hour.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to complete the following steps before you start the actual installation of Azure FarmBeats:

### Verify Permissions

You'll need the following permissions in the Azure tenant to install Azure FarmBeats:

- Tenant - AAD app creator
- Subscription - Owner
- Resource Group in which FarmBeats is being installed - Owner

The first two permissions are needed for [creating the AAD application](#create-an-aad-application) step. If needed, you can get someone with the appropriate permissions to create the AAD application.

The person running the FarmBeats install from marketplace needs to be an owner of the Resource Group in which FarmBeats is being installed. For subscription owners, this happens automatically when Resource Group is created. For others, please pre-create the Resource Group and ask the Subscription owner to make you an owner of the Resource Group.

You can verify your access permissions in the Azure portal by following the instructions on [Azure role-based access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/check-access).

### Decide Subscription and Region

You'll need the Azure subscription ID and the region where you want to install Azure FarmBeats. Choose one of the regions listed in the [Regions supported](#regions-supported) section.

Make a note of the **Azure Subscription ID** and the **Azure Region**.

### Create an AAD application

Azure FarmBeats require Azure Active Directory application creation and registration. To successfully run the AAD creation script, the following permissions are needed:

- Tenant - AAD app creator
- Subscription - Owner

Run the following steps in a Cloud Shell instance using the PowerShell environment. First-time users will be prompted to select a subscription and create a storage account. Complete the setup as instructed.

1. Download the [AAD app generator script](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsAADScript)

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
        wget -q https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsAADScript -O ./create_aad_script.ps1
    ```

2. By default, the file is downloaded to your home directory. Navigate to the directory.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
        cd
    ```

3. Run the AAD script

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
        ./create_aad_script.ps1
    ```

4. The script asks for the following three inputs:

    - **FarmBeats Website Name**: This is the unique URL prefix for your FarmBeats web application. In case the prefix is already taken, the script will error out. Once installed, your FarmBeats deployment will be accessible from https://\<FarmBeats-website-name>.azurewebsites.net and the swagger APIs will be at https://\<FarmBeats-website-name>-api.azurewebsites.net

    - **Azure login ID**: Provide Azure login ID for the user who you want to be added as admin of FarmBeats. This user can then grant access to access FarmBeats web application to other users. The login ID is generally of the form john.doe@domain.com. Azure UPN is also supported.

    - **Subscription ID**: This is the ID of the subscription in which you want to install Azure FarmBeats

5. The AAD script takes around 2 minutes to run and outputs values on screen as well as to a json file in the same directory. If you had someone else run the script, ask them to share this output with you.

### Create Sentinel account

Your Azure FarmBeats setup enables you to get satellite imagery from European Space Agency's [Sentinel-2](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) satellite mission for your farm. To configure this setup, you require a Sentinel account.

Follow the steps to create a free account with Sentinel:

1. Go to the official [sign-up](https://aka.ms/SentinelRegistration) page.
2. Provide the required details (first name, last name, username, password, and email ID) and complete the form.
3. A verification link is sent to the registered email ID. Select the link provided in the email and complete the verification.

Your registration process is complete. Make a note of your **Sentinel Username** and **Sentinel Password**, once the verification is also completed.

## Install

You are now ready to install FarmBeats. Follow the steps below to start the installation:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal. Select your account in the top-right corner and switch to the Azure AD tenant where you want to install Azure FarmBeats.

2. Go to Azure Marketplace within the portal and search for **Azure FarmBeats** in the Marketplace.

3. A new window with an overview of Azure FarmBeats appears. Select **Create**.

4. A new window appears. Complete the sign-up process by choosing the correct subscription, resource group, and location to which you want to install Azure FarmBeats.

5. Provide the email address that should receive any service alerts related to Azure FarmBeats in the **FarmBeats Service Alerts** section. Select **Next** at the bottom of the page to move to the **Dependencies** Tab.

    ![Basics Tab](./media/install-azure-farmbeats/create-azure-farmbeats-basics.png)

6. Copy the individual entries from the output of [AAD script](#create-an-aad-application) to the inputs in the AAD application section.

7. Enter the [Sentinel account](#create-sentinel-account) user name and password in the Sentinel Account section. Select **Next** to move to the **Review + Create** tab.

    ![Dependencies Tab](./media/install-azure-farmbeats/create-azure-farmbeats-dependencies.png)

8. Once the entered details are validated, select **OK**. The Terms of use page appear. Review the terms and select **Create** to start the installation. You will be redirected to the page where you can follow the installation progress.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation and start using FarmBeats portal by navigating to the website name you provided during installation: https://\<FarmBeats-website-name>.azurewebsites.net. You should see FarmBeats user interface with an option to create Farms.

**Datahub** can be found at https://\<FarmBeats-website-name>-api.azurewebsites.net/swagger. Here you will see the different FarmBeats API objects and perform REST operations on the APIs.

## Upgrade

To upgrade FarmBeats to the latest version, run the following steps in a Cloud Shell instance using the PowerShell environment. The user will need to be the owner of the subscription in which FarmBeats is installed.

First-time users will be prompted to select a subscription and create a storage account. Complete the setup as instructed.

1. Download the [upgrade script](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsUpgradeScript)

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
        wget â€“q https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsUpgradeScript -O ./upgrade-farmbeats.ps1
    ```

2. By default, the file is downloaded to your home directory. Navigate to the directory.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
        cd
    ```

3. Run the upgrade script

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
        ./upgrade-farmbeats.ps1 -InputFilePath [Path to input.json file]
    ```

The path to input.json file is optional. If not specified, the script will ask for all the required inputs. The upgrade should finish in around 30 minutes.

## Uninstall

To uninstall Azure FarmBeats Datahub or Accelerator, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal and **delete the resource groups** in which these components are installed.

2. Go to Azure Active Directory & **delete the Azure AD application** linked to the Azure FarmBeats installation.
