# Deploy FarmBeats

This article describes how to set up Azure FarmBeats.

Azure FarmBeats is an industry-specific, extensible solution for data-driven farming that enables seamless provisioning and sensor devices connectivity to Azure cloud, telemetry data collection, and aggregation. Azure FarmBeats has various sensors such as cameras, drones, soil sensors, and management of devices from the cloud, which includes infrastructure and services in Azure for the IoT-ready (Internet of Things) devices to an extendible web and mobile app to provide visualization, alerts, and insights.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure FarmBeats is supported only in Public Cloud Environments. For more information about cloud environment, see [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-a-public-cloud/).

Azure FarmBeats has the following two components:

- **Data hub** - Data hub is the platform layer of Azure FarmBeats that lets you build, store, process data and draw insights from existing or new data pipelines. This platform layer is useful to run and build your agriculture data pipelines and models.

- **Accelerator** - Accelerator is the solution layer of Azure FarmBeats that has a built-in application to illustrate the capabilities of Azure FarmBeats using the pre-created agriculture models. This solution layer lets you create farm boundaries and draw insights from the agriculture data within the context of the farm boundary.

A quick deployment of Azure FarmBeats should take less than an hour. Costs for the Data hub and Accelerator vary based on usage.

## Deployed resources

Azure FarmBeats deployment creates the below listed resources within your subscription:

|S.No  |Resource Name  |Azure FarmBeats Component  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1  |       Azure Cosmos DB   |  Data hub       |
|2  |    Application Insights      |     Data hub/Accelerator     |

|13 |    App service plan        |     Data hub/ Accelerator      |
|14 |Azure Maps account     |Accelerator    |
|15 |       Time Series Insights      |  Data hub     |

Azure FarmBeats is available for you to download from the Azure Marketplace. You can access it directly from Azure portal.  

## Create Azure FarmBeats offer on marketplace

Use these steps to create an Azure FarmBeats offer in the marketplace:

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal and select your account in the top-right corner, and switch to the Azure AD tenant where you want to deploy Microsoft Azure FarmBeats.
2. Azure FarmBeats is available at Azure Marketplace. On the marketplace page, select on “Get it Now”.
3. Select Create and enter the following information:
    - subscription name.
    - an existing resource group name (empty resource group only) or create a new resource group for deploying Azure FarmBeats. Make a note of this resource group in subsequent sections.
4. The region you want to install Azure FarmBeats. Currently Azure FarmBeats is supported in the following regions: Central US, West Europe, East US 2, North Europe, West US, Southeast Asia, East US, Australia East, West US 2.
5. Select **OK**.
The Terms of use page appears. Review the standard marketplace terms or select the hyperlink to review the Terms of Use.
6. Select **Close**, then the "I agree" checkbox and then select **Create**.
7. You have now successfully signed Azure FarmBeats's End-user License agreement (EULA) on the marketplace.  
7. To continue with the deployment, follow the next steps in this guide.

## Prepare

You need the following permissions for deploying Azure FarmBeats:

- Tenant: Read Access
- Subscription: contributor or owner
- Resource group: owner

## Before you begin

Before initiating the deployment, ensure you've the following:

- Sentinel account
- Azure Active Directory (AD) app registration

## Create a sentinel account    

An account with sentinel helps you to download the sentinel satellite imagery from their official website to your device. Follow these steps to create a free account:

Go to https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration. In the registration page, provide a first name, last name, username, password, and email.
A verification email will be sent to the registered email address for confirmation. Select the link and confirm. Your registration process is complete.

## Create Azure AD app registration

For authentication and authorization on Azure FarmBeats, you must have an Azure active directory application registration which:

- Case 1: Installer can create automatically (provided you have the required tenant, subscription, and resource group access permissions).
- Case 2: You can create and configure before deploying Azure FarmBeats (requires manual steps).

**Case 1**: : If you have access to create an AAD app registration, you may skip this step and let the installer create the app registration. Please continue to the next section: [Prepare input.json file](#prepare-input-json-file)

If you already have a subscription, you can directly moved to the next procedure.

**Case 2**: This method is the preferred step when you don't have enough rights to create and configure an Azure AD app registration within your subscription. Request your  admin to use the [custom script](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsAADScript), which will help IT admin automatically generate and configure the Azure AD app registration on the Azure portal. As an output to running this custom script using PowerShell environment the IT admin needs to share an Azure Active Directory Application Client ID and password secret with you. Make a note of these values.

Use the following steps to run the Azure AD application registration script:

1. Download [script](https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsAADScript).
2. Sign in to Azure portal and select your subscription and AD tenant.
3. Launch Cloud Shell from the top navigation of the Azure portal.

    ![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/navigation-bar-1.png)


4. First-time users will be prompted to select a subscription to create a storage account and Microsoft Azure Files share. Select **Create storage**.
5. First time users will be prompted with a choice of preferred shell experience- Bash or PowerShell. Choose PowerShell.
6. Upload the script (from step 1) to the Cloud Shell and note the location of the uploaded file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, it is uploaded to your home directory.

    Use the following script:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    ./create_aad_script.ps1
    ```
7. Make a note of the Azure AD application ID and client secret to share with person deploying Azure FarmBeats.

### Prepare Input Json file

As part of the installation, create an input.json file as follows:

```json
    {  
       "sku":"both",
       "subscriptionId":"da9xxxec-dxxf-4xxc-xxx21-xxx3ee7xxxxx",
       "datahubResourceGroup":"dummy-test-dh1",
       "location":"westus2",
       "datahubWebsiteName":"dummy-test-dh1",
       "acceleratorResourceGroup":" dummy-test-acc1",
       "acceleratorWebsiteName":" dummy-test-acc1",
       "sentinelUsername":"dummy-dev",
       "notificationEmailAddress":"dummy@yourorg.com",
       "updateIfExists":true
    }
```

This file is your input file to Azure Cloud Shell and parameters whose values are used during the installation. All params in the json needs to be replaced with appropriate values or removed; if removed, installer will prompt you during installation


Review the parameters before preparing the file.

|Command | Description|
|--- | ---|
|sku  | Provides a choice to download either or both the components of Azure FarmBeats. Specifies which components to download. To install only Data hub, use “onlydatabhub”. To install Data hub and Accelerator, use “both”|
|subscriptionId | Specifies the subscription for installing Azure FarmBeats|
|datahubResourceGroup| Resource group name for Data hub resources|
|location |Location where you would like to create the resources|
|acceleratorWebsiteName |Unique URL prefix to name your Data hub|
|acceleratorResourceGroup  | Unique URL prefix to name your accelerator website.|
|datahubWebsiteName  | UUnique URL prefix to name your Data hub website. |
|sentinelUsername | user name to sign into: https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration.|
|notificationEmailAddress  | Email address to receive the notifications for any alerts that you configure within Data hub.|
|updateIfExists|[Optional] Parameter to be included within Input.Json only if you want to upgrade an existing Azure FarmBeats instance. For upgrade, other details eg. the resource group names, locations etc. need to be the same.|
|aadAppClientId | [**Optional**] Parameter to be included within Input.Json only if Azure AD app already exists.  |
|aadAppClientSecret  | [**Optional**] Parameter to be included within Input.Json only if Azure AD app already exists.|

## Deploy within Cloud Shell browser-based command line

As part of the marketplace workflow above, you must have created one Resource Group and signed the End-user License Agreement, which can be reviewed once again as part of the actual deployment. The deployment can be done via Azure Cloud Shell (browser-based command line) using Bash environment. Please continue to the next sections to deploy via the Cloud Shell.

> [!NOTE]
> Inactive Cloud Shell sessions expire after 20 minutes. Try to complete the deployment within this time.

1. Sign into Azure portal and select the desired subscription and AD tenant.
2. Launch Cloud Shell from the top navigation of the Azure portal.
3. If you are using the Cloud Shell for the first time, you will be prompted to select a subscription to create a storage account and Microsoft Azure Files share.
4. Select **Create Storage**.  

Select the environment as Bash (and not PowerShell).

## Deployment scenario 1

Installer creates the Azure AD App Registration (Case 1 above)

1. Copy the following template and name it to input.json.  
Sample JSON input:

    ```json
    {  
       "sku":"both", 
       "subscriptionId":"da9xxxec-dxxf-4xxc-xxx21-xxx3ee7xxxxx", 
       "datahubResourceGroup":"dummy-test-dh1", 
       "location":"eastus2", 
       "datahubWebsiteName":"dummy-test-dh1", 
       "acceleratorResourceGroup":" dummy-test-acc1",   
       "acceleratorWebsiteName":" dummy-test-acc1", 
       "sentinelUsername":"dummy-dev", 
       "notificationEmailAddress":" dummy@microsoft.com", 
       "updateIfExists":true 
    }
    ```

2. Save the file and make a note of the path (on your local computer).
3. Go to Azure Cloud Shell and after successful authentication, select the upload (see highlighted icon in below image) and upload the input.json file to Cloud Shell storage.  

    ![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/bash-2-1.png)

4. Go to your home directory in the cloud shell. By default, it is /home/<username>
5. Type or paste the following command into the Cloud Shell. Make sure to modify the path to input. Json file and press enter.

   ```bash
      wget -O farmbeats-installer.sh https://aka.ms/AzureFarmbeatsInstallerScript && bash farmbeats-installer.sh /home/<username>/input.json
    ```
     The installer automatically downloads all dependencies and builds the deployer. You will be prompted to agree to the Azure FarmBeats End-user license agreement (EULA).

     - Enter ‘Y’ if you agree and you will proceed to the next step.
     - Enter ‘N’ if you do not agree to the terms and the deployment will terminate.

6. Then you will be prompted to enter an access token for the deployment. Copy the code generated and login to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin with your Azure credentials.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The token expires after 60 minutes. When it expires you can restart by typing the deployment command again.

7. When prompted, enter your Sentinel account password.
8. The installer now validates and starts deploying, which can take about 20 minutes.
9. Once the deployment is successful, you will receive the below output links:

 - **Data hub URL**: Swagger link to try Azure FarmBeats APIs.
 - **Accelerator URL**: User Interface to explore Azure FarmBeats Smart Farm Accelerator.
 - **Deployer log file**- Log file created during deployment. It can be used for troubleshooting if required.

## Deployment scenario 2

Existing Azure Active Directory app registration is used to deploy (Case 2 above)

1. Copy the below JSON file, which includes the Azure Application Client ID and password in the input.json, and save it.

    ```json
   {

   "sku":"both",
   "subscriptionId":"daxx9xxx-d18f-4xxc-9c21-5xx3exxxxx45",
   "datahubResourceGroup":"dummy-test-dh1",   
   "location":"westus2",   
   "datahubWebsiteName":"dummy-test-dh1",   
   "acceleratorResourceGroup":"dummy-test-acc1",   
   "acceleratorWebsiteName":"dummy-test-acc1",   
   "sentinelUsername":"dummy-dev",
   "notificationEmailAddress":"dummyuser@org1.com",
   "updateIfExists": true,
   "aadAppClientId": "lmtlemlemylmylkmerkywmkm823",
   "aadAppClientSecret": "Kxxxqxxxxu*kxcxxx3Yxxu5xx/db[xxx"

   }
   ```

Follow the rest of the steps:

2. Make a note of the path to your input.json file (on your local computer).
3. Go to Azure Cloud Shell once again and you're successfully authenticated, select the upload button (see highlighted icon in below image) and upload the input.json file to Cloud Shell storage.

    ![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/bash-2-1.png)

4. Go to your home directory in the cloud shell. By default, it is /home/<username>
5. Type or paste the following command into the Cloud Shell. Make sure to modify the path to input. Json file and press enter.

    ```bash
    wget -O farmbeats-installer.sh https://aka.ms/AzureFarmbeatsInstallerScript && bash farmbeats-installer.sh /home/<username>/input.json
    ```

Follow the onscreen instructions.

6. The script automatically downloads all dependencies and builds the deployer.
7. You will be prompted to read and agree to the Azure FarmBeats End-user license agreement (EULA).

    - Enter 'Y' if you agree and you will continue to the next step.
    - Enter 'N' if you don't agree to the terms and the deployment will terminate.

8. You will be prompted to enter an access token for the deployment. Copy the code generated and sign in to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin with your Azure credentials.
9. The installer will now validate and start creating the resources, which can take about 20 minutes. Keep the session active on Cloud Shell during this time.
10. Once the deployment goes through successfully, you will receive the below output links:

 - **Data hub URL**: Swagger link to try Azure FarmBeats APIs.
 - **Accelerator URL**: User Interface to explore Azure FarmBeats Accelerator.
 - **Deployer log file**: Log file created during deployment. It can be used for troubleshooting if required.

10. The installer now validates and starts creating the resources, which can take about 20 minutes.
11. Once the deployment is successful, you will receive the below output links:
 - **Data hub URL**: Swagger link to try Azure FarmBeats APIs.
 - **Accelerator URL**: User interface to explore Azure FarmBeats Accelerator.
 - **Deployer log file**: saves logs during deployment. It can be used for troubleshooting.

> [!NOTE]
> Make note of the above values for future use.


## Uninstall

Currently we don't support automated uninstallation of Azure FarmBeats using the installer. To remove the Data hub or  Accelerator, in the Azure portal, delete the resource group in which these components are installed, or delete resources manually.

For example, if you deployed Data hub and Accelerator in two different resource groups, you delete those resource groups as follows:

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Select your account in the top right corner, and switch to the desired Azure AD tenant where you want to deploy Azure FarmBeats.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Data hub is needed for Accelerator to work properly. We don’t recommend uninstalling Data hub without uninstalling Accelerator.

3. Select Resource Groups, and type in the name of the Data hub or Accelerator resource group that you want to delete.
4. Select the resource group name. Type in the name again to double-check, and select Delete to remove the resource group, and all its underlying resources.
5. Alternatively, you can delete each resource manually, which is not recommended.
7. To delete/uninstall data hub, go to the Resource group directly on Azure and delete the resource group from there.
