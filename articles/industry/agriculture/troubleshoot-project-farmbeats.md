2. On the next screen, enter the path to your deployer.log file. For example, farmbeats-deployer.log.

## Sensor telemetry

### Telemetry not seen

**Symptom**: Devices/sensors are deployed, and you have linked FarmBeats with your device partner; but you are not able to get/view Telemetry data on FarmBeats.

**Corrective action**: Visit the Azure portal and follow these steps:

1. Go to your FarmBeats Data hub Resource Group.   
2. Select the **Event Hub** (DatafeedEventHubNamespace....) and check for the number of Incoming Messages.   
3. In case there are **NO Incoming messages**, contact your device partner.  
4. In case there are **Incoming messages**, contact farmbeatssupport@microsoft.com with Data hub and Accelerator logs and captured telemetry.

See [Logs section](#collect-logs-manually) of the document to understand how to download Logs.    

### Device appears offline

**Symptoms**: Devices are installed, and you have linked FarmBeats with your device partner. The devices are online and sending telemetry data, but they appear Offline.

**Corrective action**: The reporting interval is not configured for this device. Contact your device manufacturer to set the reporting interval. 

### Error deleting a resource

Following are the common error scenarios while deleting a device:  

**Message**: Device is referenced in sensors: There are one or more sensors associated with the Device. Delete the sensors and then delete the device.  

**Meaning**: The device is associated with multiple sensors deployed in the farm.   

**Corrective action**:  

1. Delete the sensors associated with the device through the accelerator.  
2. In case you want to associate the sensors to a different device, ask your device partner to do the same.  
3. Delete the device using a DELETE API call setting the force parameter as ‘true’.  

**Message**: Device is referenced in devices as ParentDeviceId: There are one or more devices that are associated with this device as child devices. Delete them, and then delete this device.  

**Meaning**: Your device has other devices associated with it  

**Corrective action**

1. Delete the devices associated with the specific device  
2. Delete the specific device  

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot delete a device if sensors are associated with it. See [Delete Sensors](get-sensor-data-from-sensor-partner.md) in Get Sensor Data chapter for more information on how to delete associated sensors.


## Issues with jobs

### FarmBeats internal error

**Message**: FarmBeats internal error, see troubleshooting guide for more details.

**Corrective action**:
 This could be because of a temporary failure in the data pipeline. Create the job once again. If the error persists, add the error in a post on the FarmBeats forum or contact FarmBeatsSupport@microsoft.com.

## Accelerator troubleshooting

### Access Control

**Error while adding role assignment**

**Message**:No matching users found

**Corrective action**: Check the email ID for which you are trying to do a role assignment. The email ID has to be an exact match of the one registered for that user in the Active Directory. If the error  persists, add the error in a post on the FarmBeats forum or contact FarmBeatsSupport@microsoft.com

### Unable to log in to Accelerator

**Message**: Error: You are not authorized to call the service. Contact the admin for authorization.

**Corrective action**: Ask the admin to authorize you to access the FarmBeats deployment. This can be done by doing a POST of the RoleAssignment APIs or through the Access Control in the Settings pane in the accelerator.  

If you have already been added and are facing this error, try again by refreshing the page.  If the error persists, add the error in a post on the FarmBeats forum or contact FarmBeatsSupport@microsoft.com.

### Accelerator - An unknown error occurred  

**Message**: Error: An unknown error occurred

**Corrective action**: This happens if you leave the page idle for too long. Refresh the page.  

If the error still persists, add the error in a post on the FarmBeats forum or contact  FarmBeatsSupport@microsoft.com

**FarmBeats Accelerator is not showing the latest version even after upgrading the FarmBeatsDeployment**

**Corrective action**: This happens because of service worker persistence in the browser.
Close all browser tabs that have the Accelerator open and close the browser window. Start a new instance of the browser and load the Accelerator URI again. This will load the new version of the Accelerator.

## Known issues

## Batch-related issues

**Error**: The regional account quota of Batch Accounts for the specified subscription has been reached.

**Corrective action**: increase the quota or delete unused batch accounts and re-run the deployment.

### Azure Active Directory related issues

**Error**: Could not update required settings to Azure AD App d41axx40-xx21-4fbd-8xxf-97xxx9e2xxc0: Insufficient privileges to complete the operation. Ensure that above settings are configured properly for the Azure AD App.

**Meaning**: The Azure AD app registration configuration didn’t happen properly.  

**Corrective action**: ask the IT admin (having tenant read access) to use our [script](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect/tree/master/AppCreationScripts) for creating the Azure AD app registration. This script will automatically take care of the configuration steps as well.

**Error**: Could not create new Active Directory Application “dummyname” in this tenant: Another object with the same value for property identifier URIs already exists

**Meaning**: Azure AD app registration with the same name already exists.

## Input.json related issues

**Error** reading input from input.json file

**Corrective action**: This issue mostly arises due to miss in specifying the correct input json path or name to the installer. Make appropriate corrections and retry redeploying.

**Error parsing json input**

**Corrective action**: This issue mostly arises due to incorrect values within the input json file. Make appropriate corrections and retry deploying.

## High CPU usage

**Error**: You get an email alert referring to High CPU Usage Alert. 

**Corrective action**: 
1.	Go to your FarmBeats Data hub Resource Group.
2.	Select the App service.
