# Get started with the Cognitive capabilities of U-SQL

## Overview
Cognitive capabilities for U-SQL enable developers to use put intelligence in their big data programs. 

The following samples using cognitive capabilities are available:
* Imaging: [Detect faces](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/usql-cognitive-imaging-ocr-hello-world)
* Imaging: [Detect emotion](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/usql-cognitive-imaging-emotion-detection-hello-world)
* Imaging: [Detect objects (tagging)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/usql-cognitive-imaging-object-tagging-hello-world)
* Imaging: [OCR (optical character recognition)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/usql-cognitive-imaging-ocr-hello-world)
* Text: [Key Phrase Extraction & Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/usql-cognitive-text-hello-world)
