# Get started with the U-SQL Catalog in Azure Data Lake Analytics

## Create a TVF

In the previous U-SQL script, you repeated the use of EXTRACT to read from the same source file. With the U-SQL table-valued function (TVF), you can encapsulate the data for future reuse.  

The following script creates a TVF called `Searchlog()` in the default database and schema:

```usql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS Searchlog;

CREATE FUNCTION Searchlog()
RETURNS @searchlog TABLE
(
            UserId          int,
            Start           DateTime,
            Region          string,
            Query           string,
            Duration        int?,
            Urls            string,
            ClickedUrls     string
)
AS BEGIN
@searchlog =
    EXTRACT UserId          int,
            Start           DateTime,
            Region          string,
            Query           string,
            Duration        int?,
            Urls            string,
            ClickedUrls     string
    FROM "/Samples/Data/SearchLog.tsv"
USING Extractors.Tsv();
RETURN;
END;
```

The following script shows you how to use the TVF that was defined in the previous script:

```usql
@res =
    SELECT
        Region,
        SUM(Duration) AS TotalDuration
    FROM Searchlog() AS S
GROUP BY Region
HAVING SUM(Duration) > 200;

OUTPUT @res
    TO "/output/SearchLog-use-tvf.csv"
    ORDER BY TotalDuration DESC
    USING Outputters.Csv();
```

## Create views

If you have a single query expression, instead of a TVF you can use a U-SQL VIEW to encapsulate that expression.

The following script creates a view called `SearchlogView` in the default database and schema:

```usql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS SearchlogView;

CREATE VIEW SearchlogView AS  
    EXTRACT UserId          int,
            Start           DateTime,
            Region          string,
            Query           string,
            Duration        int?,
            Urls            string,
            ClickedUrls     string
    FROM "/Samples/Data/SearchLog.tsv"
USING Extractors.Tsv();
```

The following script demonstrates the use of the defined view:

```usql
@res =
    SELECT
        Region,
        SUM(Duration) AS TotalDuration
    FROM SearchlogView
GROUP BY Region
HAVING SUM(Duration) > 200;

OUTPUT @res
    TO "/output/Searchlog-use-view.csv"
    ORDER BY TotalDuration DESC
    USING Outputters.Csv();
```

## Create tables
As with relational database tables, with U-SQL you can create a table with a predefined schema or create a table that infers the schema from the query that populates the table (also known as CREATE TABLE AS SELECT or CTAS).

Create a database and two tables by using the following script:

```usql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS SearchLogDb;
CREATE DATABASE SearchLogDb;
USE DATABASE SearchLogDb;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SearchLog1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SearchLog2;

CREATE TABLE SearchLog1 (
            UserId          int,
            Start           DateTime,
            Region          string,
            Query           string,
            Duration        int?,
            Urls            string,
            ClickedUrls     string,

            INDEX sl_idx CLUSTERED (UserId ASC)
                DISTRIBUTED BY HASH (UserId)
);

INSERT INTO SearchLog1 SELECT * FROM master.dbo.Searchlog() AS s;

CREATE TABLE SearchLog2(
    INDEX sl_idx CLUSTERED (UserId ASC)
            DISTRIBUTED BY HASH (UserId)
) AS SELECT * FROM master.dbo.Searchlog() AS S; // You can use EXTRACT or SELECT here
```

## Query tables
You can query tables, such as those created in the previous script, in the same way that you query the data files. Instead of creating a rowset by using EXTRACT, you now can refer to the table name.

To read from the tables, modify the transform script that you used previously:

```usql
@rs1 =
    SELECT
        Region,
        SUM(Duration) AS TotalDuration
    FROM SearchLogDb.dbo.SearchLog2
GROUP BY Region;

@res =
    SELECT *
    FROM @rs1
    ORDER BY TotalDuration DESC
    FETCH 5 ROWS;

OUTPUT @res
    TO "/output/Searchlog-query-table.csv"
    ORDER BY TotalDuration DESC
    USING Outputters.Csv();
```

 >[!NOTE]
 >Currently, you cannot run a SELECT on a table in the same script as the one where you created the table.
