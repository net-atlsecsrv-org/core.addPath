# Debug Azure Data Lake Analytics code locally

You can use Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio to run and debug Azure Data Lake Analytics code on your local workstation, just as you can in the Azure Data Lake Analytics service.

Learn how to [run U-SQL script on your local machine](data-lake-analytics-data-lake-tools-local-run.md).

## Debug scripts and C# assemblies locally

You can debug C# assemblies without submitting and registering them to the Azure Data Lake Analytics service. You can set breakpoints in both the code-behind file and in a referenced C# project.

### Debug local code in a code-behind file

1. Set breakpoints in the code-behind file.
2. Select **F5** to debug the script locally.

> [!NOTE]
   > The following procedure works only in Visual Studio 2015. In older Visual Studio versions, you might need to manually add the **PDB** files.

### Debug local code in a referenced C# project

1. Create a C# assembly project, and build it to generate the output **DLL** file.
2. Register the **DLL** file by using a U-SQL statement:

   ```sql
   CREATE ASSEMBLY assemblyname FROM @"..\..\path\to\output\.dll";
   ```
   
3. Set breakpoints in the C# code.
4. Select **F5** to debug the script by referencing the C# **DLL** file locally.
