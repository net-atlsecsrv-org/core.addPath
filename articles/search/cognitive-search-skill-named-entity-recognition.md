#	 Named Entity Recognition cognitive skill

The **Named Entity Recognition** skill extracts named entities from text. Available entities include the types `person`, `location` and `organization`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Named entity recognition skill is now discontinued replaced by [Microsoft.Skills.Text.EntityRecognitionSkill](cognitive-search-skill-entity-recognition.md). Support stopped on February 15, 2019 and the API was removed from the product on May 2, 2019. Follow the recommendations in [Deprecated cognitive search skills](cognitive-search-skill-deprecated.md) to migrate to a supported skill.

> [!NOTE]
> As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to [attach a billable Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md). Charges accrue when calling APIs in Cognitive Services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure Cognitive Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.
>
> Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/). Image extraction pricing is described on the [Azure Cognitive Search pricing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042400).


## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.NamedEntityRecognitionSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by [`String.Length`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string.length). If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).
