# Use the "simple" search syntax in Azure Cognitive Search

In Azure Cognitive Search, the [simple query syntax](query-simple-syntax.md) invokes the default query parser for full text search. The parser is fast and handles common scenarios, including full text search, filtered and faceted search, and prefix search. This article uses examples to illustrate simple syntax usage in a [Search Documents (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/search-documents) request.

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative query syntax is [Full Lucene](query-lucene-syntax.md), supporting more complex query structures, such as fuzzy and wildcard search. For more information and examples, see [Use the full Lucene syntax](search-query-lucene-examples.md).

## NYC Jobs examples

The following examples leverage the [NYC Jobs search index](https://azjobsdemo.azurewebsites.net/) consisting of jobs available based on a dataset provided by the [City of New York OpenData Initiative](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/). This data should not be considered current or complete. The index is on a sandbox service provided by Microsoft, which means you do not need an Azure subscription or Azure Cognitive Search to try these queries.

What you do need is Postman or an equivalent tool for issuing HTTP request on GET or POST. If you're unfamiliar with these tools, see [Quickstart: Explore Azure Cognitive Search REST API](search-get-started-rest.md).

## Set up the request

1. Request headers must have the following values:

   | Key | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | Content-Type | `application/json`|
   | api-key  | `252044BE3886FE4A8E3BAA4F595114BB` </br> (this is the actual query API key for the sandbox search service hosting the NYC Jobs index) |

1. Set the verb to **`GET`**.

1. Set the URL to **`https://azs-playground.search.windows.net/indexes/nycjobs/docs?api-version=2020-06-30&search=*&$count=true`**. 

   + The documents collection on the index contains all searchable content. The query api-key provided in the request header only works for read operations targeting the documents collection.

   + **`$count=true`** returns a count of the documents matching the search criteria. On an empty search string, the count will be all documents in the index (about 2558 in the case of NYC Jobs).

   + **`search=*`** is an unspecified query, equivalent to null or empty search. It's not especially useful, but it is the simplest search you can do, and it shows all retrievable fields in the index, with all values.

1. As a verification step, paste the following request into GET and click **Send**. Results are returned as verbose JSON documents.

   ```http
   https://azs-playground.search.windows.net/indexes/nycjobs/docs?api-version=2020-06-30&$count=true&search=*&queryType=full
   ```

### How to invoke simple query parsing

For interactive queries, you don't have to specify anything: simple is the default. In code, if you previously invoked **`queryType=full`**, you can reset the default with **`queryType=simple`**.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
{
    "queryType": "simple"
}
```

## Example 1: Full text search on specific fields

This first example is not parser-specific, but we lead with it to introduce the first fundamental query concept: containment. This example limits both query execution and the response to just a few specific fields. Knowing how to structure a readable JSON response is important when your tool is Postman or Search explorer. 

This query targets only *business_title* in **`searchFields`**, specifying through the **`select`** parameter the same field in the response.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
{
    "count": true,
    "queryType": "simple",
    "search": "*",
    "searchFields": "business_title",
    "select": "business_title"
}
```

Response for this query should look similar to the following screenshot.

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-lucene-examples/postman-sample-results.png" alt-text="Postman sample response" border="false":::

You might have noticed the search score in the response. Uniform scores of **1** occur when there is no rank, either because the search was not full text search, or because no criteria was provided. For an empty search, rows come back in arbitrary order. When you include actual criteria, you will see search scores evolve into meaningful values.

## Example 2: Look up by ID

When you return search results in a query, a logical subsequent step is to provide a details page that includes more fields from the document. This example shows you how to return a single document using a [Lookup operation](/rest/api/searchservice/lookup-document) to pass in the document ID.

All documents have a unique identifier. To try out the syntax for a lookup query, first return a list of document IDs so that you can find one to use. For NYC Jobs, the identifiers are stored in the `id` field.

```http
GET /indexes/nycjobs/docs?api-version=2020-06-30&search=*&$select=id&$count=true
```

Next, retrieve a document from the collection based on `id` "9E1E3AF9-0660-4E00-AF51-9B654925A2D5", which appeared first in the previous response. The following query returns all retrievable fields for the entire document.

```http
GET /indexes/nycjobs/docs/9E1E3AF9-0660-4E00-AF51-9B654925A2D5?api-version=2020-06-30
```

## Example 3: Filter queries

[Filter syntax](./search-query-odata-filter.md) is an OData expression that you can use by itself or with **`search`**. A standalone filter, without a search parameter, is useful when the filter expression is able to fully qualify documents of interest. Without a query string, there is no lexical or linguistic analysis, no scoring (all scores are 1), and no ranking. Notice the search string is empty.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "",
      "filter": "salary_frequency eq 'Annual' and salary_range_from gt 90000",
      "select": "job_id, business_title, agency, salary_range_from"
    }
```

Used together, the filter is applied first to the entire index, and then the search is performed on the results of the filter. Filters can therefore be a useful technique to improve query performance since they reduce the set of documents that the search query needs to process.

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-simple-examples/filtered-query.png" alt-text="Filter query response" border="false":::

Another powerful way to combine filter and search is through **`search.ismatch*()`** in a filter expression, where you can use a search query within the filter. This filter expression uses a wildcard on *plan* to select business_title including the term plan, planner, planning, and so forth.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "",
      "filter": "search.ismatch('plan*', 'business_title', 'full', 'any')",
      "select": "job_id, business_title, agency, salary_range_from"
    }
```

For more information about the function, see [search.ismatch in "Filter examples"](./search-query-odata-full-text-search-functions.md#examples).

## Example 4: Range filters

Range filtering is supported through **`$filter`** expressions for any data type. The following examples search over numeric and string fields. 

Data types are important in range filters and work best when numeric data is in numeric fields, and string data in string fields. Numeric data in string fields is not suitable for ranges because numeric strings are not comparable in Azure Cognitive Search.

The following query is a numeric range:

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "",
      "filter": "num_of_positions ge 5 and num_of_positions lt 10",
      "select": "job_id, business_title, num_of_positions, agency",
      "orderby": "agency"
    }
```
Response for this query should look similar to the following screenshot.

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-simple-examples/rangefilternumeric.png" alt-text="Range filter for numeric ranges" border="false":::

In this query, the range is over a string field (business_title):

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "",
      "filter": "business_title ge 'A*' and business_title lt 'C*'",
      "select": "job_id, business_title, agency",
      "orderby": "business_title"
    }
```

Response for this query should look similar to the following screenshot.

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-simple-examples/rangefiltertext.png" alt-text="Range filter for text ranges" border="false":::

> [!NOTE]
> Faceting over ranges of values is a common search application requirement. For more information and examples, see [How to build a facet filter](search-filters-facets.md).

## Example 5: Geo-search

The sample index includes a geo_location field with latitude and longitude coordinates. This example uses the [geo.distance function](search-query-odata-geo-spatial-functions.md#examples) that filters on documents within the circumference of a starting point, out to an arbitrary distance (in kilometers) that you provide. You can adjust the last value in the query (4) to reduce or enlarge the surface area of the query.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "",
      "filter": "geo.distance(geo_location, geography'POINT(-74.11734 40.634384)') le 4",
      "select": "business_title, work_location"
    }
```

For more readable results, search results are trimmed to include job title and the work location. The starting coordinates were obtained from a random document in the index (in this case, for a work location on Staten island.

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-simple-examples/geo-search.png" alt-text="Map of Staten island" border="false":::

## Example 6: Search precision

Term queries are single terms, perhaps many of them, that are evaluated independently. Phrase queries are enclosed in quotation marks and evaluated as a verbatim string. Precision of the match is controlled by operators and searchMode.

Example 1: `search=fire`  matches on 140 results, where all matches contain the word fire somewhere in the document.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "fire"
    }
```

Example 2: `search=fire department` returns 2002 results. Matches are returned for documents containing either fire or department.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "fire department"
    }
```

Example 3: `search="fire department"` returns 77 results. Enclosing the string in quotation marks creates a phrase search consisting of both terms, and matches are found on tokenized terms in the index consisting of the combined terms. This explains why a search like `search=+fire +department` is not equivalent. Both terms are required, but are scanned for independently. 

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
    "count": true,
    "search": "\"fire department\""
    }
```

> [!Note]
> Because a phrase query is specified through quotation marks, this example adds an escape character (`\`) to preserve the syntax.

## Example 7: Booleans with searchMode

Simple syntax supports boolean operators in the form of characters (`+, -, |`). The searchMode parameter informs tradeoffs between precision and recall, with **`searchMode=any`** favoring recall (matching on any criteria qualifies a document for the result set), and **`searchMode=all`** favoring precision (all criteria must be matched). 

The default is **`searchMode=any`**, which can be confusing if you are stacking a query with multiple operators and getting broader instead of narrower results. This is particularly true with NOT, where results include all documents "not containing" a specific term.

Using the default searchMode (any), 2800 documents are returned: those containing the phrase "fire department", plus all documents that do not have the phrase "Metrotech Center".

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "\"fire department\"-\"Metrotech Center\"",
      "searchMode": "any"
    }
```

Response for this query should look similar to the following screenshot.

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-simple-examples/searchmodeany.png" alt-text="search mode any" border="false":::

Changing to **`searchMode=all`** enforces a cumulative effect on criteria and returns a smaller result set - 21 documents - consisting of documents containing the entire phrase "fire department", minus those jobs at the Metrotech Center address.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "\"fire department\"-\"Metrotech Center\"",
      "searchMode": "all"
    }
```

  :::image type="content" source="media/search-query-simple-examples/searchmodeall.png" alt-text="search mode all" border="false":::

## Example 8: Structuring results

Several parameters control which fields are in the search results, the number of documents returned in each batch, and sort order. This example resurfaces a few of the previous examples, limiting results to specific fields using the **`$select`** statement and verbatim search criteria, returning 82 matches.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "\"fire department\"",
      "searchMode": "any",
      "select": "job_id,agency,business_title,civil_service_title,work_location,job_description"
    }
```

Appended onto the previous example, you can sort by title. This sort works because civil_service_title is *sortable* in the index.

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "\"fire department\"",
      "searchMode": "any",
      "select": "job_id,agency,business_title,civil_service_title,work_location,job_description",
      "orderby": "civil_service_title"
    }
```

Paging results is implemented using the **`$top`** parameter, in this case returning the top 5 documents:

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "\"fire department\"",
      "searchMode": "any",
      "select": "job_id,agency,business_title,civil_service_title,work_location,job_description",
      "orderby": "civil_service_title",
      "top": "5"
    }
```

To get the next 5, skip the first batch:

```http
POST /indexes/nycjobs/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30
    {
      "count": true,
      "search": "\"fire department\"",
      "searchMode": "any",
      "select": "job_id,agency,business_title,civil_service_title,work_location,job_description",
      "orderby": "civil_service_title",
      "top": "5",
      "skip": "5"
    }
```
