# JavaScript code samples for Azure Cognitive Search

Learn about the JavaScript code samples that demonstrate the functionality and workflow of an Azure Cognitive Search solution. These samples use the [**Azure Cognitive Search client library**](/javascript/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme) for the [**Azure SDK for JavaScript**](/azure/developer/javascript/), which you can explore through the following links.
