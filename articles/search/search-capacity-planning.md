# Adjust the capacity of an Azure Cognitive Search service

Before [provisioning a search service](search-create-service-portal.md) and locking in a specific pricing tier, take a few minutes to understand how capacity works and how you might adjust replicas and partitions to accommodate workload fluctuation.

Capacity is a function of the [tier you choose](search-sku-tier.md) (tiers determine hardware characteristics), and the replica and partition combination necessary for projected workloads. You can increase or decrease the number of replicas or partitions individually. Depending on the tier and the size of the adjustment, adding or reducing capacity can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours.

When modifying the allocation of replicas and partitions, we recommend using the Azure portal. The portal enforces limits on allowable combinations that stay below maximum limits of a tier. However, if you require a script-based or code-based provisioning approach, the [Azure PowerShell](search-manage-powershell.md) or the [Management REST API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services) are alternative solutions.

## Concepts: search units, replicas, partitions, shards

Capacity is expressed in *search units* that can be allocated in combinations of *partitions* and *replicas*, using an underlying *sharding* mechanism to support flexible configurations:

| Concept  | Definition|
|----------|-----------|
|*Search unit* | A single increment of total available capacity (36 units). It is also the billing unit for an Azure Cognitive Search service. A minimum of one unit is required to run the service.|
|*Replica* | Instances of the search service, used primarily to load balance query operations. Each replica hosts one copy of an index. If you allocate three replicas, you'll have three copies of an index available for servicing query requests.|
|*Partition* | Physical storage and I/O for read/write operations (for example, when rebuilding or refreshing an index). Each partition has a slice of the total index. If you allocate three partitions, your index is divided into thirds. |
|*Shard* | A chunk of an index. Azure Cognitive Search divides each index into shards to make the process of adding partitions faster (by moving shards to new search units).|

The following diagram shows the relationship between replicas, partitions, shards, and search units. It shows an example of how a single index is spanned across four search units in a service with two replicas and two partitions. Each of the four search units stores only half of the shards of the index. The search units in the left column store the first half of the shards, comprising the first partition, while those in the right column store the second half of the shards, comprising the second partition. Since there are two replicas, there are two copies of each index shard. The search units in the top row store one copy, comprising the first replica, while those in the bottom row store another copy, comprising the second replica.

The diagram above is only one example. Many combinations of partitions and replicas are possible, up to a maximum of 36 total search units.

In Cognitive Search, shard management is an implementation detail and non-configurable, but knowing that an index is sharded helps to understand the occasional anomalies in ranking and autocomplete behaviors:

+ Ranking anomalies: Search scores are computed at the shard level first, and then aggregated up into a single result set. Depending on the characteristics of shard content, matches from one shard might be ranked higher than matches in another one. If you notice unintuitive rankings in search results, it is most likely due to the effects of sharding, especially if indexes are small. You can avoid these ranking anomalies by choosing to [compute scores globally across the entire index](index-similarity-and-scoring.md#scoring-statistics-and-sticky-sessions), but doing so will incur a performance penalty.

+ Autocomplete anomalies: Autocomplete queries, where matches are made on the first several characters of a partially entered term, accept a fuzzy parameter that forgives small deviations in spelling. For autocomplete, fuzzy matching is constrained to terms within the current shard. For example, if a shard contains "Microsoft" and a partial term of "micor" is entered, the search engine will match on "Microsoft" in that shard, but not in other shards that hold the remaining parts of the index.

## When to add nodes

Initially, a service is allocated a minimal level of resources consisting of one partition and one replica.

A single service must have sufficient resources to handle all workloads (indexing and queries). Neither workload runs in the background. You can schedule indexing for times when query requests are naturally less frequent, but the service will not otherwise prioritize one task over another. Additionally, a certain amount of redundancy smooths out query performance when services or nodes are updated internally.

As a general rule, search applications tend to need more replicas than partitions, particularly when the service operations are biased toward query workloads. The section on [high availability](#HA) explains why.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding more replicas or partitions increases the cost of running the service, and can introduce slight variations in how results are ordered. Be sure to check the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to understand the billing implications of adding more nodes. The [chart below](#chart) can help you cross-reference the number of search units required for a specific configuration. For more information on how additional replicas impact query processing, see [Ordering results](search-pagination-page-layout.md#ordering-results).

## How to allocate replicas and partitions

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select the search service.

1. In **Settings**, open the **Scale** page to modify replicas and partitions. 

   The following screenshot shows a standard service provisioned with one replica and partition. The formula at the bottom indicates how many search units are being used (1). If the unit price was $100 (not a real price), the monthly cost of running this service would be $100 on average.

   ![Scale page showing current values](media/search-capacity-planning/1-initial-values.png "Scale page showing current values")

1. Use the slider to increase or decrease the number of partitions. The formula at the bottom indicates how many search units are being used.

   This example doubles capacity, with two replicas and partitions each. Notice the search unit count; it is now four because the billing formula is replicas multiplied by partitions (2 x 2). Doubling capacity more than doubles the cost of running the service. If the search unit cost was $100, the new monthly bill would now be $400.

   For the current per unit costs of each tier, visit the [Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).

1. Select **Save** to confirm the changes.

   ![Confirm changes to scale and billing](media/search-capacity-planning/3-save-confirm.png "Confirm changes to scale and billing")

   Changes in capacity take several hours to complete. You cannot cancel once the process has started and there is no real-time monitoring for replica and partition adjustments. However, the following message remains visible while changes are underway.

> [!NOTE]
> After a service is provisioned, it cannot be upgraded to a higher tier. You must create a search service at the new tier and reload your indexes. See [Create an Azure Cognitive Search service in the portal](search-create-service-portal.md) for help with service provisioning.
>
> Additionally, partitions and replicas are managed exclusively and internally by the service. There is no concept of processor affinity, or assigning a workload to a specific node.

## Partition and replica combinations

A Basic service can have exactly one partition and up to three replicas, for a maximum limit of three SUs. The only adjustable resource is replicas. You need a minimum of two replicas for high availability on queries.

All Standard and Storage Optimized search services can assume the following combinations of replicas and partitions, subject to the 36-SU limit. 

|   | **1 partition** | **2 partitions** | **3 partitions** | **4 partitions** | **6 partitions** | **12 partitions** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1 replica** |1 SU |2 SU |3 SU |4 SU |6 SU |12 SU |
| **2 replicas** |2 SU |4 SU |6 SU |8 SU |12 SU |24 SU |
| **3 replicas** |3 SU |6 SU |9 SU |12 SU |18 SU |36 SU |
| **4 replicas** |4 SU |8 SU |12 SU |16 SU |24 SU |N/A |
| **5 replicas** |5 SU |10 SU |15 SU |20 SU |30 SU |N/A |
| **6 replicas** |6 SU |12 SU |18 SU |24 SU |36 SU |N/A |
| **12 replicas** |12 SU |24 SU |36 SU |N/A |N/A |N/A |

SUs, pricing, and capacity are explained in detail on the Azure website. For more information, see [Pricing Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).

> [!NOTE]
> The number of replicas and partitions divides evenly into 12 (specifically, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). This is because Azure Cognitive Search pre-divides each index into 12 shards so that it can be spread in equal portions across all partitions. For example, if your service has three partitions and you create an index, each partition will contain four shards of the index. How Azure Cognitive Search shards an index is an implementation detail, subject to change in future releases. Although the number is 12 today, you shouldn't expect that number to always be 12 in the future.

## High availability

Because it's easy and relatively fast to scale up, we generally recommend that you start with one partition and one or two replicas, and then scale up as query volumes build. Query workloads run primarily on replicas. If you need more throughput or high availability, you will probably require additional replicas.

General recommendations for high availability are:

* Two replicas for high availability of read-only workloads (queries)

* Three or more replicas for high availability of read/write workloads (queries plus indexing as individual documents are added, updated, or deleted)

Service level agreements (SLA) for Azure Cognitive Search are targeted at query operations and at index updates that consist of adding, updating, or deleting documents.

Basic tier tops out at one partition and three replicas. If you want the flexibility to immediately respond to fluctuations in demand for both indexing and query throughput, consider one of the Standard tiers.  If you find your storage requirements are growing much more rapidly than your query throughput, consider one of the Storage Optimized tiers.

## Disaster recovery

Currently, there is no built-in mechanism for disaster recovery. Adding partitions or replicas would be the wrong strategy for meeting disaster recovery objectives. The most common approach is to add redundancy at the service level by setting up a second search service in another region. As with availability during an index rebuild, the redirection or failover logic must come from your code.

## Estimate replicas

On a production service, you should allocate three replicas for SLA purposes. If you experience slow query performance, you can add replicas so that additional copies of the index are brought online to support bigger query workloads and to load balance the requests over the multiple replicas.

We do not provide guidelines on how many replicas are needed to accommodate query loads. Query performance depends on the complexity of the query and competing workloads. Although adding replicas clearly results in better performance, the result is not strictly linear: adding three replicas does not guarantee triple throughput.

For guidance in estimating QPS for your solution, see [Scale for performance](search-performance-optimization.md)and [Monitor queries](search-monitor-queries.md)

## Estimate partitions

The [tier you choose](search-sku-tier.md) determines partition size and speed, and each tier is optimized around a set of characteristics that fit various scenarios. If you choose a higher-end tier, you might need fewer partitions than if you go with S1. One of the questions you'll need to answer through self-directed testing is whether a larger and more expensive partition yields better performance than two cheaper partitions on a service provisioned at a lower tier.

Search applications that require near real-time data refresh will need proportionally more partitions than replicas. Adding partitions spreads read/write operations across a larger number of compute resources. It also gives you more disk space for storing additional indexes and documents.

Larger indexes take longer to query. As such, you might find that every incremental increase in partitions requires a smaller but proportional increase in replicas. The complexity of your queries and query volume will factor into how quickly query execution is turned around.
