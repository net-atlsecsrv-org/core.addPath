# How to map AI-enriched fields to a searchable index

![Indexer Stages](./media/cognitive-search-output-field-mapping/indexer-stages-output-field-mapping.png "indexer stages")

In this article, you learn how to map enriched input fields to output fields in a searchable index. Once you have [defined a skillset](cognitive-search-defining-skillset.md), you must map the output fields of any skill that directly contributes values to a given field in your search index.

Output Field Mappings are required for moving content from enriched documents into the index.  The enriched document is really a tree of information, and even though there is support for complex types in the index, sometimes you may want to transform the information from the enriched tree into a more simple type (for instance, an array of strings). Output field mappings allow you to perform data shape transformations by flattening information. Output field mappings always occur after skillset execution, although it is possible for this stage to run even if no skillset is defined.

Examples of output field mappings:

* As part of your skillset, you extracted the names of organizations mentioned in each of the pages of your document. Now you want to map each of those organization names into a field in your index of type Edm.Collection(Edm.String).

* As part of your skillset, you produced a new node called “document/translated_text”. You would like to map the information on this node to a specific field in your index.

* You don’t have a skillset but are indexing a complex type from a Cosmos DB database. You would like to get to a node on that complex type and map it into a field in your index.

> [!NOTE]
> We recently enabled the functionality of mapping functions on output field mappings. For more details on mapping functions, see [Field mapping functions](./search-indexer-field-mappings.md#field-mapping-functions)

## Use outputFieldMappings

To map fields, add `outputFieldMappings` to your indexer definition as shown below:

```http
PUT https://[servicename].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=2020-06-30
api-key: [admin key]
Content-Type: application/json
```

The body of the request is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "myIndexer",
    "dataSourceName": "myDataSource",
    "targetIndexName": "myIndex",
    "skillsetName": "myFirstSkillSet",
    "fieldMappings": [
        {
            "sourceFieldName": "metadata_storage_path",
            "targetFieldName": "id",
            "mappingFunction": {
                "name": "base64Encode"
            }
        }
    ],
    "outputFieldMappings": [
        {
            "sourceFieldName": "/document/content/organizations/*/description",
            "targetFieldName": "descriptions",
            "mappingFunction": {
                "name": "base64Decode"
            }
        },
        {
            "sourceFieldName": "/document/content/organizations",
            "targetFieldName": "orgNames"
        },
        {
            "sourceFieldName": "/document/content/sentiment",
            "targetFieldName": "sentiment"
        }
    ]
}
```

For each output field mapping, set the location of the data in the enriched document tree (sourceFieldName), and the name of the field as referenced in the index (targetFieldName).

## Flattening Information from Complex Types 

The path in a sourceFieldName can represent one element or multiple elements. In the example above, ```/document/content/sentiment``` represents a single numeric value, while ```/document/content/organizations/*/description``` represents several organization descriptions. 

In cases where there are several elements, they are "flattened" into an array that contains each of the elements. 

More concretely, for the ```/document/content/organizations/*/description``` example, the data in the *descriptions* field would look like a flat array of descriptions before it gets indexed:

```
 ["Microsoft is a company in Seattle","LinkedIn's office is in San Francisco"]
```

This is an important principle, so we will provide another example. Imagine that you have an array of complex types as part of the enrichment tree. Let's say there is a member called customEntities that has an array of complex types like the one described below.

```json
"document/customEntities": 
[
    {
        "name": "heart failure",
        "matches": [
            {
                "text": "heart failure",
                "offset": 10,
                "length": 12,
                "matchDistance": 0.0
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "morquio",
        "matches": [
            {
                "text": "morquio",
                "offset": 25,
                "length": 7,
                "matchDistance": 0.0
            }
        ]
    }
    //...
]
```

Let's assume that your index has a field called 'diseases' of type Collection(Edm.String), where you would like to store each of the names of the entities. 

This can be done easily by using the "\*" symbol, as follows:

```json
    "outputFieldMappings": [
        {
            "sourceFieldName": "/document/customEntities/*/name",
            "targetFieldName": "diseases"
        }
    ]
```

This operation will simply “flatten” each of the names of the customEntities elements into a single array of strings like this:

```json
  "diseases" : ["heart failure","morquio"]
```

## Next steps
Once you have mapped your enriched fields to searchable fields, you can set the field attributes for each of the searchable fields [as part of the index definition](search-what-is-an-index.md).
