# Accessing data in storage accounts securely via trusted service exception

Indexers that access data in storage accounts can make use of the [trusted service exception](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#exceptions) capability to securely access data. This mechanism offers customers who are unable to grant [indexer access via IP firewall rules](search-indexer-howto-access-ip-restricted.md) a simple, secure, and free alternative to access data in storage accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for accessing data in storage accounts via a trusted service exception is limited to Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage. Azure table storage is not supported.

## Step 1: Configure connection to the storage account via identity

Follow the details outlined in [the managed identity access guide](search-howto-managed-identities-storage.md) to configure indexers to access storage accounts via the search service's managed identity.

## Step 2: Allow trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account

In the Azure portal, navigate to the "Firewalls and Virtual Networks" tab of the storage account. Ensure that the option "Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account" is checked. This option will only permit the specific search service instance with appropriate role-based access to the storage account (strong authentication) to access data in the storage account, even if it's secured by IP firewall rules.

Indexers will now be able to access data in the storage account, even if the account is secured via IP firewall rules.
