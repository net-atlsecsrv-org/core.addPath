# Security filters for trimming Azure Cognitive Search results using Active Directory identities

This article demonstrates how to use Azure Active Directory (AD) security identities together with filters in Azure Cognitive Search to trim search results based on user group membership.

This article covers the following tasks:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create Azure AD groups and users
> - Associate the user with the group you have created
> - Cache the new groups
> - Index documents with associated groups
> - Issue a search request with group identifiers filter
> 
> [!NOTE]
> Sample code snippets in this article are written in C#. You can find the full source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started). 

## Prerequisites

Your index in Azure Cognitive Search must have a [security field](search-security-trimming-for-azure-search.md) to store the list of group identities having read access to the document. This use case assumes a one-to-one correspondence between a securable item (such as an individual's college application) and a security field specifying who has access to that item (admissions personnel).

You must have Azure AD administrator permissions, required in this walkthrough for creating users, groups, and associations. 

Your application must also be registered with Azure AD as a multi-tenant app, as described in the following procedure.

### Register your application with Azure Active Directory

This step integrates your application with Azure AD for the purpose of accepting sign-ins of user and group accounts. If you are not a tenant admin in your organization, you might need to [create a new tenant](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) to perform the following steps.

1. In [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find the Azure Active Directory resource for your subscription.

1. On the left, under **Manage**, select **App registrations**, and then select **New registration**.

1. Give the registration a name, perhaps a name that is similar to the search application name. Select **Register**.

1. Once the app registration is created, copy the Application ID. You will need to provide this string to your application.

   If you are stepping through the [DotNetHowToSecurityTrimming](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowToEncryptionUsingCMK), paste this value into the **app.config** file.

   Repeat for the Tenant ID.

   :::image type="content" source="media/search-manage-encryption-keys/cmk-application-id.png" alt-text="Application ID in the Essentials section":::

1. On the left, select **API permissions** and then select **Add a permission**. 

1. Select **Microsoft Graph** and then select **Delegated permissions**.

1. Search for and then add the following delegated permissions:

   - **Directory.ReadWrite.All**
   - **Group.ReadWrite.All**
   - **User.ReadWrite.All**

Microsoft Graph provides an API that allows programmatic access to Azure AD through a REST API. The code sample for this walkthrough uses the permissions to call the Microsoft Graph API for creating groups, users, and associations. The APIs are also used to cache group identifiers for faster filtering.

## Create users and groups

If you are adding search to an established application, you might have existing user and group identifiers in Azure AD. In this case, you can skip the next three steps. 

However, if you don't have existing users, you can use Microsoft Graph APIs to create the security principals. The following code snippets demonstrate how to generate identifiers, which become data values for the security field in your Azure Cognitive Search index. In our hypothetical college admissions application, this would be the security identifiers for admissions staff.

User and group membership might be very fluid, especially in large organizations. Code that builds user and group identities should run often enough to pick up changes in organization membership. Likewise, your Azure Cognitive Search index requires a similar update schedule to reflect the current status of permitted users and resources.

### Step 1: [Create Group](/graph/api/group-post-groups) 

```csharp
private static Dictionary<Group, List<User>> CreateGroupsWithUsers(string tenant)
{
    Group group = new Group()
    {
        DisplayName = "My First Prog Group",
        SecurityEnabled = true,
        MailEnabled = false,
        MailNickname = "group1"
    };
```

### Step 2: [Create User](/graph/api/user-post-users)

```csharp
User user1 = new User()
{
    GivenName = "First User",
    Surname = "User1",
    MailNickname = "User1",
    DisplayName = "First User",
    UserPrincipalName = String.Format("user1@{0}", tenant),
    PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile() { Password = "********" },
    AccountEnabled = true
};
```

### Step 3: Associate user and group

```csharp
List<User> users = new List<User>() { user1, user2 };
Dictionary<Group, List<User>> groups = new Dictionary<Group, List<User>>() { { group, users } };
```

### Step 4: Cache the groups identifiers

Optionally, to reduce network latency, you can cache the user-group associations so that when a search request is issued, groups are returned from the cache, saving a roundtrip to Azure AD. You can use [Azure AD Batch API](/graph/json-batching) to send a single Http request with multiple users and build the cache.

Microsoft Graph is designed to handle a high volume of requests. If an overwhelming number of requests occur, Microsoft Graph fails the request with HTTP status code 429. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph throttling](/graph/throttling).

## Index document with their permitted groups

Query operations in Azure Cognitive Search are executed over an Azure Cognitive Search index. In this step, an indexing operation imports searchable data into an index, including the identifiers used as security filters. 

Azure Cognitive Search does not authenticate user identities, or provide logic for establishing which content a user has permission to view. The use case for security trimming assumes that you provide the association between a sensitive document and the group identifier having access to that document, imported intact into a search index. 

In the hypothetical example, the body of the PUT request on  an Azure Cognitive Search index would include an applicant's college essay or transcript along with the group identifier having permission to view that content. 

In the generic example used in the code sample for this walkthrough, the index action might look as follows:

```csharp
private static void IndexDocuments(string indexName, List<string> groups)
{
    IndexDocumentsBatch<SecuredFiles> batch = IndexDocumentsBatch.Create(
        IndexDocumentsAction.Upload(
            new SecuredFiles()
            {
                FileId = "1",
                Name = "secured_file_a",
                GroupIds = new[] { groups[0] }
            }),
              ...
            };

IndexDocumentsResult result = searchClient.IndexDocuments(batch);
```

## Issue a search request

For security trimming purposes, the values in your security field in the index are static values used for including or excluding documents in search results. For example, if the group identifier for Admissions is "A11B22C33D44-E55F66G77-H88I99JKK", any documents in an Azure Cognitive Search index having that identifier in the security filed are included (or excluded) in the search results sent back to the requestor.

To filter documents returned in search results based on groups of the user issuing the request, review the following steps.

### Step 1: Retrieve user's group identifiers

If the user's groups were not already cached, or the cache has expired, issue the [groups](/graph/api/directoryobject-getmembergroups) request.

```csharp
private static async void RefreshCache(IEnumerable<User> users)
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    var userGroups = await _microsoftGraphHelper.GetGroupsForUsers(client, users);
    _groupsCache = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, List<string>>(userGroups);
}
```

### Step 2: Compose the search request

Assuming you have the user's groups membership, you can issue the search request with the appropriate filter values.

```csharp
private static void SearchQueryWithFilter(string user)
{
    // Using the filter below, the search result will contain all documents that their GroupIds field   
    // contain any one of the Ids in the groups list
    string filter = String.Format("groupIds/any(p:search.in(p, '{0}'))", string.Join(",", String.Join(",", _groupsCache[user])));
    SearchOptions searchOptions =
        new SearchOptions()
        {
            Filter = filter
        };
    searchOptions.Select.Add("name");

    SearchResults<SecuredFiles> results = searchClient.Search<SecuredFiles>("*", searchOptions);

    Console.WriteLine("Results for groups '{0}' : {1}", _groupsCache[user], results.GetResults().Select(r => r.Document.Name));
}
```

### Step 3: Handle the results

The response includes a filtered list of documents, consisting of those that the user has permission to view. Depending on how you construct the search results page, you might want to include visual cues to reflect the filtered result set.

## Next steps

In this walkthrough, you learned a pattern for using Azure AD sign-ins to filter documents in Azure Cognitive Search results, trimming the results of documents that do not match the filter provided on the request. For an alternative pattern that might be simpler, or to revisit other security features, see the following links.
