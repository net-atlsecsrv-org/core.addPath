# Upgrade to Azure Search .NET SDK version 1.1

If you're using version 1.0.2-preview or older of the [Azure Search .NET SDK](https://aka.ms/search-sdk), this article will help you upgrade your application to use version 1.1.

For a more general walkthrough of the SDK including examples, see [How to use Azure Search from a .NET Application](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Once you upgrade to version 1.1, or if you're already using a version between 1.1 and 2.0-preview inclusive, you should upgrade to version 3. See [Upgrading to the Azure Search .NET SDK version 3](search-dotnet-sdk-migration.md) for instructions.
>

First, update your NuGet reference for `Microsoft.Azure.Search` using either the NuGet Package Manager Console or by right-clicking on your project references and selecting "Manage NuGet Packages..." in Visual Studio.

Once NuGet has downloaded the new packages and their dependencies, rebuild your project.

If you were previously using version 1.0.0-preview, 1.0.1-preview, or 1.0.2-preview, the build should succeed and you're ready to go!

If you were previously using version 0.13.0-preview or older, you should see build errors like the following:

    Program.cs(137,56,137,62): error CS0117: 'Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models.IndexBatch' does not contain a definition for 'Create'
    Program.cs(137,99,137,105): error CS0117: 'Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models.IndexAction' does not contain a definition for 'Create'
    Program.cs(146,41,146,54): error CS1061: 'Microsoft.Azure.Search.IndexBatchException' does not contain a definition for 'IndexResponse' and no extension method 'IndexResponse' accepting a first argument of type 'Microsoft.Azure.Search.IndexBatchException' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
    Program.cs(163,13,163,42): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'DocumentSearchResponse' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)

The next step is to fix the build errors one by one. Most will require changing some class and method names that have been renamed in the SDK. [List of breaking changes in version 1.1](#ListOfChangesV1) contains a list of these name changes.

If you're using custom classes to model your documents, and those classes have properties of non-nullable primitive types (for example, `int` or `bool` in C#), there is a bug fix in the 1.1 version of the SDK of which you should be aware. See [Bug fixes in version 1.1](#BugFixesV1) for more details.

Finally, once you've fixed any build errors, you can make changes to your application to take advantage of new functionality if you wish.

<a name="ListOfChangesV1"></a>

## List of breaking changes in version 1.1
The following list is ordered by the likelihood that the change will affect your application code.

### IndexBatch and IndexAction changes
`IndexBatch.Create` has been renamed to `IndexBatch.New` and no longer has a `params` argument. You can use `IndexBatch.New` for batches that mix different types of actions (merges, deletes, etc.). In addition, there are new static methods for creating batches where all the actions are the same: `Delete`, `Merge`, `MergeOrUpload`, and `Upload`.

`IndexAction` no longer has public constructors and its properties are now immutable. You should use the new static methods for creating actions for different purposes: `Delete`, `Merge`, `MergeOrUpload`, and `Upload`. `IndexAction.Create` has been removed. If you used the overload that takes only a document, make sure to use `Upload` instead.

#### Example
If your code looks like this:

    var batch = IndexBatch.Create(documents.Select(doc => IndexAction.Create(doc)));
    indexClient.Documents.Index(batch);

You can change it to this to fix any build errors:

    var batch = IndexBatch.New(documents.Select(doc => IndexAction.Upload(doc)));
    indexClient.Documents.Index(batch);

If you want, you can further simplify it to this:

    var batch = IndexBatch.Upload(documents);
    indexClient.Documents.Index(batch);

### IndexBatchException changes
The `IndexBatchException.IndexResponse` property has been renamed to `IndexingResults`, and its type is now `IList<IndexingResult>`.

#### Example
If your code looks like this:

    catch (IndexBatchException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(
            "Failed to index some of the documents: {0}",
            String.Join(", ", e.IndexResponse.Results.Where(r => !r.Succeeded).Select(r => r.Key)));
    }

You can change it to this to fix any build errors:

    catch (IndexBatchException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(
            "Failed to index some of the documents: {0}",
            String.Join(", ", e.IndexingResults.Where(r => !r.Succeeded).Select(r => r.Key)));
    }

<a name="OperationMethodChanges"></a>

### Operation method changes
Each operation in the Azure Search .NET SDK is exposed as a set of method overloads for synchronous and asynchronous callers. The signatures and factoring of these method overloads has changed in version 1.1.

For example, the "Get Index Statistics" operation in older versions of the SDK exposed these signatures:

In `IIndexOperations`:

    // Asynchronous operation with all parameters
    Task<IndexGetStatisticsResponse> GetStatisticsAsync(
        string indexName,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);

In `IndexOperationsExtensions`:

    // Asynchronous operation with only required parameters
    public static Task<IndexGetStatisticsResponse> GetStatisticsAsync(
        this IIndexOperations operations,
        string indexName);

    // Synchronous operation with only required parameters
    public static IndexGetStatisticsResponse GetStatistics(
        this IIndexOperations operations,
        string indexName);

The method signatures for the same operation in version 1.1 look like this:

In `IIndexesOperations`:

    // Asynchronous operation with lower-level HTTP features exposed
    Task<AzureOperationResponse<IndexGetStatisticsResult>> GetStatisticsWithHttpMessagesAsync(
        string indexName,
        SearchRequestOptions searchRequestOptions = default(SearchRequestOptions),
        Dictionary<string, List<string>> customHeaders = null,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken));

In `IndexesOperationsExtensions`:

    // Simplified asynchronous operation
    public static Task<IndexGetStatisticsResult> GetStatisticsAsync(
        this IIndexesOperations operations,
        string indexName,
        SearchRequestOptions searchRequestOptions = default(SearchRequestOptions),
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken));

    // Simplified synchronous operation
    public static IndexGetStatisticsResult GetStatistics(
        this IIndexesOperations operations,
        string indexName,
        SearchRequestOptions searchRequestOptions = default(SearchRequestOptions));

Starting with version 1.1, the Azure Search .NET SDK organizes operation methods differently:

* Optional parameters are now modeled as default parameters rather than additional method overloads. This reduces the number of method overloads, sometimes dramatically.
* The extension methods now hide a lot of the extraneous details of HTTP from the caller. For example, older versions of the SDK returned a response object with an HTTP status code, which you often didn't need to check because operation methods throw `CloudException` for any status code that indicates an error. The new extension methods just return model objects, saving you the trouble of having to unwrap them in your code.
* Conversely, the core interfaces now expose methods that give you more control at the HTTP level if you need it. You can now pass in custom HTTP headers to be included in requests, and the new `AzureOperationResponse<T>` return type gives you direct access to the `HttpRequestMessage` and `HttpResponseMessage` for the operation. `AzureOperationResponse` is defined in the `Microsoft.Rest.Azure` namespace and replaces `Hyak.Common.OperationResponse`.

### ScoringParameters changes
A new class named `ScoringParameter` has been added in the latest SDK to make it easier to provide parameters to scoring profiles in a search query. Previously the `ScoringProfiles` property of the `SearchParameters` class was typed as `IList<string>`; Now it is typed as `IList<ScoringParameter>`.

#### Example
If your code looks like this:

    var sp = new SearchParameters();
    sp.ScoringProfile = "jobsScoringFeatured";      // Use a scoring profile
    sp.ScoringParameters = new[] { "featuredParam-featured", "mapCenterParam-" + lon + "," + lat };

You can change it to this to fix any build errors: 

    var sp = new SearchParameters();
    sp.ScoringProfile = "jobsScoringFeatured";      // Use a scoring profile
    sp.ScoringParameters =
        new[]
        {
            new ScoringParameter("featuredParam", new[] { "featured" }),
            new ScoringParameter("mapCenterParam", GeographyPoint.Create(lat, lon))
        };

### Model class changes
Due to the signature changes described in [Operation method changes](#OperationMethodChanges), many classes in the `Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models` namespace have been renamed or removed. For example:

* `IndexDefinitionResponse` has been replaced by `AzureOperationResponse<Index>`
* `DocumentSearchResponse` has been renamed to `DocumentSearchResult`
* `IndexResult` has been renamed to `IndexingResult`
* `Documents.Count()` now returns a `long` with the document count instead of a `DocumentCountResponse`
* `IndexGetStatisticsResponse` has been renamed to `IndexGetStatisticsResult`
* `IndexListResponse` has been renamed to `IndexListResult`

To summarize, `OperationResponse`-derived classes that existed only to wrap a model object have been removed. The remaining classes have had their suffix changed from `Response` to `Result`.

#### Example
If your code looks like this:

    IndexerGetStatusResponse statusResponse = null;

    try
    {
        statusResponse = _searchClient.Indexers.GetStatus(indexer.Name);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error polling for indexer status: {0}", ex.Message);
        return;
    }

    IndexerExecutionResult lastResult = statusResponse.ExecutionInfo.LastResult;

You can change it to this to fix any build errors:

    IndexerExecutionInfo status = null;

    try
    {
        status = _searchClient.Indexers.GetStatus(indexer.Name);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error polling for indexer status: {0}", ex.Message);
        return;
    }

    IndexerExecutionResult lastResult = status.LastResult;

#### Response classes and IEnumerable
An additional change that may affect your code is that response classes that hold collections no longer implement `IEnumerable<T>`. Instead, you can access the collection property directly. For example, if your code looks like this:

    DocumentSearchResponse<Hotel> response = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>(searchText, sp);
    foreach (SearchResult<Hotel> result in response)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(result.Document);
    }

You can change it to this to fix any build errors:

    DocumentSearchResult<Hotel> response = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>(searchText, sp);
    foreach (SearchResult<Hotel> result in response.Results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(result.Document);
    }

#### Special case for web applications
If you have a web application that serializes `DocumentSearchResponse` directly to send search results to the browser, you will need to change your code or the results will not serialize correctly. For example, if your code looks like this:

    public ActionResult Search(string q = "")
    {
        // If blank search, assume they want to search everything
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(q))
            q = "*";

        return new JsonResult
        {
            JsonRequestBehavior = JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet,
            Data = _featuresSearch.Search(q)
        };
    }

You can change it by getting the `.Results` property of the search response to fix search result rendering:

    public ActionResult Search(string q = "")
    {
        // If blank search, assume they want to search everything
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(q))
            q = "*";

        return new JsonResult
        {
            JsonRequestBehavior = JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet,
            Data = _featuresSearch.Search(q).Results
        };
    }

You will have to look for such cases in your code yourself; **The compiler will not warn you** because `JsonResult.Data` is of type `object`.

### CloudException changes
The `CloudException` class has moved from the `Hyak.Common` namespace to the `Microsoft.Rest.Azure` namespace. Also, its `Error` property has been renamed to `Body`.

### SearchServiceClient and SearchIndexClient changes
The type of the `Credentials` property has changed from `SearchCredentials` to its base class, `ServiceClientCredentials`. If you need to access the `SearchCredentials` of a `SearchIndexClient` or `SearchServiceClient`, please use the new `SearchCredentials` property.

In older versions of the SDK, `SearchServiceClient` and `SearchIndexClient` had constructors that took an `HttpClient` parameter. These have been replaced with constructors that take an `HttpClientHandler` and an array of `DelegatingHandler` objects. This makes it easier to install custom handlers to pre-process HTTP requests if necessary.

Finally, the constructors that took a `Uri` and `SearchCredentials` have changed. For example, if you have code that looks like this:

    var client =
        new SearchServiceClient(
            new SearchCredentials("abc123"),
            new Uri("http://myservice.search.windows.net"));

You can change it to this to fix any build errors:

    var client =
        new SearchServiceClient(
            new Uri("http://myservice.search.windows.net"),
            new SearchCredentials("abc123"));

Also note that the type of the credentials parameter has changed to `ServiceClientCredentials`. This is unlikely to affect your code since `SearchCredentials` is derived from `ServiceClientCredentials`.

### Passing a request ID
In older versions of the SDK, you could set a request ID on the `SearchServiceClient` or `SearchIndexClient` and it would be included in every request to the REST API. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with your search service if you need to contact support. However, it is more useful to set a unique request ID for every operation rather than to use the same ID for all operations. For this reason, the `SetClientRequestId` methods of `SearchServiceClient` and `SearchIndexClient` have been removed. Instead, you can pass a request ID to each operation method via the optional `SearchRequestOptions` parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> In a future release of the SDK, we will add a new mechanism for setting a request ID globally on the client objects that is consistent with the approach used by other Azure SDKs.
> 
> 

### Example
If you have code that looks like this:

    client.SetClientRequestId(Guid.NewGuid());
    ...
    long count = client.Documents.Count();

You can change it to this to fix any build errors:

    long count = client.Documents.Count(new SearchRequestOptions(requestId: Guid.NewGuid()));

### Interface name changes
The operation group interface names have all changed to be consistent with their corresponding property names:

* The type of `ISearchServiceClient.Indexes` has been renamed from `IIndexOperations` to `IIndexesOperations`.
* The type of `ISearchServiceClient.Indexers` has been renamed from `IIndexerOperations` to `IIndexersOperations`.
* The type of `ISearchServiceClient.DataSources` has been renamed from `IDataSourceOperations` to `IDataSourcesOperations`.
* The type of `ISearchIndexClient.Documents` has been renamed from `IDocumentOperations` to `IDocumentsOperations`.

This change is unlikely to affect your code unless you created mocks of these interfaces for test purposes.

## Bug fixes in version 1.1
There was a bug in older versions of the Azure Search .NET SDK relating to serialization of custom model classes. The bug could occur if you created a custom model class with a property of a non-nullable value type.

### Steps to reproduce
Create a custom model class with a property of non-nullable value type. For example, add a public `UnitCount` property of type `int` instead of `int?`.

If you index a document with the default value of that type (for example, 0 for `int`), the field will be null in Azure Search. If you subsequently search for that document, the `Search` call will throw `JsonSerializationException` complaining that it can't convert `null` to `int`.

Also, filters may not work as expected since null was written to the index instead of the intended value.

### Fix details
We have fixed this issue in version 1.1 of the SDK. Now, if you have a model class like this:

    public class Model
    {
        public string Key { get; set; }

        public int IntValue { get; set; }
    }

and you set `IntValue` to 0, that value is now correctly serialized as 0 on the wire and stored as 0 in the index. Round tripping also works as expected.

There is one potential issue to be aware of with this approach: If you use a model type with a non-nullable property, you have to **guarantee** that no documents in your index contain a null value for the corresponding field. Neither the SDK nor the Azure Search REST API will help you to enforce this.

This is not just a hypothetical concern: Imagine a scenario where you add a new field to an existing index that is of type `Edm.Int32`. After updating the index definition, all documents will have a null value for that new field (since all types are nullable in Azure Search). If you then use a model class with a non-nullable `int` property for that field, you will get a `JsonSerializationException` like this when trying to retrieve documents:

    Error converting value {null} to type 'System.Int32'. Path 'IntValue'.

For this reason, we still recommend that you use nullable types in your model classes as a best practice.

For more details on this bug and the fix, please see [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/1063).
