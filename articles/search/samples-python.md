# Python code samples for Azure Cognitive Search

Learn about the Python code samples that demonstrate the functionality and workflow of an Azure Cognitive Search solution. These samples use the [**Azure Cognitive Search client library**](/python/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme) for the [**Azure SDK for Python**](/azure/developer/python/), which you can explore through the following links.

| Target | Link |
|--------|------|
| Package download | [pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/) |
| API reference | [azure-search-documents](/python/api/azure-search-documents)  |
| API test cases | [github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/tests](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/tests) |

| [Authenticate](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_authentication.py) | Demonstrates how to configure a client and authenticate to the service. | 
| [Index Create-Read-Update-Delete operations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_index_crud_operations.py) | Demonstrates how to create, update, get, list, and delete [search indexes](search-what-is-an-index.md). |
| [Indexer Create-Read-Update-Delete operations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_indexers_operations.py) | Demonstrates how to create, update, get, list, reset, and delete [indexers](search-indexer-overview.md). |
| [Search indexer data sources](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_indexer_datasource_skillset.py) | Demonstrates how to create, update, get, list, and delete indexer data sources, required for indexer-based indexing of [supported Azure data sources](search-indexer-overview.md#supported-data-sources). |
| [Synonyms](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_synonym_map_operations.py) | Demonstrates how to create, update, get, list, and delete [synonym maps](search-synonyms.md).  |
| [Load documents](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_crud_operations.py) | Demonstrates how to upload or merge documents into an index in a [data import](search-what-is-data-import.md) operation. |
| [Simple query](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_simple_query.py) | Demonstrates how to set up a [basic query](search-query-overview.md). |
| [Filter query](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_filter_query.py) | Demonstrates setting up a [filter expression](search-filters.md). |
| [Facet query](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/samples/sample_facet_query.py) | Demonstrates working with [facets](search-filters-facets.md). |

## Doc samples

Code samples from the Cognitive Search team demonstrate features and workflows. Many of these samples are referenced in tutorials, quickstarts, and how-to articles. You can find these samples in [**Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples) on GitHub.

| Samples | Article |
|---------|---------|
| [quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/master/Quickstart) | Source code for [Quickstart: Create a search index in Python](search-get-started-python.md). This article covers the basic workflow for creating, loading, and querying a search index using sample data. |
| [tutorial-ai-enrichment](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/master/Tutorial-AI-Enrichment)  | Source code for [Tutorial: Use Python and AI to generate searchable content from Azure blobs](cognitive-search-tutorial-blob-python.md). This article shows how to create a blob indexer with a cognitive skillset, where the skillset creates and transforms raw content to make it searchable or consumable. |
| [AzureML-Custom-Skill](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/master/AzureML-Custom-Skill)  | Source code for [Example: Create a custom skill using Python](cognitive-search-custom-skill-python.md). This article demonstrates indexer and skillset integration with deep learning models in Azure Machine Learning. |
