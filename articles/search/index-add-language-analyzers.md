# Add language analyzers to string fields in an Azure Cognitive Search index

A *language analyzer* is a specific type of [text analyzer](search-analyzers.md) that performs lexical analysis using the linguistic rules of the target language. Every searchable field has an **analyzer** property. If your content consists of translated strings, such as separate fields for English and Chinese text, you could specify language analyzers on each field to access the rich linguistic capabilities of those analyzers.

## When to use a language analyzer

You should consider a language analyzer when awareness of word or sentence structure adds value to text parsing. A common example is the association of irregular verb forms ("bring" and "brought) or plural nouns ("mice" and "mouse"). Without linguistic awareness, these strings are parsed on physical characteristics alone, which fails to catch the connection. Since large chunks of text are more likely to have this content, fields consisting of descriptions, reviews, or summaries are good candidates for a language analyzer.

You should also consider language analyzers when content consists of non-Western language strings. While the [default analyzer](search-analyzers.md#default-analyzer) is language-agnostic, the concept of using spaces and special characters (hyphens and slashes) to separate strings tends is more applicable to Western languages than non-Western ones. 

For example, in Chinese, Japanese, Korean (CJK), and other Asian languages, a space is not necessarily a word delimiter. Consider the following Japanese string. Because it has no spaces, a language-agnostic analyzer would likely analyze the entire string as one token, when in fact the string is actually a phrase.

```
これは私たちの銀河系の中ではもっとも重く明るいクラスの球状星団です。
(This is the heaviest and brightest group of spherical stars in our galaxy.)
```

For the example above, a successful query would have to include the full token, or a partial token using a suffix wildcard, resulting in an unnatural and limiting search experience.

A better experience is to search for individual words: 明るい (Bright), 私たちの (Our), 銀河系 (Galaxy). Using one of the Japanese analyzers available in Cognitive Search is more likely to unlock this behavior because those analyzers are better equipped at splitting the chunk of text into meaningful words in the target language.

## Comparing Lucene and Microsoft Analyzers

Azure Cognitive Search supports 35 language analyzers backed by Lucene, and 50 language analyzers backed by proprietary Microsoft natural language processing technology used in Office and Bing.

Some developers might prefer the more familiar, simple, open-source solution of Lucene. Lucene language analyzers are faster, but the Microsoft analyzers have advanced capabilities, such as lemmatization, word decompounding (in languages like German, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Estonian, Finish, Hungarian, Slovak) and entity recognition (URLs, emails, dates, numbers). If possible, you should run comparisons of both the Microsoft and Lucene analyzers to decide which one is a better fit. 

Indexing with Microsoft analyzers is on average two to three times slower than their Lucene equivalents, depending on the language. Search performance should not be significantly affected for average size queries. 

### English analyzers

The default analyzer is Standard Lucene, which works well for English, but perhaps not as well as Lucene's English analyzer or Microsoft's English analyzer. 
 
+ Lucene's English analyzer extends the standard analyzer. It removes possessives (trailing 's) from words, applies stemming as per Porter Stemming algorithm, and removes English stop words.  

+ Microsoft's English analyzer performs lemmatization instead of stemming. This means it can handle inflected and irregular word forms much better which results in more relevant search results 

## Configuring analyzers

Language analyzers are used as-is. For each field in the index definition, you can set the **analyzer** property to an analyzer name that specifies the language and linguistics stack (Microsoft or Lucene). The same analyzer will be applied when indexing and searching for that field. For example, you can have separate fields for English, French, and Spanish hotel descriptions that exist side by side in the same index.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to use a different language analyzer at indexing time than at query time for a field. That capability is reserved for [custom analyzers](index-add-custom-analyzers.md). For this reason, if you try to set the **searchAnalyzer** or **indexAnalyzer** properties to the name of a language analyzer, the REST API will return an error response. You must use the **analyzer** property instead.

Use the **searchFields** query parameter to specify which language-specific field to search against in your queries. You can review query examples that include the analyzer property in [Search Documents](/rest/api/searchservice/search-documents). 

For more information about index properties, see [Create Index &#40;Azure Cognitive Search REST API&#41;](/rest/api/searchservice/create-index). For more information about analysis in Azure Cognitive Search, see [Analyzers in Azure Cognitive Search](./search-analyzers.md).
