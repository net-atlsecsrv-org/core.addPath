# How to index plain text blobs in Azure Cognitive Search

When using a [blob indexer](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) to extract searchable blob text for full text search, you can assign a parsing mode to get better indexing outcomes. By default, the indexer parses blob content as a single chunk of text. However, if all blobs contain plain text in the same encoding, you can significantly improve indexing performance by using the `text` parsing mode.

Recommendations for use `text` parsing include:

+ File type is .txt
+ Files are of any type, but the content itself is text (for example, program source code, HTML, XML, and so forth). For files in a mark up language, any syntax characters will come through as static text.

Recall that all indexers serialize to JSON. By default, the contents of the entire text file will be indexed within one large field as `"content": "<file-contents>"`. Any new line and return instructions are embedded in the content field and expressed as `\r\n\`.

If you want a more granular outcome, and if the file type is compatible, consider the following solutions:

+ [`delimitedText`](search-howto-index-csv-blobs.md) parsing mode, if the source is CSV
+ [`jsonArray` or `jsonLines`](search-howto-index-json-blobs.md), if the source is JSON

A third option for breaking content into multiple parts requires advanced features in the form of [AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md). It adds analysis that identifies and assigns chunks of the file to different search fields. You might find a full or partial solution through [built-in skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md), but a more likely solution would be  learning model that understands your content, articulated in custom learning model, wrapped in a [custom skill](cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface.md).

## Set up plain text indexing

To index plain text blobs, create or update an indexer definition with the `parsingMode` configuration property to `text` on a [Create Indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/create-indexer) request:

```http
PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=2020-06-30
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]

{
  ... other parts of indexer definition
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "text" } }
}
```

By default, the `UTF-8` encoding is assumed. To specify a different encoding, use the `encoding` configuration property: 

```http
{
  ... other parts of indexer definition
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "text", "encoding" : "windows-1252" } }
}
```

## Request example

Parsing modes are specified in the indexer definition.

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers?api-version=2020-06-30
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]

{
  "name" : "my-plaintext-indexer",
  "dataSourceName" : "my-blob-datasource",
  "targetIndexName" : "my-target-index",
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "delimitedText", "delimitedTextHeaders" : "id,datePublished,tags" } }
}
```
