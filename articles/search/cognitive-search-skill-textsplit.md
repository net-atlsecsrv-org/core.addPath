#	Text split cognitive skill

The **Text Split** skill breaks text into chunks of text. You can specify whether you want to break the text into sentences or into pages of a particular length. This skill is especially useful if there are maximum text length requirements in other skills downstream. 

> [!NOTE]
> This skill is not bound to a Cognitive Services API and you are not charged for using it. You should still [attach a Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md), however, to override the **Free** resource option that limits you to a small number of daily enrichments per day.

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.SplitSkill 

## Skill Parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| textSplitMode      | Either "pages" or "sentences" | 
| maximumPageLength	| If textSplitMode is set to "pages", this refers to the maximum page length as measured by `String.Length`. The minimum value is 100.  If the textSplitMode is set to "pages", the algorithm will try to split the text into chunks that are at most "maximumPageLength" in size. In this case, the algorithm will do its best to break the sentence on a sentence boundary, so the size of the chunk may be slightly less than "maximumPageLength". | 
| defaultLanguageCode	| (optional) One of the following language codes: `da, de, en, es, fi, fr, it, ko, pt`. Default is English (en). Few things to consider:<ul><li>If you pass a languagecode-countrycode format, only the languagecode part of the format is used.</li><li>If the language is not in the previous list, the split skill breaks the text at character boundaries.</li><li>Providing a language code is useful to avoid cutting a word in half for non-space languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</li></ul>  |


## Skill Inputs

| Parameter name	   | Description      |
|----------------------|------------------|
| text	| The text to split into substring. |
| languageCode	| (Optional) Language code for the document.  |

## Skill Outputs 

| Parameter name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| textItems	| An array of substrings that were extracted. |

                    "On the second page we…"
                ]
            }
