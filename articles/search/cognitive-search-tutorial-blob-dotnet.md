# C# Tutorial: Call Cognitive Services APIs in an Azure Search indexing pipeline

In this tutorial, you learn the mechanics of programming data enrichment in Azure Search using *cognitive skills*. Skills are backed by natural language processing (NLP) and image analysis capabilities in Cognitive Services. Through skillset composition and configuration, you can extract text and text representations of an image or scanned document file. You can also detect language, entities, key phrases, and more. The end result is rich additional content in an Azure Search index, created by an AI-powered indexing pipeline.

In this tutorial, you use the .NET SDK to perform the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an indexing pipeline that enriches sample data in route to an index
> * Apply built-in skills: optical character recognition, text merger, language detection, text split, entity recognition, key phrase extraction
> * Learn how to chain skills together by mapping inputs to outputs in a skillset
> * Execute requests and review results
> * Reset the index and indexers for further development

Output is a full text searchable index on Azure Search. You can enhance the index with other standard capabilities, such as [synonyms](search-synonyms.md), [scoring profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/add-scoring-profiles-to-a-search-index), [analyzers](search-analyzers.md), and [filters](search-filters.md).

This tutorial runs on the Free service, but the number of free transactions is limited to 20 documents per day. If you want to run this tutorial more than once in the same day, use a smaller file set so that you can fit in more runs.

> [!NOTE]
> As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to attach a billable Cognitive Services resource. Charges accrue when calling APIs in Cognitive Services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.
>
> Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)
. Image extraction pricing is described on the [Azure Search pricing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042400).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

The following services, tools, and data are used in this tutorial. 

+ [Create an Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account) for storing the sample data. Make sure the storage account is in the same region as Azure Search.

+ [Sample data](https://1drv.ms/f/s!As7Oy81M_gVPa-LCb5lC_3hbS-4) consists of a small file set of different types. 

+ [Install Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to use as the IDE.

+ [Create an Azure Search service](search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices) under your current subscription. You can use a free service for this tutorial.

## Get a key and URL

To interact with your Azure Search service you will need the service URL and an access key. A search service is created with both, so if you added Azure Search to your subscription, follow these steps to get the necessary information:

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and in your search service **Overview** page, get the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://mydemo.search.windows.net`.

1. In **Settings** > **Keys**, get an admin key for full rights on the service. There are two interchangeable admin keys, provided for business continuity in case you need to roll one over. You can use either the primary or secondary key on requests for adding, modifying, and deleting objects.

   ![Get an HTTP endpoint and access key](media/search-get-started-postman/get-url-key.png "Get an HTTP endpoint and access key")

Having a valid key establishes trust, on a per request basis, between the application sending the request and the service that handles it.

## Prepare sample data

The enrichment pipeline pulls from Azure data sources. Source data must originate from a supported data source type of an [Azure Search indexer](search-indexer-overview.md). Azure Table Storage is not supported for cognitive search. For this exercise, we use blob storage to showcase multiple content types.

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure storage account, click **Blobs**, and then click **+ Container**.

1. [Create a Blob container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) to contain sample data. You can set the Public Access Level to any of its valid values. This tutorial assumes that the container name is "basic-demo-data-pr".

1. After the container is created, open it and select **Upload** on the command bar to upload the [sample data](https://1drv.ms/f/s!As7Oy81M_gVPa-LCb5lC_3hbS-4).

   ![Source files in Azure blob storage](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/sample-data.png)

1. After sample files are loaded, get the container name and a connection string for your Blob storage. You could do that by navigating to your storage account in the Azure portal, selecting **Access keys**, and then copy the **Connection String** field.

   The connection string should be a URL similar to the following example:

      ```http
      DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=cogsrchdemostorage;AccountKey=<your account key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
      ```

There are other ways to specify the connection string, such as providing a shared access signature. To learn more about data source credentials, see [Indexing Azure Blob Storage](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md#Credentials).

## Set up your environment

Begin by opening Visual Studio and creating a new Console App project that can run on .NET Core.

### Install NuGet packages

The [Azure Search .NET SDK](https://aka.ms/search-sdk) consists of a few client libraries that enable you to manage your indexes, data sources, indexers, and skillsets, as well as upload and manage documents and execute queries, all without having to deal with the details of HTTP and JSON. These client libraries are all distributed as NuGet packages.

For this project, you will need to install version 9 of the `Microsoft.Azure.Search` NuGet package and the latest `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet package.

Install the `Microsoft.Azure.Search` NuGet package using the Package Manager console in Visual Studio. To open the Package Manager console select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**. To get the command to run, navigate to the  [Microsoft.Azure.Search NuGet package page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Search), select version 9, and copy the Package Manager command. In the Package Manager console, run this command.

To install the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet package in Visual Studio, select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**. Select Browse and search for the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet package. Once you've found it, select the package, select your project, confirm the version is the latest stable version, then select Install.

## Add Azure Search service information

In order to connect to your Azure Search service you will need to add the search service information to your project. Right click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select **Add** > **New Item...** . Name the file `appsettings.json` and select **Add**. 

This file will need to be included in your output directory. To do that, right click on `appsettings.json` and select **Properties**. Change the value of **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy of newer**.

Copy the below JSON into your new JSON file.

```json
{
  "SearchServiceName": "Put your search service name here",
  "SearchServiceAdminApiKey": "Put your primary or secondary API key here",
  "SearchServiceQueryApiKey": "Put your query API key here",
  "AzureBlobConnectionString": "Put your Azure Blob connection string here",
}
```

Add your search service and blob storage account information.

You can get your search service information from your search account page in the Azure portal. The account name will be on the main page and the keys can be found by selecting **Keys**.

You can get the blob connection string by navigating to your storage account in the Azure portal, selecting **Access keys**, and then copying the **Connection String** field.

## Add namespaces

This tutorial uses many different types from various namespaces. In order to use those types add the following to `Program.cs`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.Azure.Search;
using Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
```

## Create a client

Create an instance of the `SearchServiceClient` class.

```csharp
IConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddJsonFile("appsettings.json");
IConfigurationRoot configuration = builder.Build();
SearchServiceClient serviceClient = CreateSearchServiceClient(configuration);
```

`CreateSearchServiceClient` creates a new `SearchServiceClient` using values that are stored in the application's config file (appsettings.json).

```csharp
private static SearchServiceClient CreateSearchServiceClient(IConfigurationRoot configuration)
{
   string searchServiceName = configuration["SearchServiceName"];
   string adminApiKey = configuration["SearchServiceAdminApiKey"];

   SearchServiceClient serviceClient = new SearchServiceClient(searchServiceName, new SearchCredentials(adminApiKey));
   return serviceClient;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `SearchServiceClient` class manages connections to your search service. In order to avoid opening too many connections, you should try to share a single instance of `SearchServiceClient` in your application if possible. Its methods are thread-safe to enable such sharing.
> 
> 

## Create a data source

Create a new `DataSource` instance by calling `DataSource.AzureBlobStorage`. `DataSource.AzureBlobStorage` requires that you specify the data source name, connection string, and blob container name.

Although it's not used in this tutorial a soft delete policy is also defined which is used to identify deleted blobs based on the value of a soft delete column. The following policy considers a blob to be deleted if it has a metadata property `IsDeleted` with the value `true`.

```csharp
DataSource dataSource = DataSource.AzureBlobStorage(
    name: "demodata",
    storageConnectionString: configuration["AzureBlobConnectionString"],
    containerName: "basic-demo-data-pr",
    deletionDetectionPolicy: new SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy(
        softDeleteColumnName: "IsDeleted",
        softDeleteMarkerValue: "true"),
    description: "Demo files to demonstrate cognitive search capabilities.");
```

Now that you have initialized the `DataSource` object, create the data source. `SearchServiceClient` has a `DataSources` property. This property provides all the methods you need to create, list, update, or delete Azure Search data sources.

For a successful request, the method will return the data source that was created. If there is a problem with the request, such as an invalid parameter, the method will throw an exception.

```csharp
try
{
    serviceClient.DataSources.CreateOrUpdate(dataSource);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
```

Since this is your first request, check the Azure portal to confirm the data source was created in Azure Search. On the search service dashboard page, verify the Data Sources tile has a new item. You might need to wait a few minutes for the portal page to refresh.

  ![Data sources tile in the portal](./media/cognitive-search-tutorial-blob/data-source-tile.png "Data sources tile in the portal")

## Create a skillset

In this section, you define a set of enrichment steps that you want to apply to your data. Each enrichment step is called a *skill* and the set of enrichment steps a *skillset*. This tutorial uses [predefined cognitive skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) for the skillset:

+ [Optical Character Recognition](cognitive-search-skill-ocr.md) to recognize printed and handwritten text in image files.

+ [Text Merger](cognitive-search-skill-textmerger.md) to consolidate text from a collection of fields into a single field.

+ [Language Detection](cognitive-search-skill-language-detection.md) to identify the content's language.

+ [Text Split](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) to break large content into smaller chunks before calling the key phrase extraction skill and the entity recognition skill. Key phrase extraction and entity recognition accept inputs of 50,000 characters or less. A few of the sample files need splitting up to fit within this limit.

+ [Entity Recognition](cognitive-search-skill-entity-recognition.md) for extracting the names of organizations from content in the blob container.

+ [Key Phrase Extraction](cognitive-search-skill-keyphrases.md) to pull out the top key phrases.

During initial processing, Azure Search cracks each document to read content from different file formats. Found text originating in the source file is placed into a generated ```content``` field, one for each document. As such, set the input for as ```"/document/content"``` to use this text. 

Outputs can be mapped to an index, used as input to a downstream skill, or both as is the case with language code. In the index, a language code is useful for filtering. As an input, language code is used by text analysis skills to inform the linguistic rules around word breaking.

For more information about skillset fundamentals, see [How to define a skillset](cognitive-search-defining-skillset.md).

### OCR skill

The **OCR** skill extracts text from images. This skill assumes that a normalized_images field exists. To generate this field, later in the tutorial we'll set the ```"imageAction"``` configuration in the indexer definition to ```"generateNormalizedImages"```.

```csharp
List<InputFieldMappingEntry> inputMappings = new List<InputFieldMappingEntry>();
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "image",
    source: "/document/normalized_images/*"));

List<OutputFieldMappingEntry> outputMappings = new List<OutputFieldMappingEntry>();
outputMappings.Add(new OutputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "text",
    targetName: "text"));

OcrSkill ocrSkill = new OcrSkill(
    description: "Extract text (plain and structured) from image",
    context: "/document/normalized_images/*",
    inputs: inputMappings,
    outputs: outputMappings,
    defaultLanguageCode: OcrSkillLanguage.En,
    shouldDetectOrientation: true);
```

### Merge skill

In this section you'll create a **Merge** skill that merges the document content field with the text that was produced by the OCR skill.

```csharp
List<InputFieldMappingEntry> inputMappings = new List<InputFieldMappingEntry>();
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "text",
    source: "/document/content"));
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "itemsToInsert",
    source: "/document/normalized_images/*/text"));
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "offsets",
    source: "/document/normalized_images/*/contentOffset"));

List<OutputFieldMappingEntry> outputMappings = new List<OutputFieldMappingEntry>();
outputMappings.Add(new OutputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "mergedText",
    targetName: "merged_text"));

MergeSkill mergeSkill = new MergeSkill(
    description: "Create merged_text which includes all the textual representation of each image inserted at the right location in the content field.",
    context: "/document",
    inputs: inputMappings,
    outputs: outputMappings,
    insertPreTag: " ",
    insertPostTag: " ");
```

### Language detection skill

The **Language Detection** skill detects the language of the input text and reports a single language code for every document submitted on the request. We'll use the output of the **Language Detection** skill as part of the input to the **Text Split** skill.

```csharp
List<InputFieldMappingEntry> inputMappings = new List<InputFieldMappingEntry>();
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "text",
    source: "/document/merged_text"));

List<OutputFieldMappingEntry> outputMappings = new List<OutputFieldMappingEntry>();
outputMappings.Add(new OutputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "languageCode",
    targetName: "languageCode"));

LanguageDetectionSkill languageDetectionSkill = new LanguageDetectionSkill(
    description: "Detect the language used in the document",
    context: "/document",
    inputs: inputMappings,
    outputs: outputMappings);
```

### Text split skill

The below **Split** skill will split text by pages and limit the page length to 4,000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. The algorithm will try to split the text into chunks that are at most `maximumPageLength` in size. In this case, the algorithm will do its best to break the sentence on a sentence boundary, so the size of the chunk may be slightly less than `maximumPageLength`.

```csharp
List<InputFieldMappingEntry> inputMappings = new List<InputFieldMappingEntry>();
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "text",
    source: "/document/merged_text"));
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "languageCode",
    source: "/document/languageCode"));

List<OutputFieldMappingEntry> outputMappings = new List<OutputFieldMappingEntry>();
outputMappings.Add(new OutputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "textItems",
    targetName: "pages"));

SplitSkill splitSkill = new SplitSkill(
    description: "Split content into pages",
    context: "/document",
    inputs: inputMappings,
    outputs: outputMappings,
    textSplitMode: TextSplitMode.Pages,
    maximumPageLength: 4000);
```

### Entity recognition skill

This `EntityRecognitionSkill` instance is set to recognize category type `organization`. The **Entity Recognition** skill can also recognize category types `person` and `location`.

Notice that the "context" field is set to ```"/document/pages/*"``` with an asterisk, meaning the enrichment step is called for each page under ```"/document/pages"```.

```csharp
List<InputFieldMappingEntry> inputMappings = new List<InputFieldMappingEntry>();
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "text",
    source: "/document/pages/*"));
    
List<OutputFieldMappingEntry> outputMappings = new List<OutputFieldMappingEntry>();
outputMappings.Add(new OutputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "organizations",
    targetName: "organizations"));

List<EntityCategory> entityCategory = new List<EntityCategory>();
entityCategory.Add(EntityCategory.Organization);
    
EntityRecognitionSkill entityRecognitionSkill = new EntityRecognitionSkill(
    description: "Recognize organizations",
    context: "/document/pages/*",
    inputs: inputMappings,
    outputs: outputMappings,
    categories: entityCategory,
    defaultLanguageCode: EntityRecognitionSkillLanguage.En);
```

### Key phrase extraction skill

Like the `EntityRecognitionSkill` instance that was just created, the **Key Phrase Extraction** skill is called for each page of the document.

```csharp
List<InputFieldMappingEntry> inputMappings = new List<InputFieldMappingEntry>();
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "text",
    source: "/document/pages/*"));
inputMappings.Add(new InputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "languageCode",
    source: "/document/languageCode"));

List<OutputFieldMappingEntry> outputMappings = new List<OutputFieldMappingEntry>();
outputMappings.Add(new OutputFieldMappingEntry(
    name: "keyPhrases",
    targetName: "keyPhrases"));

KeyPhraseExtractionSkill keyPhraseExtractionSkill = new KeyPhraseExtractionSkill(
    description: "Extract the key phrases",
    context: "/document/pages/*",
    inputs: inputMappings,
    outputs: outputMappings);
```

### Build and create the skillset

Build the `Skillset` using the skills you created.

```csharp
List<Skill> skills = new List<Skill>();
skills.Add(ocrSkill);
skills.Add(mergeSkill);
skills.Add(languageDetectionSkill);
skills.Add(splitSkill);
skills.Add(entityRecognitionSkill);
skills.Add(keyPhraseExtractionSkill);

Skillset skillset = new Skillset(
    name: "demoskillset",
    description: "Demo skillset",
    skills: skills);
```

Create the skillset in your search service.

```csharp
try
{
    serviceClient.Skillsets.CreateOrUpdate(skillset);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

## Create an index

In this section, you define the index schema by specifying which fields to include in the searchable index, and the search attributes for each field. Fields have a type and can take attributes that determine how the field is used (searchable, sortable, and so forth). Field names in an index are not required to identically match the field names in the source. In a later step, you add field mappings in an indexer to connect source-destination fields. For this step, define the index using field naming conventions pertinent to your search application.

This exercise uses the following fields and field types:

| field-names: | `id`       | content   | languageCode | keyPhrases         | organizations     |
|--------------|----------|-------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| field-types: | Edm.String|Edm.String| Edm.String| List<Edm.String>  | List<Edm.String>  |


### Create DemoIndex Class

The fields for this index are defined using a model class. Each property of the model class has attributes which determine the search-related behaviors of the corresponding index field. 

We'll add the model class to a new C# file. Right click on your project and select **Add** > **New Item...**, select "Class" and name the file `DemoIndex.cs`, then select **Add**.

Make sure to indicate that you want to use types from the `Microsoft.Azure.Search` and `Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models` namespaces.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Search;
using Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models;
```

Add the below model class definition to `DemoIndex.cs` and include it in the same namespace where you'll create the index.

```csharp
// The SerializePropertyNamesAsCamelCase attribute is defined in the Azure Search .NET SDK.
// It ensures that Pascal-case property names in the model class are mapped to camel-case
// field names in the index.
[SerializePropertyNamesAsCamelCase]
public class DemoIndex
{
    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
    [IsSearchable, IsSortable]
    public string Id { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable]
    public string Content { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable]
    public string LanguageCode { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable]
    public string[] KeyPhrases { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable]
    public string[] Organizations { get; set; }
}
```

Now that you've defined a model class, back in `Program.cs` you can create an index definition fairly easily. The name for this index will be "demoindex".

```csharp
var index = new Index()
{
    Name = "demoindex",
    Fields = FieldBuilder.BuildForType<DemoIndex>()
};
```

During testing you may find that you're attempting to create the index more than once. Because of this, check to see if the index that you're about to create already exists before attempting to create it.

```csharp
try
{
    bool exists = serviceClient.Indexes.Exists(index.Name);

    if (exists)
    {
        serviceClient.Indexes.Delete(index.Name);
    }

    serviceClient.Indexes.Create(index);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

To learn more about defining an index, see [Create Index (Azure Search REST API)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/create-index).

## Create an indexer, map fields, and execute transformations

So far you have created a data source, a skillset, and an index. These three components become part of an [indexer](search-indexer-overview.md) that pulls each piece together into a single multi-phased operation. To tie these together in an indexer, you must define field mappings.

+ The fieldMappings are processed before the skillset, mapping source fields from the data source to target fields in an index. If field names and types are the same at both ends, no mapping is required.

+ The outputFieldMappings are processed after the skillset, referencing sourceFieldNames that don't exist until document cracking or enrichment creates them. The targetFieldName is a field in an index.

In addition to hooking up inputs to outputs, you can also use field mappings to flatten data structures. For more information, see [How to map enriched fields to a searchable index](cognitive-search-output-field-mapping.md).

```csharp
IDictionary<string, object> config = new Dictionary<string, object>();
config.Add(
    key: "dataToExtract",
    value: "contentAndMetadata");
config.Add(
    key: "imageAction",
    value: "generateNormalizedImages");

List<FieldMapping> fieldMappings = new List<FieldMapping>();
fieldMappings.Add(new FieldMapping(
    sourceFieldName: "metadata_storage_path",
    targetFieldName: "id",
    mappingFunction: new FieldMappingFunction(
        name: "base64Encode")));
fieldMappings.Add(new FieldMapping(
    sourceFieldName: "content",
    targetFieldName: "content"));

List<FieldMapping> outputMappings = new List<FieldMapping>();
outputMappings.Add(new FieldMapping(
    sourceFieldName: "/document/pages/*/organizations/*",
    targetFieldName: "organizations"));
outputMappings.Add(new FieldMapping(
    sourceFieldName: "/document/pages/*/keyPhrases/*",
    targetFieldName: "keyPhrases"));
outputMappings.Add(new FieldMapping(
    sourceFieldName: "/document/languageCode",
    targetFieldName: "languageCode"));

Indexer indexer = new Indexer(
    name: "demoindexer",
    dataSourceName: dataSource.Name,
    targetIndexName: index.Name,
    description: "Demo Indexer",
    skillsetName: skillSet.Name,
    parameters: new IndexingParameters(
        maxFailedItems: -1,
        maxFailedItemsPerBatch: -1,
        configuration: config),
    fieldMappings: fieldMappings,
    outputFieldMappings: outputMappings);

try
{
    bool exists = serviceClient.Indexers.Exists(indexer.Name);

    if (exists)
    {
        serviceClient.Indexers.Delete(indexer.Name);
    }

    serviceClient.Indexers.Create(indexer);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

Expect that creating the indexer will take a little time to complete. Even though the data set is small, analytical skills are computation-intensive. Some skills, such as image analysis, are long-running.

> [!TIP]
> Creating an indexer invokes the pipeline. If there are problems reaching the data, mapping inputs and outputs, or order of operations, they appear at this stage.

### Explore creating the indexer

The code sets ```"maxFailedItems"```  to -1, which instructs the indexing engine to ignore errors during data import. This is useful because there are so few documents in the demo data source. For a larger data source, you would set the value to greater than 0.

Also notice the ```"dataToExtract"``` is set to ```"contentAndMetadata"```. This statement tells the indexer to automatically extract the content from different file formats as well as metadata related to each file.

When content is extracted, you can set `imageAction` to extract text from images found in the data source. The ```"imageAction"``` set to ```"generateNormalizedImages"``` configuration, combined with the OCR Skill and Text Merge Skill, tells the indexer to extract text from the images (for example, the word "stop" from a traffic Stop sign), and embed it as part of the content field. This behavior applies to both the images embedded in the documents (think of an image inside a PDF), as well as images found in the data source, for instance a JPG file.

## Check indexer status

Once the indexer is defined, it runs automatically when you submit the request. Depending on which cognitive skills you defined, indexing can take longer than you expect. To find out whether the indexer is still running, use the `GetStatus` method.

```csharp
try
{
    IndexerExecutionInfo demoIndexerExecutionInfo = serviceClient.Indexers.GetStatus(indexer.Name);

    switch (demoIndexerExecutionInfo.Status)
    {
        case IndexerStatus.Error:
            Console.WriteLine("Indexer has error status");
            break;
        case IndexerStatus.Running:
            Console.WriteLine("Indexer is running");
            break;
        case IndexerStatus.Unknown:
            Console.WriteLine("Indexer status is unknown");
            break;
        default:
            Console.WriteLine("No indexer information");
            break;
    }
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

`IndexerExecutionInfo` represents the current status and execution history of an indexer.

Warnings are common with some source file and skill combinations and do not always indicate a problem. In this tutorial, the warnings are benign (for example, no text inputs from the JPEG files).
 
## Query your index

After indexing is finished, you can run queries that return the contents of individual fields. By default, Azure Search returns the top 50 results. The sample data is small so the default works fine. However, when working with larger data sets, you might need to include parameters in the query string to return more results. For instructions, see [How to page results in Azure Search](search-pagination-page-layout.md).

As a verification step, query the index for all of the fields.

```csharp
DocumentSearchResult<DemoIndex> results;

ISearchIndexClient indexClientForQueries = CreateSearchIndexClient(configuration);

try
{
    results = indexClientForQueries.Documents.Search<DemoIndex>("*");
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

`CreateSearchIndexClient` creates a new `SearchIndexClient` using values that are stored in the application's config file (appsettings.json). Note that the search service query API key is used and not the admin key.

```csharp
private static SearchIndexClient CreateSearchIndexClient(IConfigurationRoot configuration)
{
   string searchServiceName = configuration["SearchServiceName"];
   string queryApiKey = configuration["SearchServiceQueryApiKey"];

   SearchIndexClient indexClient = new SearchIndexClient(searchServiceName, "demoindex", new SearchCredentials(queryApiKey));
   return indexClient;
}
```

The output is the index schema, with the name, type, and attributes of each field.

Submit a second query for `"*"` to return all contents of a single field, such as `organizations`.

```csharp
SearchParameters parameters =
    new SearchParameters
    {
        Select = new[] { "organizations" }
    };

try
{
    results = indexClientForQueries.Documents.Search<DemoIndex>("*", parameters);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

Repeat for additional fields: content, languageCode, keyPhrases, and organizations in this exercise. You can return multiple fields via `$select` using a comma-delimited list.

## Reset and rerun

In the early experimental stages of development, the most practical approach for design iterations is to delete the objects from Azure Search and allow your code to rebuild them. Resource names are unique. Deleting an object lets you recreate it using the same name.

This tutorial took care of checking for existing indexers and indexes and deleting them if they already existed so that you can rerun your code.

You can also use the portal to delete indexes, indexers, and skillsets.

As your code matures, you might want to refine a rebuild strategy. For more information, see [How to rebuild an index](search-howto-reindex.md).

## Takeaways

This tutorial demonstrated the basic steps for building an enriched indexing pipeline through the creation of component parts: a data source, skillset, index, and indexer.

[Predefined skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) were introduced, along with skillset definition and the mechanics of chaining skills together through inputs and outputs. You also learned that `outputFieldMappings` in the indexer definition is required for routing enriched values from the pipeline into a searchable index on an Azure Search service.

Finally, you learned how to test results and reset the system for further iterations. You learned that issuing queries against the index returns the output created by the enriched indexing pipeline. You also learned how to check indexer status, and which objects to delete before rerunning a pipeline.

## Clean up resources

The fastest way to clean up after a tutorial is by deleting the resource group containing the Azure Search service and Azure Blob service. Assuming you put both services in the same group, delete the resource group now to permanently delete everything in it, including the services and any stored content that you created for this tutorial. In the portal, the resource group name is on the Overview page of each service.

## Next steps

Customize or extend the pipeline with custom skills. Creating a custom skill and adding it to a skillset allows you to onboard text or image analysis that you write yourself.
