# Quickstart: Create an Azure Cognitive Search cognitive skillset in the Azure portal

A skillset is an AI-based feature that extracts information and structure from large undifferentiated text or image files, and makes the content both indexable and searchable in Azure Cognitive Search. 

In this quickstart, you'll combine services and data in the Azure cloud to create the skillset. Once everything is in place, you'll run the **Import data** wizard in the Azure portal to pull it all together. The end result is a searchable index populated with data created by AI processing that you can query in the portal ([Search explorer](search-explorer.md)).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

+ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

+ An Azure Cognitive Search service. [Create a service](search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices) under your current subscription. You can use a free service for this quickstart. 

+ An Azure Storage account with [Blob storage](../storage/blobs/index.yml).

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart also uses [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/) for the AI. Because the workload is so small, Cognitive Services is tapped behind the scenes for free processing for up to 20 transactions. This means that you can complete this exercise without having to create an additional Cognitive Services resource.

## Set up your data

In the following steps, set up a blob container in Azure Storage to store heterogeneous content files.

1. [Download sample data](https://1drv.ms/f/s!As7Oy81M_gVPa-LCb5lC_3hbS-4) consisting of a small file set of different types. Unzip the files.

1. [Create an Azure storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal) or [find an existing account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2storageAccounts/). 

   + Choose the same region as Azure Cognitive Search to avoid bandwidth charges. 

   + Choose the StorageV2 (general purpose V2) account type if you want to try out the knowledge store feature later, in another walkthrough. Otherwise, choose any type.

1. Open the Blob services pages and create a container. You can use the default public access level. 

1. In container, click **Upload** to upload the sample files you downloaded in the first step. Notice that you have a wide range of content types, including images and application files that are not full text searchable in their native formats.

You are now ready to move on the Import data wizard.

## Run the Import data wizard

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

1. [Find your search service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2storageAccounts/) and on the Overview page, click **Import data** on the command bar to set up cognitive enrichment in four steps.

   ![Import data command](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/import-data-cmd2.png)

### Step 1 - Create a data source

1. In **Connect to your data**, choose **Azure Blob storage**, select the Storage account and container you created. Give the data source a name, and use default values for the rest. 

   ![Azure blob configuration](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/blob-datasource.png)

    Continue to the next page.

### Step 2 - Add cognitive skills

Next, configure AI enrichment to invoke OCR, image analysis, and natural language processing. 

1. For this quickstart, we are using the **Free** Cognitive Services resource. The sample data consists of 14 files, so the free allotment of 20 transaction on Cognitive Services is sufficient for this quickstart. 

   ![Attach Cognitive Services attach base service](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/cog-search-attach.png)

1. Expand **Add enrichments** and make four selections. 

   Enable OCR to add image analysis skills to wizard page.

   Set granularity to Pages to break up text into smaller chunks. Several text skills are limited to 5-KB inputs.

   Choose entity recognition (people, organizations, locations) and image analysis skills.

   ![Attach Cognitive Services select services for skillset](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/skillset.png)

   Continue to the next page.

### Step 3 - Configure the index

An index contains your searchable content and the **Import data** wizard can usually create the schema for you by sampling the data source. In this step, review the generated schema and potentially revise any settings. Below is the default schema created for the demo Blob data set.

For this quickstart, the wizard does a good job setting reasonable defaults:  

+ Default fields are based on properties for existing blobs plus new fields to contain enrichment output (for example, `people`, `organizations`, `locations`). Data types are inferred from metadata and by data sampling.

+ Default document key is *metadata_storage_path* (selected because the field contains unique values).

+ Default attributes are **Retrievable** and **Searchable**. **Searchable** allows full text search a field. **Retrievable** means field values can be returned in results. The wizard assumes you want these fields to be retrievable and searchable because you created them via a skillset.

  ![Index fields](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/index-fields.png)

Notice the strikethrough and question mark on the **Retrievable** attribute by the `content` field. For text-heavy blob documents, the `content` field contains the bulk of the file, potentially running into thousands of lines. 
A field like this is unwieldy in search results and you should exclude it for this demo. 

However, if you need to pass file contents to client code, make sure that **Retrievable** stays selected. Otherwise, consider clearing this attribute on `content` if the extracted elements (such as `people`, `organizations`, `locations`, and so forth) are sufficient.

Marking a field as **Retrievable** does not mean that the field *must* be present in the search results. You can precisely control search results composition by using the **$select** query parameter to specify which fields to include. For text-heavy fields like `content`, the **$select** parameter is your solution for providing manageable search results to the human users of your application, while ensuring client code has access to all the information it needs via the **Retrievable** attribute.
  
Continue to the next page.

### Step 4 - Configure the indexer

The indexer is a high-level resource that drives the indexing process. It specifies the data source name, a target index, and frequency of execution. The **Import data** wizard creates several objects, and of them is always an indexer that you can run repeatedly.

1. In the **Indexer** page, you can accept the default name and click the **Once** schedule option to run it immediately. 

   ![Indexer definition](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/indexer-def.png)

1. Click **Submit** to create and simultaneously run the indexer.

## Monitor status

Cognitive skills indexing takes longer to complete than typical text-based indexing, especially OCR and image analysis. To monitor progress, go to the Overview page and click **Indexers** in the middle of page.

  ![Azure Cognitive Search notification](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/indexer-notification.png)

Warnings are normal given the wide range of content types. Some content types aren't valid for certain skills and on lower tiers it's common to encounter [indexer limits](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#indexer-limits). For example, truncation notifications of 32,000 characters are an indexer limit on the Free tier. If you ran this demo on a higher tier, many truncation warnings would go away.

To check warnings or errors, click on the Warning status on the Indexers list to open the Execution History page.

On that page, click Warning status again to view the list of warnings similar to the one shown below. 

  ![Indexer warning list](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/indexer-warnings.png)

Details appear when you click a specific status line. This warning says that that merging stopped after reaching a maximum threshold (this particular PDF is large).

  ![Warning details](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/warning-detail.png)

## Query in Search explorer

After an index is created, you can run queries to return results. In the portal, use **Search explorer** for this task. 

1. On the search service dashboard page, click **Search explorer** on the command bar.

1. Select **Change Index** at the top to select the index you created.

1. Enter a search string to query the index, such as `search=Microsoft&$select=people,organizations,locations,imageTags`.

Results are returned as JSON, which can be verbose and hard to read, especially in large documents originating from Azure blobs. Some tips for searching in this tool include the following techniques:

+ Append `$select` to specify which fields to include in results. 
+ Use CTRL-F to search within the JSON for specific properties or terms.

Query strings are case-sensitive so if you get an "unknown field" message, check **Fields** or **Index Definition (JSON)** to verify name and case.

## Takeaways

You've now created your first skillset and learned important concepts useful for prototyping an enriched search solution using your own data.

Some key concepts that we hope you picked up include the dependency on Azure data sources. A skillset is bound to an indexer, and indexers are Azure and source-specific. Although this quickstart uses Azure Blob storage, other Azure data sources are possible. For more information, see [Indexers in Azure Cognitive Search](search-indexer-overview.md). 

Another important concept is that skills operate over content types, and when working with heterogeneous content, some inputs will be skipped. Also, large files or fields might exceed the indexer limits of your service tier. It's normal to see warnings when these events occur. 

Output is directed to a search index, and there is a mapping between name-value pairs created during indexing and individual fields in your index. Internally, the portal sets up [annotations](cognitive-search-concept-annotations-syntax.md) and defines a [skillset](cognitive-search-defining-skillset.md), establishing the order of operations and general flow. These steps are hidden in the portal, but when you start writing code, these concepts become important.

Finally, you learned that can verify content by querying the index. In the end, what Azure Cognitive Search provides is a searchable index, which you can query using either the [simple](/rest/api/searchservice/simple-query-syntax-in-azure-search) or [fully extended query syntax](/rest/api/searchservice/lucene-query-syntax-in-azure-search). An index containing enriched fields is like any other. If you want to incorporate standard or [custom analyzers](search-analyzers.md), [scoring profiles](/rest/api/searchservice/add-scoring-profiles-to-a-search-index), [synonyms](search-synonyms.md), [faceted filters](search-filters-facets.md), geo-search, or any other Azure Cognitive Search feature, you can certainly do so.

## Clean up resources

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the left-navigation pane.

If you are using a free service, remember that you are limited to three indexes, indexers, and data sources. You can delete individual items in the portal to stay under the limit. 

## Next steps

You can create skillsets using the portal, .NET SDK, or REST API. To further your knowledge, try the REST API using Postman and more sample data.
