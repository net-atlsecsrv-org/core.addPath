# Quickstart: Create an Azure Cognitive Search cognitive skillset in the Azure portal

A skillset is an AI feature that extracts information and structure from large undifferentiated text or image files, and makes it indexable and searchable for full text search queries in Azure Cognitive Search. 

In this quickstart, you'll combine services and data in the Azure cloud to create the skillset. Once everything is in place, you'll run the **Import data** wizard in the portal to pull it all together. The end result is a searchable index populated with data created by AI processing that you can query in the portal ([Search explorer](search-explorer.md)).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create services and load data

This quickstart uses Azure Cognitive Search, Azure Blob storage, and [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/) for the AI. 

Because the workload is so small, Cognitive Services is tapped behind the scenes to provide free processing for up to 20 transactions daily when invoked from Azure Cognitive Search. As long as you use the sample data we provide, you can skip creating or attaching a Cognitive Services resource.

1. [Download sample data](https://1drv.ms/f/s!As7Oy81M_gVPa-LCb5lC_3hbS-4) consisting of a small file set of different types. Unzip the files.

1. [Create an Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal) or [find an existing account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2storageAccounts/). 

   Choose the same region as Azure Cognitive Search. Choose the StorageV2 (general purpose V2) account type if you want to try out the knowledge store feature later, in another walkthrough. Otherwise, choose any type.

1. Open the Blob services pages and create a container. You can use the default public access level. 

1. In container, click **Upload** to upload the sample files you downloaded in the first step. Notice that you have a wide range of content types, including images and application files that are not full text searchable in their native formats.

   ![Source files in Azure blob storage](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/sample-data.png)

1. [Create an Azure Cognitive Search service](search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices). You can use a free service for this quickstart.

<!-- 1. You are almost done with this resource, but before you leave these pages, use a link on the left navigation pane to open the **Access Keys** page. In many tutorials, especially those that use the REST API, you will need a connection string to retrieve data from Blob storage. A connection string looks similar to the following example: `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-ACCOUNT-KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net` -->

You are now ready to move on the Import data wizard.

## Run the Import data wizard

In the search service Overview page, click **Import data** on the command bar to set up cognitive enrichment in four steps.

  ![Import data command](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/import-data-cmd2.png)

### Step 1: Create a data source

1. In **Connect to your data**, choose **Azure Blob storage**, select the Storage account and container you created. Give the data source a name, and use default values for the rest. 

   ![Azure blob configuration](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/blob-datasource.png)

1. Continue to the next page.

### Step 2: Add cognitive skills

Next, add cognitive skills to invoke natural language processing. The sample data consists of 12 files, so the free allotment of 20 transaction on Cognitive Services is sufficient for this quickstart. Because we aren't using OCR, only the non-image files will be counted, cracked, and used in this process.

1. For this quickstart, we are using the **Free** Cognitive Services resource.

   ![Attach Cognitive Services](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/cog-search-attach.png)

1. Expand **Add skills** and select skills that perform natural language processing. For this quickstart, choose entity recognition for people, organizations, and locations.

   ![Attach Cognitive Services](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/skillset.png)

1. Accept the default source field: `content`. This might seem like a small target, but for Azure blobs the `content` field contains most of the blob document (for example, a Word doc or PowerPoint deck), which makes it a good candidate.

1. Continue to the next page.

> [!NOTE]
> Natural language processing skills operate over text content in the sample data set. Since we didn't select the OCR option, the JPEG and PNG files found in the sample data set won't be processed in this quickstart. 

### Step 3: Configure the index

In Azure Cognitive Search, an index contains your searchable content and the **Import data** wizard can usually create the schema for you by sampling the data source. In this step, review the generated schema and potentially revise any settings. Below is the default schema created for the demo Blob data set.

For this quickstart, the wizard does a good job setting reasonable defaults: 

+ Default name is *azureblob-index* based on the data source type. 

+ Default fields are based on the original source data field (`content`), plus the output fields (`people`, `organizations`, and `locations`) created by the cognitive skills. Default data types are inferred from metadata and data sampling.

+ Default document key is *metadata_storage_path* (selected because the field contains unique values).

+ Default attributes are **Retrievable** and **Searchable** for these fields. **Searchable** indicates a field can be searched. **Retrievable** means it can be returned in results. The wizard assumes you want these fields to be retrievable and searchable because you created them via a skillset.

  ![Index fields](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/index-fields.png)

Notice the strikethrough and question mark on the **Retrievable** attribute by the `content` field. For text-heavy blob documents, the `content` field contains the bulk of the file, potentially running into thousands of lines. If you need to pass file contents to client code, make sure that **Retrievable** stays selected. Otherwise, consider clearing this attribute on `content` if the extracted elements (`people`, `organizations`, and `locations`) are sufficient for your purposes.

Marking a field as **Retrievable** does not mean that the field *must* be present in the search results. You can precisely control search results composition by using the **$select** query parameter to specify which fields to include. For text-heavy fields like `content`, the **$select** parameter is your solution for providing manageable search results to the human users of your application, while ensuring client code has access to all the information it needs via the **Retrievable** attribute.
  
Continue to the next page.

### Step 4: Configure the indexer

The indexer is a high-level resource that drives the indexing process. It specifies the data source name, a target index, and frequency of execution. The **Import data** wizard creates several objects, and of them is always an indexer that you can run repeatedly.

1. In the **Indexer** page, you can accept the default name and click the **Once** schedule option to run it immediately. 

   ![Indexer definition](media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/indexer-def.png)

1. Click **Submit** to create and simultaneously run the indexer.

## Monitor status

Cognitive skills indexing takes longer to complete than typical text-based indexing. To monitor progress, go to the Overview page and click **Indexers** in the middle of page.

The warning occurs because JPG and PNG image files are in the data source, and we omitted the OCR skill from this pipeline. You'll also find truncation notifications. Extraction is limited to 32,000 characters on the Free tier.

  ![Azure Cognitive Search notification](./media/cognitive-search-quickstart-blob/indexer-notification.png)

Indexing and enrichment can take time, which is why smaller data sets are recommended for early exploration. 

In the Azure portal, you can also monitor the Notifications activity log for a clickable **Azure Cognitive Search notification** status link. Execution may take several minutes to complete.

## Query in Search explorer

After an index is created, you can submit queries to return documents from the index. In the portal, use **Search explorer** to run queries and view results. 

1. On the search service dashboard page, click **Search explorer** on the command bar.

1. Select **Change Index** at the top to select the index you created.

1. Enter a search string to query the index, such as `search=Microsoft&searchFields=Organizations`.

Results are returned in JSON, which can be verbose and hard to read, especially in large documents originating from Azure blobs. If you can't scan results easily, use CTRL-F to search within documents. For this query, you could search within the JSON for specific terms. 

CTRL-F can also help you determine how many documents are in a given result set. For Azure blobs, the portal chooses "metadata_storage_path" as the key because each value is unique to the document. Using CTRL-F, search for "metadata_storage_path" to get a count of documents.

## Takeaways

You've now created your first skillset and learned important concepts useful for prototyping an enriched search solution using your own data.

Some key concepts that we hope you picked up include the dependency on Azure data sources. A skillset is bound to an indexer, and indexers are Azure and source-specific. Although this quickstart uses Azure Blob storage, other Azure data sources are possible. For more information, see [Indexers in Azure Cognitive Search](search-indexer-overview.md).

Another important concept is that skills operate over input fields. In the portal, you have to choose a single source field for all the skills. In code, inputs can be other fields, or the output of an upstream skill.

Output is directed to a search index, and there is a mapping between name-value pairs created during indexing and individual fields in your index. Internally, the portal sets up [annotations](cognitive-search-concept-annotations-syntax.md) and defines a [skillset](cognitive-search-defining-skillset.md), establishing the order of operations and general flow. These steps are hidden in the portal, but when you start writing code, these concepts become important.

Finally, you learned that can verify content by querying the index. In the end, what Azure Cognitive Search provides is a searchable index, which you can query using either the [simple](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/simple-query-syntax-in-azure-search) or [fully extended query syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/lucene-query-syntax-in-azure-search). An index containing enriched fields is like any other. If you want to incorporate standard or [custom analyzers](search-analyzers.md), [scoring profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/add-scoring-profiles-to-a-search-index), [synonyms](search-synonyms.md), [faceted filters](search-filters-facets.md), geo-search, or any other Azure Cognitive Search feature, you can certainly do so.

## Clean up resources

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the **All resources** or **Resource groups** link in the left-navigation pane.

If you are using a free service, remember that you are limited to three indexes, indexers, and data sources. You can delete individual items in the portal to stay under the limit. 

> [!Tip]
> If you want to repeat this exercise or try a different AI enrichment walkthrough, delete the indexer in the portal. Deleting the indexer resets the free daily transaction counter back to zero for Cognitive Services processing.

## Next steps

You can create skillsets using the portal, .NET SDK, or REST API. To further your knowledge, try the REST API using Postman and more sample data.
