# API versions in Azure Cognitive Search

Azure Cognitive Search rolls out feature updates regularly. Sometimes, but not always, these updates require a new version of the API to preserve backward compatibility. Publishing a new version allows you to control when and how you integrate search service updates in your code.

As a rule, the Azure Cognitive Search team publishes new versions only when necessary, since it can involve some effort to upgrade your code to use a new API version. A new version is needed only if some aspect of the API has changed in a way that breaks backward compatibility. Such changes can happen because of fixes to existing features, or because of new features that change existing API surface area.

The same rule applies for SDK updates. The Azure Cognitive Search SDK follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules, which means that its version has three parts: major, minor, and build number (for example, 1.1.0). A new major version of the SDK is released only for changes that break backward compatibility. Non-breaking feature updates will increment the minor version, and bug fixes will only increase the build version.

> [!Important]
> The Azure SDKs for .NET, Java, Python and JavaScript are rolling out new client libraries for Azure Cognitive Search. Currently, none of the Azure SDK libraries fully support the most recent Search REST APIs (2020-06-30) or Management REST APIs (2020-03-13) but this will change over time. You can periodically check this page or the [What's New](whats-new.md) for announcements on functional enhancements.

## Unsupported versions

Upgrade existing search solutions to the latest version of the REST API by October 15, 2020. At that time, the following versions of the Azure Cognitive Search REST API will be retired and no longer supported:

+ **2015-02-28**
+ **2015-02-28-Preview**
+ **2014-07-31-Preview**
+ **2014-10-20-Preview**

In addition, versions of the Azure Cognitive Search .NET SDK older than [**3.0.0-rc**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Search/3.0.0-rc) will also be retired since they target one of these REST API versions. 

After this date, applications that use any of the deprecated REST API or SDK versions will no longer work and must be upgraded. As with any change of this type, we are giving 12 months' notice, so you have adequate time to adjust.

To continue using Azure Cognitive Search, please migrate existing code that targets the [REST API](search-api-migration.md) to [REST API version 2020-06-30](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/) or to a newer SDK by October 15, 2020.  If you have any questions about updating to the latest version, please send mail to azuresearch_contact@microsoft.com by May 15, 2020 to ensure you have enough time to update your code.

## REST APIs

An Azure Cognitive Search service instance supports several REST API versions, including the latest one. You can continue to use a version when it is no longer the latest one, but we recommend that you [migrate your code](search-api-migration.md) to use the newest version. When using the REST API, you must specify the API version in every request via the api-version parameter. When using the .NET SDK, the version of the SDK you're using determines the corresponding version of the REST API. If you are using an older SDK, you can continue to run that code with no changes even if the service is upgraded to support a newer API version.

The following table provides the version history of current and previously released versions of the Search Service REST API. Documentation is published only for the most recent stable and preview versions.
