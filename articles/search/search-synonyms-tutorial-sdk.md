# Example: Add synonyms for Azure Cognitive Search in C#

Synonyms expand a query by matching on terms considered semantically equivalent to the input term. For example, you might want "car" to match documents containing the terms "automobile" or "vehicle". 

In Azure Cognitive Search, synonyms are defined in a *synonym map*, through *mapping rules* that associate equivalent terms. This example covers essential steps for adding and using synonyms with an existing index. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a synonym map using the  [SynonymMap](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.models.synonymmap?view=azure-dotnet) class. 
> * Set the [SynonymMaps](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.models.field.synonymmaps?view=azure-dotnet) property on fields that should support query expansion via synonyms.

You can query a synonym-enabled field as you would normally. There is no additional query syntax required to access synonyms.

You can create multiple synonym maps, post them as a service-wide resource available to any index, and then reference which one to use at the field level. At query time, in addition to searching an index, Azure Cognitive Search does a lookup in a synonym map, if one is specified on fields used in the query.

> [!NOTE]
> Synonyms can be created programmatically, but not in the portal. If Azure portal support for synonyms would be useful to you, please provide your feedback on the [UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search)

## Prerequisites

Tutorial requirements include the following:

* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* [Azure Cognitive Search service](search-create-service-portal.md)
* [Microsoft.Azure.Search .NET library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search)
* [How to use Azure Cognitive Search from a .NET Application](./search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md)

## Overview

Before-and-after queries demonstrate the value of synonyms. In this example, use a sample application that executes queries and returns results on a sample index. The sample application creates a small index named "hotels" populated with two documents. The application executes search queries using terms and phrases that do not appear in the index, enables the synonyms feature, then issues the same searches again. The code below demonstrates the overall flow.

```csharp
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
      SearchServiceClient serviceClient = CreateSearchServiceClient();

      Console.WriteLine("{0}", "Cleaning up resources...\n");
      CleanupResources(serviceClient);

      Console.WriteLine("{0}", "Creating index...\n");
      CreateHotelsIndex(serviceClient);

      ISearchIndexClient indexClient = serviceClient.Indexes.GetClient("hotels");

      Console.WriteLine("{0}", "Uploading documents...\n");
      UploadDocuments(indexClient);

      ISearchIndexClient indexClientForQueries = CreateSearchIndexClient();

      RunQueriesWithNonExistentTermsInIndex(indexClientForQueries);

      Console.WriteLine("{0}", "Adding synonyms...\n");
      UploadSynonyms(serviceClient);
      EnableSynonymsInHotelsIndex(serviceClient);
      Thread.Sleep(10000); // Wait for the changes to propagate

      RunQueriesWithNonExistentTermsInIndex(indexClientForQueries);

      Console.WriteLine("{0}", "Complete.  Press any key to end application...\n");

      Console.ReadKey();
  }
```
The steps to create and populate the sample index are explained in [How to use Azure Cognitive Search from a .NET Application](./search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md).

## "Before" queries

In `RunQueriesWithNonExistentTermsInIndex`, issue search queries with "five star", "internet", and "economy AND hotel".
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Search the entire index for the phrase \"five star\":\n");
results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("\"five star\"", parameters);
WriteDocuments(results);

Console.WriteLine("Search the entire index for the term 'internet':\n");
results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("internet", parameters);
WriteDocuments(results);

Console.WriteLine("Search the entire index for the terms 'economy' AND 'hotel':\n");
results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("economy AND hotel", parameters);
WriteDocuments(results);
```
Neither of the two indexed documents contain the terms, so we get the following output from the first `RunQueriesWithNonExistentTermsInIndex`.
~~~
Search the entire index for the phrase "five star":

no document matched

Search the entire index for the term 'internet':

no document matched

Search the entire index for the terms 'economy' AND 'hotel':

no document matched
~~~

## Enable synonyms

Enabling synonyms is a two-step process. We first define and upload synonym rules and then configure fields to use them. The process is outlined in `UploadSynonyms` and `EnableSynonymsInHotelsIndex`.

1. Add a synonym map to your search service. In `UploadSynonyms`, we define four rules in our synonym map 'desc-synonymmap' and upload to the service.
   ```csharp
    var synonymMap = new SynonymMap()
    {
        Name = "desc-synonymmap",
        Format = "solr",
        Synonyms = "hotel, motel\n
                    internet,wifi\n
                    five star=>luxury\n
                    economy,inexpensive=>budget"
    };

    serviceClient.SynonymMaps.CreateOrUpdate(synonymMap);
   ```
   A synonym map must conform to the open source standard `solr` format. The format is explained in [Synonyms in Azure Cognitive Search](search-synonyms.md) under the section `Apache Solr synonym format`.

2. Configure searchable fields to use the synonym map in the index definition. In `EnableSynonymsInHotelsIndex`, we enable synonyms on two fields `category` and `tags` by setting the `synonymMaps` property to the name of the newly uploaded synonym map.
   ```csharp
   Index index = serviceClient.Indexes.Get("hotels");
   index.Fields.First(f => f.Name == "category").SynonymMaps = new[] { "desc-synonymmap" };
   index.Fields.First(f => f.Name == "tags").SynonymMaps = new[] { "desc-synonymmap" };

   serviceClient.Indexes.CreateOrUpdate(index);
   ```
   When you add a synonym map, index rebuilds are not required. You can add a synonym map to your service, and then amend existing field definitions in any index to use the new synonym map. The addition of new attributes has no impact on index availability. The same applies in disabling synonyms for a field. You can simply set the `synonymMaps` property to an empty list.
   ```csharp
   index.Fields.First(f => f.Name == "category").SynonymMaps = new List<string>();
   ```

## "After" queries

After the synonym map is uploaded and the index is updated to use the synonym map, the second `RunQueriesWithNonExistentTermsInIndex` call outputs the following:

~~~
Search the entire index for the phrase "five star":

Name: Fancy Stay        Category: Luxury        Tags: [pool, view, wifi, concierge]

Search the entire index for the term 'internet':

Name: Fancy Stay        Category: Luxury        Tags: [pool, view, wifi, concierge]

Search the entire index for the terms 'economy' AND 'hotel':

Name: Roach Motel       Category: Budget        Tags: [motel, budget]
~~~
The first query finds the document from the rule `five star=>luxury`. The second query expands the search using `internet,wifi` and the third using both `hotel, motel` and `economy,inexpensive=>budget` in finding the documents they matched.

Adding synonyms completely changes the search experience. In this example, the original queries failed to return meaningful results even though the documents in our index were relevant. By enabling synonyms, we can expand an index to include terms in common use, with no changes to underlying data in the index.

## Sample application source code
You can find the full source code of the sample application used in this walk through on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowToSynonyms).

## Clean up resources

The fastest way to clean up after an example is by deleting the resource group containing the Azure Cognitive Search service. You can delete the resource group now to permanently delete everything in it. In the portal, the resource group name is on the Overview page of Azure Cognitive Search service.

## Next steps

This example demonstrated the synonyms feature in C# code to create and post mapping rules and then call the synonym map on a query. Additional information can be found in the [.NET SDK](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search) and [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/) reference documentation.
