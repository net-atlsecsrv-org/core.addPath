# How to index Cosmos DB data using an indexer in Azure Cognitive Search 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> SQL API is generally available.
> MongoDB API, Gremlin API, and Cassandra API support are currently in public preview. Preview functionality is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 
> You can request access to the previews by filling out [this form](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/indexer-preview). 
> [REST API preview versions](search-api-preview.md) provide these features. There is currently limited portal support, and no .NET SDK support.

> [!WARNING]
> Only Cosmos DB collections with an [indexing policy](/azure/cosmos-db/index-policy) set to [Consistent](/azure/cosmos-db/index-policy#indexing-mode) are supported by Azure Cognitive Search. Indexing collections with a Lazy indexing policy is not recommended and may result in missing data. Collections with indexing disabled are not supported.

This article shows you how to configure an Azure Cosmos DB [indexer](search-indexer-overview.md) to extract content and make it searchable in Azure Cognitive Search. This workflow creates an Azure Cognitive Search index and loads it with existing text extracted from Azure Cosmos DB. 

Because terminology can be confusing, it's worth noting that [Azure Cosmos DB indexing](/azure/cosmos-db/index-overview) and [Azure Cognitive Search indexing](search-what-is-an-index.md) are distinct operations, unique to each service. Before you start Azure Cognitive Search indexing, your Azure Cosmos DB database must already exist and contain data.

The Cosmos DB indexer in Azure Cognitive Search can crawl [Azure Cosmos DB items](../cosmos-db/databases-containers-items.md#azure-cosmos-items) accessed through different protocols. 

+ For [SQL API](../cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started.md), which is generally available, you can use the [portal](#cosmos-indexer-portal), [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexer-operations), or [.NET SDK](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexer) to create the data source and indexer.

+ For [MongoDB API (preview)](../cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction.md), you can use either the [portal](#cosmos-indexer-portal) or the [REST API version 2020-06-30-Preview](search-api-preview.md) to create the data source and indexer.

+ For [Cassandra API (preview)](../cosmos-db/cassandra-introduction.md) and [Gremlin API (preview)](../cosmos-db/graph-introduction.md), you can only use the [REST API version 2020-06-30-Preview](search-api-preview.md) to create the data source and indexer.

## Use the portal

> [!Note]
> The portal currently supports the SQL API and MongoDB API (preview).

The easiest method for indexing Azure Cosmos DB items is to use a wizard in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). By sampling data and reading metadata on the container, the [**Import data**](search-import-data-portal.md) wizard in Azure Cognitive Search can create a default index, map source fields to target index fields, and load the index in a single operation. Depending on the size and complexity of source data, you could have an operational full text search index in minutes.

We recommend using the same region or location for both Azure Cognitive Search and Azure Cosmos DB for lower latency and to avoid bandwidth charges.

### 1 - Prepare source data

You should have a Cosmos DB account, an Azure Cosmos DB database mapped to the SQL API, MongoDB API (preview), or Gremlin API (preview), and content in the database.

Make sure your Cosmos DB database contains data. The [Import data wizard](search-import-data-portal.md) reads metadata and performs data sampling to infer an index schema, but it also loads data from Cosmos DB. If the data is missing, the wizard stops with this error "Error detecting index schema from data source: Could not build a prototype index because datasource 'emptycollection' returned no data".

### 2 - Start Import data wizard

You can [start the wizard](search-import-data-portal.md) from the command bar in the Azure Cognitive Search service page, or if you're connecting to Cosmos DB SQL API you can click **Add Azure Cognitive Search** in the **Settings** section of your Cosmos DB account's left navigation pane.

   ![Import data command in portal](./media/search-import-data-portal/import-data-cmd2.png "Start the Import data wizard")

### 3 - Set the data source

In the **data source** page, the source must be **Cosmos DB**, with the following specifications:

+ **Name** is the name of the data source object. Once created, you can choose it for other workloads.

+ **Cosmos DB account** should be in one of the following formats:
    1. The primary or secondary connection string from Cosmos DB with the following format: `AccountEndpoint=https://<Cosmos DB account name>.documents.azure.com;AccountKey=<Cosmos DB auth key>;`.
        + For version 3.2 and version 3.6 **MongoDB collections** use the following format for the Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal: `AccountEndpoint=https://<Cosmos DB account name>.documents.azure.com;AccountKey=<Cosmos DB auth key>;ApiKind=MongoDb`
        + For **Gremlin graphs and Cassandra tables**, sign up for the [gated indexer preview](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/indexer-preview) to get access to the preview and information about how to format the credentials.
    1.  A managed identity connection string with the following format that does not include an account key: `ResourceId=/subscriptions/<your subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<your resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/<your cosmos db account name>/;(ApiKind=[api-kind];)`. To use this connection string format, follow the instructions for [Setting up an indexer connection to a Cosmos DB database using a managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-cosmos-db.md).

+ **Database** is an existing database from the account. 

+ **Collection** is a container of documents. Documents must exist in order for import to succeed. 

+ **Query** can be blank if you want all documents, otherwise you can input a query that selects a document subset. **Query** is only available for the SQL API.

   ![Cosmos DB data source definition](media/search-howto-index-cosmosdb/cosmosdb-datasource.png "Cosmos DB data source definition")

### 4 - Skip the "Enrich content" page in the wizard

Adding cognitive skills (or enrichment) is not an import requirement. Unless you have a specific need to [add AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md) to your indexing pipeline, you should skip this step.

To skip the step, click the blue buttons at the bottom of the page for "Next" and "Skip".

### 5 - Set index attributes

In the **Index** page, you should see a list of fields with a data type and a series of checkboxes for setting index attributes. The wizard can generate a fields list based on metadata and by sampling the source data. 

You can bulk-select attributes by clicking the checkbox at the top of an attribute column. Choose **Retrievable** and **Searchable** for every field that should be returned to a client app and subject to full text search processing. You'll notice that integers are not full text or fuzzy searchable (numbers are evaluated verbatim and are often useful in filters).

Review the description of [index attributes](/rest/api/searchservice/create-index#bkmk_indexAttrib) and [language analyzers](/rest/api/searchservice/language-support) for more information. 

Take a moment to review your selections. Once you run the wizard, physical data structures are created and you won't be able to edit these fields without dropping and recreating all objects.

   ![Cosmos DB index definition](media/search-howto-index-cosmosdb/cosmosdb-index-schema.png "Cosmos DB index definition")

### 6 - Create indexer

Fully specified, the wizard creates three distinct objects in your search service. A data source object and index object are saved as named resources in your Azure Cognitive Search service. The last step creates an indexer object. Naming the indexer allows it to exist as a standalone resource, which you can schedule and manage independently of the index and data source object, created in the same wizard sequence.

If you are not familiar with indexers, an *indexer* is a resource in Azure Cognitive Search that crawls an external data source for searchable content. The output of the **Import data** wizard is an indexer that crawls your Cosmos DB data source, extracts searchable content, and imports it into an index on Azure Cognitive Search.

The following screenshot shows the default indexer configuration. You can switch to **Once** if you want to run the indexer one time. Click **Submit** to run the wizard and create all objects. Indexing commences immediately.

   ![Cosmos DB indexer definition](media/search-howto-index-cosmosdb/cosmosdb-indexer.png "Cosmos DB indexer definition")

You can monitor data import in the portal pages. Progress notifications indicate indexing status and how many documents are uploaded. 

When indexing is complete, you can use [Search explorer](search-explorer.md) to query your index.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see the data you expect, you might need to set more attributes on more fields. Delete the index and indexer you just created, and step through the wizard again, modifying your selections for index attributes in step 5.

## Use REST APIs

You can use the REST API to index Azure Cosmos DB data, following a three-part workflow common to all indexers in Azure Cognitive Search: create a data source, create an index, create an indexer. Data extraction from Cosmos DB occurs when you submit the Create Indexer request. After this request is finished, you will have a queryable index. 

> [!NOTE]
> For indexing data from Cosmos DB Gremlin API or Cosmos DB Cassandra API you must first request access to the gated previews by filling out [this form](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/indexer-preview). Once your request is processed, you will receive instructions for how to use the [REST API version 2020-06-30-Preview](search-api-preview.md) to create the data source.

Earlier in this article it is mentioned that [Azure Cosmos DB indexing](/azure/cosmos-db/index-overview) and [Azure Cognitive Search indexing](search-what-is-an-index.md) indexing are distinct operations. For Cosmos DB indexing, by default all documents are automatically indexed except with the Cassandra API. If you turn off automatic indexing, documents can be accessed only through their self-links or by queries by using the document ID. Azure Cognitive Search indexing requires Cosmos DB automatic indexing to be turned on in the collection that will be indexed by Azure Cognitive Search. When signing up for the Cosmos DB Cassandra API indexer preview, you'll be given instructions on how set up Cosmos DB indexing.

> [!WARNING]
> Azure Cosmos DB is the next generation of DocumentDB. Previously with API version **2017-11-11** you could use the `documentdb` syntax. This meant that you could specify your data source type as `cosmosdb` or `documentdb`. Starting with API version **2019-05-06** both the Azure Cognitive Search APIs and Portal only support the `cosmosdb` syntax as instructed in this article. This means that the data source type must `cosmosdb` if you would like to connect to a Cosmos DB endpoint.

### 1 - Assemble inputs for the request

For each request, you must provide the service name and admin key for Azure Cognitive Search (in the POST header), and the storage account name and key for blob storage. You can use [Postman or Visual Studio Code](search-get-started-rest.md) to send HTTP requests to Azure Cognitive Search.

Copy the following four values into Notepad so that you can paste them into a request:

+ Azure Cognitive Search service name
+ Azure Cognitive Search admin key
+ Cosmos DB connection string

You can find these values in the portal:

1. In the portal pages for Azure Cognitive Search, copy the search service URL from the Overview page.

2. In the left navigation pane, click **Keys** and then copy either the primary or secondary key (they are equivalent).

3. Switch to the portal pages for your Cosmos storage account. In the left navigation pane, under **Settings**, click **Keys**. This page provides a URI, two sets of connection strings, and two sets of keys. Copy one of the connection strings to Notepad.

### 2 - Create a data source

A **data source** specifies the data to index, credentials, and policies for identifying changes in the data (such as modified or deleted documents inside your collection). The data source is defined as an independent resource so that it can be used by multiple indexers.

To create a data source, formulate a POST request:

```http

    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=2020-06-30
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: [Search service admin key]

	{
        "name": "mycosmosdbdatasource",
        "type": "cosmosdb",
        "credentials": {
            "connectionString": "AccountEndpoint=https://myCosmosDbEndpoint.documents.azure.com;AccountKey=myCosmosDbAuthKey;Database=myCosmosDbDatabaseId"
        },
        "container": { "name": "myCollection", "query": null },
        "dataChangeDetectionPolicy": {
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.HighWaterMarkChangeDetectionPolicy",
            "highWaterMarkColumnName": "_ts"
        }
    }
```

The body of the request contains the data source definition, which should include the following fields:

| Field   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **name** | Required. Choose any name to represent your data source object. |
|**type**| Required. Must be `cosmosdb`. |
|**credentials** | Required. Must either follow the Cosmos DB connection string format or a managed identity connection string format.<br/><br/>For **SQL collections**, connection strings can follow either of the below formats: <li>`AccountEndpoint=https://<Cosmos DB account name>.documents.azure.com;AccountKey=<Cosmos DB auth key>;Database=<Cosmos DB database id>`<li>A managed identity connection string with the following format that does not include an account key: `ResourceId=/subscriptions/<your subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<your resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/<your cosmos db account name>/;`. To use this connection string format, follow the instructions for [Setting up an indexer connection to a Cosmos DB database using a managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-cosmos-db.md).<br/><br/>For version 3.2 and version 3.6 **MongoDB collections** use either of the following formats for the connection string: <li>`AccountEndpoint=https://<Cosmos DB account name>.documents.azure.com;AccountKey=<Cosmos DB auth key>;Database=<Cosmos DB database id>;ApiKind=MongoDb`<li>A managed identity connection string with the following format that does not include an account key: `ResourceId=/subscriptions/<your subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<your resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/<your cosmos db account name>/;ApiKind=MongoDb;`. To use this connection string format, follow the instructions for [Setting up an indexer connection to a Cosmos DB database using a managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-cosmos-db.md).<br/><br/>For **Gremlin graphs and Cassandra tables**, sign up for the [gated indexer preview](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/indexer-preview) to get access to the preview and information about how to format the credentials.<br/><br/>Avoid port numbers in the endpoint url. If you include the port number, Azure Cognitive Search will be unable to index your Azure Cosmos DB database.|
| **container** | Contains the following elements: <br/>**name**: Required. Specify the ID of the database collection to be indexed.<br/>**query**: Optional. You can specify a query to flatten an arbitrary JSON document into a flat schema that Azure Cognitive Search can index.<br/>For the MongoDB API, Gremlin API, and Cassandra API, queries are not supported. |
| **dataChangeDetectionPolicy** | Recommended. See [Indexing Changed Documents](#DataChangeDetectionPolicy) section.|
|**dataDeletionDetectionPolicy** | Optional. See [Indexing Deleted Documents](#DataDeletionDetectionPolicy) section.|

### Using queries to shape indexed data
You can specify a SQL query to flatten nested properties or arrays, project JSON properties, and filter the data to be indexed. 

> [!WARNING]
> Custom queries are not supported for **MongoDB API**, **Gremlin API**, and **Cassandra API**: `container.query` parameter must be set to null or omitted. If you need to use a custom query, please let us know on [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search).

Example document:

```http
    {
        "userId": 10001,
        "contact": {
            "firstName": "andy",
            "lastName": "hoh"
        },
        "company": "microsoft",
        "tags": ["azure", "cosmosdb", "search"]
    }
```

Filter query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.company = "microsoft" and c._ts >= @HighWaterMark ORDER BY c._ts
```

Flattening query:

```sql
SELECT c.id, c.userId, c.contact.firstName, c.contact.lastName, c.company, c._ts FROM c WHERE c._ts >= @HighWaterMark ORDER BY c._ts
```

Projection query:

```sql
SELECT VALUE { "id":c.id, "Name":c.contact.firstName, "Company":c.company, "_ts":c._ts } FROM c WHERE c._ts >= @HighWaterMark ORDER BY c._ts
```

Array flattening query:

```sql
SELECT c.id, c.userId, tag, c._ts FROM c JOIN tag IN c.tags WHERE c._ts >= @HighWaterMark ORDER BY c._ts
```

### 3 - Create a target search index 

[Create a target Azure Cognitive Search index](/rest/api/searchservice/create-index) if you don’t have one already. The following example creates an index with an ID and description field:

```http
    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes?api-version=2020-06-30
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: [Search service admin key]

	{
       "name": "mysearchindex",
       "fields": [{
         "name": "id",
         "type": "Edm.String",
         "key": true,
         "searchable": false
       }, {
         "name": "description",
         "type": "Edm.String",
         "filterable": false,
         "sortable": false,
         "facetable": false,
         "suggestions": true
       }]
     }
```

Ensure that the schema of your target index is compatible with the schema of the source JSON documents or the output of your custom query projection.

> [!NOTE]
> For partitioned collections, the default document key is Azure Cosmos DB's `_rid` property, which Azure Cognitive Search automatically renames to `rid` because field names cannot start with an underscore character. Also, Azure Cosmos DB `_rid` values contain characters that are invalid in Azure Cognitive Search keys. For this reason, the `_rid` values are Base64 encoded.
> 
> For MongoDB collections, Azure Cognitive Search automatically renames the `_id` property to `id`.  

### Mapping between JSON Data Types and Azure Cognitive Search Data Types
| JSON data type | Compatible target index field types |
| --- | --- |
| Bool |Edm.Boolean, Edm.String |
| Numbers that look like integers |Edm.Int32, Edm.Int64, Edm.String |
| Numbers that look like floating-points |Edm.Double, Edm.String |
| String |Edm.String |
| Arrays of primitive types, for example ["a", "b", "c"] |Collection(Edm.String) |
| Strings that look like dates |Edm.DateTimeOffset, Edm.String |
| GeoJSON objects, for example { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [long, lat] } |Edm.GeographyPoint |
| Other JSON objects |N/A |

### 4 - Configure and run the indexer

Once the index and data source have been created, you're ready to create the indexer:

```http
    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers?api-version=2020-06-30
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: [admin key]

    {
      "name" : "mycosmosdbindexer",
      "dataSourceName" : "mycosmosdbdatasource",
      "targetIndexName" : "mysearchindex",
      "schedule" : { "interval" : "PT2H" }
    }
```

This indexer runs every two hours (schedule interval is set to "PT2H"). To run an indexer every 30 minutes, set the interval to "PT30M". The shortest supported interval is 5 minutes. The schedule is optional - if omitted, an indexer runs only once when it's created. However, you can run an indexer on-demand at any time.   

For more details on the Create Indexer API, check out [Create Indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/create-indexer).

For more information about defining indexer schedules, see [How to schedule indexers for Azure Cognitive Search](search-howto-schedule-indexers.md).

## Use .NET

The generally available .NET SDK has full parity with the generally available REST API. We recommend that you review the previous REST API section to learn concepts, workflow, and requirements. You can then refer to following .NET API reference documentation to implement a JSON indexer in managed code.

+ [azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexerdatasourceconnection](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexerdatasourceconnection)
+ [azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexerdatasourcetype](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexerdatasourcetype)
+ [azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindex](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindex)
+ [azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexer](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexer)

<a name="DataChangeDetectionPolicy"></a>

## Indexing changed documents

The purpose of a data change detection policy is to efficiently identify changed data items. Currently, the only supported policy is the [`HighWaterMarkChangeDetectionPolicy`](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.highwatermarkchangedetectionpolicy) using the `_ts` (timestamp) property provided by Azure Cosmos DB, which is specified as follows:

```http
    {
        "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.HighWaterMarkChangeDetectionPolicy",
        "highWaterMarkColumnName" : "_ts"
    }
```

Using this policy is highly recommended to ensure good indexer performance. 

If you are using a custom query, make sure that the `_ts` property is projected by the query.

<a name="IncrementalProgress"></a>

### Incremental progress and custom queries

Incremental progress during indexing ensures that if indexer execution is interrupted by transient failures or execution time limit, the indexer can pick up where it left off next time it runs, instead of having to reindex the entire collection from scratch. This is especially important when indexing large collections. 

To enable incremental progress when using a custom query, ensure that your query orders the results by the `_ts` column. This enables periodic check-pointing that Azure Cognitive Search uses to provide incremental progress in the presence of failures.   

In some cases, even if your query contains an `ORDER BY [collection alias]._ts` clause, Azure Cognitive Search may not infer that the query is ordered by the `_ts`. You can tell Azure Cognitive Search that results are ordered by using the `assumeOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn` configuration property. To specify this hint, create or update your indexer as follows: 

```http
	{
     ... other indexer definition properties
     "parameters" : {
            "configuration" : { "assumeOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn" : true } }
    } 
```

<a name="DataDeletionDetectionPolicy"></a>

## Indexing deleted documents

When rows are deleted from the collection, you normally want to delete those rows from the search index as well. The purpose of a data deletion detection policy is to efficiently identify deleted data items. Currently, the only supported policy is the `Soft Delete` policy (deletion is marked with a flag of some sort), which is specified as follows:

```http
    {
        "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy",
        "softDeleteColumnName" : "the property that specifies whether a document was deleted",
        "softDeleteMarkerValue" : "the value that identifies a document as deleted"
    }
```

If you are using a custom query, make sure that the property referenced by `softDeleteColumnName` is projected by the query.

The following example creates a data source with a soft-deletion policy:

```http
	POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=2020-06-30
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: [Search service admin key]

    {
        "name": "mycosmosdbdatasource",
        "type": "cosmosdb",
        "credentials": {
            "connectionString": "AccountEndpoint=https://myCosmosDbEndpoint.documents.azure.com;AccountKey=myCosmosDbAuthKey;Database=myCosmosDbDatabaseId"
        },
        "container": { "name": "myCosmosDbCollectionId" },
        "dataChangeDetectionPolicy": {
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.HighWaterMarkChangeDetectionPolicy",
            "highWaterMarkColumnName": "_ts"
        },
        "dataDeletionDetectionPolicy": {
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy",
            "softDeleteColumnName": "isDeleted",
            "softDeleteMarkerValue": "true"
        }
    }
```
