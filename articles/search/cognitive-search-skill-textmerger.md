#	 Text Merge cognitive skill

The **Text Merge** skill consolidates text from a collection of fields into a single field. 

> [!NOTE]
> This skill is not bound to a Cognitive Services API and you are not charged for using it. You should still [attach a Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md), however, to override the **Free** resource option that limits you to a small number of daily enrichments per day.

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.MergeSkill

## Skill parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| insertPreTag	| String to be included before every insertion. The default value is `" "`. To omit the space, set the value to `""`.  |
| insertPostTag	| String to be included after every insertion. The default value is `" "`. To omit the space, set the value to `""`.  |


##	Sample input
A JSON document providing usable input for this skill could be:

```json
{
  "values": [
    {
      "recordId": "1",
      "data":
      {
        "text": "The brown fox jumps over the dog",
        "itemsToInsert": ["quick", "lazy"],
        "offsets": [3, 28],
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##	Sample output
This example shows the output of the previous input, assuming that the *insertPreTag* is set to `" "`, and *insertPostTag* is set to `""`. 

```json
{
  "values": [
    {
      "recordId": "1",
      "data":
      {
        "mergedText": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extended sample skillset definition

A common scenario for using Text Merge is to merge the textual representation of images (text from an OCR skill, or the caption of an image)  into the content field of a document. 

The following example skillset uses the OCR skill to extract text from images embedded in the document. Next, it creates a *merged_text* field to contain both original and OCRed text from each image. You can learn more about the OCR skill [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-ocr).

```json
{
  "description": "Extract text from images and merge with content text to produce merged_text",
  "skills":
  [
    {
      "description": "Extract text (plain and structured) from image.",
      "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Vision.OcrSkill",
      "context": "/document/normalized_images/*",
      "defaultLanguageCode": "en",
      "detectOrientation": true,
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "image",
          "source": "/document/normalized_images/*"
        }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "text"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.MergeSkill",
      "description": "Create merged_text, which includes all the textual representation of each image inserted at the right location in the content field.",
      "context": "/document",
      "insertPreTag": " ",
      "insertPostTag": " ",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name":"text", "source": "/document/content"
        },
        {
          "name": "itemsToInsert", "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/text"
        },
        {
          "name":"offsets", "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/contentOffset" 
        }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "mergedText", "targetName" : "merged_text"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
The example above assumes that a normalized-images field exists. To get normalized-images field, set the *imageAction* configuration in your indexer definition to *generateNormalizedImages* as shown below:

```json
{
  //...rest of your indexer definition goes here ...
  "parameters":{
    "configuration":{
        "dataToExtract":"contentAndMetadata",
        "imageAction":"generateNormalizedImages"
    }
  }
}
```
