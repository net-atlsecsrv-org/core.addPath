# Create a Private Endpoint for a secure connection to Azure Cognitive Search

In this article, you'll use the Azure portal to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service instance that can't be accessed via the internet. Next, you'll configure an Azure virtual machine in the same virtual network and use it to access the search service via a private endpoint.

Private endpoints are provided by [Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md), as a separate service. For more information about costs, see the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/).

> [!Important]
> Private Endpoint support for Azure Cognitive Search can be configured using the Azure portal or the [Management REST API version 2020-03-13](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchmanagement/). When the service endpoint is private, some portal features are disabled. You'll be able to view and manage service level information, but portal access to index data and the various components in the service, such as the index, indexer, and skillset definitions, is restricted for security reasons.

## Why use a Private Endpoint for secure access?

[Private Endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) for Azure Cognitive Search allow a client on a virtual network to securely access data in a search index over a [Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md). The private endpoint uses an IP address from the [virtual network address space](../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md#private-ip-addresses) for your search service. Network traffic between the client and the search service traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet. For a list of other PaaS services that support Private Link, check the [availability section](../private-link/private-link-overview.md#availability) in the product documentation.

Private endpoints for your search service enables you to:

- Block all connections on the public endpoint for your search service.
- Increase security for the virtual network, by enabling you to block exfiltration of data from the virtual network.
- Securely connect to your search service from on-premises networks that connect to the virtual network using [VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) or [ExpressRoutes](../expressroute/expressroute-locations.md) with private-peering.

## Create the virtual network

In this section, you will create a virtual network and subnet to host the VM that will be used to access your search service's private endpoint.

    | Resource group | Select **Create new**, enter *myResourceGroup*, then select **OK** |
    | Name | Enter *MyVirtualNetwork* |
    | Region | Select your desired region |
    |||

1. Leave the defaults for the rest of the settings. Click **Review + create** and then **Create**

## Create a search service with a private endpoint

## Connect to the VM

Download and then connect to the VM *myVm* as follows:

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *myVm*.

1. Select the **Connect** button. After selecting the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.

1. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp*) file and downloads it to your computer.

1. Open the downloaded.rdp* file.

    1. If prompted, select **Connect**.

    1. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may need to select **More choices** > **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive a certificate warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**.

1. Once the VM desktop appears, minimize it to go back to your local desktop.  


## Test connections

In this section, you will verify private network access to the search service and connect privately to the using the Private Endpoint.

When the search service endpoint is private, some portal features are disabled. You'll be able to view and manage service level settings, but portal access to index data and various other components in the service, such as the index, indexer, and skillset definitions, is restricted for security reasons.

1. In the Remote Desktop of *myVM*, open PowerShell.

1. Enterâ€¯'nslookup [search service name].search.windows.net'

    You'll receive a message similar to this:
    ```azurepowershell
    Server:  UnKnown
    Address:  168.63.129.16
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    [search service name].privatelink.search.windows.net
    Address:  10.0.0.5
    Aliases:  [search service name].search.windows.net
    ```

1. From the VM, connect to the search service and create an index. You can follow this [quickstart](search-get-started-postman.md) to create a new search index in your service in Postman using the REST API. Setting up requests from Postman requires the search service endpoint (https://[search service name].search.windows.net) and the admin api-key you copied in a previous step.

1. Completing the quickstart from the VM is your confirmation that the service is fully operational.

1. Close the remote desktop connection to *myVM*. 

1. To verify that your service is not accessible on a public endpoint, open Postman on your local workstation and attempt the first several tasks in the quickstart. If you receive an error that the remote server does not exist, you have successfully configured a private endpoint for your search service.

## Clean up resources 
When you're done using the Private Endpoint, search service, and the VM, delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains:
1. Enterâ€¯*myResourceGroup*â€¯in the **Search** box at the top of the portal and selectâ€¯*myResourceGroup*â€¯from the search results. 
1. Select **Delete resource group**. 
1. Enterâ€¯*myResourceGroup*â€¯for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and select **Delete**.

## Next steps
In this article, you created a VM on a virtual network and a search service with a Private Endpoint. You connected to the VM from the internet and securely communicated to the search service using Private Link.
