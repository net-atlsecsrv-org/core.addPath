# Add spell check to queries in Cognitive Search

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Spell correction is in public preview, available through the preview REST API only. Preview features are offered as-is, under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). During the initial preview launch, there is no charge for speller. For more information, see [Availability and pricing](semantic-search-overview.md#availability-and-pricing).

You can improve recall by spell-correcting individual search query terms before they reach the search engine. The **speller** parameter is supported for all query types: [simple](query-simple-syntax.md), [full](query-lucene-syntax.md), and the new [semantic](semantic-how-to-query-request.md) option currently in public preview.

## Prerequisites

+ An existing search index, containing English content. Currently, spell correction does not work with [synonyms](search-synonyms.md). Avoid using it on indexes that specify a synonym map in any field definition.

+ A search client for sending queries

  The search client must support preview REST APIs on the query request. You can use [Postman](search-get-started-rest.md), [Visual Studio Code](search-get-started-vs-code.md), or code that you've modified to make REST calls to the preview APIs.

+ [A query request](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/search-documents) that uses spell correction has "api-version=2020-06-30-Preview", "speller=lexicon", and "queryLanguage=en-us".

  The queryLanguage is required for speller, and currently "en-us" is the only valid value.

> [!Note]
> The speller parameter is available on all tiers, in the same regions that provide semantic search. You do not need to sign up for access to this preview feature. For more information, see [Availability and pricing](semantic-search-overview.md#availability-and-pricing).

## Spell correction with simple search

The following example uses the built-in hotels-sample index to demonstrate spell correction on a simple free form text query. Without spell correction, the query returns zero results. With correction, the query returns one result for Johnson's family-oriented resort.

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30-Preview
{
    "search": "famly acitvites",
    "speller": "lexicon",
    "queryLanguage": "en-us",
    "queryType": "simple",
    "select": "HotelId,HotelName,Description,Category,Tags",
    "count": true
}
```

## Spell correction with full Lucene

Spelling correction occurs on individual query terms that undergo analysis, which is why you can use the speller parameter with some Lucene queries, but not others.

+ Incompatible query forms that bypass text analysis include: wildcard, regex, fuzzy
+ Compatible query forms include: fielded search, proximity, term boosting

This example uses fielded search over the Category field, with full Lucene syntax, and a misspelled query term. By including speller, the typo in "Suiite" is corrected and the query succeeds.

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30-Preview
{
    "search": "Category:(Resort and Spa) OR Category:Suiite",
    "queryType": "full",
    "speller": "lexicon",
    "queryLanguage": "en-us",
    "select": "Category",
    "count": true
}
```

## Spell correction with semantic search

This query, with typos in every term except one, undergoes spelling corrections to return relevant results. To learn more, see [Create a semantic query](semantic-how-to-query-request.md).

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-sample-index/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30-Preview     
{
    "search": "hisotoric hotell wiht great restrant nad wiifi",
    "queryType": "semantic",
    "speller": "lexicon",
    "queryLanguage": "en-us",
    "searchFields": "HotelName,Tags,Description",
    "select": "HotelId,HotelName,Description,Category,Tags",
    "count": true
}
```

## Language considerations

The queryLanguage parameter required for speller must be consistent with any [language analyzers](index-add-language-analyzers.md) assigned to field definitions in the index schema. 

+ queryLanguage determines which lexicons are used for spell check, and is also used as an input to the [semantic ranking algorithm](semantic-answers.md) if you are using "queryType=semantic".

+ Language analyzers are used during indexing and query execution to find matching documents in the search index. An example of a field definition that uses a language analyzer is `"name": "Description", "type": "Edm.String", "analyzer": "en.microsoft"`.

For best results when using speller, if queryLanguage is "en-us", then any language analyzers must also be an English variant ("en.microsoft" or "en.lucene").

> [!NOTE]
> Language-agnostic analyzers (such as keyword, simple, standard, stop, whitespace, or `standardasciifolding.lucene`) do not conflict with queryLanguage settings.

In a query request, the queryLanguage you set applies equally to speller, answers, and captions. There is no override for individual parts.

While content in a search index can be composed in multiple languages, the query input is most likely in one. The search engine doesn't check for compatibility of queryLanguage, language analyzer, and the language in which content is composed, so be sure to scope queries accordingly to avoid producing incorrect results.
