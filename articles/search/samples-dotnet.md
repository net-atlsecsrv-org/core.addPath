# .NET (C#) code samples for Azure Cognitive Search

Learn about the C# code samples that demonstrate the functionality and workflow of an Azure Cognitive Search solution. These samples use the [**Azure Cognitive Search client library**](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search) for the [**Azure SDK for .NET**](/dotnet/azure/), which you can explore through the following links.

| Target | Link |
|--------|------|
| Package download | [www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Search.Documents/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Search.Documents/) |
| API reference | [azure.search.documents](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents)  |
| API test cases | [github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/tests](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/tests) |
| Source code | [github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/src](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/src)  |

## SDK samples

Code samples from the Azure SDK development team demonstrate API usage. You can find these samples in [**Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/) on GitHub.

| Samples | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ["Hello world", synchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample01a_HelloWorld.md) | Demonstrates how to create a client, authenticate, and handle errors using synchronous methods.|
| ["Hello world", asynchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample01b_HelloWorldAsync.md) | Demonstrates how to create a client, authenticate, and handle errors using asynchronous methods.  |
| [Service-level operations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample02_Service.md) | Demonstrates how to create indexes, indexers, data sources, skillsets, and synonym maps. This sample also shows you how to get service statistics and how to query an index.  |
| [Index operations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample03_Index.md) | Demonstrates how to perform an action on existing index, in this case getting a count of documents stored in the index.  |
| [FieldBuilderIgnore](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample04_FieldBuilderIgnore.md) | Demonstrates a technique for working with unsupported data types.  |
| [Indexing documents (push model)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample05_IndexingDocuments.md) | "Push" model indexing, where you send a JSON payload to an index on a service.   |
| [Encryption key sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/samples/Sample06_EncryptedIndex.md) | Demonstrates using a customer-managed encryption key to add an extra layer of protection over sensitive content.  |

## Doc samples

Code samples from the Cognitive Search team demonstrate features and workflows. Many of these samples are referenced in tutorials, quickstarts, and how-to articles. You can find these samples in [**Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples) and in [**Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/) on GitHub.

| Samples | Article  |
|---------|-------------|
| [quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/master/quickstart) | Source code for [Quickstart: Create a search index ](search-get-started-dotnet.md). This article covers the basic workflow for creating, loading, and querying a search index using sample data. |
| [DotNetHowTo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowTo)  | Source code for [How to use the .NET client library](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md). This article steps through the basic workflow, but in more detail and discussion of API usage.  |
| [DotNetHowToSynonyms](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowToSynonyms)  | Source code for [Example: Add synonyms in C#](search-synonyms-tutorial-sdk.md). Synonym lists are used for query expansion, providing matchable  terms that are external to an index. |
| [DotNetToIndexers](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowToIndexers) | Source code for [Tutorial: Index Azure SQL data using the .NET SDK](search-indexer-tutorial.md). This article shows how to configure an Azure SQL indexer that has a schedule, field mappings, and parameters.  |
| [DotNetHowToEncryptionUsingCMK](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowToEncryptionUsingCMK)  | Source code for [How to configure customer-managed keys for data encryption](search-security-manage-encryption-keys.md). |
| [Create your first app in C#](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/master/create-first-app/v11) |  Source code for [Tutorial: Create your first search app](tutorial-csharp-create-first-app.md). While most samples are console applications, this MVC sample uses a web page to front the sample Hotels index, demonstrating basic search, pagination, autocomplete and suggested queries, facets, and filters. |
| [multiple-data-sources](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/master/multiple-data-sources)  | Source code for [Tutorial: Index from multiple data sources](tutorial-multiple-data-sources.md). |
