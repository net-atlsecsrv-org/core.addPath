# Field mappings in Azure Search indexers
When using Azure Search indexers, you can occasionally find yourself in situations where your input data doesn't quite match the schema of your target index. In those cases, you can use **field mappings** to transform your data into the desired shape.

Some situations where field mappings are useful:

* Your data source has a field `_id`, but Azure Search doesn't allow field names starting with an underscore. A field mapping allows you to "rename" a field.
* You want to populate several fields in the index with the same data source data, for example because you want to apply different analyzers to those fields. Field mappings let you "fork" a data source field.
* You need to Base64 encode or decode your data. Field mappings support several **mapping functions**, including functions for Base64 encoding and decoding.   

## Setting up field mappings
You can add field mappings when creating a new indexer using the [Create Indexer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn946899.aspx) API. You can manage field mappings on an indexing indexer using the [Update Indexer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn946892.aspx) API.

A field mapping consists of three parts:

1. A `sourceFieldName`, which represents a field in your data source. This property is required.
2. An optional `targetFieldName`, which represents a field in your search index. If omitted, the same name as in the data source is used.
3. An optional `mappingFunction`, which can transform your data using one of several predefined functions. The full list of functions is [below](#mappingFunctions).

Fields mappings are added to the `fieldMappings` array on the indexer definition.

For example, here's how you can accommodate differences in field names:

```JSON

PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/myindexer?api-version=[api-version]
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]
{
    "dataSourceName" : "mydatasource",
    "targetIndexName" : "myindex",
    "fieldMappings" : [ { "sourceFieldName" : "_id", "targetFieldName" : "id" } ]
}
```

An indexer can have multiple field mappings. For example, here's how you can "fork" a field:

```JSON

"fieldMappings" : [
    { "sourceFieldName" : "text", "targetFieldName" : "textStandardEnglishAnalyzer" },
    { "sourceFieldName" : "text", "targetFieldName" : "textSoundexAnalyzer" }
]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Search uses case-insensitive comparison to resolve the field and function names in field mappings. This is convenient (you don't have to get all the casing right), but it means that your data source or index cannot have fields that differ only by case.

## Field mapping functions
These functions are currently supported:

* [base64Encode](#base64EncodeFunction)
* [base64Decode](#base64DecodeFunction)
* [extractTokenAtPosition](#extractTokenAtPositionFunction)
* [jsonArrayToStringCollection](#jsonArrayToStringCollectionFunction)

<a name="base64EncodeFunction"></a>

## base64Encode
Performs *URL-safe* Base64 encoding of the input string. Assumes that the input is UTF-8 encoded.

### Sample use case - document key lookup
Only URL-safe characters can appear in an Azure Search document key (because customers must be able to address the document using the [Lookup API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/lookup-document), for example). If your data contains URL-unsafe characters and you want to use it to populate a key field in your search index, use this function. Once the key is encoded, you can use base64 decode to retrieve the original value. For details, see the [base64 encoding and decoding](#base64details) section.

#### Example
```JSON

"fieldMappings" : [
  {
    "sourceFieldName" : "SourceKey",
    "targetFieldName" : "IndexKey",
    "mappingFunction" : { "name" : "base64Encode" }
  }]
```

### Sample use case - retrieve original key
You have a blob indexer that indexes blobs with the blob path metadata as the document key. After retrieving the encoded document key, you want to decode the path and download the blob.

#### Example
```JSON

"fieldMappings" : [
  {
    "sourceFieldName" : "SourceKey",
    "targetFieldName" : "IndexKey",
    "mappingFunction" : { "name" : "base64Encode", "parameters" : { "useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenEncode" : false } }
  }]
 ```

If you don't need to look up documents by keys and also don't need to decode the encoded content, you can just leave out `parameters` for the mapping function, which defaults `useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenEncode` to `true`. Otherwise, see [base64 details](#base64details) section to decide which settings to use.

<a name="base64DecodeFunction"></a>

## base64Decode
Performs Base64 decoding of the input string. The input is assumed to a *URL-safe* Base64-encoded string.

### Sample use case
Blob custom metadata values must be ASCII-encoded. You can use Base64 encoding to represent arbitrary UTF-8 strings in blob custom metadata. However, to make search meaningful, you can use this function to turn the encoded data back into "regular" strings when populating your search index.

#### Example
```JSON

"fieldMappings" : [
  {
    "sourceFieldName" : "Base64EncodedMetadata",
    "targetFieldName" : "SearchableMetadata",
    "mappingFunction" : { "name" : "base64Decode", "parameters" : { "useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenDecode" : false } }
  }]
```

If you don't specify any `parameters`, then the default value of `useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenDecode` is `true`. See [base64 details](#base64details) section to decide which settings to use.

<a name="base64details"></a>

### Details of base64 encoding and decoding
Azure Search supports two base64 encodings: HttpServerUtility URL token and URL-safe base64 encoding without padding. You need to use the same encoding as the mapping functions if you want to encode a document key for look up, encode a value to be decoded by the indexer, or decode a field encoded by the indexer.

If `useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenEncode` or `useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenDecode` parameters for encoding and decoding respectively are set to `true`, then `base64Encode` behaves like [HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.httpserverutility.urltokenencode.aspx) and `base64Decode` behaves like [HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenDecode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.httpserverutility.urltokendecode.aspx).

If you are not using the full .NET Framework (i.e., you are using .NET Core or other programming environment) to produce the key values to emulate Azure Search behavior, then you should set `useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenEncode` and `useHttpServerUtilityUrlTokenDecode` to `false`. Depending on the library you use, the base64 encode and decode utility functions may be  different from Azure Search.

The following table compares different base64 encodings of the string `00>00?00`. To determine the required additional processing (if any) for your base64 functions, apply your library encode function on the string `00>00?00` and compare the output with the expected output `MDA-MDA_MDA`.

| Encoding | Base64 encode output | Additional processing after library encoding | Additional processing before library decoding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base64 with padding | `MDA+MDA/MDA=` | Use URL-safe characters and remove padding | Use standard base64 characters and add padding |
| Base64 without padding | `MDA+MDA/MDA` | Use URL-safe characters | Use standard base64 characters |
| URL-safe base64 with padding | `MDA-MDA_MDA=` | Remove padding | Add padding |
| URL-safe base64 without padding | `MDA-MDA_MDA` | None | None |

<a name="extractTokenAtPositionFunction"></a>

## extractTokenAtPosition
Splits a string field using the specified delimiter, and picks the token at the specified position in the resulting split.

For example, if the input is `Jane Doe`, the `delimiter` is `" "`(space) and the `position` is 0, the result is `Jane`; if the `position` is 1, the result is `Doe`. If the position refers to a token that doesn't exist, an error is returned.

### Sample use case
Your data source contains a `PersonName` field, and you want to index it as two separate `FirstName` and `LastName` fields. You can use this function to split the input using the space character as the delimiter.

### Parameters
* `delimiter`: a string to use as the separator when splitting the input string.
* `position`: an integer zero-based position of the token to pick after the input string is split.    

### Example
```JSON

"fieldMappings" : [
  {
    "sourceFieldName" : "PersonName",
    "targetFieldName" : "FirstName",
    "mappingFunction" : { "name" : "extractTokenAtPosition", "parameters" : { "delimiter" : " ", "position" : 0 } }
  },
  {
    "sourceFieldName" : "PersonName",
    "targetFieldName" : "LastName",
    "mappingFunction" : { "name" : "extractTokenAtPosition", "parameters" : { "delimiter" : " ", "position" : 1 } }
  }]
```

<a name="jsonArrayToStringCollectionFunction"></a>

## jsonArrayToStringCollection
Transforms a string formatted as a JSON array of strings into a string array that can be used to populate a `Collection(Edm.String)` field in the index.

For example, if the input string is `["red", "white", "blue"]`, then the target field of type `Collection(Edm.String)` will be populated with the three values `red`, `white`, and `blue`. For input values that cannot be parsed as JSON string arrays, an error is returned.

### Sample use case
Azure SQL database doesn't have a built-in data type that naturally maps to `Collection(Edm.String)` fields in Azure Search. To populate string collection fields, format your source data as a JSON string array and use this function.

### Example
```JSON

"fieldMappings" : [
  { "sourceFieldName" : "tags", "mappingFunction" : { "name" : "jsonArrayToStringCollection" } }
]
```
