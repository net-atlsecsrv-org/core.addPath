# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure Cognitive Search

If you are using [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) to enforce the recommendations in [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/introduction.md), then you probably already know that you can create policies for identifying and fixing non-compliant services. These policies might be custom, or they might be based on built-in definitions that provide compliance criteria and appropriate solutions for well-understood best practices.

For Azure Cognitive Search, there is currently one built-definition, listed below, that you can use in a policy assignment. The built-in is for logging and monitoring. By using this built-in definition in a [policy that you create](../governance/policy/assign-policy-portal.md), the system will scan for search services that do not have [diagnostic logging](search-monitor-logs.md), and then enable it accordingly.

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance.md)
provides Microsoft-created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure Cognitive Search. You can
assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources
compliant with the specific standard.
