# Configure a connection from an Azure Search indexer to SQL Managed Instance
As noted in [Connecting Azure SQL Database to Azure Search using indexers](search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-database-to-azure-search-using-indexers.md#faq), creating indexers against **SQL Managed Instances** is supported by Azure Search through the public endpoint.

## Create Azure SQL Managed Instance with public endpoint
Create a SQL Managed Instance with the **Enable public endpoint** option selected.

## Enable Azure SQL Managed Instance public endpoint
You can also enable public endpoint on an existing SQL Managed Instance under **Security** > **Virtual network** > **Public endpoint** > **Enable**.

## Verify NSG rules
Check the Network Security Group has the correct **Inbound security rules** that allow connections from Azure services.

## Get public endpoint connection string
Make sure you use the connection string for the **public endpoint** (port 3342, not port 1433).

## Next steps
With configuration out of the way, you can now specify a SQL Managed Instance as the data source for an Azure Search indexer using either the portal or REST API. See [Connecting Azure SQL Database to Azure Search using indexers](search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-database-to-azure-search-using-indexers.md) for more information.
