# Make indexer connections through a private endpoint

Many Azure resources, such as Azure storage accounts, can be configured to accept connections from a list of virtual networks and refuse outside connections that originate from a public network. If you're using an indexer to index data in Azure Cognitive Search, and your data source is on a private network, you can create an outbound [private endpoint connection](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) to reach the data.

This indexer connection method is subject to the following two requirements:

+ The Azure resource that provides content or code must be previously registered with the [Azure Private Link service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link/).

+ The Azure Cognitive Search service must be on the Basic tier or higher. The feature isn't available on the Free tier. Additionally, if your indexer has a skillset, the tier must be Standard 2 (S2) or higher. For more information, see [Service limits](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#shared-private-link-resource-limits).

## Shared Private Link Resources Management APIs

Private endpoints of secured resources that are created through Azure Cognitive Search APIs are referred to as *shared private link resources*. This is because you're "sharing" access to a resource, such as a storage account, that has been integrated with the [Azure Private Link service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link/).

Through its Management REST API, Azure Cognitive Search provides a [CreateOrUpdate](/rest/api/searchmanagement/sharedprivatelinkresources/createorupdate) operation that you can use to configure access from an Azure Cognitive Search indexer.

You can create private endpoint connections to some resources only by using the preview version of the Search Management API (version *2020-08-01-preview* or later), which is designated *preview* in the following table. Resources without a *preview* designation can be created with either the preview or generally available API version (*2020-08-01* or later).

The following table lists Azure resources for which you can create outbound private endpoints from Azure Cognitive Search. To create a shared private link resource, enter the **Group ID** values exactly as they're written in the API. The values are case-sensitive.

| Azure resource | Group ID |
| --- | --- |
| Azure Storage - Blob (or) ADLS Gen 2 | `blob`|
| Azure Storage - Tables | `table`|
| Azure Cosmos DB - SQL API | `Sql`|
| Azure SQL Database | `sqlServer`|
| Azure Database for MySQL (preview) | `mysqlServer`|
| Azure Key Vault | `vault` |
| Azure Functions (preview) | `sites` |

You can also query the Azure resources for which outbound private endpoint connections are supported by using the [list of supported APIs](/rest/api/searchmanagement/privatelinkresources/listsupported).

In the remainder of this article, a mix of [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) APIs is used to demonstrate the REST API calls.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples in this article are based on the following assumptions:
> * The name of the search service is _contoso-search_, which exists in the _contoso_ resource group of a subscription with subscription ID _00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000_. 
> * The resource ID of this search service is _/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/contoso-search_.

The rest of the examples show how the _contoso-search_ service can be configured so that its indexers can access data from the secure storage account _/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/contoso-storage_.

## Secure your storage account

Configure the storage account to [allow access only from specific subnets](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network). In the Azure portal, if you select this option and leave the set empty, it means that no traffic from virtual networks is allowed.

   ![Screenshot of the "Firewalls and virtual networks" pane, showing the option to allow access to selected networks. ](media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\storage-firewall-noaccess.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [trusted Microsoft service approach](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#trusted-microsoft-services) to bypass virtual network or IP restrictions on a storage account. You can also enable the search service to access data in the storage account. To do so, see [Indexer access to Azure Storage with the trusted service exception](search-indexer-howto-access-trusted-service-exception.md). 
>
> However, when you use this approach, communication between Azure Cognitive Search and your storage account happens via the public IP address of the storage account, over the secure Microsoft backbone network.

### Step 1: Create a shared private link resource to the storage account

To request Azure Cognitive Search to create an outbound private endpoint connection to the storage account, make the following API call: 

`armclient PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/contoso-search/sharedPrivateLinkResources/blob-pe?api-version=2020-08-01 create-pe.json`

The contents of the *create-pe.json* file, which represent the request body to the API, are as follows:

```json
{
      "name": "blob-pe",
      "properties": {
        "privateLinkResourceId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/contoso-storage",
        "groupId": "blob",
        "requestMessage": "please approve"
      }
}
```

A `202 Accepted` response is returned on success. The process of creating an outbound private endpoint is a long-running (asynchronous) operation. It involves deploying the following resources:

* A private endpoint, allocated with a private IP address in a `"Pending"` state. The private IP address is obtained from the address space that's allocated to the virtual network of the execution environment for the search service-specific private indexer. Upon approval of the private endpoint, any communication from Azure Cognitive Search to the storage account originates from the private IP address and a secure private link channel.

* A private DNS zone for the type of resource, based on the `groupId`. By deploying this resource, you ensure that any DNS lookup to the private resource utilizes the IP address that's associated with the private endpoint.

Be sure to specify the correct `groupId` for the type of resource for which you're creating the private endpoint. Any mismatch will result in a non-successful response message.

As in all asynchronous Azure operations, the `PUT` call returns an `Azure-AsyncOperation` header value that looks like the following:

`"Azure-AsyncOperation": "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/contoso-search/sharedPrivateLinkResources/blob-pe/operationStatuses/08586060559526078782?api-version=2020-08-01"`

You can poll this URI periodically to obtain the status of the operation. Before you proceed, we recommend that you wait until the status of the shared private link resource operation has reached a terminal state (that is, the operation's status is *succeeded*).

`armclient GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/contoso-search/sharedPrivateLinkResources/blob-pe/operationStatuses/08586060559526078782?api-version=2020-08-01"`

```json
{
    "status": "running" | "succeeded" | "failed"
}
```

### Step 2a: Approve the private endpoint connection for the storage account

> [!NOTE]
> In this section, you use the Azure portal to walk through the approval flow for a private endpoint to storage. Alternately, you could use the [REST API](/rest/api/storagerp/privateendpointconnections) that's available via the storage resource provider.
>
> Other providers, such as Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL Server, offer similar storage resource provider APIs for managing private endpoint connections.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Private endpoint connections** tab of your storage account. After the asynchronous operation has succeeded, there should be a request for a private endpoint connection with the request message from the previous API call.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the "Private endpoint connections" pane.](media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\storage-privateendpoint-approval.png)

1. Select the private endpoint that Azure Cognitive Search created. In the **Private endpoint** column, identify the private endpoint connection by the name that's specified in the previous API, select **Approve**, and then enter an appropriate message. The message content isn't significant. 

   Make sure that the private endpoint connection appears as shown in the following screenshot. It could take one to two minutes for the status to be updated in the portal.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing an "Approved" status on the "Private endpoint connections" pane.](media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\storage-privateendpoint-after-approval.png)

After the private endpoint connection request is approved, traffic is *capable* of flowing through the private endpoint. After the private endpoint is approved, Azure Cognitive Search creates the necessary DNS zone mappings in the DNS zone that's created for it.

### Step 2b: Query the status of the shared private link resource

To confirm that the shared private link resource has been updated after approval, obtain its status by using the [GET API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/sharedprivatelinkresources/get).

`armclient GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/contoso-search/sharedPrivateLinkResources/blob-pe?api-version=2020-08-01`

If the `properties.provisioningState` of the resource is `Succeeded` and `properties.status` is `Approved`, it means that the shared private link resource is functional and the indexer can be configured to communicate over the private endpoint.

```json
{
      "name": "blob-pe",
      "properties": {
        "privateLinkResourceId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/contoso-storage",
        "groupId": "blob",
        "requestMessage": "please approve",
        "status": "Approved",
        "resourceRegion": null,
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
      }
}

```

### Step 3: Configure the indexer to run in the private environment

> [!NOTE]
> You can perform this step before the private endpoint connection is approved. Until the private endpoint connection is approved, any indexer that tries to communicate with a secure resource (such as the storage account) will end up in a transient failure state. New indexers will fail to be created. As soon as the private endpoint connection is approved, indexers can access the private storage account.

1. [Create a data source](/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source) that points to the secure storage account and an appropriate container within the storage account. The following screenshot shows this request in Postman.

   ![Screenshot showing the creation of a data source on the Postman user interface.](media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\create-ds.png )

1. Similarly, [create an index](/rest/api/searchservice/create-index) and, optionally, [create a skillset](/rest/api/searchservice/create-skillset) by using the REST API.

1. [Create an indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/create-indexer) that points to the data source, index, and skillset that you created in the preceding step. In addition, force the indexer to run in the private execution environment by setting the indexer `executionEnvironment` configuration property to `private`.

   ![Screenshot showing the creation of an indexer on the Postman user interface.](media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\create-idr.png)

   After the indexer is created successfully, it should begin indexing content from the storage account over the private endpoint connection. You can monitor the status of the indexer by using the [Indexer Status API](/rest/api/searchservice/get-indexer-status).

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have existing indexers, you can update them via the [PUT API](/rest/api/searchservice/create-indexer) by setting the `executionEnvironment` to `private`.

## Troubleshooting

- If your indexer creation fails with an error message such as "Data source credentials are invalid," it means that either the status of the private endpoint connection is not yet *Approved* or the connection is not functional. To remedy the issue: 
  * Obtain the status of the shared private link resource by using the [GET API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/sharedprivatelinkresources/get). If the status is *Approved*, check the `properties.provisioningState` of the resource. If the status here is `Incomplete`, this means that some of the underlying dependencies for the resource failed to be set up. Reissuing the `PUT` request to re-create the shared private link resource should fix the issue. A reapproval might be necessary. Re-check the status of the resource to verify that the issue is fixed.

- If you create the indexer without setting its `executionEnvironment` property, the creation might succeed, but its execution history will show that the indexer runs are unsuccessful. To remedy the issue:
   * [Update the indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/update-indexer) to specify the execution environment.

- If you've created the indexer without setting the `executionEnvironment` property and it runs successfully, it means that Azure Cognitive Search has decided that its execution environment is the search service-specific *private* environment. This can change, depending on resources consumed by the indexer, the load on the search service, and other factors, and it can fail later. To remedy the issue:
  * We highly recommend that you set the `executionEnvironment` property to `private` to ensure that it won't fail in the future.

[Quotas and limits](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md) determine how many shared private link resources can be created and depend on the SKU of the search service.
