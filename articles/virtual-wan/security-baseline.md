# Azure security baseline for Virtual WAN

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Microsoft Azure Virtual
WAN. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Virtual
WAN. **Controls** not applicable to Virtual
WAN have been excluded.

To see how Virtual
WAN completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Virtual
WAN security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

**Guidance**: Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN provides custom routing capabilities and offers encryption for your ExpressRoute traffic. All route management is provided by the virtual hub router, which also enables transit connectivity between virtual networks. Encrypting your ExpressRoute traffic with Virtual WAN provides an encrypted transit between the on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks over ExpressRoute, without going over the public internet or using public IP addresses.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-2: Connect private networks together 

**Guidance**: Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute offers private connectivity to Azure Virtual WAN. As the ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public internet, ExpressRoute offers more reliability, faster speeds and lower latencies than typical internet connections. You can also use a virtual private network to connect to Azure through either Site-to-site (S2S) VPN or Point-to-site (P2S) VPN.

**Responsibility**: Shared

### NS-4: Protect applications and services from external network attacks

**Guidance**: Virtual WAN does not expose any endpoints to external networks which require them to be secured with conventional network protections. You are free to protect resources in Spoke Virtual Networks (any virtual network connected to a virtual hub) using virtual network protection services. 

Use Azure Firewall to protect applications and services against potentially malicious traffic from the Internet and other external locations. 

Choose Azure-provided DDoS Protection to protect your assets against attacks on your Azure Virtual Networks. Use Azure Security Center to detect misconfigurations risks related to your network-related resources.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### NS-5: Deploy intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Virtual WAN is a Microsoft-managed service. It does not offer native intrusion detection or intrusion prevention capabilities. However, there are security capabilities provided to Virtual WAN through Azure Firewall to enable a unified point of policy control. You can create an Azure Firewall policy and link the policy to a Virtual WAN hub to allow the existing Virtual WAN hub to function as a secured virtual hub, with the required Azure Firewall resources deployed.

- [Configure Azure Firewall in a Virtual WAN hub](howto-firewall.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-6: Simplify network security rules

**Guidance**: Simplify network security rules by leveraging Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. Service tags can be used in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name in the source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the default identity and access management service for Azure services. including Virtual WAN. Standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:

- Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machines (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) applications.
- Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources

Secure Azure AD as a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Assess your identity and security posture with the security score feature from Security Center to gauge how closely your configuration matches Microsoft's best practice recommendations. As necessary, implement Microsoft’s best practice recommendations for improvements to your security posture.

Azure AD also supports external identities, which allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity. 

Review information on using Azure AD in Point-to-Site VPN scenarios at the referenced links.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Currently, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication is provided through integration with Virtual WAN Point-to-site VPN.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the default identity and access management service for Azure services. Azure AD supports strong authentication controls with multifactor authentication, and strong passwordless methods.

Azure AD recommends the following for strong authentication controls:

- Multifactor authentication - Enable Azure AD multifactor authentication and follow Identity and Access Management recommendations in Azure Security Center for security best practices. Enforce multifactor authentication on all, select users or at per-user level based on sign in conditions and risk factors

- Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available. These include, Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards

Ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used for administrator and privileged users, followed by a roll-out of a strong authentication policy to other users.

- [How to enable MFA in P2S VPN for Virtual WAN](openvpn-azure-ad-mfa.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### IM-6: Restrict Azure resource access based on conditions

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) multifactor authentication for VPN users (point-to-site) with using Azure AD authentication. Configure multifactor authentication on a per user basis, or leverage multifactor authentication with Conditional Access. Conditional Access allows for finer-grained control over how a second factor should be promoted. It can allow assignment of multifactor authentication to only VPN, and exclude other applications tied to the Azure AD tenant. 

Note that Azure AD authentication is only available for gateways using OpenVPN protocol and clients running Windows.

### IM-7: Eliminate unintended credential exposure

**Guidance**: Site-to-site VPN in Virtual WAN uses pre-shared keys (PSK) which are discovered, created and managed by the customer in their Azure Key Vault. Implement Credential Scanner to identify credentials within code. Credential Scanner will also encourage moving discovered credentials to more secure locations such as Azure Key Vault.

For GitHub, you can use native secret scanning feature to identify credentials or other form of secrets within the code.

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN uses Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged access to the subscriptions and management groups they are in.

Also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers, security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. With that, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (root management group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Note: Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-detection).*

### LT-1: Enable threat detection for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Point-to-site VPN with Virtual WAN is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel, SIEM or monitoring tools for more sophisticated threat monitoring and analytics use cases. These are:

- Sign in – The sign in report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign in activities.
- Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD, such as, adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
- Risky sign in - A risky sign in is an indicator for a sign in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Use Azure Security Center to create alerts on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts including deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, use Threat Protection module from Security Center to collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

You also have options to customize incident alert and notification in different Azure services based on your incident response needs. 

- [How to set the Azure Security Center security contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

### GS-7: Define logging and threat response strategy

**Guidance**: Establish a logging and threat response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats while meeting compliance requirements. Prioritize providing analysts with high quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than integration and manual steps. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs

-	Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native Azure capabilities, and other sources 

-	Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest

-	Use of Azure native and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication

-	Processes for handling incidents and post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention
