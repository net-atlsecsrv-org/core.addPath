# Configure a custom IPsec policy for Virtual WAN using the portal

You can configure a custom IPsec policy for a Virtual WAN VPN connection in the Azure portal. Custom policies are helpful when you want both sides (on-premises and Azure VPN gateway) to use the same settings for IKE Phase 1 and IKE Phase 2.

## Working with custom policies

[!INCLUDE [IPsec](../../includes/virtual-wan-ipsec-custom-include.md)]

## Configure a policy

1. **Locate the virtual hub**. From a browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azurevirtualwanpreviewfeatures) and sign in with your Azure account. Navigate to your Virtual WAN resource and locate the virtual hub that your VPN site is connected to.
2. **Select the VPN site**. From the hub overview page, click **VPN (Site to site)** and select the VPN Site for which you want to set up a custom IPsec policy.
