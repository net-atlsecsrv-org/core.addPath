# Azure Virtual WAN logs and metrics

You can monitor Azure Virtual WAN using Azure Monitor. Virtual WAN is a networking service that brings together many networking, security, and routing functionalities to provide a single operational interface. Virtual WAN VPN gateways, ExpressRoute gateways, and Azure Firewall have logging and metrics available through Azure Monitor. For Azure Firewall information, see [Azure Firewall logs and metrics](../firewall/logs-and-metrics.md).

This article discusses metrics and diagnostics that are available through the portal. Metrics are lightweight and can support near real-time scenarios, making them useful for alerting and fast issue detection.

## Metrics

Metrics in Azure Monitor are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular time. Metrics are collected every minute, and are useful for alerting because they can be sampled frequently. An alert can be fired quickly with relatively simple logic.

### Site-to-site VPN gateways

The following metrics are available for Azure site-to-site VPN gateways:

* **Gateway Bandwidth** – Average site-to-site aggregate bandwidth of a gateway in bytes per second.
* **Tunnel Bandwidth** – Average bandwidth of a tunnel in bytes per second.
* **Tunnel Egress Bytes** – Outgoing bytes of a tunnel. 
* **Tunnel Egress Packets** – Outgoing packet count of a tunnel. 
* **Tunnel Egress TS Mismatch Packet Drop** – Outgoing packet drop count from traffic selector mismatch of a tunnel. 
* **Tunnel Ingress Bytes** – Incoming bytes of a tunnel. 
* **Tunnel Ingress Packet** – Incoming packet count of a tunnel. 
* **Tunnel Ingress TS Mismatch Packet Drop** – Incoming packet drop count from traffic selector mismatch of a tunnel. 

### Point-to-site VPN gateways

The following metrics are available for Azure point-to-site VPN gateways:

* **Gateway P2S Bandwidth** – Average point-to-site aggregate bandwidth of a gateway in bytes per second.
* **P2S Connection Count** – point-to-site connection count of a gateway.

### Azure ExpressRoute gateways

The following metrics are available for Azure ExpressRoute gateways:

* **BitsInPerSecond** – Bits ingressing Azure per second.
* **BitsOutPerSecond** – Bits egressing Azure per second.

### <a name="metrics-steps"></a>View gateway metrics

The following steps help you locate and view metrics:

1. In the portal, navigate to the virtual hub that has the gateway.

2. Select **VPN (Site to site)** to locate a site-to-site gateway, **ExpressRoute** to locate an ExpressRoute gateway, or **User VPN (Point to site)** to locate a point-to-site gateway. On the page, you can see the gateway information. Copy this information. You will use it later to view diagnostics using Azure Monitor.

3. Select **Metrics**.

4. On the **Metrics** page, you can view the metrics that you are interested in.

## <a name="diagnostic"></a>Diagnostic logs

### Site-to-site VPN gateways

The following diagnostics are available for Azure site-to-site VPN gateways:

* **Gateway Diagnostic Logs** – Gateway-specific diagnostics such as health, configuration, service updates, as well as additional diagnostics.
* **Tunnel Diagnostic Logs** – These are IPsec tunnel-related logs such as connect and disconnect events for a site-to-site IPsec tunnel, negotiated SAs, disconnect reasons, as well as additional diagnostics.
* **Route Diagnostic Logs** – These are logs related to events for static routes, BGP, route updates, as well as additional diagnostics.
* **IKE Diagnostic Logs** – IKE-specific diagnostics for IPsec connections.

### Point-to-site VPN gateways

The following diagnostics are available for Azure point-to-site VPN gateways:

* **Gateway Diagnostic Logs** – Gateway-specific diagnostics such as health, configuration, service updates, as well as other diagnostics.
* **IKE Diagnostic Logs** – IKE-specific diagnostics for IPsec connections.
* **P2S Diagnostic Logs** – These are User VPN (Point-to-site) P2S configuration and client events. They include client connect/disconnect, VPN client address allocation, as well as other diagnostics.

### <a name="diagnostic-steps"></a>View diagnostic logs

The following steps help you locate and view diagnostics:

1. In the portal, navigate to your Virtual WAN resource. In the **Overview** section of the Virtual WAN page in the portal, select **Essentials** to expand the view and obtain resource group information. Copy the resource group information.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/logs-metrics/3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Overview' section with an arrow pointing to the 'Copy' button.":::

2. In the Monitoring section, navigate to the resource group. Select **Diagnostic settings**, then input the resource information. This is the resource information that you copied in Step 2 from the [View gateway metrics](#metrics-steps) section, earlier in this article.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/logs-metrics/4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Monitoring' section with an arrow pointing to the 'Resource' drop-down.":::

3. On the results page, select **+Add diagnostic setting**, then select an option. You can choose to send to Log Analytics, stream to an event hub, or to simply archive to a storage account.

### <a name="sample-query"></a>Log Analytics sample query

Logs are located in **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**. You can set up a query in Log Analytics. The following example contains a query to obtain site-to-site route diagnostics.

```AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"```

Replace the values below, after the **= =**, as needed.

* "GatewayDiagnosticLog"
* "IKEDiagnosticLog"
* "P2SDiagnosticLog”
* "TunnelDiagnosticLog"
* "RouteDiagnosticLog"

## <a name="activity-logs"></a>Activity logs

**Activity log** entries are collected by default and can be viewed in the Azure portal. You can use Azure activity logs (formerly known as *operational logs* and *audit logs*) to view all operations submitted to your Azure subscription.
