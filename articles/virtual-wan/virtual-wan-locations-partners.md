# Virtual WAN partners and virtual hub locations

This article provides information on Virtual WAN supported regions and partners for connectivity into Virtual Hub.

Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that provides optimized and automated branch-to-branch connectivity through Azure. Virtual WAN lets you connect and configure branch devices to communicate with Azure. This can be done either manually, or by using provider devices through a Virtual WAN partner. Using partner devices allows you ease of use, simplification of connectivity, and configuration management.

Connectivity from the on-premises device is established in an automated way to the Virtual Hub. A virtual hub is a Microsoft-managed virtual network. The hub contains various service endpoints to enable connectivity from your on-premises network (vpnsite). You can only have one hub per region.

## <a name="automation"></a>Branch IPSec connectivity automation from partners

Devices that connect to Azure Virtual WAN have built-in automation to connect. This is typically set up in the device-management UI (or equivalent), which sets up the connectivity and configuration management between the VPN branch device to an Azure Virtual Hub VPN endpoint (VPN gateway).

The following high-level automation is set up in the device console/management center:

* Appropriate permissions for the device to access Azure Virtual WAN Resource Group
* Uploading of Branch Device into Azure Virtual WAN
* Automatic download of Azure connectivity information
* Configuration of on-premises branch device 

Some connectivity partners may extend the automation to include creating the Azure Virtual Hub VNet and VPN Gateway. If you want to know more about automation, see [Automation guidelines for Virtual WAN partners](virtual-wan-configure-automation-providers.md).

[!INCLUDE [partners](../../includes/virtual-wan-partners-include.md)]

The following partners are slated on our roadmap for the near future: 128 Technologies, Arista, Cisco Systems (Viptela), F5 Networks, Oracle SD-WAN and SharpLink.

## Partners with integrated Virtual Hub offerings
In addition to having automated branch office IPSec connectivity, some partners offer **Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs)** that can be integrated directly into the Azure Virtual WAN hub.  This allows the customers the option to terminate their branch connections into a compatible third-party appliance in the Virtual Hub.  

Partners that offer NVA in the Virtual WAN Hub must:

* Have implemented IPSec Connectivity Automation from their branch device and have on-boarded their NVA offering to Azure Virtual WAN hub.
* Have an existing Network Virtual Appliance offer available in Azure Marketplace.

If you are a partner and have questions about the Managed NVA in the Virtual Hub offering, please contact us by sending email to vwannvaonboarding@microsoft.com

## Integrated Virtual Hub NVA partners
These partners have **Managed Application** offers that are available now to deploy into the Virtual WAN hub.
