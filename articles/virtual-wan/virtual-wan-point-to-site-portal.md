    * **Hubs** - Select the hub you want to associate with this connection.
    * **Subscription** - Verify the subscription.
    * **Virtual network** - Select the virtual network you want to connect to this hub. The virtual network cannot have an already existing virtual network gateway.
4. Click **OK** to add the connection.

## <a name="device"></a>7. Download VPN profile

Use the VPN profile to configure your clients.

1. On the page for your virtual WAN, click **Hubs**.
2. Select the hub that you want to download the profile for.
3. Click **"..."** and pick **Download profile**. 
4. Once the file has finished creating, you can click the link to download it.
4. Use the profile file to configure the point-to-site clients.

## <a name="device"></a>8. Configure point-to-site clients
Use the downloaded profile to configure the remote access clients. The procedure for each operating system is different, please follow the correct instructions below:

### Microsoft Windows
#### OpenVPN

1.	Download and install the OpenVPN client from the official website.
2.	Download the VPN profile for the gateway. This can be done from the Point-to-site configurations tab in Azure portal, or New-AzVpnClientConfiguration in PowerShell.
3.	Unzip the profile. Open the vpnconfig.ovpn configuration file from the OpenVPN folder in notepad.
4.	Fill in the P2S client certificate section with the P2S client certificate public key in base64. In a PEM formatted certificate, you can simply open the .cer file and copy over the base64 key between the certificate headers. See here how to export a certificate to get the encoded public key.
5.	Fill in the private key section with the P2S client certificate private key in base64. See here how to extract private key.
6.	Do not change any other fields. Use the filled in configuration in client input to connect to the VPN.
7.	Copy the vpnconfig.ovpn file to C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config folder.
8.	Right-click the OpenVPN icon in the system tray and click connect.

#### IKEv2

1. Select the VPN client configuration files that correspond to the architecture of the Windows computer. For a 64-bit processor architecture, choose the 'VpnClientSetupAmd64' installer package. For a 32-bit processor architecture, choose the 'VpnClientSetupX86' installer package.
2. Double-click the package to install it. If you see a SmartScreen popup, click More info, then Run anyway.
3. On the client computer, navigate to Network Settings and click VPN. The VPN connection shows the name of the virtual network that it connects to.
4. Before you attempt to connect, verify that you have installed a client certificate on the client computer. A client certificate is required for authentication when using the native Azure certificate authentication type. For more information about generating certificates, see Generate Certificates. For information about how to install a client certificate, see Install a client certificate.

### Mac (OS X)
#### OpenVPN

1.	Download and install an OpenVPN client, such as TunnelBlik from https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html 
2.	Download the VPN profile for the gateway. This can be done from the Point-to-site configuration tab in Azure portal, or New-AzVpnClientConfiguration in PowerShell.
3.	Unzip the profile. Open the vpnconfig.ovpn configuration file from the OpenVPN folder in notepad.
4.	Fill in the P2S client certificate section with the P2S client certificate public key in base64. In a PEM formatted certificate, you can simply open the .cer file and copy over the base64 key between the certificate headers. See here how to export a certificate to get the encoded public key.
5.	Fill in the private key section with the P2S client certificate private key in base64. See here how to extract private key.
6.	Do not change any other fields. Use the filled in configuration in client input to connect to the VPN.
7.	Double-click the profile file to create the profile in tunnelblik
8.	Launch Tunnelblik from the applications folder
9.	Click on the Tunneblik icon in the system tray and pick connect

#### IKEv2

Azure does not provide mobileconfig file for native Azure certificate authentication. You have to manually configure the native IKEv2 VPN client on every Mac that will connect to Azure. The Generic folder has all the information that you need to configure it. If you don't see the Generic folder in your download, it's likely that IKEv2 was not selected as a tunnel type. Once IKEv2 is selected, generate the zip file again to retrieve the Generic folder. The Generic folder contains the following files:

- VpnSettings.xml, which contains important settings like server address and tunnel type.
- VpnServerRoot.cer, which contains the root certificate required to validate the Azure VPN Gateway during P2S connection setup.

## <a name="viewwan"></a>9. View your virtual WAN

1. Navigate to the virtual WAN.
2. On the Overview page, each point on the map represents a hub. Hover over any point to view the hub health summary.
3. In the Hubs and connections section, you can view hub status, site, region, VPN connection status, and bytes in and out.

## <a name="viewhealth"></a>10. View your resource health

1. Navigate to your WAN.
2. On your WAN page, in the **SUPPORT + Troubleshooting** section, click **Health** and view your resource.

## <a name="connectmon"></a>11. Monitor a connection

Create a connection to monitor communication between an Azure VM and a remote site. For information about how to set up a connection monitor, see [Monitor network communication](~/articles/network-watcher/connection-monitor.md). The source field is the VM IP in Azure, and the destination IP is the Site IP.

## <a name="cleanup"></a>12. Clean up resources

When you no longer need these resources, you can use [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains. Replace "myResourceGroup" with the name of your resource group and run the following PowerShell command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```
