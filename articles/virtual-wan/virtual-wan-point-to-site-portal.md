# Tutorial: Create a User VPN connection using Azure Virtual WAN

This tutorial shows you how to use Virtual WAN to connect to your resources in Azure over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv2) or OpenVPN VPN connection. This type of connection requires a client to be configured on the client computer. For more information about Virtual WAN, see the [Virtual WAN Overview](virtual-wan-about.md)

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a WAN
> * Create a P2S configuration
> * Create a hub
> * Specify DNS servers
> * Download a VPN client profile
> * View your virtual WAN

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Before beginning](../../includes/virtual-wan-before-include.md)]

## <a name="wan"></a>Create a virtual WAN

[!INCLUDE [Create a virtual WAN](../../includes/virtual-wan-create-vwan-include.md)]

## <a name="p2sconfig"></a>Create a P2S configuration

A point-to-site (P2S) configuration defines the parameters for connecting remote clients.

[!INCLUDE [Create client profiles](../../includes/virtual-wan-p2s-configuration-include.md)]

## <a name="hub"></a>Create hub with point-to-site gateway

[!INCLUDE [Create hub](../../includes/virtual-wan-p2s-hub-include.md)]

## <a name="dns"></a>Specify DNS server

The Virtual WAN User VPN gateways allow you to specify up to 5 DNS Servers. You can configure this during the hub creation process or modify it at a later time. To do so, locate the virtual hub. Under **User VPN (point to site)**, select **configure** and enter the DNS server IP address(es) in the **Custom DNS Servers** text box(es).

## <a name="download"></a>Download VPN profile

Use the VPN profile to configure your clients.

[!INCLUDE [Download profile](../../includes/virtual-wan-p2s-download-profile-include.md)]

### Configure User VPN clients

Use the downloaded profile to configure the remote access clients. The procedure for each operating system is different, follow the instructions that apply to your system.

[!INCLUDE [Configure clients](../../includes/virtual-wan-p2s-configure-clients-include.md)]

## <a name="viewwan"></a>View your virtual WAN

1. Navigate to the virtual WAN.
1. On the **Overview** page, each point on the map represents a hub.
1. In the **Hubs and connections** section, you can view hub status, site, region, VPN connection status, and bytes in and out.

## <a name="cleanup"></a>Clean up resources

When you no longer need these resources, you can use [Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains. Replace "myResourceGroup" with the name of your resource group and run the following PowerShell command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```
