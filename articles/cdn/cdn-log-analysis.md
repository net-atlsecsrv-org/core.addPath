# Analyze Azure CDN usage patterns

After you enable CDN for your application, you can monitor CDN usage, check the health of your delivery, and troubleshoot potential issues. Azure CDN provides these capabilities in the following ways: 

## Raw logs for Azure CDN from Microsoft
With a Standard Microsoft profile, you can enable raw logs and select to stream logs to:

* Azure Storage
* Event hubs
* Azure Log Analytics

With Azure Log Analytics you can view monitoring metrics, and set up alerts. 

For more information, see [Azure CDN HTTP raw logs](enable-raw-logs.md).


## Core analytics via Azure diagnostic logs

Core analytics is available for CDN endpoints for all pricing tiers. Azure diagnostics logs allow core analytics to be exported to Azure storage, event hubs, or Azure Monitor logs. Azure Monitor logs offers a solution with graphs that are user-configurable and customizable. For more information about Azure diagnostic logs, see [Azure diagnostic logs](cdn-azure-diagnostic-logs.md).

## Verizon core reports

**Azure CDN Standard from Verizon** or **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon** profiles provide core reports. You can view core reports in the Verizon supplemental portal. Verizon core reports are accessible via the **Manage** option from the Azure portal and offers different kinds of graphs and views. For more information, see [Core Reports from Verizon](cdn-analyze-usage-patterns.md).

## Verizon custom reports

**Azure CDN Standard from Verizon** or **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon** profiles provide custom reports. You can view custom reports in the Verizon supplemental portal. Verizon custom reports are accessible via the **Manage** option from the Azure portal. 

The custom reports display the number of hits or data transferred for each edge CNAME. Data is grouped by HTTP response code or cache status over period of time. For more information, see [Custom Reports from Verizon](cdn-verizon-custom-reports.md).

## Azure CDN Premium from Verizon reports

With **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon**, you can also access the following reports:
   * [Advanced HTTP reports](cdn-advanced-http-reports.md)
   * [Real-time stats](cdn-real-time-stats.md)
   * [Azure CDN edge node performance](cdn-edge-performance.md)
