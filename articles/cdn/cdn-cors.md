# Using Azure CDN with CORS
## What is CORS?
CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. In order to reduce the possibility of cross-site scripting attacks, all modern web browsers implement a security restriction known as [same-origin policy](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy).  This prevents a web page from calling APIs in a different domain.  CORS provides a secure way to allow one origin (the origin domain) to call APIs in another origin.

## How it works
There are two types of CORS requests, *simple requests* and *complex requests.*

### For simple requests:

1. The browser sends the CORS request with an additional **Origin** HTTP request header. The value of this header is the origin that served the parent page, which is defined as the combination of *protocol,* *domain,* and *port.*  When a page from https\://www.contoso.com attempts to access a user's data in the fabrikam.com origin, the following request header would be sent to fabrikam.com:

   `Origin: https://www.contoso.com`

2. The server may respond with any of the following:

   * An **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header in its response indicating which origin site is allowed. For example:

     `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.contoso.com`

   * An HTTP error code such as 403 if the server does not allow the cross-origin request after checking the Origin header

   * An **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header with a wildcard that allows all origins:

     `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

### For complex requests:

A complex request is a CORS request where the browser is required to send a *preflight request* (that is, a preliminary probe) before sending the actual CORS request. The preflight request asks the server permission if the original CORS request can proceed and is an `OPTIONS` request to the same URL.

## Wildcard or single origin scenarios
CORS on Azure CDN will work automatically with no additional configuration when the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header is set to wildcard (*) or a single origin.  The CDN will cache the first response and subsequent requests will use the same header.

If requests have already been made to the CDN prior to CORS being set on your origin, you will need to purge content on your endpoint content to reload the content with the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header.

## Multiple origin scenarios
If you need to allow a specific list of origins to be allowed for CORS, things get a little more complicated. The problem occurs when the CDN caches the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header for the first CORS origin.  When a different CORS origin makes a subsequent request, the CDN will serve the cached **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header, which won't match.  There are several ways to correct this.

### Azure CDN Premium from Verizon
The best way to enable this is to use **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon**, which exposes some advanced functionality. 

You'll need to [create a rule](cdn-rules-engine.md) to check the **Origin** header on the request.  If it's a valid origin, your rule will set the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header with the origin provided in the request.  If the origin specified in the **Origin** header is not allowed, your rule should omit the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header, which will cause the browser to reject the request. 

There are two ways to do this with the rules engine. In both cases, the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header from the file's origin server is ignored and the CDN's rules engine completely manages the allowed CORS origins.

#### One regular expression with all valid origins
In this case, you'll create a regular expression that includes all of the origins you want to allow: 

    https?:\/\/(www\.contoso\.com|contoso\.com|www\.microsoft\.com|microsoft.com\.com)$

> [!TIP]
> **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon** uses [Perl Compatible Regular Expressions](https://pcre.org/) as its engine for regular expressions.  You can use a tool like [Regular Expressions 101](https://regex101.com/) to validate your regular expression.  Note that the "/" character is valid in regular expressions and doesn't need to be escaped, however, escaping that character is considered a best practice and is expected by some regex validators.

If the regular expression matches, your rule will replace the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header (if any) from the origin with the origin that sent the request.  You can also add additional CORS headers, such as **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**.

#### Request header rule for each origin.
Rather than regular expressions, you can instead create a separate rule for each origin you wish to allow using the **Request Header Wildcard** [match condition](/previous-versions/azure/mt757336(v=azure.100)#match-conditions). As with the regular expression method, the rules engine alone sets the CORS headers.

> [!TIP]
> In the example above, the use of the wildcard character * tells the rules engine to match both HTTP and HTTPS.

### Azure CDN standard profiles
On Azure CDN standard profiles (**Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft**, **Azure CDN Standard from Akamai**, and **Azure CDN Standard from Verizon**), the only mechanism to allow for multiple origins without the use of the wildcard origin is to use [query string caching](cdn-query-string.md). Enable the query string setting for the CDN endpoint and then use a unique query string for requests from each allowed domain. Doing so will result in the CDN caching a separate object for each unique query string. This approach is not ideal, however, as it will result in multiple copies of the same file cached on the CDN.
