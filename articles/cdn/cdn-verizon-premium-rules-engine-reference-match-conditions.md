# Azure CDN from Verizon Premium rules engine match conditions

This article lists detailed descriptions of the available match conditions for the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) from Verizon Premium [rules engine](cdn-verizon-premium-rules-engine.md).

The second part of a rule is the match condition. A match condition identifies specific types of requests for which a set of features will be performed.

For example, you can use a match condition to:

- Filter requests for content at a particular location.
- Filter requests generated from a particular IP address or country/region.
- Filter requests by header information.

For the most recent match conditions, see the [Verizon Rules Engine documentation](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/index.html#Quick_References/HRE_QR.htm#Conditio).
