# Allowed certificate authorities for enabling custom HTTPS on Azure CDN

You must meet specific certificate requirements when you [enable the HTTPS feature by using your own certificate](cdn-custom-ssl.md?tabs=option-2-enable-https-with-your-own-certificate#ssl-certificates) for an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) custom domain. The **Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft** profile requires a certificate from one of the approved certificate authorities (CA) in the following list. If a certificate from an unapproved CA or if a self-signed certificate is used, the request is rejected. **Azure CDN Standard from Verizon** and **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon** profiles accept any valid certificate from any valid CA.

> [!NOTE]
> The option of using your own certificate to enable the custom domain HTTPS feature is *not* available for **Azure CDN Standard from Akamai** profiles.
