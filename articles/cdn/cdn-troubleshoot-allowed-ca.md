# Allowed certificate authorities for enabling custom HTTPS on Azure CDN

For an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) custom domain on an **Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft** endpoint, when you [enable the HTTPS feature by using your own certificate](cdn-custom-ssl.md?tabs=option-2-enable-https-with-your-own-certificate#ssl-certificates), you must use an allowed certificate authority (CA) to create your SSL certificate. Otherwise, if you use a non-allowed CA or a self-signed certificate, your request will be rejected.

> [!NOTE]
> The option of using your own certificate to enable custom HTTPS is available only with **Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft** profiles.
