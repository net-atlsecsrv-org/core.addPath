# Monitor the health of Azure CDN resources
  
Azure CDN Resource health is a subset of [Azure resource health](../service-health/resource-health-overview.md).  You can use Azure resource health to monitor the health of CDN resources and receive actionable guidance to troubleshoot problems.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>Azure CDN resource health only currently accounts for the health of global CDN delivery and API capabilities.  Azure CDN resource health does not verify individual CDN endpoints.
>
>The signals that feed Azure CDN resource health may be up to 15 minutes delayed.

## How to find Azure CDN resource health

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to your CDN profile.

2. Click the **Settings** button.
