# Tutorial: Add Azure CDN to an Azure App Service web app

This tutorial shows how to add [Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)](cdn-overview.md) to a [web app in Azure App Service](../app-service/overview.md). Web apps is a service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. 

Here's the home page of the sample static HTML site that you'll work with:

![Sample app home page](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/sample-app-home-page.png)

What you'll learn:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a CDN endpoint.
> * Refresh cached assets.
> * Use query strings to control cached versions.


## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create the web app

To create the web app that you'll work with, follow the [static HTML quickstart](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html.md) through the **Browse to the app** step.

## Log in to the Azure portal

Open a browser and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Dynamic site acceleration optimization
If you want to optimize your CDN endpoint for dynamic site acceleration (DSA), you should use the [CDN portal](cdn-create-new-endpoint.md) to create your profile and endpoint. With [DSA optimization](cdn-dynamic-site-acceleration.md), the performance of web pages with dynamic content is measurably improved. For instructions about how to optimize a CDN endpoint for DSA from the CDN portal, see [CDN endpoint configuration to accelerate delivery of dynamic files](cdn-dynamic-site-acceleration.md#cdn-endpoint-configuration-to-accelerate-delivery-of-dynamic-files). 
Otherwise, if you don't want to optimize your new endpoint, you can use the web app portal to create it by following the steps in the next section. Note that for **Azure CDN from Verizon** profiles, you cannot change the optimization of a CDN endpoint after it has been created.

## Create a CDN profile and endpoint

In the left navigation, select **App Services**, and then select the app that you created in the [static HTML quickstart](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html.md).

![Select App Service app in the portal](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-select-app-services.png)

In the **App Service** page, in the **Settings** section, select **Networking > Configure Azure CDN for your app**.

![Select CDN in the portal](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-select-cdn.png)

In the **Azure Content Delivery Network** page, provide the **New endpoint** settings as specified in the table.

![Create profile and endpoint in the portal](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-new-endpoint.png)

| Setting | Suggested value | Description |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **CDN profile** | myCDNProfile | A CDN profile is a collection of CDN endpoints with the same pricing tier. |
| **Pricing tier** | Standard Akamai | The [pricing tier](cdn-features.md) specifies the provider and available features. This tutorial uses *Standard Akamai*. |
| **CDN endpoint name** | Any name that is unique in the azureedge.net domain | You access your cached resources at the domain *&lt;endpointname&gt;*.azureedge.net.

Select **Create** to create a CDN profile.

Azure creates the profile and endpoint. The new endpoint appears in the **Endpoints** list, and when it's provisioned, the status is **Running**.

![New endpoint in list](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-new-endpoint-in-list.png)

### Test the CDN endpoint

 Because it takes time for the registration to propagate, the endpoint isn't immediately available for use: 
   - For **Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft** profiles, propagation usually completes in 10 minutes. 
   - For **Azure CDN Standard from Akamai** profiles, propagation usually completes within one minute. 
   - For **Azure CDN Standard from Verizon** and **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon** profiles, propagation usually completes within 90 minutes. 

The sample app has an *index.html* file and *css*, *img*, and *js* folders that contain other static assets. The content paths for all of these files are the same at the CDN endpoint. For example, both of the following URLs access the *bootstrap.css* file in the *css* folder:

```
http://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/css/bootstrap.css
```

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/css/bootstrap.css
```

Navigate a browser to the following URL:

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html
```

![Sample app home page served from CDN](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/sample-app-home-page-cdn.png)

 You see the same page that you ran earlier in an Azure web app. Azure CDN has retrieved the origin web app's assets and is serving them from the CDN endpoint

To ensure that this page is cached in the CDN, refresh the page. Two requests for the same asset are sometimes required for the CDN to cache the requested content.

For more information about creating Azure CDN profiles and endpoints, see [Getting started with Azure CDN](cdn-create-new-endpoint.md).

## Purge the CDN

The CDN periodically refreshes its resources from the origin web app based on the time-to-live (TTL) configuration. The default TTL is seven days.

At times you might need to refresh the CDN before the TTL expiration; for example, when you deploy updated content to the web app. To trigger a refresh, manually purge the CDN resources. 

In this section of the tutorial, you deploy a change to the web app and purge the CDN to trigger the CDN to refresh its cache.

### Deploy a change to the web app

Open the *index.html* file and add *- V2* to the H1 heading, as shown in the following example: 

```
<h1>Azure App Service - Sample Static HTML Site - V2</h1>
```

Commit your change and deploy it to the web app.

```bash
git commit -am "version 2"
git push azure master
```

Once deployment has completed, browse to the web app URL to see the change.

```
http://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/index.html
```

![V2 in title in web app](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/v2-in-web-app-title.png)

If you browse to the CDN endpoint URL for the home page, you won't see the change because the cached version in the CDN hasn't expired yet. 

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html
```

![No V2 in title in CDN](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/no-v2-in-cdn-title.png)

### Purge the CDN in the portal

To trigger the CDN to update its cached version, purge the CDN.

In the portal left navigation, select **Resource groups**, and then select the resource group that you created for your web app (myResourceGroup).

![Select resource group](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-select-group.png)

In the list of resources, select your CDN endpoint.

![Select endpoint](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-select-endpoint.png)

At the top of the **Endpoint** page, select **Purge**.

![Select Purge](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-select-purge.png)

Enter the content paths you want to purge. You can pass a complete file path to purge an individual file, or a path segment to purge and refresh all content in a folder. Because you changed *index.html*, ensure that is in one of the paths.

At the bottom of the page, select **Purge**.

![Purge page](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/app-service-web-purge-cdn.png)

### Verify that the CDN is updated

Wait until the purge request finishes processing, which is typically a couple of minutes. To see the current status, select the bell icon at the top of the page. 

![Purge notification](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-purge-notification.png)

When you browse to the CDN endpoint URL for *index.html*, you'll see the *V2* that you added to the title on the home page, which indicates that the CDN cache has been refreshed.

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html
```

![V2 in title in CDN](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/v2-in-cdn-title.png)

For more information, see [Purge an Azure CDN endpoint](../cdn/cdn-purge-endpoint.md). 

## Use query strings to version content

Azure CDN offers the following caching behavior options:

* Ignore query strings
* Bypass caching for query strings
* Cache every unique URL 

The first option is the default, which means there is only one cached version of an asset regardless of the query string in the URL. 

In this section of the tutorial, you change the caching behavior to cache every unique URL.

### Change the cache behavior

In the Azure portal **CDN Endpoint** page, select **Cache**.

Select **Cache every unique URL** from the **Query string caching behavior** drop-down list.

Select **Save**.

![Select query string caching behavior](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/portal-select-caching-behavior.png)

### Verify that unique URLs are cached separately

In a browser, navigate to the home page at the CDN endpoint, and include a query string: 

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html?q=1
```

Azure CDN returns the current web app content, which includes *V2* in the heading. 

To ensure that this page is cached in the CDN, refresh the page. 

Open *index.html*, change *V2* to *V3*, then deploy the change. 

```bash
git commit -am "version 3"
git push azure master
```

In a browser, go to the CDN endpoint URL with a new query string, such as `q=2`. Azure CDN gets the current *index.html* file and displays *V3*. However, if you navigate to the CDN endpoint with the `q=1` query string, you see *V2*.

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html?q=2
```

![V3 in title in CDN, query string 2](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/v3-in-cdn-title-qs2.png)

```
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html?q=1
```

![V2 in title in CDN, query string 1](media/cdn-add-to-web-app/v2-in-cdn-title-qs1.png)

This output shows that each query string is treated differently:

* q=1 was used before, so cached contents are returned (V2).
* q=2 is new, so the latest web app contents are retrieved and returned (V3).

For more information, see [Control Azure CDN caching behavior with query strings](../cdn/cdn-query-string.md).
