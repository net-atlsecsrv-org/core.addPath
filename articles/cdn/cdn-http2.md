# HTTP/2 Support in Azure CDN

HTTP/2 is a major revision to HTTP/1.1\. It provides faster web performance, reduced response time, and improved user experience, while maintaining the familiar HTTP methods, status codes, and semantics. Though HTTP/2 is designed to work with HTTP and HTTPS, many client web browsers only support HTTP/2 over TLS.

### HTTP/2 Benefits

The benefits of HTTP/2 include:

*   **Multiplexing and concurrency**

    Using HTTP 1.1, making multiple resource requests requires multiple TCP connections, and each connection has performance overhead associated with it. HTTP/2 allows multiple resources to be requested on a single TCP connection.

*   **Header compression**

    By compressing the HTTP headers for served resources, time on the wire is reduced significantly.

*   **Stream dependencies**

    Stream dependencies allow the client to indicate to the server which resources have priority.


## HTTP/2 Browser Support

All of the major browsers have implemented HTTP/2 support in their current versions. Non-supported browsers automatically fallback to HTTP/1.1.

|Browser|Minimum Version|
|-------------|------------|
|Microsoft Edge| 12|
|Google Chrome| 43|
|Mozilla Firefox| 38|
|Opera| 32|
|Safari| 9|

## Enabling HTTP/2 Support in Azure CDN

Currently, HTTP/2 support is active for all Azure CDN profiles. No further action is required from customers.

## Next Steps

To see the benefits of HTTP/2 in action, see [this demo from Akamai](https://http2.akamai.com/demo).
