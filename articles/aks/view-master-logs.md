# Enable and review Kubernetes master node logs in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the master components such as the *kube-apiserver* and *kube-controller-manager* are provided as a managed service. You create and manage the nodes that run the *kubelet* and container runtime, and deploy your applications through the managed Kubernetes API server. To help troubleshoot your application and services, you may need to view the logs generated by these master components. This article shows you how to use Azure Monitor logs to enable and query the logs from the Kubernetes master components.

## Before you begin

This article requires an existing AKS cluster running in your Azure account. If you do not already have an AKS cluster, create one using the [Azure CLI][cli-quickstart] or [Azure portal][portal-quickstart]. Azure Monitor logs works with both RBAC and non-RBAC enabled AKS clusters.

## Enable resource logs

To help collect and review data from multiple sources, Azure Monitor logs provides a query language and analytics engine that provides insights to your environment. A workspace is used to collate and analyze the data, and can integrate with other Azure services such as Application Insights and Security Center. To use a different platform to analyze the logs, you can instead choose to send resource logs to an Azure storage account or event hub. For more information, see [What is Azure Monitor logs?][log-analytics-overview].

Azure Monitor logs are enabled and managed in the Azure portal. To enable log collection for the Kubernetes master components in your AKS cluster, open the Azure portal in a web browser and complete the following steps:

1. Select the resource group for your AKS cluster, such as *myResourceGroup*. Don't select the resource group that contains your individual AKS cluster resources, such as *MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*.
1. On the left-hand side, choose **Diagnostic settings**.
1. Select your AKS cluster, such as *myAKSCluster*, then choose to **Add diagnostic setting**.
1. Enter a name, such as *myAKSClusterLogs*, then select the option to **Send to Log Analytics**.
1. Select an existing workspace or create a new one. If you create a workspace, provide a workspace name, a resource group, and a location.
1. In the list of available logs, select the logs you wish to enable. For this example, enable the *kube-audit* logs. Common logs include the *kube-apiserver*, *kube-controller-manager*, and *kube-scheduler*. You can return and change the collected logs once Log Analytics workspaces are enabled.
1. When ready, select **Save** to enable collection of the selected logs.

## Schedule a test pod on the AKS cluster

To generate some logs, create a new pod in your AKS cluster. The following example YAML manifest can be used to create a basic NGINX instance. Create a file named `nginx.yaml` in an editor of your choice and paste the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: nginx:1.15.5
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 256Mi
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Create the pod with the [kubectl create][kubectl-create] command and specify your YAML file, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl create -f nginx.yaml

pod/nginx created
```

## View collected logs

It may take a few minutes for the diagnostics logs to be enabled and appear. In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster, and select **Logs** on the left-hand side. Close the *Example Queries* window if it appears.

On the left-hand side, choose **Logs**. To view the *kube-audit* logs, enter the following query in the text box:

```
KubePodInventory
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
```

Many logs are likely returned. To scope down the query to view the logs about the NGINX pod created in the previous step, add an additional *where* statement to search for *nginx* as shown in the following example query:

```
KubePodInventory
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where Name contains "nginx"
```

For more information on how to query and filter your log data, see [View or analyze data collected with log analytics log search][analyze-log-analytics].

## Log event schema

AKS logs the following events:

* [AzureActivity][log-schema-azureactivity]
* [AzureMetrics][log-schema-azuremetrics]
* [ContainerImageInventory][log-schema-containerimageinventory]
* [ContainerInventory][log-schema-containerinventory]
* [ContainerLog][log-schema-containerlog]
* [ContainerNodeInventory][log-schema-containernodeinventory]
* [ContainerServiceLog][log-schema-containerservicelog]
* [Heartbeat][log-schema-heartbeat]
* [InsightsMetrics][log-schema-insightsmetrics]
* [KubeEvents][log-schema-kubeevents]
* [KubeHealth][log-schema-kubehealth]
* [KubeMonAgentEvents][log-schema-kubemonagentevents]
* [KubeNodeInventory][log-schema-kubenodeinventory]
* [KubePodInventory][log-schema-kubepodinventory]
* [KubeServices][log-schema-kubeservices]
* [Perf][log-schema-perf]

## Log Roles

| Role                     | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| *aksService*             | The display name in audit log for the control plane operation (from the hcpService) |
| *masterclient*           | The display name in audit log for MasterClientCertificate, the certificate you get from az aks get-credentials |
| *nodeclient*             | The display name for ClientCertificate, which is used by agent nodes |
