# Install applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[Helm][helm] is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers such as *APT* and *Yum*, Helm is used to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This article shows you how to configure and use Helm in a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

You also need the Helm CLI installed, which is the client that runs on your development system. It allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, the Helm CLI is already installed. For installation instructions on your local platform, see [Installing Helm][helm-install].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Helm is intended to run on Linux nodes. If you have Windows Server nodes in your cluster, you must ensure that Helm pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes. You also need to ensure that any Helm charts you install are also scheduled to run on the correct nodes. The commands in this article use [node-selectors][k8s-node-selector] to make sure pods are scheduled to the correct nodes, but not all Helm charts may expose a node selector. You can also consider using other options on your cluster, such as [taints][taints].

## Verify your version of Helm

Use the `helm version` command to verify the version of Helm you have installed:

```console
helm version
```

The following example shows Helm version 3.0.0 installed:

```console
$ helm version

version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.0.0", GitCommit:"e29ce2a54e96cd02ccfce88bee4f58bb6e2a28b6", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.4"}
```

For Helm v3, follow the steps in the [Helm v3 section](#install-an-application-with-helm-v3). For Helm v2, follow the steps in the [Helm v2 section](#install-an-application-with-helm-v2)

## Install an application with Helm v3

### Add the official Helm stable charts repository

Use the [helm repo][helm-repo-add] command to add the official Helm stable charts repository.

```console
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
```

### Find Helm charts

Helm charts are used to deploy applications into a Kubernetes cluster. To search for pre-created Helm charts, use the [helm search][helm-search] command:

```console
helm search repo stable
```

The following condensed example output shows some of the Helm charts available for use:


```console
$ helm search repo stable

```

To update the list of charts, use the [helm repo update][helm-repo-update] command. The following example shows a successful repo update:

```console
$ helm repo update

Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

### Run Helm charts

To install charts with Helm, use the [helm install][helm-install-command] command and specify a release name and the name of the chart to install. To see installing a Helm chart in action, let's install a basic nginx deployment using a Helm chart.

```console
helm install my-nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
```

The following condensed example output shows the deployment status of the Kubernetes resources created by the Helm chart:

```console
$ helm install my-nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress \
>     --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
>     --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux

NAME: my-nginx-ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Nov 22 10:08:06 2019
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
The nginx-ingress controller has been installed.
It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace default get services -o wide -w my-nginx-ingress-controller'
...
```

Use the `kubectl get services` command to get the *EXTERNAL-IP* of your service. For example, the below command shows the *EXTERNAL-IP* for the *my-nginx-ingress-controller* service:

```console
$ kubectl --namespace default get services -o wide -w my-nginx-ingress-controller

NAME                          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE   SELECTOR
my-nginx-ingress-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.123.1     <EXTERNAL-IP>   80:31301/TCP,443:31623/TCP   96s   app=nginx-ingress,component=controller,release=my-nginx-ingress
```

### List releases

To see a list of releases installed on your cluster, use the `helm list` command.

```console
helm list
```

The following example shows the *my-nginx-ingress* release deployed in the previous step:

```console
$ helm list

NAME            	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART               	APP VERSION
my-nginx-ingress	default  	1       	2019-11-22 10:08:06.048477 -0600 CST	deployed	nginx-ingress-1.25.0	0.26.1 
```

### Clean up resources

When you deploy a Helm chart, a number of Kubernetes resources are created. These resources include pods, deployments, and services. To clean up these resources, use the [helm uninstall][helm-cleanup] command and specify your release name, as found in the previous `helm list` command.

```console
helm uninstall my-nginx-ingress
```

The following example shows the release named *my-nginx-ingress* has been uninstalled:

```console
$ helm uninstall my-nginx-ingress

release "my-nginx-ingress" uninstalled
```

## Install an application with Helm v2

### Create a service account

Before you can deploy Helm in an RBAC-enabled AKS cluster, you need a service account and role binding for the Tiller service. For more information on securing Helm / Tiller in an RBAC enabled cluster, see [Tiller, Namespaces, and RBAC][tiller-rbac]. If your AKS cluster is not RBAC enabled, skip this step.

Create a file named `helm-rbac.yaml` and copy in the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
```

Create the service account and role binding with the `kubectl apply` command:

```console
kubectl apply -f helm-rbac.yaml
```

### Secure Tiller and Helm

The Helm client and Tiller service authenticate and communicate with each other using TLS/SSL. This authentication method helps to secure the Kubernetes cluster and what services can be deployed. To improve security, you can generate your own signed certificates. Each Helm user would receive their own client certificate, and Tiller would be initialized in the Kubernetes cluster with certificates applied. For more information, see [Using TLS/SSL between Helm and Tiller][helm2-ssl].

With an RBAC-enabled Kubernetes cluster, you can control the level of access Tiller has to the cluster. You can define the Kubernetes namespace that Tiller is deployed in, and restrict what namespaces Tiller can then deploy resources in. This approach lets you create Tiller instances in different namespaces and limit deployment boundaries, and scope the users of Helm client to certain namespaces. For more information, see [Helm role-based access controls][helm2-rbac].

### Configure Helm

To deploy a basic Tiller into an AKS cluster, use the [helm init][helm2-init] command. If your cluster is not RBAC enabled, remove the `--service-account` argument and value. The following examples also set the [history-max][helm2-history-max] to 200.

If you configured TLS/SSL for Tiller and Helm, skip this basic initialization step and instead provide the required `--tiller-tls-` as shown in the next example.

```console
helm init --history-max 200 --service-account tiller --node-selectors "beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux"
```

If you configured TLS/SSL between Helm and Tiller provide the `--tiller-tls-*` parameters and names of your own certificates, as shown in the following example:

```console
helm init \
    --tiller-tls \
    --tiller-tls-cert tiller.cert.pem \
    --tiller-tls-key tiller.key.pem \
    --tiller-tls-verify \
    --tls-ca-cert ca.cert.pem \
    --history-max 200 \
    --service-account tiller \
    --node-selectors "beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux"
```

### Find Helm charts

Helm charts are used to deploy applications into a Kubernetes cluster. To search for pre-created Helm charts, use the [helm search][helm2-search] command:

```console
helm search
```

The following condensed example output shows some of the Helm charts available for use:

```

To update the list of charts, use the [helm repo update][helm2-repo-update] command. The following example shows a successful repo update:

```console
$ helm repo update

Hold tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Skip local chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete.
```

### Run Helm charts

To install charts with Helm, use the [helm install][helm2-install-command] command and specify the name of the chart to install. To see installing a Helm chart in action, let's install a basic nginx deployment using a Helm chart. If you configured TLS/SSL, add the `--tls` parameter to use your Helm client certificate.

```console
helm install stable/nginx-ingress \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
```

The following condensed example output shows the deployment status of the Kubernetes resources created by the Helm chart:

```
$ helm install stable/nginx-ingress --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux

It takes a minute or two for the *EXTERNAL-IP* address of the nginx-ingress-controller service to be populated and allow you to access it with a web browser.

### List Helm releases

To see a list of releases installed on your cluster, use the [helm list][helm2-list] command. The following example shows the nginx-ingress release deployed in the previous step. If you configured TLS/SSL, add the `--tls` parameter to use your Helm client certificate.

```console
$ helm list

NAME        	    REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART          	      APP VERSION	NAMESPACE
flailing-alpaca	  1       	Thu May 23 12:55:21 2019	DEPLOYED	nginx-ingress-1.6.13	0.24.1     	default
```

### Clean up resources

When you deploy a Helm chart, a number of Kubernetes resources are created. These resources include pods, deployments, and services. To clean up these resources, use the `helm delete` command and specify your release name, as found in the previous `helm list` command. The following example deletes the release named *flailing-alpaca*:

```console
$ helm delete flailing-alpaca

release "flailing-alpaca" deleted
```
