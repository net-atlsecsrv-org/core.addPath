# Preview - Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service

When you're using Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), an authentication mechanism needs to be established. This article details the recommended configurations for authentication between these two Azure services.

You can set up the AKS to ACR integration in a few simple commands with the Azure CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AKS preview features are self-service opt-in. Previews are provided "as-is" and "as available" and are excluded from the service level agreements and limited warranty. AKS Previews are partially covered by customer support on best effort basis. As such, these features are not meant for production use. For additional infromation, please see the following support articles:
>
> * [AKS Support Policies](support-policies.md)
> * [Azure Support FAQ](faq.md)

## Before you begin

You must have the following:

* **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role on the **Azure subscription**
* You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.70 or later and the aks-preview 0.4.8 extension
* You need [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your client, and you need access to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Install latest AKS CLI preview extension

You need the **aks-preview 0.4.8** extension or later.

```azurecli
az extension remove --name aks-preview 
az extension add -y --name aks-preview
```

## Create a new AKS cluster with ACR integration

You can set up AKS and ACR integration during the initial creation of your AKS cluster.  To allow an AKS cluster to interact with ACR, an Azure Active Directory **service principal** is used. The following CLI command creates an ACR in the resource group you specify and configures the appropriate **ACRPull** role for the service principal. If the *acr-name* doesn't exist, a default ACR name of `aks<resource-group>acr` is automatically created.  Supply valid values for your parameters below.  The parameters in brackets are optional.
```azurecli
az login
az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-acr [--acr <acr-name-or-resource-id>]
```
This step may take several minutes to complete.

## Create ACR integration for existing AKS clusters

Integrate ACR with existing ACR clusters by supplying valid values for **acr-name** and **acr-resource-id** below.

```azurecli
az aks update -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-acr --acr <acrName>
az aks update -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-acr --acr <acr-resource-id>
```

## Log in to your ACR

Use the following command to Log in to your ACR.  Replace the <acrname> parameter with your ACR name.  For example, the default is **aks<your-resource-group>acr**.

```azurecli
az acr login -n <acrName>
```

## Pull an image from docker hub and push to your ACR

Pull an image from docker hub, tag the image, and push to your ACR.

```console
acrloginservername=$(az acr show -n <acrname> -g <myResourceGroup> --query loginServer -o tsv)
docker pull nginx
```

```
$ docker tag nginx $acrloginservername/nginx:v1
$ docker push $acrloginservername/nginx:v1

The push refers to repository [someacr1.azurecr.io/nginx]

```

## Update the state and verify pods

Perform the following steps to verify your deployment.

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster
```

View the yaml file, and edit the image property by replacing the value with your ACR login server, image, and tag.

```
$ cat acr-nginx.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx0-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx0-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx0
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: <replace this image property with you acr login server, image and tag>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

$ kubectl apply -f acr-nginx.yaml
$ kubectl get pods

You should have two running pods.

NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx0-deployment-669dfc4d4b-x74kr   1/1     Running   0          20s
nginx0-deployment-669dfc4d4b-xdpd6   1/1     Running   0          20s
```
