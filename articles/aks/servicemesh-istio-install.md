# Install and use Istio in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[Istio][istio-github] is an open-source service mesh that provides a key set of functionality across the microservices in a Kubernetes cluster. These features include traffic management, service identity and security, policy enforcement, and observability. For more information about Istio, see the official [What is Istio?][istio-docs-concepts] documentation.

This article shows you how to install Istio. The Istio `istioctl` client binary is installed onto your client machine and the Istio components are installed into a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.

> [!NOTE]
> The following instructions reference Istio version `1.4.0`.
>
> The Istio `1.4.x` releases have been tested by the Istio team against Kubernetes versions `1.13`, `1.14`, `1.15`. You can find additional Istio versions at [GitHub - Istio Releases][istio-github-releases], information about each of the releases at [Istio News][istio-release-notes] and supported Kubernetes versions at [Istio General FAQ][istio-faq].

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download and install the Istio istioctl client binary
> * Install Istio on AKS
> * Validate the Istio installation
> * Access the add-ons
> * Uninstall Istio from AKS

## Before you begin

The steps detailed in this article assume that you've created an AKS cluster (Kubernetes `1.13` and above, with RBAC enabled) and have established a `kubectl` connection with the cluster. If you need help with any of these items, then see the [AKS quickstart][aks-quickstart].

Make sure that you have read the [Istio Performance and Scalability](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/performance-and-scalability/) documentation to understand the additional resource requirements for running Istio in your AKS cluster. The core and memory requirements will vary based on your specific workload. Choose an appropriate number of nodes and VM size to cater for your setup.

This article separates the Istio installation guidance into several discrete steps. The end result is the same in structure as the official Istio installation [guidance][istio-install-istioctl].

## Install the Istio components on AKS

We'll be installing [Grafana][grafana] and [Kiali][kiali] as part of our Istio installation. Grafana provides analytics and monitoring dashboards, and Kiali provides a service mesh observability dashboard. In our setup, each of these components requires credentials that must be provided as a [Secret][kubernetes-secrets].

Before we can install the Istio components, we must create the secrets for both Grafana and Kiali. These secrets need to be installed into the `istio-system` namespace that will be used by Istio, so we'll need to create the namespace too. We need to use the `--save-config` option when creating the namespace via `kubectl create` so that the Istio installer can run `kubectl apply` on this object in the future.

```console
kubectl create namespace istio-system --save-config
```

::: zone-end

### Install Istio components

Now that we've successfully created the Grafana and Kiali secrets in our AKS cluster, it's time to install the Istio components. 

The [Helm][helm] installation approach for Istio will be deprecated in the future. The new installation approach for Istio leverages the `istioctl` client binary, the [Istio configuration profiles][istio-configuration-profiles], and the new [Istio control plane spec and api][istio-control-plane]. This new approach is what we'll be using to install Istio.

> [!NOTE]
> Istio currently must be scheduled to run on Linux nodes. If you have Windows Server nodes in your cluster, you must ensure that the Istio pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes. We'll use [node selectors][kubernetes-node-selectors] to make sure pods are scheduled to the correct nodes.

> [!CAUTION]
> The [SDS (secret discovery service)][istio-feature-sds] and [Istio CNI][istio-feature-cni] Istio features are currently in [Alpha][istio-feature-stages], so thought should be given before enabling these. In addition, the [Service Account Token Volume Projection][kubernetes-feature-sa-projected-volume] Kubernetes feature (a requirement for SDS) is not enabled in current AKS versions.

Create a file called `istio.aks.yaml` with the following content. This file will hold the [Istio control plane spec][istio-control-plane] details for configuring Istio.

```yaml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha2
kind: IstioControlPlane
spec:
  # Use the default profile as the base
  # More details at: https://istio.io/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/
  profile: default
  values:
    global:
      # Ensure that the Istio pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes
      defaultNodeSelector:
        beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
      # Enable mutual TLS for the control plane
      controlPlaneSecurityEnabled: true
      mtls:
        # Require all service to service communication to have mtls
        enabled: false
    grafana:
      # Enable Grafana deployment for analytics and monitoring dashboards
      enabled: true
      security:
        # Enable authentication for Grafana
        enabled: true
    kiali:
      # Enable the Kiali deployment for a service mesh observability dashboard
      enabled: true
    tracing:
      # Enable the Jaeger deployment for tracing
      enabled: true
```

Install istio using the `istioctl apply` command and the above `istio.aks.yaml` Istio control plane spec file as follows:

```console
istioctl manifest apply -f istio.aks.yaml
```

The installer will deploy a number of [CRDs][kubernetes-crd] and then manage dependencies to install all of the relevant objects defined for this configuration of Istio. You should see something like the following output snippet.

```console

...
```

At this point, you've deployed Istio to your AKS cluster. To ensure that we have a successful deployment of Istio, let's move on to the next section to [Validate the Istio installation](#validate-the-istio-installation).

## Validate the Istio installation

First confirm that the expected services have been created. Use the [kubectl get svc][kubectl-get] command to view the running services. Query the `istio-system` namespace, where the Istio and add-on components were installed by the `istio` Helm chart:

```console
kubectl get svc --namespace istio-system --output wide
```

The following example output shows the services that should now be running:

- `istio-*` services
- `jaeger-*`, `tracing`, and `zipkin` add-on tracing services
- `prometheus` add-on metrics service
- `grafana` add-on analytics and monitoring dashboard service
- `kiali` add-on service mesh dashboard service

If the `istio-ingressgateway` shows an external ip of `<pending>`, wait a few minutes until an IP address has been assigned by Azure networking.

```console

```

Next, confirm that the required pods have been created. Use the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command, and again query the `istio-system` namespace:

```console
kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system
```

The following example output shows the pods that are running:

- the `istio-*` pods
- the `prometheus-*` add-on metrics pod
- the `grafana-*` add-on analytics and monitoring dashboard pod
- the `kiali` add-on service mesh dashboard pod

```console

prometheus-7c7cf9dbd6-rjxcv                   1/1     Running   0          94s
```

All of the pods should show a status of `Running`. If your pods don't have these statuses, wait a minute or two until they do. If any pods report an issue, use the [kubectl describe pod][kubectl-describe] command to review their output and status.

## Accessing the add-ons

A number of add-ons were installed by Istio in our setup above that provide additional functionality. The web applications for the add-ons are **not** exposed publicly via an external ip address. 

To access the add-on user interfaces, use the `istioctl dashboard` command. This command leverages [kubectl port-forward][kubectl-port-forward] and a random port to create a secure connection between your client machine and the relevant pod in your AKS cluster. It will then automatically open the add-on web application in your default browser.

We added an additional layer of security for Grafana and Kiali by specifying credentials for them earlier in this article.

### Grafana

The analytics and monitoring dashboards for Istio are provided by [Grafana][grafana]. Remember to use the credentials you created via the Grafana secret earlier when prompted. Open the Grafana dashboard securely as follows:

```console
istioctl dashboard grafana
```

### Prometheus

Metrics for Istio are provided by [Prometheus][prometheus]. Open the Prometheus dashboard securely as follows:

```console
istioctl dashboard prometheus
```

### Jaeger

Tracing within Istio is provided by [Jaeger][jaeger]. Open the Jaeger dashboard securely as follows:

```console
istioctl dashboard jaeger
```

### Kiali

A service mesh observability dashboard is provided by [Kiali][kiali]. Remember to use the credentials you created via the Kiali secret earlier when prompted. Open the Kiali dashboard securely as follows:

```console
istioctl dashboard kiali
```

### Envoy

A simple interface to the [Envoy][envoy] proxies is available. It provides configuration information and metrics for an Envoy proxy running in a specified pod. Open the Envoy interface securely as follows:

```console
istioctl dashboard envoy <pod-name>.<namespace>
```

## Uninstall Istio from AKS

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting Istio from a running system may result in traffic related issues between your services. Ensure that you have made provisions for your system to still operate correctly without Istio before proceeding.

### Remove Istio components and namespace

To remove Istio from your AKS cluster, use the `istioctl manifest generate` command with the `istio.aks.yaml` Istio control plane spec file. This will generate the deployed manifest, which we will pipe to `kubectl delete` in order to remove all the installed components and the `istio-system` namespace.

```console
istioctl manifest generate -f istio.aks.yaml | kubectl delete -f -
```

### Remove Istio CRDs and Secrets

The above commands delete all the Istio components and namespace, but we are still left with generated Istio secrets.
