# Azure security baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: By default, a network security group and route table are automatically created with the creation of a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. AKS automatically modifies network security groups for appropriate traffic flow as services are created with load balancers, port mappings, or ingress routes. The network security group is automatically associated with the virtual NICs on customer nodes and the route table with the subnet on the virtual network. 

Use AKS network policies to limit network traffic by defining rules for ingress and egress traffic between Linux pods in a cluster based on choice of namespaces and label selectors. Network policy usage requires the Azure CNI plug-in with defined virtual network and subnets and can only be enabled at cluster creation. They cannot be deployed on an existing AKS cluster.

You can implement a private AKS cluster to ensure network traffic between your AKS API server and node pools remains only on the private network. The control plane or API server, resides in an AKS-managed Azure subscription and uses internal (RFC1918) IP addresses, while the customer's cluster or node pool is in their own subscription. The server and the cluster or node pool communicate
with each other using the Azure Private Link service in the API server virtual network and a private endpoint that's exposed in the subnet of the customer's AKS cluster.  Alternatively, use a public endpoint for the AKS API server but restrict access with the AKS API Server's Authorized IP Ranges feature.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Use Security Center and follow its network protection recommendations to secure the network resources being used by your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. 

Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. You can also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Use an Azure Application Gateway enabled Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of an AKS cluster to provide an additional layer of security by filtering the incoming traffic to your web applications. Azure WAF uses a set of rules, provided by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), for attacks, such as, cross site scripting or cookie poisoning against this traffic. 

Use an API gateway for authentication, authorization, throttling, caching, transformation, and monitoring for APIs used in your AKS environment. An API gateway serves as a front door to the microservices, decouples clients from your microservices, and decreases the complexity of your microservices by removing the burden of handling cross cutting concerns.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable Microsoft Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) Standard protection on the virtual networks where Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) components are deployed for protections against DDoS attacks.
Install the network policy engine and create Kubernetes network policies to control the flow of traffic between pods in AKS as, by default, all traffic is allowed between these pods. Network policy should only be used for Linux-based nodes and pods in AKS. Define rules that limit pod communication for improved security. 

Choose to allow or deny traffic based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. The required network policies can be automatically applied as pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster.

- [How to configure DDoS protection](../virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Use Network Watcher packet capture as required for investigating anomalous activity. 

Network Watcher is enabled automatically in your virtual network's region when you create or update a virtual network in your subscription. You can also create new instances of Network Watcher using PowerShell, the Azure CLI, the REST API, or ARMClient method

- [How to enable Network Watcher](../network-watcher/network-watcher-create.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with an Azure Application Gateway enabled with a Web Application Firewall (WAF). 

If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection or behavior analytics is not a requirement, an Azure Application Gateway with WAF can be used and configured in "detection mode" to log alerts and threats, or "prevention mode" to actively block detected intrusions and attacks.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

**Guidance**: Use an Azure Application Gateway-enabled Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of an AKS cluster to filter the incoming traffic. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a set of rules which are used in the Azure WAF to watch for attacks like cross site scripting or cookie poisoning.

Apply Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) tags to applications for ease of use in setting up application rules within a network security group. After setting up the network rules. Add an application rule using an FQDN tag, for example, AzureKubernetesService, which includes all required FQDNs accessible through TCP port 443 and port 80.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups associated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances. Service tags can be used in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules to allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service by specifying the service tag name. 

Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

Apply an Azure tag to node pools in your AKS cluster. They are different than the virtual network service tags, and are applied to each node within the node pool and persist through upgrades.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations with Azure Policy for network resources associated with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. 
Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ContainerService" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your AKS clusters. 

Also, use built-in policy definitions related to AKS, such as:

•	Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services

•	Enforce HTTPS ingress in Kubernetes cluster

•	Ensure services listen only on allowed ports in Kubernetes cluster

- [Azure Policy samples for networking](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md#network)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for network security groups and other resources for  traffic flow to and from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Use the "Description" field for individual network security group rules to specify business need and/or duration, and so on, for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.
Use any of the built-in Azure Policy tagging-related definitions, for example, "Require tag and its value" that ensure that all resources are created with tags and to receive notifications for existing untagged resources.

Choose to allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors with network policies. Use these namespaces and labels as descriptors for traffic configuration rules. Use Azure PowerShell or Azure command-line interface (CLI) to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes for network resources related to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. 

Create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to critical network resources take place. Any entries from the AzureContainerService user in the activity logs are logged as platform actions. 

Use Azure Monitor logs to enable and query the logs from AKS the master components, kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager. 
Create and manage the nodes that run the kubelet with container runtime and deploy their applications through the managed Kubernetes API server.

### 2.4: Collect security logs from operating systems

**Guidance**: Enable automatic installation of Log Analytics agents for collecting data from the AKS cluster nodes. Also, turn-on automatic provisioning of the Azure Log Analytics Monitoring Agent from Azure Security Center, as by default, automatic provisioning is off. The agent can also be installed manually. With automatic provisioning on, Security Center deploys the Log Analytics agent on all supported Azure VMs and any new ones that are created. 
Security center collects data from Azure Virtual Machines (VM), virtual machine scale sets, and IaaS containers, such as Kubernetes cluster nodes, to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats. Data is collected using the Azure Log Analytics Agent, which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your workspace for analysis. 

Data collection is required to provide visibility into missing updates, misconfigured OS security settings, endpoint protection status, and health and threat detections.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: The two primary types of storage provided for volumes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are backed by Azure Disks or Azure Files. Both types of storage use Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE), which encrypts data at rest to improve security. By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys.

Encryption-at-rest using customer-managed keys is available for encrypting both the OS and data disks on AKS clusters for additional control over encryption keys. Customers own the responsibility for key management activities such as key backup and rotation. Disks cannot currently be encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption at the AKS node level.

## Secure configuration

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Secure configuration](../security/benchmarks/security-control-secure-configuration.md).*

### 7.1: Establish secure configurations for all Azure resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ContainerService" namespace to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances. Use built-in Azure Policy definitions.

Examples of built-in policy definitions for AKS include:

•	Enforce HTTPS ingress in Kubernetes cluster

•	Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services

•	Based Access Control (RBAC) should be used on Kubernetes Services

•	Ensure only allowed container images in Kubernetes cluster

Export a template of your AKS configuration in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) with Azure Resource Manager. Review it periodically to ensure that these configurations meet the security requirements for your organization. Use the recommendations from Azure Security Center as a secure configuration baseline for your Azure resources.

### 7.11: Manage Azure secrets securely

**Guidance**: Integrate Azure Key Vault with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using a FlexVolume drive. Use Azure Key Vault to store and regularly rotate secrets such as credentials, storage account keys, or certificates. The FlexVolume driver lets the AKS cluster natively retrieve credentials from Key Vault and securely provide them only to the requesting pod. 
Use a pod managed identity to request access to Key Vault and retrieve the required credentials through the FlexVolume driver. Ensure Key Vault Soft Delete is enabled. 

Limit credential exposure by not defining credentials in your application code. 

Avoid the use of fixed or shared credentials.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 7.12: Manage identities securely and automatically

**Guidance**: Do not define credentials in your application code as a security best practice. Use managed identities for Azure resources to let a pod authenticate itself against any service in Azure that supports it, including Azure Key Vault. The pod is assigned an Azure Identity to authenticate to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and receive a digital token which can be presented to other Azure services that check if the pod is authorized to access the service and perform the required actions. 

Note that Pod managed identities are intended for use with Linux pods and container images only. Provision Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve digital keys and credentials. Keys such as the ones used to encrypt OS disks, AKS cluster data can be stored in Azure Key Vault.

Service principals can also be used in AKS clusters. However, clusters using service principals eventually may reach a state in which the service principal must be renewed to keep the cluster working. Managing service principals adds complexity, which is why it's easier to use managed identities instead. The same permission requirements apply for both service principals and managed identities.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Prioritize which alerts must be investigated first with Security Center assigned severity to alerts. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.
Clearly mark subscriptions (for example, production, non-production) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.
