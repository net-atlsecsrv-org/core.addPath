# Linkerd

## Overview

[Linkerd][linkerd] is an easy to use and lightweight service mesh.

## Architecture

Linkerd provides a data plane that is composed of ultralight [Linkerd][linkerd-proxy] specialised proxy sidecars. These intelligent proxies control all network traffic in and out of your meshed apps and workloads. The proxies also expose metrics via [Prometheus][prometheus] metrics endpoints.

The control plane manages the configuration and aggregated telemetry via the following [components][linkerd-architecture]:

- **Controller** - Provides api that drives the Linkerd CLI and Dashboard. Provides configuration for proxies.

- **Tap** - Establish real-time watches on requests and responses.

- **Identity** - Provides identity and security capabilities that allow for mTLS between services.

- **Web** - Provides the Linkerd dashboard.


The following architecture diagram demonstrates how the various components within the data plane and control plane interact.

## Selection criteria

It's important to understand and consider the following areas when evaluating Linkerd for your workloads:

- [Design Principles](#design-principles)
- [Capabilities](#capabilities)
- [Scenarios](#scenarios)


### Design principles

The following design principles [guide][design-principles] the Linkerd project:

- **Keep it Simple** - Must be easy to use and understand.

- **Minimize Resource Requirements** - Impose minimal performance and resource cost.

- **Just Work** - Don't break existing applications and don't require complex configuration.


### Capabilities

Linkerd provides the following set of capabilities:

- **Mesh** – built in debugging option

- **Traffic Management** – splitting, timeouts, retries, ingress

- **Security** – encryption (mTLS), certificates autorotated every 24 hours

- **Observability** – golden metrics, tap, tracing, service profiles and per route metrics, web dashboard with topology graphs, prometheus, grafana


### Scenarios

Linkerd is well suited to and suggested for the following scenarios:

- Simple to use with just the essential set of capability requirements

- Low latency, low overhead, with focus on observability and simple traffic management
