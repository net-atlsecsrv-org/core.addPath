# Tutorial: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. With AKS, you can quickly create a production ready Kubernetes cluster. In this tutorial, part three of seven, a Kubernetes cluster is deployed in AKS. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy a Kubernetes AKS cluster that can authenticate to an Azure container registry
> * Install the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
> * Configure kubectl to connect to your AKS cluster

In later tutorials, the Azure Vote application is deployed to the cluster, scaled, and updated.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, a container image was created and uploaded to an Azure Container Registry instance. If you haven't done these steps, and would like to follow along, start at [Tutorial 1 â€“ Create container images][aks-tutorial-prepare-app].

This tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.0.53 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

AKS clusters can use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC). These controls let you define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. Permissions are combined if a user is assigned multiple roles, and permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster. By default, the Azure CLI automatically enables Kubernetes RBAC when you create an AKS cluster.

Create an AKS cluster using [az aks create][]. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*. This resource group was created in the [previous tutorial][aks-tutorial-prepare-acr] in the *eastus* region. The following example does not specify a region so the AKS cluster is also created in the *eastus* region. For more information, see [Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][quotas-skus-regions] for more information about resource limits and region availability for AKS.

To allow an AKS cluster to interact with other Azure resources, a cluster identity is automatically created, since you did not specify one. Here, this cluster identity is [granted the right to pull images][container-registry-integration] from the Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance you created in the previous tutorial. To execute the command successfully, you're required to have an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role on the Azure subscription.

```azurecli
az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --node-count 2 \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --attach-acr <acrName>
```

To avoid needing an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role, you can also manually configure a service principal to pull images from ACR. For more information, see [ACR authentication with service principals](../container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal.md) or [Authenticate from Kubernetes with a pull secret](../container-registry/container-registry-auth-kubernetes.md). Alternatively, you can use a [managed identity](use-managed-identity.md) instead of a service principal for easier management.

After a few minutes, the deployment completes, and returns JSON-formatted information about the AKS deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure your cluster to operate reliably, you should run at least 2 (two) nodes.

## Install the Kubernetes CLI

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use [kubectl][kubectl], the Kubernetes command-line client.

If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl` is already installed. You can also install it locally using the [az aks install-cli][] command:

```azurecli
az aks install-cli
```

## Connect to cluster using kubectl

To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the [az aks get-credentials][] command. The following example gets credentials for the AKS cluster named *myAKSCluster* in the *myResourceGroup*:

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

To verify the connection to your cluster, run the [kubectl get nodes][kubectl-get] command to return a list of the cluster nodes:

```
$ kubectl get nodes

NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-nodepool1-37463671-vmss000000   Ready    agent   2m37s   v1.18.10
aks-nodepool1-37463671-vmss000001   Ready    agent   2m28s   v1.18.10
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, a Kubernetes cluster was deployed in AKS, and you configured `kubectl` to connect to it. You learned how to:

> * Install the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
> * Configure kubectl to connect to your AKS cluster

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to deploy an application to the cluster.
