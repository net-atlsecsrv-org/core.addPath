#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn how to deploy apps to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster so that I can deploy and run my own applications.

# Tutorial: Run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. You build and deploy your own applications and services into a Kubernetes cluster, and let the cluster manage the availability and connectivity. In this tutorial, part four of seven, a sample application is deployed into a Kubernetes cluster. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Update a Kubernetes manifest file
> * Run an application in Kubernetes
> * Test the application

In additional tutorials, this application is scaled out and updated.

This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, an application was packaged into a container image, this image was uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and a Kubernetes cluster was created.

To complete this tutorial, you need the pre-created `azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml` Kubernetes manifest file. This file was downloaded with the application source code in a previous tutorial. Verify that you've cloned the repo, and that you have changed directories into the cloned repo. If you haven't done these steps, and would like to follow along, start with [Tutorial 1 â€“ Create container images][aks-tutorial-prepare-app].

This tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.0.53 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Update the manifest file

In these tutorials, an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance stores the container image for the sample application. To deploy the application, you must update the image name in the Kubernetes manifest file to include the ACR login server name.

Get the ACR login server name using the [az acr list][az-acr-list] command as follows:

```azurecli
az acr list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
```

The sample manifest file from the git repo cloned in the first tutorial uses the login server name of *microsoft*. Make sure that you're in the cloned *azure-voting-app-redis* directory, then open the manifest file with a text editor, such as `vi`:

```console
vi azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
```

Replace *microsoft* with your ACR login server name. The image name is found on line 51 of the manifest file. The following example shows the default image name:

```yaml
containers:
- name: azure-vote-front
  image: microsoft/azure-vote-front:v1
```

Provide your own ACR login server name so that your manifest file looks like the following example:

```yaml
containers:
- name: azure-vote-front
  image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
```

Save and close the file. In `vi`, use `:wq`.

## Deploy the application

To deploy your application, use the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command. This command parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects. Specify the sample manifest file, as shown in the following example:

```console
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
```

The following example output shows the resources successfully created in the AKS cluster:

```
$ kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml

deployment "azure-vote-back" created
service "azure-vote-back" created
deployment "azure-vote-front" created
service "azure-vote-front" created
```

## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

```console
kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
```

Initially the *EXTERNAL-IP* for the *azure-vote-front* service is shown as *pending*:

```
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.34.242   <pending>     80:30676/TCP   5s
```

When the *EXTERNAL-IP* address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process. The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

```
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.34.242   52.179.23.131   80:30676/TCP   67s
```

To see the application in action, open a web browser to the external IP address of your service:

If the application didn't load, it might be due to an authorization problem with your image registry. To view the status of your containers, use the `kubectl get pods` command. If the container images can't be pulled, see [allow access to Container Registry with a Kubernetes secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-aks#access-with-kubernetes-secret).

## Next steps

In this tutorial, a sample Azure vote application was deployed to a Kubernetes cluster in AKS. You learned how to:

> * Update a Kubernetes manifest files
> * Run an application in Kubernetes
> * Test the application

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to scale a Kubernetes application and the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.
