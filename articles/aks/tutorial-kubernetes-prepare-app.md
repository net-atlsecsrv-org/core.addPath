#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn how to build a container-based application so that I can deploy the app to Azure Kubernetes Service.

# Tutorial: Prepare an application for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this tutorial, part one of seven, a multi-container application is prepared for use in Kubernetes. Existing development tools such as Docker Compose are used to locally build and test an application. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Clone a sample application source from GitHub
> * Create a container image from the sample application source
> * Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In additional tutorials, the container image is uploaded to an Azure Container Registry, and then deployed into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker` commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker][docker-get-started].

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac][docker-for-mac], [Windows][docker-for-windows], or [Linux][docker-for-linux] system.

Azure Cloud Shell does not include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The sample application used in this tutorial is a basic voting app. The application consists of a front-end web component and a back-end Redis instance. The web component is packaged into a custom container image. The Redis instance uses an unmodified image from Docker Hub.

Use [git][] to clone the sample application to your development environment:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis.git
```

Change into the cloned directory.

```console
cd azure-voting-app-redis
```

Inside the directory is the application source code, a pre-created Docker compose file, and a Kubernetes manifest file. These files are used throughout the tutorial set.

## Create container images

[Docker Compose][docker-compose] can be used to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

Use the sample `docker-compose.yaml` file to create the container image, download the Redis image, and start the application:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

When completed, use the [docker images][docker-images] command to see the created images. Three images have been downloaded or created. The *azure-vote-front* image contains the front-end application and uses the `nginx-flask` image as a base. The `redis` image is used to start a Redis instance.

```
$ docker images

REPOSITORY                   TAG        IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
azure-vote-front             latest     9cc914e25834        40 seconds ago      694MB
redis                        latest     a1b99da73d05        7 days ago          106MB
tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask   flask      788ca94b2313        9 months ago        694MB
```

Run the [docker ps][docker-ps] command to see the running containers:

```
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                           NAMES
82411933e8f9        azure-vote-front  "/usr/bin/supervisord"   57 seconds ago      Up 30 seconds       443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   azure-vote-front
b68fed4b66b6        redis             "docker-entrypoint..."   57 seconds ago      Up 30 seconds       0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp          azure-vote-back
```

## Test application locally

To see the running application, enter `http://localhost:8080` in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

![Image of Kubernetes cluster on Azure](./media/container-service-tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app/azure-vote.png)

## Clean up resources

Now that the application's functionality has been validated, the running containers can be stopped and removed. Do not delete the container images - in the next tutorial, the *azure-vote-front* image is uploaded to an Azure Container Registry instance.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources with the [docker-compose down][docker-compose-down] command:

```console
docker-compose down
```

When the local application has been removed, you have a Docker image that contains the Azure Vote application, *azure-front-front*, for use with the next tutorial.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, an application was tested and container images created for the application. You learned how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Clone a sample application source from GitHub
> * Create a container image from the sample application source
> * Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to store container images in Azure Container Registry.
