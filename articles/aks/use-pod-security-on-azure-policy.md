# Secure pods with Azure Policy (Preview)

To improve the security of your AKS cluster, you can control what functions pods are granted and if anything is running against company policy. This access is defined through built-in policies provided by the [Azure Policy Add-on for AKS][kubernetes-policy-reference]. By providing additional control over the security aspects of your pod's specification, like root privileges, enables stricter security adherence and visibility into what is deployed in your cluster. If a pod does not meet conditions specified in the policy, Azure Policy can disallow the pod to start or flag a violation. This article shows you how to use Azure Policy to limit the deployment of pods in AKS.

[!INCLUDE [preview features callout](./includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

### Install the Azure Policy Add-on for AKS

To secure AKS pods through Azure Policy, you need to install the Azure Policy Add-on for AKS on an AKS cluster. Follow these [steps to install the Azure Policy Add-on](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks).

This document assumes you have the following which are deployed in the walk-through linked above.

* Registered the `Microsoft.ContainerService` and `Microsoft.PolicyInsights` resource providers using `az provider register`
* Registered the `AKS-AzurePolicyAutoApprove` preview feature flag using `az feature register`
* Azure CLI installed with the `aks-preview` extension version 0.4.53 or greater
* An AKS cluster on a supported version of 1.15 or greater installed with the Azure Policy Add-on

## Overview of securing pods with Azure Policy for AKS (Preview)

>[!NOTE]
> This document details how to use Azure Policy to secure pods, which is the successor to the [Kubernetes pod security policy feature in preview](use-pod-security-policies.md).
> **Both pod security policy (preview) and the Azure Policy Add-on for AKS cannot be enabled simultaneously.**
> 
> If installing the Azure Policy Add-on into a cluster with pod security policy enabled, [follow these steps to disable pod security policy](use-pod-security-policies.md#enable-pod-security-policy-on-an-aks-cluster).

In an AKS cluster, an admission controller is used to intercept requests to the API server when a resource is to be created and updated. The admission controller can then *validate* the resource request against a set of rules on whether it should be created.

Previously, the feature [pod security policy (preview)](use-pod-security-policies.md) was enabled through the Kubernetes project to limit what pods can be deployed.

By using the Azure Policy Add-on, an AKS cluster can use built-in Azure policies which secure pods and other Kubernetes resources similar to pod security policy previously. The Azure Policy Add-on for AKS installs a managed instance of [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), a validating admission controller. Azure Policy for Kubernetes is built on the open-source Open Policy Agent which relies on the [Rego policy language](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#policy-language).

This document details how to use Azure Policy to secure pods in an AKS cluster and instruct how to migrate from pod security policies (preview).

## Limitations

* During preview, a limit of 200 pods with 20 Azure Policy for Kubernetes policies can run in a single cluster.
* [Some system namespaces](#namespace-exclusion) containing AKS managed pods are excluded from policy evaluation.
* Windows pods [do not support for security contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#what-profiles-should-i-apply-to-my-windows-pods), thus many Azure policies only apply to Linux pods, such as disallowing root privileges, which cannot be escalated in Windows pods.
* Pod security policy and the Azure Policy Add-on for AKS cannot both be enabled. If installing the Azure Policy Add-on into a cluster with pod security policy enabled, disable the pod security policy with the [following instructions](use-pod-security-policies.md#enable-pod-security-policy-on-an-aks-cluster).

## Azure policies to secure Kubernetes pods

After installing the Azure Policy Add-on, no policies are applied by default.

There are eleven (11) built-in individual Azure policies and two (2) built-in initiatives that specifically secure pods in an AKS cluster.
Each policy can be customized with an effect. A full list of [AKS policies and their supported effects is listed here][policy-samples]. Read more about [Azure Policy effects](../governance/policy/concepts/effects.md).

Azure policies can be applied at the management group, subscription or resource group level. When assigning a policy at the resource group level, ensure the target AKS cluster's resource group is selected within scope of the policy. Every cluster in the assigned scope with the Azure Policy Add-on installed is in scope for the policy.

If using [pod security policy (preview)](use-pod-security-policies.md), learn how to [migrate to Azure Policy and about other behavioral differences](#migrate-from-kubernetes-pod-security-policy-to-azure-policy).

### Built-in policy initiatives

An initiative in Azure Policy is a collection of policy definitions that are tailored towards achieving a singular overarching goal. The use of initiatives can simplify the management and assignment of policies across AKS clusters. An initiative exists as a single object, learn more about [Azure Policy initiatives](../governance/policy/overview.md#initiative-definition).

Azure Policy for Kubernetes offers two built-in initiatives which secure pods, [baseline](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2Fa8640138-9b0a-4a28-b8cb-1666c838647d) and [restricted](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2F42b8ef37-b724-4e24-bbc8-7a7708edfe00).

Both built-in initiatives are built from definitions used in [pod security policy from Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/content/en/examples/policy/baseline-psp.yaml).

### Additional optional policies

There are additional Azure policies which can be singly applied outside of applying an initiative. Consider appending these policies in addition to initiatives if your requirements are not met by the built-in initiatives.

### Unsupported built-in policies for managed AKS clusters

> [!NOTE]
> The following 3 policies are **not supported in AKS** due to customizing aspects managed and secured by AKS as a managed service. These policies are built specifically for Azure Arc connected clusters with unmanaged control planes.

|[Pod security policy control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#what-is-a-pod-security-policy)|
|---|
|Define the custom SELinux context of a container|
|Restrict the sysctl profile used by containers|
|Default Proc Mount types are defined to reduce attack surface|

<!---
# Removing until custom initiatives are supported the week after preview

#### Custom initiative

If the built-in initiatives to address pod security do not match your requirements, you can choose your own policies to exist in a custom initiative. Read more about [building custom initatives in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage#create-and-assign-an-initiative-definition).

--->

### Namespace exclusion

> [!WARNING]
> Pods in admin namespaces such as kube-system must run for a cluster to remain healthy, removing a required namespace from the the list of default excluded namespaces may trigger policy violations due to a required system pod.

AKS requires system pods to run on a cluster to provide critical services, such as DNS resolution. Policies which limit pod functionality can impact the ability system pod stability. As a result, the following namespaces are **excluded from policy evaluation during admission requests during create, update and policy auditing**. This forces new deployments to these namespaces to be excluded from Azure policies.

1. kube-system
1. gatekeeper-system
1. azure-arc
1. aks-periscope

Additional custom namespaces can be excluded from evaluation during create, update, and audit. This should be used if you have specialized pods that run in a sanctioned namespace and want to avoid triggering audit violations.

## Apply the baseline initiative

> [!TIP]
> All policies default to an audit effect. Effects can be updated to deny at any time through Azure Policy.

To apply the baseline initiative, we can assign through the Azure portal.
<!--
1. Navigate to the Policy service in Azure portal
1. In the left pane of the Azure Policy page, select **Definitions**
1. Search for "Baseline Profile" on the search pane to the right of the page
1. Select `Kubernetes Pod Security Standards Baseline Profile for Linux-based workloads` from the `Kubernetes` category
-->
1. Follow [this link to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2Fa8640138-9b0a-4a28-b8cb-1666c838647d) to review the pod security baseline initiative
1. Set the **Scope** to the subscription level or only the resource group holding AKS clusters with the Azure Policy Add-on enabled
1. Select the **Parameters** page and update the **Effect** from `audit` to `deny` to block new deployments violating the baseline initiative
1. Add additional namespaces to exclude from evaluation during create, update, and audit, [some namespaces are forcibly excluded from policy evaluation.](#namespace-exclusion)
![update effect](media/use-pod-security-on-azure-policy/update-effect.png)
1. Select **Review + create** to submit the policies

Confirm policies are applied to your cluster by running `kubectl get constrainttemplates`.

> [!NOTE]
> Policies can take [up to 20 minutes to sync](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#assign-a-built-in-policy-definition) into each cluster.

The output should be similar to:

```console
$ kubectl get constrainttemplate
NAME                                     AGE
k8sazureallowedcapabilities              30m
k8sazureblockhostnamespace               30m
k8sazurecontainernoprivilege             30m
k8sazurehostfilesystem                   30m
k8sazurehostnetworkingports              30m
```

## Validate rejection of a privileged pod

Let's first test what happens when you schedule a pod with the security context of `privileged: true`. This security context escalates the pod's privileges. The baseline initiative disallows privileged pods, so the request will be denied resulting in the deployment being rejected.

Create a file named `nginx-privileged.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-privileged
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-privileged
      image: nginx
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
```

Create the pod with [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f nginx-privileged.yaml
```

As expected the pod fails to be scheduled, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f privileged.yaml

Error from server ([denied by azurepolicy-container-no-privilege-00edd87bf80f443fa51d10910255adbc4013d590bec3d290b4f48725d4dfbdf9] Privileged container is not allowed: nginx-privileged, securityContext: {"privileged": true}): error when creating "privileged.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [denied by azurepolicy-container-no-privilege-00edd87bf80f443fa51d10910255adbc4013d590bec3d290b4f48725d4dfbdf9] Privileged container is not allowed: nginx-privileged, securityContext: {"privileged": true}
```

The pod doesn't reach the scheduling stage, so there are no resources to delete before you move on.

## Test creation of an unprivileged pod

In the previous example, the container image automatically tried to use root to bind NGINX to port 80. This request was denied by the baseline policy initiative, so the pod fails to start. Let's try now running that same NGINX pod without privileged access.

Create a file named `nginx-unprivileged.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-unprivileged
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-unprivileged
      image: nginx
```

Create the pod using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f nginx-unprivileged.yaml
```

The pod is successfully scheduled. When you check the status of the pod using the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command, the pod is *Running*:

```console
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-unprivileged   1/1     Running   0          18s
```

This example shows the baseline initiative affecting only deployments which violate policies in the collection. Allowed deployments continue to function.

Delete the NGINX unprivileged pod using the [kubectl delete][kubectl-delete] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl delete -f nginx-unprivileged.yaml
```

## Disable policies and the Azure Policy Add-on

To remove the baseline initiative:

1. Navigate to the Policy pane on the Azure portal
1. Select **Assignments** from the left pane
1. Click the "..." button next to the Baseline Profile
1. Select "Delete assignment"

![Delete assignment](media/use-pod-security-on-azure-policy/delete-assignment.png)

To disable the Azure Policy Add-on, use the [az aks disable-addons][az-aks-disable-addons] command.

```azurecli
az aks disable-addons --addons azure-policy --name MyAKSCluster --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

Learn how to remove the [Azure Policy Add-on from Azure portal](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#remove-the-add-on-from-aks).

## Migrate from Kubernetes pod security policy to Azure Policy

To migrate from pod security policy you need to take the following actions on a cluster.

1. [Disable pod security policy](use-pod-security-policies.md#clean-up-resources) on the cluster
1. Enable the [Azure Policy Add-on][kubernetes-policy-reference]
1. Enable the desired Azure policies from [available built-in policies][policy-samples]

Below is a summary of behavior changes between pod security policy and Azure Policy.

|Scenario| Pod security policy | Azure Policy |
|---|---|---|
|Installation|Enable pod security policy feature |Enable Azure Policy Add-on
|Deploy policies| Deploy pod security policy resource| Assign Azure policies to the subscription or resource group scope. The Azure Policy Add-on is required for Kubernetes resource applications.
| Default policies | When pod security policy is enabled in AKS, default Privileged and Unrestricted policies are applied. | No default policies are applied by enabling the Azure Policy Add-on. You must explicitly enable policies in Azure Policy.
| Who can create and assign policies | Cluster admin creates a pod security policy resource | Users must have a minimum role of 'owner' or 'Resource Policy Contributor' permissions on the AKS cluster resource group. - Through API, users can assign policies at the AKS cluster resource scope. The user should have minimum of 'owner' or 'Resource Policy Contributor' permissions on AKS cluster resource. - In the Azure portal, policies can be assigned at the Management group/subscription/resource group level.
| Authorizing policies| Users and Service Accounts require explicit permissions to use pod security policies. | No additional assignment is required to authorize policies. Once policies are assigned in Azure, all cluster users can use these policies.
| Policy applicability | The admin user bypasses the enforcement of pod security policies. | All users (admin & non-admin) sees the same policies. There is no special casing based on users. Policy application can be excluded at the namespace level.
| Policy scope | Pod security policies are not namespaced | Constraint templates used by Azure Policy are not namespaced.
| Deny/Audit/Mutation action | Pod security policies support only deny actions. Mutation can be done with default values on create requests. Validation can be done during update requests.| Azure Policy supports both audit & deny actions. Mutation is not supported yet, but planned.
| Pod security policy compliance | There is no visibility on compliance of pods that existed before enabling pod security policy. Non-compliant pods created after enabling pod security policies are denied. | Non-compliant pods that existed before applying Azure policies would show up in policy violations. Non-compliant pods created after enabling Azure policies are denied if policies are set with a deny effect.
| How to view policies on the cluster | `kubectl get psp` | `kubectl get constrainttemplate` - All policies are returned.
| Pod security policy standard - Privileged | A privileged pod security policy resource is created by default when enabling the feature. | Privileged mode implies no restriction, as a result it is equivalent to not having any Azure Policy assignment.
| [Pod security policy standard - Baseline/default](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#baseline-default) | User installs a pod security policy baseline resource. | Azure Policy provides a [built-in baseline initiative](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2Fa8640138-9b0a-4a28-b8cb-1666c838647d) which maps to the baseline pod security policy.
| [Pod security policy standard - Restricted](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted) | User installs a pod security policy restricted resource. | Azure Policy provides a [built-in restricted initiative](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2F42b8ef37-b724-4e24-bbc8-7a7708edfe00) which maps to the restricted pod security policy.

## Next steps

This article showed you how to apply an Azure policy which restricts privileged pods from being deployed to prevent the use of privileged access. There are many policies which can be applied, such as those which restrict use of volumes. For more information on the available options, see the [Azure Policy for Kubernetes reference docs][kubernetes-policy-reference].

For more information about limiting pod network traffic, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS][network-policies].
