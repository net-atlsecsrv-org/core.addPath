# Create an ingress controller in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

An ingress controller is a piece of software that provides reverse proxy, configurable traffic routing, and TLS termination for Kubernetes services. Kubernetes ingress resources are used to configure the ingress rules and routes for individual Kubernetes services. Using an ingress controller and ingress rules, a single IP address can be used to route traffic to multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster.

This article shows you how to deploy the [NGINX ingress controller][nginx-ingress] in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Two applications are then run in the AKS cluster, each of which is accessible over the single IP address.

You can also:

- [Enable the HTTP application routing add-on][aks-http-app-routing]
- [Create an ingress controller that uses an internal, private network and IP address][aks-ingress-internal]
- [Create an ingress controller that uses your own TLS certificates][aks-ingress-own-tls]
- Create an ingress controller that uses Let's Encrypt to automatically generate TLS certificates [with a dynamic public IP address][aks-ingress-tls] or [with a static public IP address][aks-ingress-static-tls]

## Before you begin

This article uses [Helm 3][helm] to install the NGINX ingress controller. Make sure that you are using the latest release of Helm and have access to the *ingress-nginx* Helm repository.

This article also requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.64 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create an ingress controller

To create the ingress controller, use Helm to install *nginx-ingress*. For added redundancy, two replicas of the NGINX ingress controllers are deployed with the `--set controller.replicaCount` parameter. To fully benefit from running replicas of the ingress controller, make sure there's more than one node in your AKS cluster.

The ingress controller also needs to be scheduled on a Linux node. Windows Server nodes shouldn't run the ingress controller. A node selector is specified using the `--set nodeSelector` parameter to tell the Kubernetes scheduler to run the NGINX ingress controller on a Linux-based node.

> [!TIP]
> The following example creates a Kubernetes namespace for the ingress resources named *ingress-basic*. Specify a namespace for your own environment as needed.

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to enable [client source IP preservation][client-source-ip] for requests to containers in your cluster, add `--set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local` to the Helm install command. The client source IP is stored in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*. When using an ingress controller with client source IP preservation enabled, SSL pass-through will not work.

```console
# Create a namespace for your ingress resources
kubectl create namespace ingress-basic

# Add the ingress-nginx repository
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx

# Use Helm to deploy an NGINX ingress controller
helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-basic \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
```

When the Kubernetes load balancer service is created for the NGINX ingress controller, a dynamic public IP address is assigned, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl --namespace ingress-basic get services -o wide -w nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller

NAME                                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE   SELECTOR
nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.74.133   EXTERNAL_IP     80:32486/TCP,443:30953/TCP   44s   app.kubernetes.io/component=controller,app.kubernetes.io/instance=nginx-ingress,app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```

No ingress rules have been created yet, so the NGINX ingress controller's default 404 page is displayed if you browse to the internal IP address. Ingress rules are configured in the following steps.

## Run demo applications

To see the ingress controller in action, run two demo applications in your AKS cluster. In this example, you use `kubectl apply` to deploy two instances of a simple *Hello world* application.

Create a *aks-helloworld-one.yaml* file and copy in the following example YAML:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aks-helloworld-one  
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aks-helloworld-one
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: aks-helloworld-one
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: aks-helloworld-one
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aks-helloworld:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: TITLE
          value: "Welcome to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: aks-helloworld-one  
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: aks-helloworld-one
```

Create a *aks-helloworld-two.yaml* file and copy in the following example YAML:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aks-helloworld-two  
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aks-helloworld-two
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: aks-helloworld-two
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: aks-helloworld-two
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aks-helloworld:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: TITLE
          value: "AKS Ingress Demo"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: aks-helloworld-two  
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: aks-helloworld-two
```

Run the two demo applications using `kubectl apply`:

```console
kubectl apply -f aks-helloworld-one.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
kubectl apply -f aks-helloworld-two.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
```

## Create an ingress route

Both applications are now running on your Kubernetes cluster. To route traffic to each application, create a Kubernetes ingress resource. The ingress resource configures the rules that route traffic to one of the two applications.

In the following example, traffic to *EXTERNAL_IP* is routed to the service named `aks-helloworld-one`. Traffic to *EXTERNAL_IP/hello-world-two* is routed to the `aks-helloworld-two` service. Traffic to *EXTERNAL_IP/static* is routed to the service named `aks-helloworld-one` for static assets.

Create a file named *hello-world-ingress.yaml* and copy in the following example YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world-ingress
  namespace: ingress-basic
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld-one
          servicePort: 80
        path: /hello-world-one(/|$)(.*)
      - backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld-two
          servicePort: 80
        path: /hello-world-two(/|$)(.*)
      - backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld-one
          servicePort: 80
        path: /(.*)
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world-ingress-static
  namespace: ingress-basic
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /static/$2
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld-one
          servicePort: 80
        path: /static(/|$)(.*)
```

Create the ingress resource using the `kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml` command.

```
$ kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml

ingress.extensions/hello-world-ingress created
ingress.extensions/hello-world-ingress-static created
```

## Test the ingress controller

To test the routes for the ingress controller, browse to the two applications. Open a web browser to the IP address of your NGINX ingress controller, such as *EXTERNAL_IP*. The first demo application is displayed in the web browser, as shown in the follow example:

![First app running behind the ingress controller](media/ingress-basic/app-one.png)

Now add the */hello-world-two* path to the IP address, such as *EXTERNAL_IP/hello-world-two*. The second demo application with the custom title is displayed:

![Second app running behind the ingress controller](media/ingress-basic/app-two.png)

## Clean up resources

This article used Helm to install the ingress components and sample apps. When you deploy a Helm chart, a number of Kubernetes resources are created. These resources includes pods, deployments, and services. To clean up these resources, you can either delete the entire sample namespace, or the individual resources.

### Delete the sample namespace and all resources

To delete the entire sample namespace, use the `kubectl delete` command and specify your namespace name. All the resources in the namespace are deleted.

```console
kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic
```

### Delete resources individually

Alternatively, a more granular approach is to delete the individual resources created. List the Helm releases with the `helm list` command. Look for charts named *nginx-ingress* and *aks-helloworld*, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ helm list --namespace ingress-basic

NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
nginx-ingress           ingress-basic   1               2020-01-06 19:55:46.358275 -0600 CST    deployed        nginx-ingress-1.27.1    0.26.1  
```

Uninstall the releases with the `helm uninstall` command. The following example uninstalls the NGINX ingress deployment.

```
$ helm uninstall nginx-ingress --namespace ingress-basic

release "nginx-ingress" uninstalled
```

Next, remove the two sample applications:

```console
kubectl delete -f aks-helloworld-one.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
kubectl delete -f aks-helloworld-two.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
```

Remove the ingress route that directed traffic to the sample apps:

```console
kubectl delete -f hello-world-ingress.yaml
```

Finally, you can delete the itself namespace. Use the `kubectl delete` command and specify your namespace name:

```console
kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic
```
