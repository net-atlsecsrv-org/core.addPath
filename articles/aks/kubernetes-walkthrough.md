# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Azure CLI

In this quickstart, you deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure CLI. AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. A multi-container application that includes a web front end and a Redis instance is run in the cluster. You then see how to monitor the health of the cluster and pods that run your application.

To learn more about creating a Windows Server node pool, see [Create an AKS cluster that supports Windows Server containers][windows-container-cli].

This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0.64 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

> [!NOTE]
> If running the commands in this quickstart locally (instead of Azure Cloud Shell), ensure you run the commands as administrator.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you are asked to specify a location. This location is where resource group metadata is stored, it is also where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation. Create a resource group using the [az group create][az-group-create] command.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

The following example output shows the resource group created successfully:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup",
  "location": "eastus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "myResourceGroup",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}
```

## Create AKS cluster

Use the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command to create an AKS cluster. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one node. This will take several minutes to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure Monitor for containers][azure-monitor-containers] is enabled using the *--enable-addons monitoring* parameter, which requires *Microsoft.OperationsManagement* and *Microsoft.OperationalInsights* to be registered on you subscription. To check the registration status:
> 
> ```azurecli
> az provider show -n Microsoft.OperationsManagement -o table
> az provider show -n Microsoft.OperationalInsights -o table
> ```
> 
> If they are not registered, use the following command to register *Microsoft.OperationsManagement* and *Microsoft.OperationalInsights*:
> 
> ```azurecli
> az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationsManagement
> az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
> ```

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> When creating an AKS cluster a second resource group is automatically created to store the AKS resources. For more information see [Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](./faq.md#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)

## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use [kubectl][kubectl], the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl` is already installed. To install `kubectl` locally, use the [az aks install-cli][az-aks-install-cli] command:

```azurecli
az aks install-cli
```

To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above command uses the default location for the [Kubernetes configuration file][kubeconfig-file], which is `~/.kube/config`. You can specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using *--file*.

To verify the connection to your cluster, use the [kubectl get][kubectl-get] command to return a list of the cluster nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get nodes
```

The following example output shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure that the status of the node is *Ready*:

```output
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-nodepool1-31718369-0   Ready    agent   6m44s   v1.12.8
```

## Run the application

A [Kubernetes manifest file][kubernetes-deployment] defines a desired state for the cluster, such as what container images to run. In this quickstart, a manifest is used to create all objects needed to run the [Azure Vote application][azure-vote-app]. This manifest includes two [Kubernetes deployments][kubernetes-deployment] - one for the sample Azure Vote Python applications, and the other for a Redis instance. Two [Kubernetes Services][kubernetes-service] are also created - an internal service for the Redis instance, and an external service to access the Azure Vote application from the internet.

Create a file named `azure-vote.yaml` and copy in the following YAML definition. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, this file can be created using `code`, `vi`, or `nano` as if working on a virtual or physical system:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-vote-back
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-back
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "beta.kubernetes.io/os": linux
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-back
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/bitnami/redis:6.0.8
        env:
        - name: ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
          value: "yes"
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 256Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
          name: redis
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-back
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-vote-front
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-front
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "beta.kubernetes.io/os": linux
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/azure-vote-front:v1
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 256Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-front
```

Deploy the application using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f azure-vote.yaml
```

The following example output shows the Deployments and Services created successfully:

```output
deployment "azure-vote-back" created
service "azure-vote-back" created
deployment "azure-vote-front" created
service "azure-vote-front" created
```

## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
```

Initially the *EXTERNAL-IP* for the *azure-vote-front* service is shown as *pending*.

```output
NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   <pending>     80:30572/TCP   6s
```

When the *EXTERNAL-IP* address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process. The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

```output
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   52.179.23.131   80:30572/TCP   2m
```

To see the Azure Vote app in action, open a web browser to the external IP address of your service.

When the AKS cluster was created, [Azure Monitor for containers][azure-monitor-containers] was enabled to capture health metrics for both the cluster nodes and pods. These health metrics are available in the Azure portal.

## Delete the cluster

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unneeded resources.  When the cluster is no longer needed, use the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command to remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete the cluster, the Azure Active Directory service principal used by the AKS cluster is not removed. For steps on how to remove the service principal, see [AKS service principal considerations and deletion][sp-delete]. If you used a managed identity, the identity is managed by the platform and does not require removal.

## Get the code

In this quickstart, pre-created container images were used to create a Kubernetes deployment. The related application code, Dockerfile, and Kubernetes manifest file are available on GitHub.

[https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis][azure-vote-app]

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and deployed a multi-container application to it. You can also [access the Kubernetes web dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard] for your AKS cluster.
