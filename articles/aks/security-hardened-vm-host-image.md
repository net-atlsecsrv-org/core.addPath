# Security hardening in AKS virtual machine hosts 

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a secure service compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards. This article covers the security hardening applied to AKS virtual machine hosts. For more information about AKS security, see [Security concepts for applications and clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-security).

AKS clusters are deployed on host virtual machines, which run a security optimized OS. This host OS is currently based on an Ubuntu 16.04.LTS image with a set of additional security hardening steps applied (see Security hardening details).   

The goal of the security hardened host OS is to reduce the surface area of attack and allow the deployment of containers in a secure fashion. 

> [!Important]
> The security hardened OS is NOT CIS benchmarked. While there are overlaps with CIS benchmarks, the goal is not to be CIS-compliant. The goal for host OS hardening is to converge on a level of security consistent with Microsoftâ€™s own internal host security standards. 

## Security hardening features 

* AKS provides a security optimized host OS by default. There is no current option to select an alternate operating system. 

* Azure applies daily patches (including security patches) to AKS virtual machine hosts. Some of these patches will require a reboot, while others will not. You are responsible for scheduling AKS VM host reboots as needed. For guidance on how to automate AKS patching see [patching AKS nodes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-updates-kured).

Below is a summary of image hardening work that is implemented in AKS-Engine to produce the security optimized host OS. The work was implemented [in this GitHub project](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/projects/7).  

AKS-Engine does not promote or adhere to any specific security standard at this time, but CIS (Center for Internet Security) audit IDs are provided for convenience where applicable.

|5.2.8 |Ensure SSH root login is disabled |
|5.2.10 |Ensure SSH PermitUserEnvironment is disabled |
|5.2.11 |Ensure only approved MAX algorithms are used |
|5.2.12 |Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured |
|5.2.13 |Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less |
|5.2.15 |Ensure SSH warning banner is configured |
|5.3.1 |Ensure password creation requirements are configured |
|5.4.1.1 |Ensure password expiration is 90 days or less |
|5.4.1.4 |Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less |
|5.4.4 |Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive |
|5.6 |Ensure access to the su command is restricted|

## Additional notes
 
* To further reduce the attack surface area, some unnecessary kernel module drivers have been disabled in the OS. 

* The security hardened OS is NOT supported outside of the AKS platform.
