# Configure an AKS cluster

As part of creating an AKS cluster, you may need to customize your cluster configuration to suit your needs. This article introduces a few options for customizing your AKS cluster.

## OS configuration (Preview)

AKS now supports Ubuntu 18.04 as the node operating system (OS) in preview. During the preview period, both Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04 are available.

You must have the following resources installed:

- The Azure CLI, version 2.2.0 or later
- The aks-preview 0.4.35 extension

To install the aks-preview 0.4.35 extension or later, use the following Azure CLI commands:

```azurecli
az extension add --name aks-preview
az extension list
```

Register the `UseCustomizedUbuntuPreview` feature:

```azurecli
az feature register --name UseCustomizedUbuntuPreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

It might take several minutes for the status to show as **Registered**. You can check the registration status by using the [az feature list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/feature?view=azure-cli-latest#az-feature-list) command:

```azurecli
az feature list -o table --query "[?contains(name, 'Microsoft.ContainerService/UseCustomizedUbuntuPreview')].{Name:name,State:properties.state}"
```

When the status shows as registered, refresh the registration of the `Microsoft.ContainerService` resource provider by using the [az provider register](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/provider?view=azure-cli-latest#az-provider-register) command:

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

Configure the cluster to use Ubuntu 18.04 when the cluster is created. Use the `--aks-custom-headers` flag to set the Ubuntu 18.04 as the default OS.

```azure-cli
az aks create --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --aks-custom-headers CustomizedUbuntu=aks-ubuntu-1804
```

If you want to create a regular Ubuntu 16.04 cluster, you can do so by omitting the custom `--aks-custom-headers` tag.

## Custom resource group name

When you deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Azure, a second resource group gets created for the worker nodes. By default, AKS will name the node resource group `MC_resourcegroupname_clustername_location`, but you can also provide your own name.

To specify your own resource group name, install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension version 0.3.2 or later. Using the Azure CLI, use the `--node-resource-group` parameter of the `az aks create` command to specify a custom name for the resource group. If you use an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy an AKS cluster, you can define the resource group name by using the `nodeResourceGroup` property.

```azurecli
az aks create --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --node-resource-group myNodeResourceGroup
```

The secondary resource group is automatically created by the Azure resource provider in your own subscription. Note that you can only specify the custom resource group name when the cluster is created. 

As you work with the node resource group, keep in mind that you cannot:

- Specify an existing resource group for the node resource group.
- Specify a different subscription for the node resource group.
- Change the node resource group name after the cluster has been created.
- Specify names for the managed resources within the node resource group.
- Modify or delete Azure-created tags of managed resources within the node resource group.
