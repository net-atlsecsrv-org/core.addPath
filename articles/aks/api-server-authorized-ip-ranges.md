# Preview - Secure access to the API server using authorized IP address ranges in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In Kubernetes, the API server receives requests to perform actions in the cluster such as to create resources or scale the number of nodes. The API server is the central way to interact with and manage a cluster. To improve cluster security and minimize attacks, the API server should only be accessible from a limited set of IP address ranges.

This article shows you how to use API server authorized IP address ranges to limit requests to control plane. This feature is currently in preview.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AKS preview features are self-service opt-in. Previews are provided "as-is" and "as available" and are excluded from the service level agreements and limited warranty. AKS Previews are partially covered by customer support on best effort basis. As such, these features are not meant for production use. For additional infromation, please see the following support articles:

> * [Azure Support FAQ][aks-faq]

## Before you begin

API server authorized IP ranges only work for new AKS clusters that you create. This article shows you how to create an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI.

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

### Install aks-preview CLI extension

To configure API server authorized IP ranges, you need the *aks-preview* CLI extension version 0.4.1 or higher. Install the *aks-preview* Azure CLI extension using the [az extension add][az-extension-add] command, then check for any available updates using the [az extension update][az-extension-update] command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview

# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

### Register feature flag for your subscription

To use API server authorized IP ranges, first enable a feature flag on your subscription. To register the *APIServerSecurityPreview* feature flag, use the [az feature register][az-feature-register] command as shown in the following example:

> [!CAUTION]
> When you register a feature on a subscription, you can't currently un-register that feature. After you enable some preview features, defaults may be used for all AKS clusters then created in the subscription. Don't enable preview features on production subscriptions. Use a separate subscription to test preview features and gather feedback.

```azurecli-interactive
az feature register --name APIServerSecurityPreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

It takes a few minutes for the status to show *Registered*. You can check on the registration status using the [az feature list][az-feature-list] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az feature list -o table --query "[?contains(name, 'Microsoft.ContainerService/APIServerSecurityPreview')].{Name:name,State:properties.state}"
```

When ready, refresh the registration of the *Microsoft.ContainerService* resource provider using the [az provider register][az-provider-register] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you configure API server authorized IP ranges:

* You cannot currently use Azure Dev Spaces as the communication with the API server is also blocked.

## Overview of API server authorized IP ranges

The Kubernetes API server is how the underlying Kubernetes APIs are exposed. This component provides the interaction for management tools, such as `kubectl` or the Kubernetes dashboard. AKS provides a single-tenant cluster master, with a dedicated API server. By default, the API server is assigned a public IP address, and you should control access using role-based access controls (RBAC).

To secure access to the otherwise publicly accessible AKS control plane / API server, you can enable and use authorized IP ranges. These authorized IP ranges only allow defined IP address ranges to communicate with the API server. A request made to the API server from an IP address that is not part of these authorized IP ranges is blocked. You should continue to use RBAC to then authorize users and the actions they request.

For more information about the API server and other cluster components, see [Kubernetes core concepts for AKS][concepts-clusters-workloads].

## Create an AKS cluster

API server authorized IP ranges only work for new AKS clusters. You can't enable authorized IP ranges as part of the cluster create operation. If you try to enable authorized IP ranges as part of the cluster create process, the cluster nodes are unable to access the API server during deployment as the egress IP address isn't defined at that point.

First, create a cluster using the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command. The following example creates a single-node cluster named *myAKSCluster* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*.

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an Azure resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --node-count 1 \
    --generate-ssh-keys

# Get credentials to access the cluster
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

## Create outbound gateway for firewall rules

To ensure that the nodes in a cluster can reliably communicate with the API server when you enable authorized IP ranges in the next section, create an Azure firewall for use as the outbound gateway. The IP address of the Azure firewall is then added to the list of authorized API server IP addresses in the next section.

> [!WARNING]
> The use of Azure Firewall can incur significant costs over a monthly billing cycle. The requirement to use Azure Firewall should only be necessary in this initial preview period. For more information and cost planning, see [Azure Firewall pricing][azure-firewall-costs].
>
> Alternatively, if your cluster uses the [Standard SKU load balancer][standard-sku-lb], you do not need to configure the Azure Firewall as the outbound gateway. Use [az network public-ip list][az-network-public-ip-list] and specify the resource group of your AKS cluster, which usually starts with *MC_*. This displays the public IP for your cluster, which you can whitelist. For example:
>
> ```azurecli-interactive
> RG=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSClusterSLB --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv)
> SLB_PublicIP=$(az network public-ip list --resource-group $RG --query [].ipAddress -o tsv)
> az aks update --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges $SLB_PublicIP --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSClusterSLB
> ```

First, get the *MC_* resource group name for the AKS cluster and the virtual network. Then, create a subnet using the [az network vnet subnet create][az-network-vnet-subnet-create] command. The following example creates a subnet named *AzureFirewallSubnet* with the CIDR range of *10.200.0.0/16*:

```azurecli-interactive
# Get the name of the MC_ cluster resource group
MC_RESOURCE_GROUP=$(az aks show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv)

# Get the name of the virtual network used by the cluster
VNET_NAME=$(az network vnet list \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --query [0].name -o tsv)

# Create a subnet in the virtual network for Azure Firewall
az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \
    --name AzureFirewallSubnet \
    --address-prefixes 10.200.0.0/16
```

To create an Azure Firewall, install the *azure-firewall* CLI extension using the [az extension add][az-extension-add] command. Then, create a firewall using the [az network firewall create][az-network-firewall-create] command. The following example creates an Azure firewall named *myAzureFirewall*:

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the CLI extension for Azure Firewall
az extension add --name azure-firewall

# Create an Azure firewall
az network firewall create \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP\
    --name myAzureFirewall
```

An Azure firewall is assigned a public IP address that egress traffic flows through. Create a public address using the [az network public-ip create][az-network-public-ip-create] command, then create an IP configuration on the firewall using the [az network firewall ip-config create][az-network-firewall-ip-config-create] that applies the public IP:

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a public IP address for the firewall
FIREWALL_PUBLIC_IP=$(az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name myAzureFirewallPublicIP \
    --sku Standard \
    --query publicIp.ipAddress -o tsv)

# Associated the firewall with virtual network
az network firewall ip-config create \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name myAzureFirewallIPConfig \
    --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \
    --firewall-name myAzureFirewall \
    --public-ip-address myAzureFirewallPublicIP
```

Now create the Azure firewall network rule to *allow* all *TCP* traffic using the [az network firewall network-rule create][az-network-firewall-network-rule-create] command. The following example creates a network rule named *AllowTCPOutbound* for traffic with any source or destination address:

```azurecli-interactive
az network firewall network-rule create \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --firewall-name myAzureFirewall \
    --name AllowTCPOutbound \
    --collection-name myAzureFirewallCollection \
    --priority 200 \
    --action Allow \
    --protocols TCP \
    --source-addresses '*' \
    --destination-addresses '*' \
    --destination-ports '*'
```

To associate the Azure firewall with the network route, obtain the existing route table information, the internal IP address of the Azure firewall, and then the IP address of the API server. These IP addresses are specified in the next section to control how traffic should be routed for cluster communication.

```azurecli-interactive
# Get the AKS cluster route table
ROUTE_TABLE=$(az network route-table list \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --query "[?contains(name,'agentpool')].name" -o tsv)

# Get internal IP address of the firewall
FIREWALL_INTERNAL_IP=$(az network firewall show \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name myAzureFirewall \
    --query ipConfigurations[0].privateIpAddress -o tsv)

# Get the IP address of API server endpoint
K8S_ENDPOINT_IP=$(kubectl get endpoints -o=jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.name == "kubernetes")].subsets[].addresses[].ip}')
```

Finally, create a route in the existing AKS network route table using the [az network route-table route create][az-network-route-table-route-create] command that allows traffic to use the Azure firewall appliance for API server communication.

```azurecli-interactive
az network route-table route create \
    --resource-group $MC_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --route-table-name $ROUTE_TABLE \
    --name AzureFirewallAPIServer \
    --address-prefix $K8S_ENDPOINT_IP/32 \
    --next-hop-ip-address $FIREWALL_INTERNAL_IP \
    --next-hop-type VirtualAppliance

echo "Public IP address for the Azure Firewall instance that should be added to the list of API server authorized addresses is:" $FIREWALL_PUBLIC_IP
```

Make a note of the public IP address of your Azure Firewall appliance. This address is added to the list of API server authorized IP ranges in the next section.

## Enable authorized IP ranges

To enable API server authorized IP ranges, you provide a list of authorized IP address ranges. When you specify a CIDR range, start with the first IP address in the range. For example, *137.117.106.90/29* is a valid range, but make sure you specify the first IP address in the range, such as *137.117.106.88/29*.

Use [az aks update][az-aks-update] command and specify the *--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges* to allow. These IP address ranges are usually address ranges used by your on-premises networks. Add the public IP address of your own Azure firewall obtained in the previous step, such as *20.42.25.196/32*.

The following example enables API server authorized IP ranges on the cluster named *myAKSCluster* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*. The IP address ranges to authorize are *20.42.25.196/32* (the Azure firewall public IP address), then *172.0.0.0/16* and *168.10.0.0/18*:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges 20.42.25.196/32,172.0.0.0/16,168.10.0.0/18
```

## Update or disable authorized IP ranges

To update or disable authorized IP ranges, you again use [az aks update][az-aks-update] command. Specify the updated CIDR range you wish to allow, or specify an empty range to disable API server authorized IP ranges, as shown in the following example:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges ""
```

## Next steps

In this article, you enabled API server authorized IP ranges. This approach is one part of how you can run a secure AKS cluster.
