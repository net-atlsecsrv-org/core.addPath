# Create an ingress controller with a static public IP address in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

An ingress controller is a piece of software that provides reverse proxy, configurable traffic routing, and TLS termination for Kubernetes services. Kubernetes ingress resources are used to configure the ingress rules and routes for individual Kubernetes services. Using an ingress controller and ingress rules, a single IP address can be used to route traffic to multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster.

This article shows you how to deploy the [NGINX ingress controller][nginx-ingress] in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The ingress controller is configured with a static public IP address. The [cert-manager][cert-manager] project is used to automatically generate and configure [Let's Encrypt][lets-encrypt] certificates. Finally, two applications are run in the AKS cluster, each of which is accessible over a single IP address.

- [Create an ingress controller that uses your own TLS certificates][aks-ingress-own-tls]
- [Create an ingress controller that uses Let's Encrypt to automatically generate TLS certificates with a dynamic public IP address][aks-ingress-tls]

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

This article uses Helm to install the NGINX ingress controller, cert-manager, and a sample web app. Make sure that you are using the latest release of Helm. For upgrade instructions, see the [Helm install docs][helm-install]. For more information on configuring and using Helm, see [Install applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][use-helm].

This article also requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.64 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create an ingress controller

By default, an NGINX ingress controller is created with a new public IP address assignment. This public IP address is only static for the life-span of the ingress controller, and is lost if the controller is deleted and re-created. A common configuration requirement is to provide the NGINX ingress controller an existing static public IP address. The static public IP address remains if the ingress controller is deleted. This approach allows you to use existing DNS records and network configurations in a consistent manner throughout the lifecycle of your applications.

If you need to create a static public IP address, first get the resource group name of the AKS cluster with the [az aks show][az-aks-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv
```

Next, create a public IP address with the *static* allocation method using the [az network public-ip create][az-network-public-ip-create] command. The following example creates a public IP address named *myAKSPublicIP* in the AKS cluster resource group obtained in the previous step:

```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip create --resource-group MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus --name myAKSPublicIP --sku Standard --allocation-method static --query publicIp.ipAddress -o tsv
```

Now deploy the *nginx-ingress* chart with Helm. Add the `--set controller.service.loadBalancerIP` parameter, and specify your own public IP address created in the previous step. For added redundancy, two replicas of the NGINX ingress controllers are deployed with the `--set controller.replicaCount` parameter. To fully benefit from running replicas of the ingress controller, make sure there's more than one node in your AKS cluster.

The ingress controller also needs to be scheduled on a Linux node. Windows Server nodes (currently in preview in AKS) shouldn't run the ingress controller. A node selector is specified using the `--set nodeSelector` parameter to tell the Kubernetes scheduler to run the NGINX ingress controller on a Linux-based node.

> [!TIP]
> The following example creates a Kubernetes namespace for the ingress resources named *ingress-basic*. Specify a namespace for your own environment as needed. If your AKS cluster is not RBAC enabled, add `--set rbac.create=false` to the Helm commands.

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to enable [client source IP preservation][client-source-ip] for requests to containers in your cluster, add `--set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local` to the Helm install command. The client source IP is stored in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*. When using an ingress controller with client source IP preservation enabled, SSL pass-through will not work.

```console
# Create a namespace for your ingress resources
kubectl create namespace ingress-basic

# Use Helm to deploy an NGINX ingress controller
helm install nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress \
    --namespace ingress-basic \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set controller.service.loadBalancerIP="40.121.63.72"
```

When the Kubernetes load balancer service is created for the NGINX ingress controller, your static IP address is assigned, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl get service -l app=nginx-ingress --namespace ingress-basic

NAME                                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
nginx-ingress-controller                    LoadBalancer   10.0.232.56   40.121.63.72   80:31978/TCP,443:32037/TCP   3m
nginx-ingress-default-backend               ClusterIP      10.0.95.248   <none>         80/TCP                       3m
```

No ingress rules have been created yet, so the NGINX ingress controller's default 404 page is displayed if you browse to the public IP address. Ingress rules are configured in the following steps.

## Configure a DNS name

For the HTTPS certificates to work correctly, configure an FQDN for the ingress controller IP address. Update the following script with the IP address of your ingress controller and a unique name that you would like to use for the FQDN:

```azurecli-interactive
#!/bin/bash

# Public IP address of your ingress controller
IP="40.121.63.72"

# Name to associate with public IP address
DNSNAME="demo-aks-ingress"

# Get the resource-id of the public ip
PUBLICIPID=$(az network public-ip list --query "[?ipAddress!=null]|[?contains(ipAddress, '$IP')].[id]" --output tsv)

# Update public ip address with DNS name
az network public-ip update --ids $PUBLICIPID --dns-name $DNSNAME
```

The ingress controller is now accessible through the FQDN.

## Install cert-manager

The NGINX ingress controller supports TLS termination. There are several ways to retrieve and configure certificates for HTTPS. This article demonstrates using [cert-manager][cert-manager], which provides automatic [Lets Encrypt][lets-encrypt] certificate generation and management functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses the `staging` environment for Let's Encrypt. In production deployments, use `letsencrypt-prod` and `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` in the resource definitions and when installing the Helm chart.

To install the cert-manager controller in an RBAC-enabled cluster, use the following `helm install` command:

```console
# Install the CustomResourceDefinition resources separately
kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/release-0.13/deploy/manifests/00-crds.yaml

# Label the cert-manager namespace to disable resource validation
kubectl label namespace ingress-basic cert-manager.io/disable-validation=true

# Add the Jetstack Helm repository
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

# Update your local Helm chart repository cache
helm repo update

# Install the cert-manager Helm chart
helm install \
  cert-manager \
  --namespace ingress-basic \
  --version v0.13.0 \
  jetstack/cert-manager
```

For more information on cert-manager configuration, see the [cert-manager project][cert-manager].

## Create a CA cluster issuer

Before certificates can be issued, cert-manager requires an [Issuer][cert-manager-issuer] or [ClusterIssuer][cert-manager-cluster-issuer] resource. These Kubernetes resources are identical in functionality, however `Issuer` works in a single namespace, and `ClusterIssuer` works across all namespaces. For more information, see the [cert-manager issuer][cert-manager-issuer] documentation.

Create a cluster issuer, such as `cluster-issuer.yaml`, using the following example manifest. Update the email address with a valid address from your organization:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: user@contoso.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

To create the issuer, use the `kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml` command.

```
$ kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml --namespace ingress-basic

clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-staging created
```

## Run demo applications

An ingress controller and a certificate management solution have been configured. Now let's run two demo applications in your AKS cluster. In this example, Helm is used to deploy two instances of a simple 'Hello world' application.

Before you can install the sample Helm charts, add the Azure samples repository to your Helm environment as follows:

```console
helm repo add azure-samples https://azure-samples.github.io/helm-charts/
```

Create the first demo application from a Helm chart with the following command:

```console
helm install aks-helloworld azure-samples/aks-helloworld --namespace ingress-basic
```

Now install a second instance of the demo application. For the second instance, you specify a new title so that the two applications are visually distinct. You also specify a unique service name:

```console
helm install aks-helloworld-2 azure-samples/aks-helloworld \
    --namespace ingress-basic \
    --set title="AKS Ingress Demo" \
    --set serviceName="ingress-demo"
```

## Create an ingress route

Both applications are now running on your Kubernetes cluster, however they're configured with a service of type `ClusterIP`. As such, the applications aren't accessible from the internet. To make them publicly available, create a Kubernetes ingress resource. The ingress resource configures the rules that route traffic to one of the two applications.

In the following example, traffic to the address `https://demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/` is routed to the service named `aks-helloworld`. Traffic to the address `https://demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/hello-world-two` is routed to the `ingress-demo` service. Update the *hosts* and *host* to the DNS name you created in a previous step.

Create a file named `hello-world-ingress.yaml` and copy in the following example YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-staging
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
    secretName: tls-secret
  rules:
  - host: demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld
          servicePort: 80
        path: /(.*)
      - backend:
          serviceName: ingress-demo
          servicePort: 80
        path: /hello-world-two(/|$)(.*)
```

Create the ingress resource using the `kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml --namespace ingress-basic` command.

```
$ kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml --namespace ingress-basic

ingress.extensions/hello-world-ingress created
```

## Create a certificate object

Next, a certificate resource must be created. The certificate resource defines the desired X.509 certificate. For more information, see [cert-manager certificates][cert-manager-certificates].

Cert-manager has likely automatically created a certificate object for you using ingress-shim, which is automatically deployed with cert-manager since v0.2.2. For more information, see the [ingress-shim documentation][ingress-shim].

To verify that the certificate was created successfully, use the `kubectl describe certificate tls-secret --namespace ingress-basic` command.

If the certificate was issued, you will see output similar to the following:
```
Type    Reason          Age   From          Message
----    ------          ----  ----          -------
  Normal  CreateOrder     11m   cert-manager  Created new ACME order, attempting validation...
  Normal  DomainVerified  10m   cert-manager  Domain "demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com" verified with "http-01" validation
  Normal  IssueCert       10m   cert-manager  Issuing certificate...
  Normal  CertObtained    10m   cert-manager  Obtained certificate from ACME server
  Normal  CertIssued      10m   cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
```

If you need to create an additional certificate resource, you can do so with the following example manifest. Update the *dnsNames* and *domains* to the DNS name you created in a previous step. If you use an internal-only ingress controller, specify the internal DNS name for your service.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: tls-secret
  namespace: ingress-basic
spec:
  secretName: tls-secret
  dnsNames:
  - demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
  acme:
    config:
    - http01:
        ingressClass: nginx
      domains:
      - demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-staging
    kind: ClusterIssuer
```

To create the certificate resource, use the `kubectl apply -f certificates.yaml` command.

```
$ kubectl apply -f certificates.yaml

certificate.cert-manager.io/tls-secret created
```

## Test the ingress configuration

Open a web browser to the FQDN of your Kubernetes ingress controller, such as *https://demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com*.

As these examples use `letsencrypt-staging`, the issued SSL certificate is not trusted by the browser. Accept the warning prompt to continue to your application. The certificate information shows this *Fake LE Intermediate X1* certificate is issued by Let's Encrypt. This fake certificate indicates `cert-manager` processed the request correctly and received a certificate from the provider:

![Let's Encrypt staging certificate](media/ingress/staging-certificate.png)

When you change Let's Encrypt to use `prod` rather than `staging`, a trusted certificate issued by Let's Encrypt is used, as shown in the following example:

![Let's Encrypt certificate](media/ingress/certificate.png)

The demo application is shown in the web browser:

![Application example one](media/ingress/app-one.png)

Now add the */hello-world-two* path to the FQDN, such as *https://demo-aks-ingress.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/hello-world-two*. The second demo application with the custom title is shown:

![Application example two](media/ingress/app-two.png)

## Clean up resources

This article used Helm to install the ingress components, certificates, and sample apps. When you deploy a Helm chart, a number of Kubernetes resources are created. These resources includes pods, deployments, and services. To clean up these resources, you can either delete the entire sample namespace, or the individual resources.

### Delete the sample namespace and all resources

To delete the entire sample namespace, use the `kubectl delete` command and specify your namespace name. All the resources in the namespace are deleted.

```console
kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic
```

Then, remove the Helm repo for the AKS hello world app:

```console
helm repo remove azure-samples
```

### Delete resources individually

Alternatively, a more granular approach is to delete the individual resources created. First, remove the certificate resources:

```console
kubectl delete -f certificates.yaml
kubectl delete -f cluster-issuer.yaml
```

Now list the Helm releases with the `helm list` command. Look for charts named *nginx-ingress*, *cert-manager*, and *aks-helloworld*, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ helm list --all-namespaces

NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                        STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
aks-helloworld          ingress-basic   1               2020-01-11 15:02:21.51172346   deployed        aks-helloworld-0.1.0
aks-helloworld-2        ingress-basic   1               2020-01-11 15:03:10.533465598  deployed        aks-helloworld-0.1.0
nginx-ingress           ingress-basic   1               2020-01-11 14:51:03.454165006  deployed        nginx-ingress-1.28.2    0.26.2
cert-manager            ingress-basic    1               2020-01-06 21:19:03.866212286  deployed        cert-manager-v0.13.0    v0.13.0
```

Delete the releases with the `helm uninstall` command. The following example deletes the NGINX ingress deployment, certificate manager, and the two sample AKS hello world apps.

```
$ helm uninstall aks-helloworld aks-helloworld-2 nginx-ingress cert-manager -n ingress-basic

release "aks-helloworld" deleted
release "aks-helloworld-2" deleted
release "nginx-ingress" deleted
release "cert-manager" deleted
```

Next, remove the Helm repo for the AKS hello world app:

```console
helm repo remove azure-samples
```

Delete the itself namespace. Use the `kubectl delete` command and specify your namespace name:

```console
kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic
```

Finally, remove the static public IP address created for the ingress controller. Provide your *MC_* cluster resource group name obtained in the first step of this article, such as *MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*:

```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip delete --resource-group MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus --name myAKSPublicIP
```
