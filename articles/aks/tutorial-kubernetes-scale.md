# Tutorial: Scale applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

If you've followed the tutorials, you have a working Kubernetes cluster in AKS and you deployed the sample Azure Voting app. In this tutorial, part five of seven, you scale out the pods in the app and try pod autoscaling. You also learn how to scale the number of Azure VM nodes to change the cluster's capacity for hosting workloads. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Scale the Kubernetes nodes
> * Manually scale Kubernetes pods that run your application
> * Configure autoscaling pods that run the app front-end

In additional tutorials, the Azure Vote application is updated to a new version.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, an application was packaged into a container image. This image was uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and you created an AKS cluster. The application was then deployed to the AKS cluster. If you haven't done these steps, and would like to follow along, start with [Tutorial 1 â€“ Create container images][aks-tutorial-prepare-app].

This tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.0.53 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Manually scale pods

When the Azure Vote front-end and Redis instance were deployed in previous tutorials, a single replica was created. To see the number and state of pods in your cluster, use the [kubectl get][kubectl-get] command as follows:

```console
kubectl get pods
```

The following example output shows one front-end pod and one back-end pod:

```
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azure-vote-back-2549686872-4d2r5   1/1       Running   0          31m
azure-vote-front-848767080-tf34m   1/1       Running   0          31m
```

To manually change the number of pods in the *azure-vote-front* deployment, use the [kubectl scale][kubectl-scale] command. The following example increases the number of front-end pods to *5*:

```console
kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/azure-vote-front
```

Run [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] again to verify that AKS creates the additional pods. After a minute or so, the additional pods are available in your cluster:

```console
kubectl get pods

                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azure-vote-back-2606967446-nmpcf    1/1       Running   0          15m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-2hfh0   1/1       Running   0          3m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-bzt05   1/1       Running   0          3m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-fvcvm   1/1       Running   0          3m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-hrbf2   1/1       Running   0          15m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-qphz8   1/1       Running   0          3m
```

## Autoscale pods

Kubernetes supports [horizontal pod autoscaling][kubernetes-hpa] to adjust the number of pods in a deployment depending on CPU utilization or other select metrics. The [Metrics Server][metrics-server] is used to provide resource utilization to Kubernetes, and is automatically deployed in AKS clusters versions 1.10 and higher. To see the version of your AKS cluster, use the [az aks show][az-aks-show] command, as shown in the following example:

```azurecli
az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query kubernetesVersion --output table
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your AKS cluster is less than *1.10*, the Metrics Server is not automatically installed. Metrics Server installation manifests are available as a `components.yaml` asset on Metrics Server releases, which means you can install them via a url. To learn more about these YAML definitions, see the [Deployment][metrics-server-github] section of the readme.
> 
> Example installation:
> ```console
> kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.6/components.yaml
> ```

To use the autoscaler, all containers in your pods and your pods must have CPU requests and limits defined. In the `azure-vote-front` deployment, the front-end container already requests 0.25 CPU, with a limit of 0.5 CPU. These resource requests and limits are defined as shown in the following example snippet:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
     cpu: 250m
  limits:
     cpu: 500m
```

The following example uses the [kubectl autoscale][kubectl-autoscale] command to autoscale the number of pods in the *azure-vote-front* deployment. If average CPU utilization across all pods exceeds 50% of their requested usage, the autoscaler increases the pods up to a maximum of *10* instances. A minimum of *3* instances is then defined for the deployment:

```console
kubectl autoscale deployment azure-vote-front --cpu-percent=50 --min=3 --max=10
```

Alternatively, you can create a manifest file to define the autoscaler behavior and resource limits. The following is an example of a manifest file named `azure-vote-hpa.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back-hpa
spec:
  maxReplicas: 10 # define max replica count
  minReplicas: 3  # define min replica count
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: azure-vote-back
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50 # target CPU utilization

---

apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front-hpa
spec:
  maxReplicas: 10 # define max replica count
  minReplicas: 3  # define min replica count
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: azure-vote-front
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50 # target CPU utilization
```

Use `kubectl apply` to apply the autoscaler defined in the `azure-vote-hpa.yaml` manifest file.

```
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-hpa.yaml
```

To see the status of the autoscaler, use the `kubectl get hpa` command as follows:

```
kubectl get hpa

NAME               REFERENCE                     TARGETS    MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
azure-vote-front   Deployment/azure-vote-front   0% / 50%   3         10        3          2m
```

After a few minutes, with minimal load on the Azure Vote app, the number of pod replicas decreases automatically to three. You can use `kubectl get pods` again to see the unneeded pods being removed.

## Manually scale AKS nodes

If you created your Kubernetes cluster using the commands in the previous tutorial, it has two nodes. You can adjust the number of nodes manually if you plan more or fewer container workloads on your cluster.

The following example increases the number of nodes to three in the Kubernetes cluster named *myAKSCluster*. The command takes a couple of minutes to complete.

```azurecli
az aks scale --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 3
```

When the cluster has successfully scaled, the output is similar to following example:

```
"agentPoolProfiles": [
  {
    "count": 3,
    "dnsPrefix": null,
    "fqdn": null,
    "name": "myAKSCluster",
    "osDiskSizeGb": null,
    "osType": "Linux",
    "ports": null,
    "storageProfile": "ManagedDisks",
    "vmSize": "Standard_D2_v2",
    "vnetSubnetId": null
  }
```
