# Best practices for network connectivity and security in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

As you create and manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you provide network connectivity for your nodes and applications. These network resources include IP address ranges, load balancers, and ingress controllers. To maintain a high quality of service for your applications, you need to plan for and then configure these resources.

This best practices article focuses on network connectivity and security for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

> * Securely connect to cluster nodes

## Choose the appropriate network model

**Best practice guidance** - For integration with existing virtual networks or on-premises networks, use Azure CNI networking in AKS. This network model also allows greater separation of resources and controls in an enterprise environment.

Virtual networks provide the basic connectivity for AKS nodes and customers to access your applications. There are two different ways to deploy AKS clusters into virtual networks:

* **Kubenet networking** - Azure manages the virtual network resources as the cluster is deployed and uses the [kubenet][kubenet] Kubernetes plugin.
* **Azure CNI networking** - Deploys into an existing virtual network, and uses the [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)][cni-networking] Kubernetes plugin. Pods receive individual IPs that can route to other network services or on-premises resources.

The Container Networking Interface (CNI) is a vendor-neutral protocol that lets the container runtime make requests to a network provider. The Azure CNI assigns IP addresses to pods and nodes, and provides IP address management (IPAM) features as you connect to existing Azure virtual networks. Each node and pod resource receives an IP address in the Azure virtual network, and no additional routing is needed to communicate with other resources or services.

For production deployments, both kubenet and Azure CNI are valid options.

A notable benefit of Azure CNI networking for production is the network model allows for separation of control and management of resources. From a security perspective, you often want different teams to manage and secure those resources. Azure CNI networking lets you connect to existing Azure resources, on-premises resources, or other services directly via IP addresses assigned to each pod.

When you use Azure CNI networking, the virtual network resource is in a separate resource group to the AKS cluster. Delegate permissions for the AKS service principal to access and manage these resources. The service principal used by the AKS cluster must have at least [Network Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#network-contributor) permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you wish to define a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:
  * `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`
  * `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

For more information about AKS service principal delegation, see [Delegate access to other Azure resources][sp-delegation]. Instead of a service principal, you can also use the system assigned managed identity for permissions. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity.md).

As each node and pod receive its own IP address, plan out the address ranges for the AKS subnets. The subnet must be large enough to provide IP addresses for every node, pods, and network resources that you deploy. Each AKS cluster must be placed in its own subnet. To allow connectivity to on-premises or peered networks in Azure, don't use IP address ranges that overlap with existing network resources. There are default limits to the number of pods that each node runs with both kubenet and Azure CNI networking. To handle scale out events or cluster upgrades, you also need additional IP addresses available for use in the assigned subnet. This additional address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see [Upgrade a node pool in AKS][nodepool-upgrade].

To calculate the IP address required, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS][advanced-networking].

### Kubenet networking

Although kubenet doesn't require you to set up the virtual networks before the cluster is deployed, there are disadvantages:

* Nodes and pods are placed on different IP subnets. User Defined Routing (UDR) and IP forwarding is used to route traffic between pods and nodes. This additional routing may reduce network performance.
* Connections to existing on-premises networks or peering to other Azure virtual networks can be complex.

Kubenet is suitable for small development or test workloads, as you don't have to create the virtual network and subnets separately from the AKS cluster. Simple websites with low traffic, or to lift and shift workloads into containers, can also benefit from the simplicity of AKS clusters deployed with kubenet networking. For most production deployments, you should plan for and use Azure CNI networking. You can also [configure your own IP address ranges and virtual networks using kubenet][aks-configure-kubenet-networking].

## Distribute ingress traffic

**Best practice guidance** - To distribute HTTP or HTTPS traffic to your applications, use ingress resources and controllers. Ingress controllers provide additional features over a regular Azure load balancer, and can be managed as native Kubernetes resources.

An Azure load balancer can distribute customer traffic to applications in your AKS cluster, but it's limited in what it understands about that traffic. A load balancer resource works at layer 4, and distributes traffic based on protocol or ports. Most web applications that use HTTP or HTTPS should use Kuberenetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at layer 7. Ingress can distribute traffic based on the URL of the application and handle TLS/SSL termination. This ability also reduces the number of IP addresses you expose and map. With a load balancer, each application typically needs a public IP address assigned and mapped to the service in the AKS cluster. With an ingress resource, a single IP address can distribute traffic to multiple applications.

![Diagram showing Ingress traffic flow in an AKS cluster](media/operator-best-practices-network/aks-ingress.png)

 There are two components for ingress:

 * An ingress *resource*, and
 * An ingress *controller*

The ingress resource is a YAML manifest of `kind: Ingress` that defines the host, certificates, and rules to route traffic to services that run in your AKS cluster. The following example YAML manifest would distribute traffic for *myapp.com* to one of two services, *blogservice* or *storeservice*. The customer is directed to one service or the other based on the URL they access.

```yaml
kind: Ingress
metadata:
 name: myapp-ingress
   annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "PublicIngress"
spec:
 tls:
 - hosts:
   - myapp.com
   secretName: myapp-secret
 rules:
   - host: myapp.com
     http:
      paths:
      - path: /blog
        backend:
         serviceName: blogservice
         servicePort: 80
      - path: /store
        backend:
         serviceName: storeservice
         servicePort: 80
```

An ingress controller is a daemon that runs on an AKS node and watches for incoming requests. Traffic is then distributed based on the rules defined in the ingress resource. The most common ingress controller is based on [NGINX]. AKS doesn't restrict you to a specific controller, so you can use other controllers such as [Contour][contour], [HAProxy][haproxy], or [Traefik][traefik].

Ingress controllers must be scheduled on a Linux node. Windows Server nodes shouldn't run the ingress controller. Use a node selector in your YAML manifest or Helm chart deployment to indicate that the resource should run on a Linux-based node. For more information, see [Use node selectors to control where pods are scheduled in AKS][concepts-node-selectors].

There are many scenarios for ingress, including the following how-to guides:

* [Create a basic ingress controller with external network connectivity][aks-ingress-basic]
* [Create an ingress controller that uses an internal, private network and IP address][aks-ingress-internal]
* [Create an ingress controller that uses your own TLS certificates][aks-ingress-own-tls]
* Create an ingress controller that uses Let's Encrypt to automatically generate TLS certificates [with a dynamic public IP address][aks-ingress-tls] or [with a static public IP address][aks-ingress-static-tls]

## Secure traffic with a web application firewall (WAF)

**Best practice guidance** - To scan incoming traffic for potential attacks, use a web application firewall (WAF) such as [Barracuda WAF for Azure][barracuda-waf] or Azure Application Gateway. These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic TLS termination.

An ingress controller that distributes traffic to services and applications is typically a Kubernetes resource in your AKS cluster. The controller runs as a daemon on an AKS node, and consumes some of the node's resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. In larger environments, you often want to offload some of this traffic routing or TLS termination to a network resource outside of the AKS cluster. You also want to scan incoming traffic for potential attacks.

![A web application firewall (WAF) such as Azure App Gateway can protect and distribute traffic for your AKS cluster](media/operator-best-practices-network/web-application-firewall-app-gateway.png)

A web application firewall (WAF) provides an additional layer of security by filtering the incoming traffic. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a set of rules to watch for attacks like cross site scripting or cookie poisoning. [Azure Application Gateway][app-gateway] (currently in preview in AKS) is a WAF that can integrate with AKS clusters to provide these security features, before the traffic reaches your AKS cluster and applications. Other third-party solutions also perform these functions, so you can continue to use existing investments or expertise in a given product.

Load balancer or ingress resources continue to run in your AKS cluster to further refine the traffic distribution. App Gateway can be centrally managed as an ingress controller with a resource definition. To get started, [create an Application Gateway Ingress controller][app-gateway-ingress].

## Control traffic flow with network policies

**Best practice guidance** - Use network policies to allow or deny traffic to pods. By default, all traffic is allowed between pods within a cluster. For improved security, define rules that limit pod communication.

Network policy is a Kubernetes feature that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You can choose to allow or deny traffic based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. The use of network policies gives a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, the required network policies can be automatically applied. Don't use Azure network security groups to control pod-to-pod traffic, use network policies.

To use network policy, the feature must be enabled when you create an AKS cluster. You can't enable network policy on an existing AKS cluster. Plan ahead to make sure that you enable network policy on clusters and can use them as needed. Network policy should only be used for Linux-based nodes and pods in AKS.

A network policy is created as a Kubernetes resource using a YAML manifest. The policies are applied to defined pods, then ingress or egress rules define how the traffic can flow. The following example applies a network policy to pods with the *app: backend* label applied to them. The ingress rule then only allows traffic from pods with the *app: frontend* label:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

To get started with policies, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][use-network-policies].

## Securely connect to nodes through a bastion host

**Best practice guidance** - Don't expose remote connectivity to your AKS nodes. Create a bastion host, or jump box, in a management virtual network. Use the bastion host to securely route traffic into your AKS cluster to remote management tasks.

Most operations in AKS can be completed using the Azure management tools or through the Kubernetes API server. AKS nodes aren't connected to the public internet, and are only available on a private network. To connect to nodes and perform maintenance or troubleshoot issues, route your connections through a bastion host, or jump box. This host should be in a separate management virtual network that is securely peered to the AKS cluster virtual network.

![Connect to AKS nodes using a bastion host, or jump box](media/operator-best-practices-network/connect-using-bastion-host-simplified.png)

The management network for the bastion host should be secured, too. Use an [Azure ExpressRoute][expressroute] or [VPN gateway][vpn-gateway] to connect to an on-premises network, and control access using network security groups.
