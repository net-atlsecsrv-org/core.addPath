# Use Azure role-based access controls to define access to the Kubernetes configuration file in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

You can interact with Kubernetes clusters using the `kubectl` tool. The Azure CLI provides an easy way to get the access credentials and configuration information to connect to your AKS clusters using `kubectl`. To limit who can get that Kubernetes configuration (*kubeconfig*) information and to limit the permissions they then have, you can use Azure role-based access controls (RBAC).

This article shows you how to assign RBAC roles that limit who can get the configuration information for an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

This article also requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.65 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Available cluster roles permissions

When you interact with an AKS cluster using the `kubectl` tool, a configuration file is used that defines cluster connection information. This configuration file is typically stored in *~/.kube/config*. Multiple clusters can be defined in this *kubeconfig* file. You switch between clusters using the [kubectl config use-context][kubectl-config-use-context] command.

The [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command lets you get the access credentials for an AKS cluster and merges them into the *kubeconfig* file. You can use Azure role-based access controls (RBAC) to control access to these credentials. These Azure RBAC roles let you define who can retrieve the *kubeconfig* file, and what permissions they then have within the cluster.

The two built-in roles are:

* **Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role**  
  * Allows access to *Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterAdminCredential/action* API call. This API call [lists the cluster admin credentials][api-cluster-admin].
  * Downloads *kubeconfig* for the *clusterAdmin* role.
* **Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role**
  * Allows access to *Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action* API call. This API call [lists the cluster user credentials][api-cluster-user].
  * Downloads *kubeconfig* for *clusterUser* role.

These RBAC roles can be applied to an Azure Active Directory (AD) user or group.

> ![NOTE]
> On clusters that use Azure AD, users with the *clusterUser* role have an empty *kubeconfig* file that prompts a log in. Once logged in, users have access based on their Azure AD user or group settings. Users with the *clusterAdmin* role have admin access.
>
> Clusters that do not use Azure AD only use the *clusterAdmin* role.

## Assign role permissions to a user or group

To assign one of the available roles, you need to get the resource ID of the AKS cluster and the ID of the Azure AD user account or group. The following example commands:

* Get the cluster resource ID using the [az aks show][az-aks-show] command for the cluster named *myAKSCluster* in the *myResourceGroup* resource group. Provide your own cluster and resource group name as needed.
* Use the [az account show][az-account-show] and [az ad user show][az-ad-user-show] commands to get your user ID.
* Finally, assign a role using the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command.

The following example assigns the *Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role* to an individual user account:

```azurecli-interactive
# Get the resource ID of your AKS cluster
AKS_CLUSTER=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query id -o tsv)

# Get the account credentials for the logged in user
ACCOUNT_UPN=$(az account show --query user.name -o tsv)
ACCOUNT_ID=$(az ad user show --id $ACCOUNT_UPN --query objectId -o tsv)

# Assign the 'Cluster Admin' role to the user
az role assignment create \
    --assignee $ACCOUNT_ID \
    --scope $AKS_CLUSTER \
    --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to assign permissions to an Azure AD group, update the `--assignee` parameter shown in the previous example with the object ID for the *group* rather than a *user*. To obtain the object ID for a group, use the [az ad group show][az-ad-group-show] command. The following example gets the object ID for the Azure AD group named *appdev*: `az ad group show --group appdev --query objectId -o tsv`

You can change the previous assignment to the *Cluster User Role* as needed.

The following example output shows the role assignment has been successfully created:

```
{
  "canDelegate": null,
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/b2712174-5a41-4ecb-82c5-12b8ad43d4fb",
  "name": "b2712174-5a41-4ecb-82c5-12b8ad43d4fb",
  "principalId": "946016dd-9362-4183-b17d-4c416d1f8f61",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/<guid>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/0ab01a8-8aac-4efd-b8c2-3ee1fb270be8",
  "scope": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments"
}
```

## Get and verify the configuration information

With RBAC roles assigned, use the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command to get the *kubeconfig* definition for your AKS cluster. The following example gets the *--admin* credentials, which work correctly if the user has been granted the *Cluster Admin Role*:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin
```

You can then use the [kubectl config view][kubectl-config-view] command to verify that the *context* for the cluster shows that the admin configuration information has been applied:

```
$ kubectl config view

apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://myaksclust-myresourcegroup-19da35-4839be06.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io:443
  name: myAKSCluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: myAKSCluster
    user: clusterAdmin_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster
  name: myAKSCluster-admin
current-context: myAKSCluster-admin
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: clusterAdmin_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster
  user:
    client-certificate-data: REDACTED
    client-key-data: REDACTED
    token: e9f2f819a4496538b02cefff94e61d35
```

## Remove role permissions

To remove role assignments, use the [az role assignment delete][az-role-assignment-delete] command. Specify the account ID and cluster resource ID, as obtained in the previous commands. If you assigned the role to a group rather than a user, specify the appropriate group object ID rather than account object ID for the `--assignee` parameter:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment delete --assignee $ACCOUNT_ID --scope $AKS_CLUSTER
```
