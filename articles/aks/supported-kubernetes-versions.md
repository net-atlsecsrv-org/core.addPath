# Supported Kubernetes versions in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The Kubernetes community releases minor versions roughly every three months. Recently the Kubernetes community has [increased the window of support for each version from 9 months to 12 months](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/31/kubernetes-1-19-feature-one-year-support/), starting with version 1.19. These releases include new features and improvements. Patch releases are more frequent (sometimes weekly) and are intended for critical bug fixes within a minor version. These patch releases include fixes for security vulnerabilities or major bugs.

## Kubernetes versions

Kubernetes uses the standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme, which means that each version of Kubernetes follows this numbering scheme:

```
[major].[minor].[patch]

Example:
  1.17.7
  1.17.8
```

Each number in the version indicates general compatibility with the previous version:

* Major versions change when incompatible API changes or backwards compatibility may be broken.
* Minor versions change when functionality changes are made that are backwards compatible to the other minor releases.
* Patch versions change when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

Users should aim to run the latest patch release of the minor version they're running, for example if your production cluster is on **`1.17.7`** and **`1.17.8`** is the latest available patch version available for the *1.17* series, you should upgrade to **`1.17.8`** as soon as you're able, to ensure your cluster is fully patched and supported.

## Kubernetes version support policy

AKS defines a generally available version, as a version enabled in all SLO or SLA measurements and when available in all regions. AKS supports three GA minor versions of Kubernetes:

* The latest GA minor version that is released in AKS (which we'll refer to as N).
* Two previous minor versions.
* Each supported minor version also supports a maximum of two (2) stable patches.
* AKS may also support preview versions, which are explicitly labeled and subject to [Preview terms and conditions][preview-terms].

> [!NOTE]
> AKS uses safe deployment practices which involve gradual region deployment. This means it may take up to 10 business days for a new release or a new version to be available in all regions.

The supported window of Kubernetes versions on AKS is known as "N-2": (N (Latest release) - 2 (minor versions)).

For example, if AKS introduces *1.17.a* today, support is provided for the following versions:

New minor version    |    Supported Version List
-----------------    |    ----------------------
1.17.a               |    1.17.a, 1.17.b, 1.16.c, 1.16.d, 1.15.e, 1.15.f

Where ".letter" is representative of patch versions.

When a new minor version is introduced, the oldest minor version and patch releases supported are deprecated and removed. For example, if the current supported version list is:

```
1.17.a
1.17.b
1.16.c
1.16.d
1.15.e
1.15.f
```

And AKS releases 1.18.\*, it means that all the 1.15.\* versions will be removed and will be out of support in 30 days.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note, that if customers are running an unsupported Kubernetes version, they will be asked to upgrade when
> requesting support for the cluster. Clusters running unsupported Kubernetes releases are not covered by the
> [AKS support policies](./support-policies.md).

In addition to the above, AKS supports a maximum of two **patch** releases of a given minor version. So given the following supported versions:

```
Current Supported Version List
------------------------------
1.17.8, 1.17.7, 1.16.10, 1.16.9
```

If AKS releases `1.17.9` and `1.16.11`, the oldest patch versions are deprecated and removed, and the supported version list becomes:

```
New Supported Version List
----------------------
1.17.*9*, 1.17.*8*, 1.16.*11*, 1.16.*10*
```

### Supported `kubectl` versions

You can use one minor version older or newer of `kubectl` relative to your *kube-apiserver* version, which is consistent with the [Kubernetes support policy for kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#kubectl).

For example, if your *kube-apiserver* is at *1.17*, then you can use versions *1.16* to *1.18* of `kubectl` with that *kube-apiserver*.

To install or update your version of `kubectl`, run `az aks install-cli`.

## Release and deprecation process

You can reference upcoming version releases and deprecations on the [AKS Kubernetes Release Calendar](#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar).

For new **minor** versions of Kubernetes
1. AKS publishes a pre-announcement with the planned date of a new version release and respective old version deprecation on the [AKS Release notes](https://aka.ms/aks/releasenotes) at least 30 days prior to removal.
2. AKS publishes a [service health notification](../service-health/service-health-overview.md) available to all users with AKS and portal access, and sends an email to the subscription administrators with the planned version removal dates.
3. Users have **30 days** from version removal to upgrade to a supported minor version release  to continue receiving support.

For new **patch** versions of Kubernetes
  * Because of the urgent nature of patch versions, these can be introduced into the service as they become available.
  * In general, AKS does not do broad communications for the release of new patch versions. However, AKS constantly monitors and validates available CVE patches to support them in AKS in a timely manner. If a critical patch is found or user action is required, AKS will notify users to upgrade to the newly available patch.
  * Users have **30 days** from the time a patch release is removed from AKS to upgrade into a  supported patch and continue receiving support.

### Supported versions policy exceptions

AKS reserves the right to add or remove new/existing versions that have been identified to have one or more critical production impacting bugs or security issues without advance notice.

Specific patch releases may be skipped, or rollout accelerated depending on the severity of the bug or security issue.

## Azure portal and CLI versions

When you deploy an AKS cluster in the portal or with the Azure CLI, the cluster is defaulted to the N-1 minor version and latest patch. For example, if AKS supports *1.17.a*, *1.17.b*, *1.16.c*, *1.16.d*, *1.15.e*, and *1.15.f*, the default version selected is *1.16.c*.

To find out what versions are currently available for your subscription and region, use the
[az aks get-versions][az-aks-get-versions] command. The following example lists the available Kubernetes versions for the *EastUS* region:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-versions --location eastus --output table
```

## FAQ

**How often should I expect to upgrade Kubernetes versions to stay in support?**

Stating with Kubernetes 1.19, the [open source community has expanded support to 1 year](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/31/kubernetes-1-19-feature-one-year-support/). AKS commits to enabling patches and support matching the upstream commitments, at a minimum. This means starting with AKS clusters on 1.19, you will be able to upgrade at a minimum of once a year to stay on a supported version. For versions on 1.18 or below, the window of support remains at 9 months which requires an upgrade once every 9 months to stay on a supported version. It is highly recommended to regularly test new versions and be prepared to upgrade to newer versions to capture the latest stable enhancements within Kubernetes.

**What happens when a user upgrades a Kubernetes cluster with a minor version that isn't supported?**

If you're on the *n-3* version or older, it means you're outside of support and will be asked to upgrade. When your upgrade from version n-3 to n-2 succeeds, you're back within our support policies. For example:

- If the oldest supported AKS version is *1.15.a* and you are on *1.14.b* or older, you're outside of support.
- When the upgrade from *1.14.b* to *1.15.a* or higher succeeds, you're back within our support policies.

Downgrades are not supported.

**What does 'Outside of Support' mean**

'Outside of Support' means that the version you're running is outside of the supported versions list, and you'll be asked to upgrade the cluster to a supported version when requesting support, unless you're within the 30-day grace period after version deprecation. Additionally, AKS doesn't make any runtime or other guarantees for clusters outside of the supported versions list.

**What happens when a user scales a Kubernetes cluster with a minor version that isn't supported?**

For minor versions not supported by AKS, scaling in or out should continue to work, but there are no Quality of Service guarantees, so it's highly recommended to upgrade to bring your cluster back into support.

**Can a user stay on a Kubernetes version forever?**

If a cluster has been out of support for more than three (3) minor versions and has been found to carry security risks, Azure contacts you to proactively upgrade your cluster. If you do not take further action, Azure reserves the right to automatically upgrade your cluster on your behalf.

**What version does the control plane support if the node pool is not in one of the supported AKS versions?**

The control plane must be within a window of versions from all node pools. For details on upgrading the control plane or node pools, visit documentation on [upgrading node pools](use-multiple-node-pools.md#upgrade-a-cluster-control-plane-with-multiple-node-pools).

**Can I skip multiple AKS versions during cluster upgrade?**

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, Kubernetes minor versions cannot be skipped. For example, upgrades between *1.12.x* -> *1.13.x* or *1.13.x* -> *1.14.x* are allowed, however *1.12.x* -> *1.14.x* is not.

To upgrade, from *1.12.x* -> *1.14.x*, first upgrade from *1.12.x* -> *1.13.x*, then upgrade from *1.13.x* -> *1.14.x*.

Skipping multiple versions can only be done when upgrading from an unsupported version back into a supported version. For example, upgrade from an unsupported *1.10.x* --> a supported *1.15.x* can be completed.
