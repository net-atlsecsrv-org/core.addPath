# Best practices for advanced scheduler features in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. The Kubernetes scheduler provides advanced features that let you control which pods can be scheduled on certain nodes, or how multi-pod applications can be appropriately distributed across the cluster. 

This best practices article focuses on advanced Kubernetes scheduling features for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

> * Give preference to pods to run on certain nodes with node selectors or node affinity
> * Split apart or group together pods with inter-pod affinity or anti-affinity

## Provide dedicated nodes using taints and tolerations

**Best practice guidance** - Limit access for resource-intensive applications, such as ingress controllers, to specific nodes. Keep node resources available for workloads that require them, and don't allow scheduling of other workloads on the nodes.

When you create your AKS cluster, you can deploy nodes with GPU support or a large number of powerful CPUs. These nodes are often used for large data processing workloads such as machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI). As this type of hardware is typically an expensive node resource to deploy, limit the workloads that can be scheduled on these nodes. You may instead wish to dedicate some nodes in the cluster to run ingress services, and prevent other workloads.

This support for different nodes is provided by using multiple node pools. An AKS cluster provides one or more node pools.

The Kubernetes scheduler can use taints and tolerations to restrict what workloads can run on nodes.

* A **taint** is applied to a node that indicates only specific pods can be scheduled on them.
* A **toleration** is then applied to a pod that allows them to *tolerate* a node's taint.

When you deploy a pod to an AKS cluster, Kubernetes only schedules pods on nodes where a toleration is aligned with the taint. As an example, assume you have a node pool in your AKS cluster for nodes with GPU support. You define name, such as *gpu*, then a value for scheduling. If you set this value to *NoSchedule*, the Kubernetes scheduler can't schedule pods on the node if the pod doesn't define the appropriate toleration.

```console
kubectl taint node aks-nodepool1 sku=gpu:NoSchedule
```

With a taint applied to nodes, you then define a toleration in the pod specification that allows scheduling on the nodes. The following example defines the `sku: gpu` and `effect: NoSchedule` to tolerate the taint applied to the node in the previous step:

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: tf-mnist
spec:
  containers:
  - name: tf-mnist
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/samples-tf-mnist-demo:gpu
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 2Gi
      limits:
        cpu: 4.0
        memory: 16Gi
  tolerations:
  - key: "sku"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "gpu"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

When this pod is deployed, such as using `kubectl apply -f gpu-toleration.yaml`, Kubernetes can successfully schedule the pod on the nodes with the taint applied. This logical isolation lets you control access to resources within a cluster.

When you apply taints, work with your application developers and owners to allow them to define the required tolerations in their deployments.

For more information about how to use multiple node pools in AKS, see [Create and manage multiple node pools for a cluster in AKS][use-multiple-node-pools].

### Behavior of taints and tolerations in AKS

When you upgrade a node pool in AKS, taints and tolerations follow a set pattern as they're applied to new nodes:

- **Default clusters that use virtual machine scale sets**
  - You can [taint a nodepool][taint-node-pool] from the AKS API, to have newly scaled out nodes receive API specified node taints.
  - Let's assume you have a two-node cluster - *node1* and *node2*. You upgrade the node pool.
  - Two additional nodes are created, *node3* and *node4*, and the taints are passed on respectively.
  - The original *node1* and *node2* are deleted.

- **Clusters without virtual machine scale set support**
  - Again, let's assume you have a two-node cluster - *node1* and *node2*. When you upgrade, an additional node (*node3*) is created.
  - The taints from *node1* are applied to *node3*, then *node1* is then deleted.
  - Another new node is created (named *node1*, since the previous *node1* was deleted), and the *node2* taints are applied to the new *node1*. Then, *node2* is deleted.
  - In essence *node1* becomes *node3*, and *node2* becomes *node1*.

When you scale a node pool in AKS, taints and tolerations do not carry over by design.

## Control pod scheduling using node selectors and affinity

**Best practice guidance** - Control the scheduling of pods on nodes using node selectors, node affinity, or inter-pod affinity. These settings allow the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads, such as by hardware in the node.

Taints and tolerations are used to logically isolate resources with a hard cut-off - if the pod doesn't tolerate a node's taint, it isn't scheduled on the node. An alternate approach is to use node selectors. You label nodes, such as to indicate locally attached SSD storage or a large amount of memory, and then define in the pod specification a node selector. Kubernetes then schedules those pods on a matching node. Unlike tolerations, pods without a matching node selector can be scheduled on labeled nodes. This behavior allows unused resources on the nodes to consume, but gives priority to pods that define the matching node selector.

Let's look at an example of nodes with a high amount of memory. These nodes can give preference to pods that request a high amount of memory. To make sure that the resources don't sit idle, they also allow other pods to run.

```console
kubectl label node aks-nodepool1 hardware=highmem
```

A pod specification then adds the `nodeSelector` property to define a node selector that matches the label set on a node:

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: tf-mnist
spec:
  containers:
  - name: tf-mnist
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/samples-tf-mnist-demo:gpu
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 2Gi
      limits:
        cpu: 4.0
        memory: 16Gi
  nodeSelector:
      hardware: highmem
```

When you use these scheduler options, work with your application developers and owners to allow them to correctly define their pod specifications.

For more information about using node selectors, see [Assigning Pods to Nodes][k8s-node-selector].

### Node affinity

A node selector is a basic way to assign pods to a given node. More flexibility is available using *node affinity*. With node affinity, you define what happens if the pod can't be matched with a node. You can *require* that Kubernetes scheduler matches a pod with a labeled host. Or, you can *prefer* a match but allow the pod to be scheduled on a different host if no match is available.

The following example sets the node affinity to *requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution*. This affinity requires the Kubernetes schedule to use a node with a matching label. If no node is available, the pod has to wait for scheduling to continue. To allow the pod to be scheduled on a different node, you can instead set the value to *preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution*:

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: tf-mnist
spec:
  containers:
  - name: tf-mnist
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/samples-tf-mnist-demo:gpu
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 2Gi
      limits:
        cpu: 4.0
        memory: 16Gi
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: hardware
            operator: In
            values: highmem
```

The *IgnoredDuringExecution* part of the setting indicates that if the node labels change, the pod shouldn't be evicted from the node. The Kubernetes scheduler only uses the updated node labels for new pods being scheduled, not pods already scheduled on the nodes.

For more information, see [Affinity and anti-affinity][k8s-affinity].

### Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity

One final approach for the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads is using inter-pod affinity or anti-affinity. The settings define that pods *shouldn't* be scheduled on a node that has an existing matching pod, or that they *should* be scheduled. By default, the Kubernetes scheduler tries to schedule multiple pods in a replica set across nodes. You can define more specific rules around this behavior.

A good example is a web application that also uses an Azure Cache for Redis. You can use pod anti-affinity rules to request that the Kubernetes scheduler distributes replicas across nodes. You can then use affinity rules to make sure that each web app component is scheduled on the same host as a corresponding cache. The distribution of pods across nodes looks like the following example:

| **Node 1** | **Node 2** | **Node 3** |
|------------|------------|------------|
| webapp-1   | webapp-2   | webapp-3   |
| cache-1    | cache-2    | cache-3    |

This example is a more complex deployment than the use of node selectors or node affinity. The deployment gives you control over how Kubernetes schedules pods on nodes and can logically isolate resources. For a complete example of this web application with Azure Cache for Redis example, see [Co-locate pods on the same node][k8s-pod-affinity].
