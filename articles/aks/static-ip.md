#Customer intent: As a cluster operator or developer, I want to create and manage static IP address resources in Azure that I can use beyond the lifecycle of an individual Kubernetes service deployed in an AKS cluster.

# Use a static public IP address and DNS label with the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) load balancer

By default, the public IP address assigned to a load balancer resource created by an AKS cluster is only valid for the lifespan of that resource. If you delete the Kubernetes service, the associated load balancer and IP address are also deleted. If you want to assign a specific IP address or retain an IP address for redeployed Kubernetes services, you can create and use a static public IP address.

This article shows you how to create a static public IP address and assign it to your Kubernetes service.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

This article covers using a *Standard* SKU IP with a *Standard* SKU load balancer. For more information, see [IP address types and allocation methods in Azure][ip-sku].

## Create a static IP address

Create a static public IP address with the [az network public ip create][az-network-public-ip-create] command. The following creates a static IP resource named *myAKSPublicIP* in the *myResourceGroup* resource group:

```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSPublicIP \
    --sku Standard \
    --allocation-method static
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a *Basic* SKU load balancer in your AKS cluster, use *Basic* for the *sku* parameter when defining a public IP. Only *Basic* SKU IPs work with the *Basic* SKU load balancer and only *Standard* SKU IPs work with *Standard* SKU load balancers. 

The IP address is displayed, as shown in the following condensed example output:

```json
{
  "publicIp": {
    ...
    "ipAddress": "40.121.183.52",
    ...
  }
}
```

You can later get the public IP address using the [az network public-ip list][az-network-public-ip-list] command. Specify the name of the node resource group and public IP address you created, and query for the *ipAddress* as shown in the following example:

```azurecli-interactive
$ az network public-ip show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSPublicIP --query ipAddress --output tsv

40.121.183.52
```

## Create a service using the static IP address

Before creating a service, ensure the service principal used by the AKS cluster has delegated permissions to the other resource group. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create \
    --assignee <SP Client ID> \
    --role "Network Contributor" \
    --scope /subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>
```

Alternatively, you can use the system assigned managed identity for permissions instead of the service principal. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity.md).

To create a *LoadBalancer* service with the static public IP address, add the `loadBalancerIP` property and the value of the static public IP address to the YAML manifest. Create a file named `load-balancer-service.yaml` and copy in the following YAML. Provide your own public IP address created in the previous step. The following example also sets the annotation to the resource group named *myResourceGroup*. Provide your own resource group name.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group: myResourceGroup
  name: azure-load-balancer
spec:
  loadBalancerIP: 40.121.183.52
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-load-balancer
```

Create the service and deployment with the `kubectl apply` command.

```console
kubectl apply -f load-balancer-service.yaml
```

## Apply a DNS label to the service

If your service is using a dynamic or static public IP address, you can use the service annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name` to set a public-facing DNS label. This publishes a fully qualified domain name for your service using Azure's public DNS servers and top-level domain. The annotation value must be unique within the Azure location, so it's recommended to use a sufficiently qualified label.   

Azure will then automatically append a default subnet, such as `<location>.cloudapp.azure.com` (where location is the region you selected), to the name you provide, to create the fully qualified DNS name. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: myserviceuniquelabel
  name: azure-load-balancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-load-balancer
```

> [!NOTE] 
> To publish the service on your own domain, see [Azure DNS][azure-dns-zone] and the [external-dns][external-dns] project.

## Troubleshoot

If the static IP address defined in the *loadBalancerIP* property of the Kubernetes service manifest does not exist, or has not been created in the node resource group and no additional delegations configured, the load balancer service creation fails. To troubleshoot, review the service creation events with the [kubectl describe][kubectl-describe] command. Provide the name of the service as specified in the YAML manifest, as shown in the following example:

```console
kubectl describe service azure-load-balancer
```

Information about the Kubernetes service resource is displayed. The *Events* at the end of the following example output indicate that the *user supplied IP Address was not found*. In these scenarios, verify that you have created the static public IP address in the node resource group and that the IP address specified in the Kubernetes service manifest is correct.

## Next steps

For additional control over the network traffic to your applications, you may want to instead [create an ingress controller][aks-ingress-basic]. You can also [create an ingress controller with a static public IP address][aks-static-ingress].
