# Control access to cluster resources using role-based access control and Azure Active Directory identities in Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can be configured to use Azure Active Directory (AD) for user authentication. In this configuration, you sign in to an AKS cluster using an Azure AD authentication token. You can also configure Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to cluster resources based a user's identity or group membership.

This article shows you how to use Azure AD group membership to control access to namespaces and cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC in an AKS cluster. Example groups and users are created in Azure AD, then Roles and RoleBindings are created in the AKS cluster to grant the appropriate permissions to create and view resources.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster enabled with Azure AD integration. If you need an AKS cluster, see [Integrate Azure Active Directory with AKS][azure-ad-aks-cli].

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

## Create demo groups in Azure AD

In this article, let's create two user roles that can be used to show how Kubernetes RBAC and Azure AD control access to cluster resources. The following two example roles are used:

* **Application developer**
    * A user named *aksdev* that is part of the *appdev* group.
* **Site reliability engineer**
    * A user named *akssre* that is part of the *opssre* group.

In production environments, you can use existing users and groups within an Azure AD tenant.

First, get the resource ID of your AKS cluster using the [az aks show][az-aks-show] command. Assign the resource ID to a variable named *AKS_ID* so that it can be referenced in additional commands.

```azurecli-interactive
AKS_ID=$(az aks show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --query id -o tsv)
```

Create the first example group in Azure AD for the application developers using the [az ad group create][az-ad-group-create] command. The following example creates a group named *appdev*:

```azurecli-interactive
APPDEV_ID=$(az ad group create --display-name appdev --mail-nickname appdev --query objectId -o tsv)
```

Now, create an Azure role assignment for the *appdev* group using the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command. This assignment lets any member of the group use `kubectl` to interact with an AKS cluster by granting them the *Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role*.

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $APPDEV_ID \
  --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" \
  --scope $AKS_ID
```

> [!TIP]
> If you receive an error such as `Principal 35bfec9328bd4d8d9b54dea6dac57b82 does not exist in the directory a5443dcd-cd0e-494d-a387-3039b419f0d5.`, wait a few seconds for the Azure AD group object ID to propagate through the directory then try the `az role assignment create` command again.

Create a second example group, this one for SREs named *opssre*:

```azurecli-interactive
OPSSRE_ID=$(az ad group create --display-name opssre --mail-nickname opssre --query objectId -o tsv)
```

Again, create an Azure role assignment to grant members of the group the *Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role*:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $OPSSRE_ID \
  --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" \
  --scope $AKS_ID
```

## Create demo users in Azure AD

With two example groups created in Azure AD for our application developers and SREs, now lets create two example users. To test the RBAC integration at the end of the article, you sign in to the AKS cluster with these accounts.

Create the first user account in Azure AD using the [az ad user create][az-ad-user-create] command.

The following example creates a user with the display name *AKS Dev* and the user principal name (UPN) of `aksdev@contoso.com`. Update the UPN to include a verified domain for your Azure AD tenant (replace *contoso.com* with your own domain), and provide your own secure `--password` credential:

```azurecli-interactive
AKSDEV_ID=$(az ad user create \
  --display-name "AKS Dev" \
  --user-principal-name aksdev@contoso.com \
  --password P@ssw0rd1 \
  --query objectId -o tsv)
```

Now add the user to the *appdev* group created in the previous section using the [az ad group member add][az-ad-group-member-add] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad group member add --group appdev --member-id $AKSDEV_ID
```

Create a second user account. The following example creates a user with the display name *AKS SRE* and the user principal name (UPN) of `akssre@contoso.com`. Again, update the UPN to include a verified domain for your Azure AD tenant (replace *contoso.com* with your own domain), and provide your own secure `--password` credential:

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a user for the SRE role
AKSSRE_ID=$(az ad user create \
  --display-name "AKS SRE" \
  --user-principal-name akssre@contoso.com \
  --password P@ssw0rd1 \
  --query objectId -o tsv)

# Add the user to the opssre Azure AD group
az ad group member add --group opssre --member-id $AKSSRE_ID
```

## Create the AKS cluster resources for app devs

The Azure AD groups and users are now created. Azure role assignments were created for the group members to connect to an AKS cluster as a regular user. Now, let's configure the AKS cluster to allow these different groups access to specific resources.

First, get the cluster admin credentials using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. In one of the following sections, you get the regular *user* cluster credentials to see the Azure AD authentication flow in action.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin
```

Create a namespace in the AKS cluster using the [kubectl create namespace][kubectl-create] command. The following example creates a namespace name *dev*:

```console
kubectl create namespace dev
```

In Kubernetes, *Roles* define the permissions to grant, and *RoleBindings* apply them to desired users or groups. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster. For more information, see [Using RBAC authorization][rbac-authorization].

First, create a Role for the *dev* namespace. This role grants full permissions to the namespace. In production environments, you can specify more granular permissions for different users or groups.

Create a file named `role-dev-namespace.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: dev-user-full-access
  namespace: dev
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources:
  - jobs
  - cronjobs
  verbs: ["*"]
```

Create the Role using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f role-dev-namespace.yaml
```

Next, get the resource ID for the *appdev* group using the [az ad group show][az-ad-group-show] command. This group is set as the subject of a RoleBinding in the next step.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad group show --group appdev --query objectId -o tsv
```

Now, create a RoleBinding for the *appdev* group to use the previously created Role for namespace access. Create a file named `rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest. On the last line, replace *groupObjectId*  with the group object ID output from the previous command:

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: dev-user-access
  namespace: dev
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: dev-user-full-access
subjects:
- kind: Group
  namespace: dev
  name: groupObjectId
```

Create the RoleBinding using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml
```

## Create the AKS cluster resources for SREs

Now, repeat the previous steps to create a namespace, Role, and RoleBinding for the SREs.

First, create a namespace for *sre* using the [kubectl create namespace][kubectl-create] command:

```console
kubectl create namespace sre
```

Create a file named `role-sre-namespace.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: sre-user-full-access
  namespace: sre
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources:
  - jobs
  - cronjobs
  verbs: ["*"]
```

Create the Role using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f role-sre-namespace.yaml
```

Get the resource ID for the *opssre* group using the [az ad group show][az-ad-group-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad group show --group opssre --query objectId -o tsv
```

Create a RoleBinding for the *opssre* group to use the previously created Role for namespace access. Create a file named `rolebinding-sre-namespace.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest. On the last line, replace *groupObjectId*  with the group object ID output from the previous command:

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: sre-user-access
  namespace: sre
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: sre-user-full-access
subjects:
- kind: Group
  namespace: sre
  name: groupObjectId
```

Create the RoleBinding using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f rolebinding-sre-namespace.yaml
```

## Interact with cluster resources using Azure AD identities

Now, let's test the expected permissions work when you create and manage resources in an AKS cluster. In these examples, you schedule and view pods in the user's assigned namespace. Then, you try to schedule and view pods outside of the assigned namespace.

First, reset the *kubeconfig* context using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. In a previous section, you set the context using the cluster admin credentials. The admin user bypasses Azure AD sign in prompts. Without the `--admin` parameter, the user context is applied that requires all requests to be authenticated using Azure AD.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing
```

Schedule a basic NGINX pod using the [kubectl run][kubectl-run] command in the *dev* namespace:

```console
kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-dev --image=nginx --namespace dev
```

As the sign in prompt, enter the credentials for your own `appdev@contoso.com` account created at the start of the article. Once you are successfully signed in, the account token is cached for future `kubectl` commands. The NGINX is successfully schedule, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-dev --image=nginx --namespace dev

To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code B24ZD6FP8 to authenticate.

pod/nginx-dev created
```

Now use the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command to view pods in the *dev* namespace.

```console
kubectl get pods --namespace dev
```

As shown in the following example output, the NGINX pod is successfully *Running*:

```console
$ kubectl get pods --namespace dev

NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-dev   1/1     Running   0          4m
```

### Create and view cluster resources outside of the assigned namespace

Now try to view pods outside of the *dev* namespace. Use the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command again, this time to see `--all-namespaces` as follows:

```console
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

The user's group membership does not have a Kubernetes Role that allows this action, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "aksdev@contoso.com" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```

In the same way, try to schedule a pod in different namespace, such as the *sre* namespace. The user's group membership does not align with a Kubernetes Role and RoleBinding to grant these permissions, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-dev --image=nginx --namespace sre

Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "aksdev@contoso.com" cannot create resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "sre"
```

### Test the SRE access to the AKS cluster resources

To confirm that our Azure AD group membership and Kubernetes RBAC work correctly between different users and groups, try the previous commands when signed in as the *opssre* user.

Reset the *kubeconfig* context using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command that clears the previously cached authentication token for the *aksdev* user:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing
```

Try to schedule and view pods in the assigned *sre* namespace. When prompted, sign in with your own `opssre@contoso.com` credentials created at the start of the article:

```console
kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-sre --image=nginx --namespace sre
kubectl get pods --namespace sre
```

As shown in the following example output, you can successfully create and view the pods:

```console
$ kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-sre --image=nginx --namespace sre

To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code BM4RHP3FD to authenticate.

pod/nginx-sre created

$ kubectl get pods --namespace sre

NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-sre   1/1     Running   0
```

Now, try to view or schedule pods outside of assigned SRE namespace:

```console
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-sre --image=nginx --namespace dev
```

These `kubectl` commands fail, as shown in the following example output. The user's group membership and Kubernetes Role and RoleBindings don't grant permissions to create or manager resources in other namespaces:

```console
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot list pods at the cluster scope

$ kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx-sre --image=nginx --namespace dev
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create pods in the namespace "dev"
```

## Clean up resources

In this article, you created resources in the AKS cluster and users and groups in Azure AD. To clean up all these resources, run the following commands:

```azurecli-interactive
# Get the admin kubeconfig context to delete the necessary cluster resources
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin

# Delete the dev and sre namespaces. This also deletes the pods, Roles, and RoleBindings
kubectl delete namespace dev
kubectl delete namespace sre

# Delete the Azure AD user accounts for aksdev and akssre
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSDEV_ID
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSSRE_ID

# Delete the Azure AD groups for appdev and opssre. This also deletes the Azure role assignments.
az ad group delete --group appdev
az ad group delete --group opssre
```
