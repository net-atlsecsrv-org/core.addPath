# Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

This article demonstrates how to:  
* Run your Java, Java EE, Jakarta EE, or MicroProfile application on the Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty runtime.
* Build the application Docker image using Open Liberty container images.
* Deploy the containerized application to an AKS cluster using the Open Liberty Operator.   

The Open Liberty Operator simplifies the deployment and management of applications running on Kubernetes clusters. With Open Liberty Operator, you can also perform more advanced operations, such as gathering traces and dumps. 

For more details on Open Liberty, see [the Open Liberty project page](https://openliberty.io/). For more details on IBM WebSphere Liberty, see [the WebSphere Liberty product page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty).

* This article requires the latest version of Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
* If running the commands in this guide locally (instead of Azure Cloud Shell):
  * Prepare a local machine with Unix-like operating system installed (for example, Ubuntu, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux).
  * Install a Java SE implementation (for example, [AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK 8 LTS/OpenJ9](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9)).
  * Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.0 or higher.
  * Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your OS.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed.  

Create a resource group called *java-liberty-project* using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) command  in the *eastus* location. This resource group will be used later for creating the Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance and the AKS cluster. 

```azurecli-interactive
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=java-liberty-project
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location eastus
```

## Create an ACR instance

Use the [az acr create](/cli/azure/acr#az_acr_create) command to create the ACR instance. The following example creates an ACR instance named *youruniqueacrname*. Make sure *youruniqueacrname* is unique within Azure.

```azurecli-interactive
REGISTRY_NAME=youruniqueacrname
az acr create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $REGISTRY_NAME --sku Basic --admin-enabled
```

After a short time, you should see a JSON output that contains:

```output
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "publicNetworkAccess": "Enabled",
  "resourceGroup": "java-liberty-project",
```

### Connect to the ACR instance

You will need to sign in to the ACR instance before you can push an image to it. Run the following commands to verify the connection:

```azurecli-interactive
LOGIN_SERVER=$(az acr show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query 'loginServer' -o tsv)
USER_NAME=$(az acr credential show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query 'username' -o tsv)
PASSWORD=$(az acr credential show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query 'passwords[0].value' -o tsv)

docker login $LOGIN_SERVER -u $USER_NAME -p $PASSWORD
```

You should see `Login Succeeded` at the end of command output if you have logged into the ACR instance successfully.

## Create an AKS cluster

Use the [az aks create](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_create) command to create an AKS cluster. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one node. This will take several minutes to complete.

```azurecli-interactive
CLUSTER_NAME=myAKSCluster
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys --enable-managed-identity
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster, including the following:

```output
  "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_java-liberty-project_myAKSCluster_eastus",
  "privateFqdn": null,
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "resourceGroup": "java-liberty-project",
```

### Connect to the AKS cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl` is already installed. To install `kubectl` locally, use the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_install_cli) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks install-cli
```

To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the [az aks get-credentials](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_get_credentials) command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --overwrite-existing
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above command uses the default location for the [Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/), which is `~/.kube/config`. You can specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using *--file*.

To verify the connection to your cluster, use the [kubectl get]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command to return a list of the cluster nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get nodes
```

The following example output shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure that the status of the node is *Ready*:

```output
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-nodepool1-xxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyy   Ready    agent   76s     v1.18.10
```

## Install Open Liberty Operator

After creating and connecting to the cluster, install the [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/master/deploy/releases/0.7.0) by running the following commands.

```azurecli-interactive
OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=default
WATCH_NAMESPACE='""'

# Install Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for OpenLibertyApplication
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.0/openliberty-app-crd.yaml

# Install cluster-level role-based access
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.0/openliberty-app-cluster-rbac.yaml \
      | sed -e "s/OPEN_LIBERTY_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE/${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}/" \
      | kubectl apply -f -

# Install the operator
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.0/openliberty-app-operator.yaml \
      | sed -e "s/OPEN_LIBERTY_WATCH_NAMESPACE/${WATCH_NAMESPACE}/" \
      | kubectl apply -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

## Build application image

To deploy and run your Liberty application on the AKS cluster, containerize your application as a Docker image using [Open Liberty container images](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker) or [WebSphere Liberty container images](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker).

1. Clone the sample code for this guide. The sample is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks).
1. Change directory to `javaee-app-simple-cluster` of your local clone.
1. Run `mvn clean package` to package the application.
1. Run `mvn liberty:dev` to test the application. You should see `The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.` in the command output if successful. Use `CTRL-C` to stop the application.
1. Run one of the following commands to build the application image and push it to the ACR instance.
   * Build with Open Liberty base image if you prefer to use Open Liberty as a lightweight open source Javaâ„¢ runtime:

     ```azurecli-interactive
     # Build and tag application image. This will cause the ACR instance to pull the necessary Open Liberty base images.
     az acr build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 -r $REGISTRY_NAME .
     ```

   * Build with WebSphere Liberty base image if you prefer to use a commercial version of Open Liberty:

     ```azurecli-interactive
     # Build and tag application image. This will cause the ACR instance to pull the necessary WebSphere Liberty base images.
     az acr build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 -r $REGISTRY_NAME --file=Dockerfile-wlp .
     ```

## Deploy application on the AKS cluster

Follow steps below to deploy the Liberty application on the AKS cluster.

1. Create a pull secret so that the AKS cluster is authenticated to pull image from the ACR instance.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   kubectl create secret docker-registry acr-secret \
      --docker-server=${LOGIN_SERVER} \
      --docker-username=${USER_NAME} \
      --docker-password=${PASSWORD}
   ```

1. Verify the current working directory is `javaee-app-simple-cluster` of your local clone.
1. Run the following commands to deploy your Liberty application with 3 replicas to the AKS cluster. Command output is also shown inline.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   # Create OpenLibertyApplication "javaee-app-simple-cluster"
   cat openlibertyapplication.yaml | sed -e "s/\${Container_Registry_URL}/${LOGIN_SERVER}/g" | sed -e "s/\${REPLICAS}/3/g" | kubectl apply -f -

   openlibertyapplication.openliberty.io/javaee-app-simple-cluster created

   # Check if OpenLibertyApplication instance is created
   kubectl get openlibertyapplication javaee-app-simple-cluster

   NAME                        IMAGE                                                   EXPOSED   RECONCILED   AGE
   javaee-app-simple-cluster   youruniqueacrname.azurecr.io/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0             True         59s

   # Check if deployment created by Operator is ready
   kubectl get deployment javaee-app-simple-cluster --watch

   NAME                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   javaee-app-simple-cluster   0/3     3            0           20s
   ```

1. Wait until you see `3/3` under the `READY` column and `3` under the `AVAILABLE` column, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

### Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes load balancer service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a while to complete.

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command with the `--watch` argument.

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get service javaee-app-simple-cluster --watch

NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
javaee-app-simple-cluster   LoadBalancer   10.0.251.169   52.152.189.57   80:31732/TCP     68s
```

Once the *EXTERNAL-IP* address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

Open a web browser to the external IP address of your service (`52.152.189.57` for the above example) to see the application home page. You should see the pod name of your application replicas displayed at the top-left of the page. Wait for a few minutes and refresh the page to see a different pod name displayed due to load balancing provided by the AKS cluster.

>[!NOTE]
> - Currently the application is not using HTTPS. It is recommended to [ENABLE TLS with your own certificates](ingress-own-tls.md).

## Clean up the resources

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unnecessary resources.  When the cluster is no longer needed, use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az_group_delete) command to remove the resource group, container service, container registry, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --yes --no-wait
```
