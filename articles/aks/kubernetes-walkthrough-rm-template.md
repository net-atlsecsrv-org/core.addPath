# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using an Azure Resource Manager template

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this quickstart, you deploy an AKS cluster using an Azure Resource Manager template. A multi-container application that includes a web front end and a Redis instance is run in the cluster.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Prerequisites

To create an AKS cluster using a Resource Manager template, you provide an SSH public key and Azure Active Directory service principal. If you need either of these resources, see the following section; otherwise skip to the [Create an AKS cluster](#create-an-aks-cluster) section.

### Create an SSH key pair

To access AKS nodes, you connect using an SSH key pair. Use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate SSH public and private key files. By default, these files are created in the *~/.ssh* directory. If an SSH key pair with the same name exists in the given location, those files are overwritten.

Go to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com) to open Cloud Shell in your browser.

The following command creates an SSH key pair using RSA encryption and a bit length of 2048:

```console
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

For more information about creating SSH keys, see [Create and manage SSH keys for authentication in Azure][ssh-keys].

### Create a service principal

To allow an AKS cluster to interact with other Azure resources, an Azure Active Directory service principal is used. Create a service principal using the [az ad sp create-for-rbac][az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac] command. The `--skip-assignment` parameter limits any additional permissions from being assigned. By default, this service principal is valid for one year.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment
```

The output is similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "appId": "8b1ede42-d407-46c2-a1bc-6b213b04295f",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2019-04-19-21-42-11",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2019-04-19-21-42-11",
  "password": "27e5ac58-81b0-46c1-bd87-85b4ef622682",
  "tenant": "73f978cf-87f2-41bf-92ab-2e7ce012db57"
}
```

Make a note of the *appId* and *password*. These values are used in the following steps.

## Create an AKS cluster

### Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-aks/).

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/101-aks/azuredeploy.json" range="1-126" highlight="86-118":::

For more AKS samples, see the [AKS quickstart templates][aks-quickstart-templates] site.

### Deploy the template

1. Select the following image to sign in to Azure and open a template.

    [![Deploy to Azure](./media/kubernetes-walkthrough-rm-template/deploy-to-azure.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-aks%2Fazuredeploy.json)

2. Select or enter the following values.

    For this quickstart, leave the default values for the *OS Disk Size GB*, *Agent Count*, *Agent VM Size*, *OS Type*, and *Kubernetes Version*. Provide your own values for the following template parameters:

    * **Subscription**: Select an Azure subscription.
    * **Resource group**: Select **Create new**. Enter a unique name for the resource group, such as *myResourceGroup*, then choose **OK**.
    * **Location**: Select a location, such as **East US**.
    * **Cluster name**: Enter a unique name for the AKS cluster, such as *myAKSCluster*.
    * **DNS prefix**: Enter a unique DNS prefix for your cluster, such as *myakscluster*.
    * **Linux Admin Username**: Enter a username to connect using SSH, such as *azureuser*.
    * **SSH RSA Public Key**: Copy and paste the *public* part of your SSH key pair (by default, the contents of *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub*).
    * **Service Principal Client Id**: Copy and paste the *appId* of your service principal from the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command.
    * **Service Principal Client Secret**: Copy and paste the *password* of your service principal from the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command.
    * **I agree to the terms and conditions state above**: Check this box to agree.

3. Select **Purchase**.

It takes a few minutes to create the AKS cluster. Wait for the cluster to be successfully deployed before you move on to the next step.

## Validate the deployment

### Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use [kubectl][kubectl], the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl` is already installed. To install `kubectl` locally, use the [az aks install-cli][az-aks-install-cli] command:

```azurecli
az aks install-cli
```

To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

To verify the connection to your cluster, use the [kubectl get][kubectl-get] command to return a list of the cluster nodes.

```console
kubectl get nodes
```

The following example output shows the nodes created in the previous steps. Make sure that the status for all the nodes is *Ready*:

```output
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-agentpool-41324942-0   Ready    agent   6m44s   v1.12.6
aks-agentpool-41324942-1   Ready    agent   6m46s   v1.12.6
aks-agentpool-41324942-2   Ready    agent   6m45s   v1.12.6
```

### Run the application

A Kubernetes manifest file defines a desired state for the cluster, such as what container images to run. In this quickstart, a manifest is used to create all objects needed to run the Azure Vote application. This manifest includes two [Kubernetes deployments][kubernetes-deployment] - one for the sample Azure Vote Python applications, and the other for a Redis instance. Two [Kubernetes Services][kubernetes-service] are also created - an internal service for the Redis instance, and an external service to access the Azure Vote application from the internet.

> [!TIP]
> In this quickstart, you manually create and deploy your application manifests to the AKS cluster. In more real-world scenarios, you can use [Azure Dev Spaces][azure-dev-spaces] to rapidly iterate and debug your code directly in the AKS cluster. You can use Dev Spaces across OS platforms and development environments, and work together with others on your team.

Create a file named `azure-vote.yaml` and copy in the following YAML definition. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, this file can be created using `vi` or `nano` as if working on a virtual or physical system:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-vote-back
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-back
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "beta.kubernetes.io/os": linux
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-back
        image: redis
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 256Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
          name: redis
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-back
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-vote-front
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-front
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "beta.kubernetes.io/os": linux
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: microsoft/azure-vote-front:v1
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 256Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-front
```

Deploy the application using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f azure-vote.yaml
```

The following example output shows the Deployments and Services created successfully:

```output
deployment "azure-vote-back" created
service "azure-vote-back" created
deployment "azure-vote-front" created
service "azure-vote-front" created
```

### Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

```console
kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
```

Initially the *EXTERNAL-IP* for the *azure-vote-front* service is shown as *pending*.

```output
NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   <pending>     80:30572/TCP   6s
```

When the *EXTERNAL-IP* address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process. The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

```output
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   52.179.23.131   80:30572/TCP   2m
```

To see the Azure Vote app in action, open a web browser to the external IP address of your service.

## Clean up resources

When the cluster is no longer needed, use the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command to remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete the cluster, the Azure Active Directory service principal used by the AKS cluster is not removed. For steps on how to remove the service principal, see [AKS service principal considerations and deletion][sp-delete].

## Get the code

In this quickstart, pre-created container images were used to create a Kubernetes deployment. The related application code, Dockerfile, and Kubernetes manifest file are available on GitHub.
