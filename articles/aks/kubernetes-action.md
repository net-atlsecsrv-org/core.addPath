# GitHub Actions for deploying to Kubernetes service

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. The Kubernetes action [azure/aks-set-context@v1](https://github.com/Azure/aks-set-context) facilitate deployments to Azure Kubernetes Service clusters. The action sets the target AKS cluster context, which could be used by other actions like [azure/k8s-deploy](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-deploy/tree/master), [azure/k8s-create-secret](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-create-secret/tree/master) etc. or run any kubectl commands.

A workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

For a workflow targeting AKS, the file has three sections:

|Section  |Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|**Authentication** | Login to a private container registry (ACR) |
|**Build** | Build & push the container image  |
|**Deploy** | 1. Set the target AKS cluster |
| |2. Create a generic/docker-registry secret in Kubernetes cluster  |
||3. Deploy to the Kubernetes cluster|

## Create a service principal

You can create a [service principal](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md#service-principal-object) by using the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/). You can run this command using [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in the Azure portal or by selecting the **Try it** button.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP> --sdk-auth
```

In the above command, replace the placeholders with your subscription ID, and resource group. The output is the role assignment credentials that provide access to your resource. The command should output a JSON object similar to this.

```json
  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```
Copy this JSON object, which you can use to authenticate from GitHub.

## Configure the GitHub secrets

Follow the steps to configure the secrets:

1. In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse to your repository, select **Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret**.

    ![secrets](media/kubernetes-action/secrets.png)

2. Paste the contents of the above `az cli` command as the value of secret variable. For example, `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

3. Similarly, define the following additional secrets for the container registry credentials and set them in Docker login action. 

    - REGISTRY_USERNAME
    - REGISTRY_PASSWORD

4. You will see the secrets as shown below once defined.

##  Build a container image and deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

The build and push of the container images is done using `Azure/docker-login@v1` action. To deploy a container image to AKS, you will need to use the `Azure/k8s-deploy@v1` action. This action has five parameters:

| **Parameter**  | **Explanation**  |
|---------|---------|
| **namespace** | (Optional) Choose the target Kubernetes namespace. If the namespace is not provided, the commands will run in the default namespace | 
| **manifests** |  (Required) Path to the manifest files, that will be used for deployment |
| **images** | (Optional) Fully qualified resource URL of the image(s) to be used for substitutions on the manifest files |
| **imagepullsecrets** | (Optional) Name of a docker-registry secret that has already been set up within the cluster. Each of these secret names is added under imagePullSecrets field for the workloads found in the input manifest files |
| **kubectl-version** | (Optional) Installs a specific version of kubectl binary |

### Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

End to end workflow for building container images and deploying to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    
    - uses: Azure/docker-login@v1
      with:
        login-server: contoso.azurecr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
    
    - run: |
        docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
      
    # Set the target AKS cluster.
    - uses: Azure/aks-set-context@v1
      with:
        creds: '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'
        cluster-name: contoso
        resource-group: contoso-rg
        
    - uses: Azure/k8s-create-secret@v1
      with:
        container-registry-url: contoso.azurecr.io
        container-registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        container-registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        secret-name: demo-k8s-secret

    - uses: Azure/k8s-deploy@v1
      with:
        manifests: |
          manifests/deployment.yml
          manifests/service.yml
        images: |
          demo.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        imagepullsecrets: |
          demo-k8s-secret
```
