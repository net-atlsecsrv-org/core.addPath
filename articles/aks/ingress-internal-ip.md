# Create an ingress controller to an internal virtual network in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

An ingress controller is a piece of software that provides reverse proxy, configurable traffic routing, and TLS termination for Kubernetes services. Kubernetes ingress resources are used to configure the ingress rules and routes for individual Kubernetes services. Using an ingress controller and ingress rules, a single IP address can be used to route traffic to multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster.

This article shows you how to deploy the [NGINX ingress controller][nginx-ingress] in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The ingress controller is configured on an internal, private virtual network and IP address. No external access is allowed. Two applications are then run in the AKS cluster, each of which is accessible over the single IP address.

- [Enable the HTTP application routing add-on][aks-http-app-routing]
- [Create an ingress controller that uses your own TLS certificates][aks-ingress-own-tls]
- Create an ingress controller that uses Let's Encrypt to automatically generate TLS certificates [with a dynamic public IP address][aks-ingress-tls] or [with a static public IP address][aks-ingress-static-tls]

## Before you begin

This article uses [Helm 3][helm] to install the NGINX ingress controller and cert-manager. For more information on configuring and using Helm, see [Install applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][use-helm].

This article also requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.64 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create an ingress controller

By default, an NGINX ingress controller is created with a dynamic public IP address assignment. A common configuration requirement is to use an internal, private network and IP address. This approach allows you to restrict access to your services to internal users, with no external access.

Create a file named *internal-ingress.yaml* using the following example manifest file. This example assigns *10.240.0.42* to the *loadBalancerIP* resource. Provide your own internal IP address for use with the ingress controller. Make sure that this IP address is not already in use within your virtual network. Also, if you are using an existing virtual network and subnet, you must configure your AKS cluster with the correct permissions to manage the virtual network and subnet. See [Use kubenet networking with your own IP address ranges in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][aks-configure-kubenet-networking] or [Configure Azure CNI networking in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][aks-configure-advanced-networking] for more information.

```yaml
controller:
  service:
    loadBalancerIP: 10.240.0.42
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
```

Now deploy the *nginx-ingress* chart with Helm. To use the manifest file created in the previous step, add the `-f internal-ingress.yaml` parameter. For added redundancy, two replicas of the NGINX ingress controllers are deployed with the `--set controller.replicaCount` parameter. To fully benefit from running replicas of the ingress controller, make sure there's more than one node in your AKS cluster.

The ingress controller also needs to be scheduled on a Linux node. Windows Server nodes shouldn't run the ingress controller. A node selector is specified using the `--set nodeSelector` parameter to tell the Kubernetes scheduler to run the NGINX ingress controller on a Linux-based node.

> [!TIP]
> The following example creates a Kubernetes namespace for the ingress resources named *ingress-basic*. Specify a namespace for your own environment as needed. If your AKS cluster is not RBAC enabled, add `--set rbac.create=false` to the Helm commands.

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to enable [client source IP preservation][client-source-ip] for requests to containers in your cluster, add `--set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local` to the Helm install command. The client source IP is stored in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*. When using an ingress controller with client source IP preservation enabled, TLS pass-through will not work.

```console
# Create a namespace for your ingress resources
kubectl create namespace ingress-basic

# Add the official stable repository
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

# Use Helm to deploy an NGINX ingress controller
helm install nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress \
    --namespace ingress-basic \
    -f internal-ingress.yaml \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
```

When the Kubernetes load balancer service is created for the NGINX ingress controller, your internal IP address is assigned. To get the public IP address, use the `kubectl get service` command.

```console
kubectl get service -l app=nginx-ingress --namespace ingress-basic
```

It takes a few minutes for the IP address to be assigned to the service, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl get service -l app=nginx-ingress --namespace ingress-basic

NAME                             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
nginx-ingress-controller         LoadBalancer   10.0.61.144    10.240.0.42   80:30386/TCP,443:32276/TCP   6m2s
nginx-ingress-default-backend    ClusterIP      10.0.192.145   <none>        80/TCP                       6m2s
```

No ingress rules have been created yet, so the NGINX ingress controller's default 404 page is displayed if you browse to the internal IP address. Ingress rules are configured in the following steps.

## Run demo applications

To see the ingress controller in action, run two demo applications in your AKS cluster. In this example, you use `kubectl apply` to deploy two instances of a simple *Hello world* application.

Create a *aks-helloworld.yaml* file and copy in the following example YAML:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aks-helloworld
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aks-helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: aks-helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: aks-helloworld
        image: neilpeterson/aks-helloworld:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: TITLE
          value: "Welcome to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: aks-helloworld
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: aks-helloworld
```

Create a *ingress-demo.yaml* file and copy in the following example YAML:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ingress-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ingress-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ingress-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ingress-demo
        image: neilpeterson/aks-helloworld:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: TITLE
          value: "AKS Ingress Demo"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ingress-demo
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: ingress-demo
```

Run the two demo applications using `kubectl apply`:

```console
kubectl apply -f aks-helloworld.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
kubectl apply -f ingress-demo.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
```

## Create an ingress route

Both applications are now running on your Kubernetes cluster. To route traffic to each application, create a Kubernetes ingress resource. The ingress resource configures the rules that route traffic to one of the two applications.

In the following example, traffic to the address `http://10.240.0.42/` is routed to the service named `aks-helloworld`. Traffic to the address `http://10.240.0.42/hello-world-two` is routed to the `ingress-demo` service.

Create a file named `hello-world-ingress.yaml` and copy in the following example YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world-ingress
  namespace: ingress-basic
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld
          servicePort: 80
        path: /(.*)
      - backend:
          serviceName: ingress-demo
          servicePort: 80
        path: /hello-world-two(/|$)(.*)
```

Create the ingress resource using the `kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml` command.

```console
kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml
```

The following example output shows the ingress resource is created.

```
$ kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml

ingress.extensions/hello-world-ingress created
```

## Test the ingress controller

To test the routes for the ingress controller, browse to the two applications with a web client. If needed, you can quickly test this internal-only functionality from a pod on the AKS cluster. Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it:

```console
kubectl run -it --rm aks-ingress-test --image=debian --namespace ingress-basic
```

Install `curl` in the pod using `apt-get`:

```console
apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

Now access the address of your Kubernetes ingress controller using `curl`, such as *http://10.240.0.42*. Provide your own internal IP address specified when you deployed the ingress controller in the first step of this article.

```console
curl -L http://10.240.0.42
```

No additional path was provided with the address, so the ingress controller defaults to the */* route. The first demo application is returned, as shown in the following condensed example output:

```
$ curl -L http://10.240.0.42

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/default.css">
    <title>Welcome to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</title>
[...]
```

Now add */hello-world-two* path to the address, such as *http://10.240.0.42/hello-world-two*. The second demo application with the custom title is returned, as shown in the following condensed example output:

```
$ curl -L -k http://10.240.0.42/hello-world-two

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/default.css">
    <title>AKS Ingress Demo</title>
[...]
```

## Clean up resources

This article used Helm to install the ingress components. When you deploy a Helm chart, a number of Kubernetes resources are created. These resources includes pods, deployments, and services. To clean up these resources, you can either delete the entire sample namespace, or the individual resources.

### Delete the sample namespace and all resources

To delete the entire sample namespace, use the `kubectl delete` command and specify your namespace name. All the resources in the namespace are deleted.

```console
kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic
```

### Delete resources individually

Alternatively, a more granular approach is to delete the individual resources created. List the Helm releases with the `helm list` command. 

```console
helm list --namespace ingress-basic
```

Look for charts named *nginx-ingress* and *aks-helloworld*, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ helm list --namespace ingress-basic

NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
nginx-ingress           ingress-basic   1               2020-01-06 19:55:46.358275 -0600 CST    deployed        nginx-ingress-1.27.1    0.26.1  
```

Uninstall the releases with the `helm uninstall` command.

```console
helm uninstall nginx-ingress --namespace ingress-basic
```

The following example uninstalls the NGINX ingress deployment.

```
$ helm uninstall nginx-ingress --namespace ingress-basic

release "nginx-ingress" uninstalled
```

Next, remove the two sample applications:

```console
kubectl delete -f aks-helloworld.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
kubectl delete -f ingress-demo.yaml --namespace ingress-basic
```

Remove the ingress route that directed traffic to the sample apps:

```console
kubectl delete -f hello-world-ingress.yaml
```

Finally, you can delete the itself namespace. Use the `kubectl delete` command and specify your namespace name:

```console
kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic
```
