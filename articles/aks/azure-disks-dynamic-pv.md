# Dynamically create and use a persistent volume with Azure disks in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

A persistent volume represents a piece of storage that has been provisioned for use with Kubernetes pods. A persistent volume can be used by one or many pods, and can be dynamically or statically provisioned. This article shows you how to dynamically create persistent volumes with Azure disks for use by a single pod in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure disk can only be mounted with *Access mode* type *ReadWriteOnce*, which makes it available to only a single pod in AKS. If you need to share a persistent volume across multiple pods, use [Azure Files][azure-files-pvc].

For more information on Kubernetes volumes, see [Storage options for applications in AKS][concepts-storage].

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

## Built-in storage classes

A storage class is used to define how a unit of storage is dynamically created with a persistent volume. For more information on Kubernetes storage classes, see [Kubernetes Storage Classes][kubernetes-storage-classes].

Each AKS cluster includes four pre-created storage classes, two of them configured to work with Azure disks:

* The *default* storage class provisions a standard SSD Azure disk.
    * Standard storage is backed by Standard SSDs and delivers cost-effective storage while still delivering reliable performance. 
* The *managed-premium* storage class provisions a premium Azure disk.
    * Premium disks are backed by SSD-based high-performance, low-latency disk. Perfect for VMs running production workload. If the AKS nodes in your cluster use premium storage, select the *managed-premium* class.
    
If you use one of the default storage classes, you can't update the volume size after the storage class is created. To be able to update the volume size after a storage class is created, add the line `allowVolumeExpansion: true` to one of the default storage classes, or you can create you own custom storage class. Note that it's not supported to reduce the size of a PVC (to prevent data loss). You can edit an existing storage class by using the `kubectl edit sc` command. 

For example, if you want to use a disk of size 4 TiB, you must create a storage class that defines `cachingmode: None` because [disk caching isn't supported for disks 4 TiB and larger](../virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage-performance.md#disk-caching).

For more information about storage classes and creating your own storage class, see [Storage options for applications in AKS][storage-class-concepts].

Use the [kubectl get sc][kubectl-get] command to see the pre-created storage classes. The following example shows the pre-create storage classes available within an AKS cluster:

```console
$ kubectl get sc

NAME                PROVISIONER                AGE
default (default)   kubernetes.io/azure-disk   1h
managed-premium     kubernetes.io/azure-disk   1h
```

> [!NOTE]
> Persistent volume claims are specified in GiB but Azure managed disks are billed by SKU for a specific size. These SKUs range from 32GiB for S4 or P4 disks to 32TiB for S80 or P80 disks (in preview). The throughput and IOPS performance of a Premium managed disk depends on the both the SKU and the instance size of the nodes in the AKS cluster. For more information, see [Pricing and Performance of Managed Disks][managed-disk-pricing-performance].

## Create a persistent volume claim

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is used to automatically provision storage based on a storage class. In this case, a PVC can use one of the pre-created storage classes to create a standard or premium Azure managed disk.

Create a file named `azure-premium.yaml`, and copy in the following manifest. The claim requests a disk named `azure-managed-disk` that is *5GB* in size with *ReadWriteOnce* access. The *managed-premium* storage class is specified as the storage class.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: azure-managed-disk
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: managed-premium
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

> [!TIP]
> To create a disk that uses standard storage, use `storageClassName: default` rather than *managed-premium*.

Create the persistent volume claim with the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify your *azure-premium.yaml* file:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f azure-premium.yaml

persistentvolumeclaim/azure-managed-disk created
```

## Use the persistent volume

Once the persistent volume claim has been created and the disk successfully provisioned, a pod can be created with access to the disk. The following manifest creates a basic NGINX pod that uses the persistent volume claim named *azure-managed-disk* to mount the Azure disk at the path `/mnt/azure`. For Windows Server containers, specify a *mountPath* using the Windows path convention, such as *'D:'*.

Create a file named `azure-pvc-disk.yaml`, and copy in the following manifest.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: nginx:1.15.5
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 256Mi
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/mnt/azure"
      name: volume
  volumes:
    - name: volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: azure-managed-disk
```

Create the pod with the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command, as shown in the following example:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f azure-pvc-disk.yaml

pod/mypod created
```

You now have a running pod with your Azure disk mounted in the `/mnt/azure` directory. This configuration can be seen when inspecting your pod via `kubectl describe pod mypod`, as shown in the following condensed example:

```console
$ kubectl describe pod mypod

[...]
Volumes:
  volume:
    Type:       PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
    ClaimName:  azure-managed-disk
    ReadOnly:   false
  default-token-smm2n:
    Type:        Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)
    SecretName:  default-token-smm2n
    Optional:    false
[...]

```

## Use Ultra Disks
To leverage ultra disk see [Use Ultra Disks on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-ultra-disks.md).

## Back up a persistent volume

To back up the data in your persistent volume, take a snapshot of the managed disk for the volume. You can then use this snapshot to create a restored disk and attach to pods as a means of restoring the data.

First, get the volume name with the `kubectl get pvc` command, such as for the PVC named *azure-managed-disk*:

```console
$ kubectl get pvc azure-managed-disk

NAME                 STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
azure-managed-disk   Bound     pvc-faf0f176-8b8d-11e8-923b-deb28c58d242   5Gi        RWO            managed-premium   3m
```

This volume name forms the underlying Azure disk name. Query for the disk ID with [az disk list][az-disk-list] and provide your PVC volume name, as shown in the following example:

```azurecli-interactive
$ az disk list --query '[].id | [?contains(@,`pvc-faf0f176-8b8d-11e8-923b-deb28c58d242`)]' -o tsv

/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/MC_MYRESOURCEGROUP_MYAKSCLUSTER_EASTUS/providers/MicrosoftCompute/disks/kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-faf0f176-8b8d-11e8-923b-deb28c58d242
```

Use the disk ID to create a snapshot disk with [az snapshot create][az-snapshot-create]. The following example creates a snapshot named *pvcSnapshot* in the same resource group as the AKS cluster (*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*). You may encounter permission issues if you create snapshots and restore disks in resource groups that the AKS cluster does not have access to.

```azurecli-interactive
$ az snapshot create \
    --resource-group MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus \
    --name pvcSnapshot \
    --source /subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus/providers/MicrosoftCompute/disks/kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-faf0f176-8b8d-11e8-923b-deb28c58d242
```

Depending on the amount of data on your disk, it may take a few minutes to create the snapshot.

## Restore and use a snapshot

To restore the disk and use it with a Kubernetes pod, use the snapshot as a source when you create a disk with [az disk create][az-disk-create]. This operation preserves the original resource if you then need to access the original data snapshot. The following example creates a disk named *pvcRestored* from the snapshot named *pvcSnapshot*:

```azurecli-interactive
az disk create --resource-group MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus --name pvcRestored --source pvcSnapshot
```

To use the restored disk with a pod, specify the ID of the disk in the manifest. Get the disk ID with the [az disk show][az-disk-show] command. The following example gets the disk ID for *pvcRestored* created in the previous step:

```azurecli-interactive
az disk show --resource-group MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus --name pvcRestored --query id -o tsv
```

Create a pod manifest named `azure-restored.yaml` and specify the disk URI obtained in the previous step. The following example creates a basic NGINX web server, with the restored disk mounted as a volume at */mnt/azure*:

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypodrestored
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypodrestored
    image: nginx:1.15.5
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 256Mi
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/mnt/azure"
      name: volume
  volumes:
    - name: volume
      azureDisk:
        kind: Managed
        diskName: pvcRestored
        diskURI: /subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/MC_myResourceGroupAKS_myAKSCluster_eastus/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/pvcRestored
```

Create the pod with the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command, as shown in the following example:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f azure-restored.yaml

pod/mypodrestored created
```

You can use `kubectl describe pod mypodrestored` to view details of the pod, such as the following condensed example that shows the volume information:

```console
$ kubectl describe pod mypodrestored

[...]
Volumes:
  volume:
    Type:         AzureDisk (an Azure Data Disk mount on the host and bind mount to the pod)
    DiskName:     pvcRestored
    DiskURI:      /subscriptions/19da35d3-9a1a-4f3b-9b9c-3c56ef409565/resourceGroups/MC_myResourceGroupAKS_myAKSCluster_eastus/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/pvcRestored
    Kind:         Managed
    FSType:       ext4
    CachingMode:  ReadWrite
    ReadOnly:     false
[...]
```
