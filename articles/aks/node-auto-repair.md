# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node auto-repair

AKS continuously monitors the health state of worker nodes and performs automatic node repair if they become unhealthy. The Azure virtual machine (VM) platform [performs maintenance on VMs][vm-updates] experiencing issues. 

AKS and Azure VMs work together to minimize service disruptions for clusters.

In this document, you'll learn how automatic node repair functionality behaves for both Windows and Linux nodes. 

## How AKS checks for unhealthy nodes

AKS uses the following rules to determine if a node is unhealthy and needs repair: 
* The node reports **NotReady** status on consecutive checks within a 10-minute timeframe.
* The node doesn't report any status within 10 minutes.

You can manually check the health state of your nodes with kubectl.

```
kubectl get nodes
```

## How automatic repair works

> [!Note]
> AKS initiates repair operations with the user account **aks-remediator**.

If AKS identifies an unhealthy node that remains unhealthy for 10 minutes, AKS takes the following actions:

1. Reboot the node.
1. If the reboot is unsuccessful, reimage the node.
1. If the reimage is unsuccessful, create and reimage a new node.

Alternative remediations are investigated by AKS engineers if auto-repair is unsuccessful. 

If AKS finds multiple unhealthy nodes during a health check, each node is repaired individually before another repair begins.
