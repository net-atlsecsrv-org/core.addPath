# Linux Performance Troubleshooting

Resource exhaustion on Linux machines is a common issue and can manifest through a wide variety of symptoms. This document provides a high-level overview of the tools available to help diagnose such issues.

Many of these tools accept an interval on which to produce rolling output. This output format typically makes spotting patterns much easier. Where accepted, the example invocation will include `[interval]`.

Many of these tools have an extensive history and wide set of configuration options. This page provides only a simple subset of invocations to highlight common problems. The canonical source of information is always the reference documentation for each particular tool. That documentation will be much more thorough than what is provided here.

## Guidance

Be systematic in your approach to investigating performance issues. Two common approaches are USE (utilization, saturation, errors) and RED (rate, errors, duration). RED is typically used in the context of services for request-based monitoring. USE is typically used for monitoring resources: for each resource in a machine, monitor utilization, saturation, and errors. The four main kinds of resources on any machine are cpu, memory, disk, and network. High utilization, saturation, or error rates for any of these resources indicates a possible problem with the system. When a problem exists, investigate the root cause: why is disk IO latency high? Are the disks or virtual machine SKU throttled? What processes are writing to the devices, and to what files?

Some examples of common issues and indicators to diagnose them:
- IOPS throttling: use iostat to measure per-device IOPS. Ensure no individual disk is above its limit, and the sum for all disks is less than the limit for the virtual machine.
- Bandwidth throttling: use iostat as for IOPS, but measuring read/write throughput. Ensure both per-device and aggregate throughput are below the bandwidth limits.
- SNAT exhaustion: this can manifest as high active (outbound) connections in SAR. 
- Packet loss: this can be measured by proxy via TCP retransmit count relative to sent/received count. Both `sar` and `netstat` can show this information.

## General

These tools are general purpose and cover basic system information. They are a good starting point for further investigation.

### uptime

```
$ uptime
 19:32:33 up 17 days, 12:36,  0 users,  load average: 0.21, 0.77, 0.69
```

uptime provides system uptime and 1, 5, and 15-minute load averages. These load averages roughly correspond to threads doing work or waiting for uninterruptible work to complete. In absolute these numbers can be difficult to interpret, but measured over time they can tell us useful information:

- 1-minute average > 5-minute average means load is increasing.
- 1-minute average < 5-minute average means load is decreasing.

uptime can also illuminate why information is not available: the issue may have resolved on its own or by a restart before the user could access the machine.

Load averages higher than the number of CPU threads available may indicate a performance issue with a given workload.

### dmesg

```
$ dmesg | tail 
$ dmesg --level=err | tail
```

dmesg dumps the kernel buffer. Events like OOMKill add an entry to the kernel buffer. Finding an OOMKill or other resource exhaustion messages in dmesg logs is a strong indicator of a problem.

### top

```
$ top
Tasks: 249 total,   1 running, 158 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  2.2 us,  1.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 95.4 id,  1.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.2 si,  0.0 st
KiB Mem : 65949064 total, 43415136 free,  2349328 used, 20184600 buff/cache
KiB Swap:        0 total,        0 free,        0 used. 62739060 avail Mem

   PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
116004 root      20   0  144400  41124  27028 S  11.8  0.1 248:45.45 coredns
  4503 root      20   0 1677980 167964  89464 S   5.9  0.3   1326:25 kubelet
     1 root      20   0  120212   6404   4044 S   0.0  0.0  48:20.38 systemd
     ...
```

`top` provides a broad overview of current system state. The headers provide some useful aggregate information:

- state of tasks: running, sleeping, stopped.
- CPU utilization, in this case mostly showing idle time.
- total, free, and used system memory.

`top` may miss short-lived processes; alternatives like `htop` and `atop` provide similar interfaces while fixing some of these shortcomings.

## CPU

These tools provide CPU utilization information. This is especially useful with rolling output, where patterns become easy to spot.

### mpstat

```
$ mpstat -P ALL [interval]
Linux 4.15.0-1064-azure (aks-main-10212767-vmss000001)  02/10/20        _x86_64_        (8 CPU)

19:49:04       1    1.98    0.00    0.99    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   97.03

19:49:04       4    1.98    0.00    1.98    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   96.04

```

`mpstat` prints similar CPU information to top, but broken down by CPU thread. Seeing all cores at once can be useful for detecting highly imbalanced CPU usage, for example when a single threaded application uses one core at 100% utilization. This problem may be more difficult to spot when aggregated over all CPUs in the system.

### vmstat

```
$ vmstat [interval]
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 2  0      0 43300372 545716 19691456    0    0     3    50    3    3  2  1 95  1  0
```

`vmstat` provides similar information `mpstat` and `top`, enumerating number of processes waiting on CPU (r column), memory statistics, and percent of CPU time spent in each work state.

## Memory

Memory is a very important, and thankfully easy, resource to track. Some tools can report both CPU and memory, like `vmstat`. But tools like `free` may still be useful for quick debugging.

### free

```
$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          64403        2338       42485           1       19579       61223
Swap:             0           0           0
```

`free` presents basic information about total memory as well as used and free memory. `vmstat` may be more useful even for basic memory analysis due to its ability to provide rolling output.

## Disk

These tools measure disk IOPS, wait queues, and total throughput. 

### iostat

```

```

`iostat` provides deep insights into disk utilization. This invocation passes `-x` for extended statistics, `-y` to skip the initial output printing system averages since boot, and `1 1` to specify we want 1-second interval, ending after one block of output. 

`iostat` exposes many useful statistics:

- `r/s` and `w/s` are reads per second and writes per second. The sum of these values is IOPS.
- `rkB/s` and `wkB/s` are kilobytes read/written per second. The sum of these values is throughput.
- `await` is the average iowait time in milliseconds for queued requests.
- `avgqu-sz` is the average queue size over the provided interval.

On an Azure VM:

- the sum of `r/s` and `w/s` for an individual block device may not exceed that disk's SKU limits.
- the sum of `rkB/s` and `wkB/s`  for an individual block device may not exceed that disk's SKU limits
- the sum of `r/s` and `w/s` for all block devices may not exceed the limits for the VM SKU.
- the sum of  `rkB/s` and `wkB/s for all block devices may not exceed the limits for the VM SKU.

Note that the OS disk counts as a managed disk of the smallest SKU corresponding to its capacity. For example, a 1024GB OS Disk corresponds to a P30 disk. Ephemeral OS disks and temporary disks do not have individual disk limits; they are only limited by the full VM limits.

Non-zero values of await or avgqu-sz are also good indicators of IO contention.

## Network

These tools measure network statistics like throughput, transmission failures, and utilization. Deeper analysis can expose fine-grained TCP statistics about congestion and dropped packets.

`sar` is a powerful tool for a wide range of analysis. While this example uses its ability to measure network stats, it is equally powerful for measuring CPU and memory consumption. This example invokes `sar` with `-n` flag to specify the `DEV` (network device) keyword, displaying network throughput by device.

- The sum of `rxKb/s` and `txKb/s` is total throughput for a given device. When this value exceeds the limit for the provisioned Azure NIC, workloads on the machine will experience increased network latency.
- `%ifutil` measures utilization for a given device. As this value approaches 100%, workloads will experience increased network latency.

```
$ sar -n TCP,ETCP [interval]
Linux 4.15.0-1064-azure (aks-main-10212767-vmss000001)  02/10/20        _x86_64_        (8 CPU)

```

This invocation of `sar` uses the `TCP,ETCP` keywords to examine TCP connections. The third column of the last row, "retrans", is the number of TCP retransmits per second. High values for this field indicate an unreliable network connection. In The first and third rows, "active" means a connection originated from the local device, while "remote" indicates an incoming connection.  A common issue on Azure is SNAT port exhaustion, which `sar` can help detect. SNAT port exhaustion would manifest as high "active" values, since the problem is due to a high rate of outbound, locally-initiated TCP connections.

As `sar` takes an interval, it prints rolling output and then prints final rows of output containing the average results from the invocation.

`netstat` can introspect a wide variety of network stats, here invoked with summary output. There are many useful fields here depending on the issue. One useful field in the TCP section is "failed connection attempts". This may be an indication of SNAT port exhaustion or other issues making outbound connections. A high rate of retransmitted segments (also under the TCP section) may indicate issues with packet delivery.
