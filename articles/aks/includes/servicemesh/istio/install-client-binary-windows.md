## Download and install the Istio istioctl client binary

In a PowerShell-based shell on Windows, use `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the Istio release and then extract with `Expand-Archive` as follows:

```powershell
# Specify the Istio version that will be leveraged throughout these instructions
$ISTIO_VERSION="1.4.0"

# Enforce TLS 1.2
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "tls12"
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest -URI "https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/download/$ISTIO_VERSION/istio-$ISTIO_VERSION-win.zip" -OutFile "istio-$ISTIO_VERSION.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "istio-$ISTIO_VERSION.zip" -DestinationPath .
```

The `istioctl` client binary runs on your client machine and allows you to interact with the Istio service mesh. Use the following commands to install the Istio `istioctl` client binary in a PowerShell-based shell on Windows. These commands copy the `istioctl` client binary to an Istio folder and then make it available both immediately (in current shell) and permanently (across shell restarts) via your `PATH`. You don't need elevated (Admin) privileges to run these commands and you don't need to restart your shell.

```powershell
# Copy istioctl.exe to C:\Istio
cd istio-$ISTIO_VERSION
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "C:\Istio"
Copy-Item -Path .\bin\istioctl.exe -Destination "C:\Istio\"

# Add C:\Istio to PATH. 
# Make the new PATH permanently available for the current User, and also immediately available in the current shell.
$PATH = [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User") + "; C:\Istio\"
[environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $PATH, "User") 
[environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $PATH)
```
