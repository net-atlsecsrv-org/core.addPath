## Download and install the Linkerd linkerd client binary

In a PowerShell-based shell on Windows, use `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the Linkerd release as follows:

```powershell
# Specify the Linkerd version that will be leveraged throughout these instructions
$LINKERD_VERSION="stable-2.6.0"

# Enforce TLS 1.2
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "tls12"
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest -URI "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/download/$LINKERD_VERSION/linkerd2-cli-$LINKERD_VERSION-windows.exe" -OutFile "linkerd2-cli-$LINKERD_VERSION-windows.exe"
```

The `linkerd` client binary runs on your client machine and allows you to interact with the Linkerd service mesh. Use the following commands to install the Linkerd `linkerd` client binary in a PowerShell-based shell on Windows. These commands copy the `linkerd` client binary to a Linkerd folder and then make it available both immediately (in current shell) and permanently (across shell restarts) via your `PATH`. You don't need elevated (Admin) privileges to run these commands and you don't need to restart your shell.

```powershell
# Copy linkerd.exe to C:\Linkerd
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "C:\Linkerd"
Copy-Item -Path ".\linkerd2-cli-$LINKERD_VERSION-windows.exe" -Destination "C:\Linkerd\linkerd.exe"

# Add C:\Linkerd to PATH. 
# Make the new PATH permanently available for the current User, and also immediately available in the current shell.
$PATH = [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User") + "; C:\Linkerd\"
[environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $PATH, "User") 
[environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $PATH)
```
