## Download and install the OSM client binary

In a PowerShell-based shell on Windows, use `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the Istio release and then extract with `Expand-Archive` as follows:

```powershell
# Specify the OSM version that will be leveraged throughout these instructions
$OSM_VERSION="v0.8.2"

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "tls12"
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest -URI "https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/$OSM_VERSION/osm-$OSM_VERSION-windows-amd64.zip" -OutFile "osm-$OSM_VERSION.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "osm-$OSM_VERSION.zip" -DestinationPath .
```

The `osm` client binary runs on your client machine and allows you to manage the OSM controller in your AKS cluster. Use the following commands to install the OSM `osm` client binary in a PowerShell-based shell on Windows. These commands copy the `osm` client binary to an OSM folder and then make it available both immediately (in current shell) and permanently (across shell restarts) via your `PATH`. You don't need elevated (Admin) privileges to run these commands and you don't need to restart your shell.

```powershell
# Copy osm.exe to C:\OSM
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "C:\OSM"
Move-Item -Path .\windows-amd64\osm.exe -Destination "C:\OSM\"

# Add C:\OSM to PATH.
# Make the new PATH permanently available for the current User
$USER_PATH = [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User") + ";C:\OSM\"
[environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $USER_PATH, "User")
# Make the new PATH immediately available in the current shell
$env:PATH += ";C:\OSM\"
```
