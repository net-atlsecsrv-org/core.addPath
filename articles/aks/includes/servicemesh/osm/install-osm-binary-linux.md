## Download and install the OSM client binary

In a bash-based shell on Linux or [Windows Subsystem for Linux][install-wsl], use `curl` to download the OSM release and then extract with `tar` as follows:

```bash
# Specify the OSM version that will be leveraged throughout these instructions
OSM_VERSION=v0.8.2

curl -sL "https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/$OSM_VERSION/osm-$OSM_VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz" | tar -vxzf -
```

The `osm` client binary runs on your client machine and allows you to manage OSM in your AKS cluster. Use the following commands to install the OSM `osm` client binary in a bash-based shell on Linux or [Windows Subsystem for Linux][install-wsl]. These commands copy the `osm` client binary to the standard user program location in your `PATH`.

```bash
sudo mv ./linux-amd64/osm /usr/local/bin/osm
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/osm
```

You can verify the `osm` client library has been correctly added to your path and its version number with the following command.

```
osm version
```
