> AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. AKS preview features aren't available in Azure Government or Azure China 21Vianet clouds. For more information, see the following support articles:
