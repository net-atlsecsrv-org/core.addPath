# Create a Windows Server container on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure CLI

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this article, you deploy an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI. You also deploy an ASP.NET sample application in a Windows Server container to the cluster.

This article assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

### Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters that support multiple node pools:

* You can't delete the first node pool.

The following additional limitations apply to Windows Server node pools:

* The AKS cluster can have a maximum of 10 node pools.
* The AKS cluster can have a maximum of 100 nodes in each node pool.
* The Windows Server node pool name has a limit of 6 characters.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you are asked to specify a location. This location is where resource group metadata is stored, it is also where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation. Create a resource group using the [az group create][az-group-create] command.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses Bash syntax for the commands in this tutorial.
> If you are using Azure Cloud Shell, ensure that the dropdown in the upper-left of the Cloud Shell window is set to **Bash**.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

The following example output shows the resource group created successfully:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup",
  "location": "eastus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "myResourceGroup",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": null
}
```

## Create an AKS cluster

To run an AKS cluster that supports node pools for Windows Server containers, your cluster needs to use a network policy that uses [Azure CNI][azure-cni-about] (advanced) network plugin. For more detailed information to help plan out the required subnet ranges and network considerations, see [configure Azure CNI networking][use-advanced-networking]. Use the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command to create an AKS cluster named *myAKSCluster*. This command will create the necessary network resources if they don't exist.

* The cluster is configured with two nodes
* The *windows-admin-password* and *windows-admin-username* parameters set the admin credentials for any Windows Server containers created on the cluster and must meet [Windows Server password requirements][windows-server-password].
* The node pool uses `VirtualMachineScaleSets`

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure your cluster to operate reliably, you should run at least 2 (two) nodes in the default node pool.

Provide your own secure *PASSWORD_WIN* (remember that the commands in this article are entered into a BASH shell):

```azurecli-interactive
PASSWORD_WIN="P@ssw0rd1234"

az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --node-count 2 \
    --enable-addons monitoring \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --windows-admin-password $PASSWORD_WIN \
    --windows-admin-username azureuser \
    --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \
    --network-plugin azure
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get a password validation error, try creating your resource group in another region.
> Then try creating the cluster with the new resource group.

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. Occasionally the cluster can take longer than a few minutes to provision. Allow up to 10 minutes in these cases.

## Add a Windows Server node pool

By default, an AKS cluster is created with a node pool that can run Linux containers. Use `az aks nodepool add` command to add an additional node pool that can run Windows Server containers alongside the Linux node pool.

```azurecli
az aks nodepool add \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --cluster-name myAKSCluster \
    --os-type Windows \
    --name npwin \
    --node-count 1
```

The above command creates a new node pool named *npwin* and adds it to the *myAKSCluster*. When creating a node pool to run Windows Server containers, the default value for *node-vm-size* is *Standard_D2s_v3*. If you choose to set the *node-vm-size* parameter, please check the list of [restricted VM sizes][restricted-vm-sizes]. The minimum recommended size is *Standard_D2s_v3*. The above command also uses the default subnet in the default vnet created when running `az aks create`.

## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use [kubectl][kubectl], the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl` is already installed. To install `kubectl` locally, use the [az aks install-cli][az-aks-install-cli] command:

```azurecli
az aks install-cli
```

To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

To verify the connection to your cluster, use the [kubectl get][kubectl-get] command to return a list of the cluster nodes.

```console
kubectl get nodes
```

The following example output shows the all the nodes in the cluster. Make sure that the status of all nodes is *Ready*:

```output
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmssfedcba   Ready    agent   13m    v1.16.9
aksnpwin987654                      Ready    agent   108s   v1.16.9
```

## Run the application

A Kubernetes manifest file defines a desired state for the cluster, such as what container images to run. In this article, a manifest is used to create all objects needed to run the ASP.NET sample application in a Windows Server container. This manifest includes a [Kubernetes deployment][kubernetes-deployment] for the ASP.NET sample application and an external [Kubernetes service][kubernetes-service] to access the application from the internet.

The ASP.NET sample application is provided as part of the [.NET Framework Samples][dotnet-samples] and runs in a Windows Server container. AKS requires Windows Server containers to be based on images of *Windows Server 2019* or greater. The Kubernetes manifest file must also define a [node selector][node-selector] to tell your AKS cluster to run your ASP.NET sample application's pod on a node that can run Windows Server containers.

Create a file named `sample.yaml` and copy in the following YAML definition. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, this file can be created using `vi` or `nano` as if working on a virtual or physical system:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample
  labels:
    app: sample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      name: sample
      labels:
        app: sample
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "beta.kubernetes.io/os": windows
      containers:
      - name: sample
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:aspnetapp
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 1
            memory: 800M
          requests:
            cpu: .1
            memory: 300M
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
  selector:
    app: sample
```

Deploy the application using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f sample.yaml
```

The following example output shows the Deployment and Service created successfully:

```output
deployment.apps/sample created
service/sample created
```

## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete. Occasionally the service can take longer than a few minutes to provision. Allow up to 10 minutes in these cases.

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

```console
kubectl get service sample --watch
```

Initially the *EXTERNAL-IP* for the *sample* service is shown as *pending*.

```output
NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
sample             LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   <pending>     80:30572/TCP   6s
```

When the *EXTERNAL-IP* address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process. The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

```output
sample  LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   52.179.23.131   80:30572/TCP   2m
```

To see the sample app in action, open a web browser to the external IP address of your service.

> [!Note]
> If you receive a connection timeout when trying to load the page then you should verify the sample app is ready with the following command [kubectl get pods --watch]. Sometimes the windows container will not be started by the time your external IP address is available.

## Delete cluster

When the cluster is no longer needed, use the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command to remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete the cluster, the Azure Active Directory service principal used by the AKS cluster is not removed. For steps on how to remove the service principal, see [AKS service principal considerations and deletion][sp-delete]. If you used a managed identity, the identity is managed by the platform and does not require removal.

## Next steps

In this article, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and deployed an ASP.NET sample application in a Windows Server container to it. [Access the Kubernetes web dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard] for the cluster you just created.
