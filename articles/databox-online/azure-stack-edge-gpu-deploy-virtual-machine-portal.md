# Deploy VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device via the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

You can create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on an Azure Stack Edge device by using the Azure portal, templates, and Azure PowerShell cmdlets, and via the Azure CLI or Python scripts. This article describes how to create and manage a VM on your Azure Stack Edge device by using the Azure portal. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> We recommend that you enable multifactor authentication for the user who manages VMs that are deployed on your device from the cloud.
        
## VM deployment workflow

The high-level summary of the deployment workflow is as follows:

1. Enable a network interface for compute on your Azure Stack Edge device. This step creates a virtual switch on the specified network interface.
1. Enable cloud management of VMs from the Azure portal.
1. Upload a VHD to an Azure Storage account by using Azure Storage Explorer. 
1. Use the uploaded VHD to download the VHD onto the device, and create a VM image from the VHD. 
1. Use the resources created in the previous steps:
    1. VM image that you created.
    1. Virtual switch associated with the network interface on which you enabled compute.
    1. Subnet associated with the virtual switch.

    And create or specify the following resources inline:
    1. VM name, choose a supported VM size, sign-in credentials for the VM. 
    1. Create new data disks or attach existing data disks.
    1. Configure static or dynamic IP for the VM. If you're providing a static IP, choose from a free IP in the subnet range of the network interface enabled for compute.

    Use the preceding resources to create a VM.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin to create and manage VMs on your device via the Azure portal, make sure that:

1. You've completed the network settings on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device as described in [Step 1: Configure an Azure Stack Edge Pro device](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#step-1-configure-azure-stack-edge-pro-device).

    1. You've enabled a network interface for compute. This network interface IP is used to create a virtual switch for the VM deployment. In the local UI of your device, go to **Compute**. Select the network interface that you'll use to create a virtual switch.

        > [!IMPORTANT] 
        > You can configure only one port for compute.

    1. Enable compute on the network interface. Azure Stack Edge Pro creates and manages a virtual switch corresponding to that network interface.

1. You have access to a Windows or Linux VHD that you'll use to create the VM image for the VM you intend to create.

## Deploy a VM

Follow these steps to create a VM on your Azure Stack Edge device.

### Add a VM image

1. Upload a VHD to an Azure Storage account. Follow the steps in [Upload a VHD by using Azure Storage Explorer](../devtest-labs/devtest-lab-upload-vhd-using-storage-explorer.md).

1. In the Azure portal, go to the Azure Stack Edge resource for your Azure Stack Edge device. Go to **Edge compute** > **Virtual machines**.
