If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Get started

To deploy Azure Stack Edge Pro, refer to the following tutorials in the prescribed sequence.

| **#** | **In this step** | **Use these documents** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1. |**[Prepare the Azure portal for Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-deploy-prep.md)** |Create and configure your Azure Stack Edge resource before you install a Azure Stack Box Edge physical device. |
| 2. |**[Install Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-deploy-install.md)**|Unpack, rack, and cable the Azure Stack Edge Pro physical device.  |
| 3. |**[Connect, set up, and activate Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-deploy-connect-setup-activate.md)** |Connect to the local web UI, complete the device setup, and activate the device. The device is ready to set up SMB or NFS shares.  |
| 4. |**[Transfer data with Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-deploy-add-shares.md)** |Add shares and connect to shares via SMB or NFS. |
| 5. |**[Transform data with Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-deploy-configure-compute.md)** |Configure compute modules on the device to transform the data as it moves to Azure. |

You can now begin to set up the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Azure Stack Edge resource, your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Azure Stack Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not supported.

* You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

  * You should be an **Owner** at the subscription level to grant contributor access. To give contributor access to someone else, in Azure portal, go to **All Services** > **Subscriptions** > **Access control (IAM)** > **+Add** > **Add role assignment**. For more information, see [Tutorial: Grant a user access to Azure resources using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/quickstart-assign-role-user-portal).

  * To create any Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` resource provider is registered. For information on how to register a resource provider, see [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
  * To create any IoT Hub resource, make sure that Microsoft.Devices provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
  * To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
* You have admin or user access to AzureÂ Active Directory Graph API. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).
* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.
* You are not blocked by any Azure policy set up by your system administrator. For more information about policies, see [Quickstart: Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-portal).

### For the Azure Stack Edge Pro device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

* You've reviewed the safety information that was included in the shipment package.
* You have a 1U slot available in a standard 19" rack in your datacenter for rack mounting the device.
* You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
* The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
* You have access to a physical device.

### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

* The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. For more information, see [Azure Stack Edge Pro System Requirements](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md).

* For normal operating conditions of your Azure Stack Edge Pro, you have:

  * A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
  * A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create a new resource

If you have an existing Azure Stack Edge resource to manage your physical device, skip this step and go to [Get the activation key](#get-the-activation-key).

To create a Azure Stack Edge resource, take the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to sign in to 

    - The Azure portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
    - Or, the Azure Government portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.us](https://portal.azure.us). For more details, go to [Connect to Azure Government using the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-portal).

2. In the left-pane, select **+ Create a resource**. Search for and select **Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway**. Select **Create**.
3. Pick the subscription that you want to use for the Azure Stack Edge Pro device. Select the region where you want to deploy the Azure Stack Edge resource. For a list of all the regions where the Azure Stack Edge resource is available, see [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=databox&regions=all).

    Choose a location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device. The region stores only the metadata for device management. The actual data can be stored in any storage account.
    
    In the **Azure Stack Edge Pro** option, select **Create**.
