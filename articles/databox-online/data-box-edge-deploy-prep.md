If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

### Get started

To deploy Data Box Edge, refer to the following tutorials in the prescribed sequence.

| **#** | **In this step** | **Use these documents** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1. |**[Prepare the Azure portal for Data Box Edge](data-box-edge-deploy-prep.md)** |Create and configure your Data Box Edge resource before you install a Data Box Edge physical device. |
| 2. |**[Install Data Box Edge](data-box-edge-deploy-install.md)**|Unpack, rack, and cable the Data Box Edge physical device.  |
| 3. |**[Connect, set up, and activate Data Box Edge](data-box-edge-deploy-connect-setup-activate.md)** |Connect to the local web UI, complete the device setup, and activate the device. The device is ready to set up SMB or NFS shares.  |
| 4. |**[Transfer data with Data Box Edge](data-box-edge-deploy-add-shares.md)** |Add shares and connect to shares via SMB or NFS. |
| 5. |**[Transform data with Data Box Edge](data-box-edge-deploy-configure-compute.md)** |Configure compute modules on the device to transform the data as it moves to Azure. |

You can now begin to set up the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Data Box Edge resource, your Data Box Edge device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Data Box Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/).
* You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Data Box Edge/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.
    - To create any Data Box Edge/ Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](data-box-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    - To create any IoT Hub resource, make sure that Microsoft.Devices provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](data-box-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
- You have admin or user access to Microsoft Graph API. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference).
- You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

### For the Data Box Edge device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

- You've reviewed the safety information that was included in the shipment package.
- You have a 1U slot available in a standard 19" rack in your datacenter for rack mounting the device.
- You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
- The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
- You have access to a physical device.


### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

- The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Data Box Edge device. For more information, see [Data Box Edge System Requirements](data-box-edge-system-requirements.md).

- For normal operating conditions of your Data Box Edge, you have:

    - A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
    - A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create a new resource

If you have an existing Data Box Edge resource to manage your physical device, skip this step and go to [Get the activation key](#get-the-activation-key).

To create a Data Box Edge resource, take the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to sign in to 
    
    - The Azure portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
    - Or, the Azure Government portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.us](https://portal.azure.us). For more details, go to [Connect to Azure Government using the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-portal).

2. In the left-pane, select **+ Create a resource**. Search for **Data Box Edge / Data Box Gateway**. Select **Data Box Edge / Data Box Gateway**. Select **Create**.
3. Pick the subscription that you want to use for the Data Box Edge device. Select the region where you want to deploy the Data Box Edge resource. For a list of all the regions where the Azure Stack Edge resource is available, see [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=databox&regions=all).

    Choose a location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device. The region stores only the metadata for device management. The actual data can be stored in any storage account.
    
    In the **Data Box Edge** option, select **Create**.

    ![Search Data Box Edge service](media/data-box-edge-deploy-prep/data-box-edge-sku.png)

3. On the **Basics** tab, enter or select the following **Project details**.
    
    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Subscription    |This is automatically populated based on the earlier selection. Subscription is linked to your billing account. |
    |Resource group  |Select an existing group or create a new group.<br>Learn more about [Azure Resource Groups](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).     |

4. Enter or select the following **Instance details**.

    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Name   | A friendly name to identify the resource.<br>The name has between 2 and 50 characters containing letter, numbers, and hyphens.<br> Name starts and ends with a letter or a number.        |
    |Region     |For a list of all the regions where the Azure Stack Edge resource is available, see [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=databox&regions=all). If using Azure Government, all the government regions are available as shown in the [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/).<br> Choose a location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device.|

6. Select **Next: Review + create**.

7. On the **Review + create** tab, review the **Pricing details**, **Terms of use**, and the details for your resource. Select the combo box for **I have reviewed the privacy terms**.

    ![Review Data Box Edge resource details and privacy terms](media/data-box-edge-deploy-prep/data-box-edge-resource2.png)

8. Select **Create**.

The resource creation takes a few minutes. After the resource is successfully created and deployed, you're notified. Select **Go to resource**.

![Go to the Data Box Edge resource](media/data-box-edge-deploy-prep/data-box-edge-resource3.png)

After the order is placed, Microsoft reviews the order and reaches out to you (via email) with shipping details.

## Get the activation key

After the Data Box Edge resource is up and running, you'll need to get the activation key. This key is used to activate and connect your Data Box Edge device with the resource. You can get this key now while you are in the Azure portal.

1. Select the resource that you created. Select **Overview** and then select **Device setup**.

    ![Select Device setup](media/data-box-edge-deploy-prep/data-box-edge-select-devicesetup.png)

2. On the **Activate** tile, select **Generate key** to create an activation key. Select the copy icon to copy the key and save it for later use.
