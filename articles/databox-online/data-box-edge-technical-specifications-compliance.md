# Azure Data Box Edge technical specifications

The hardware components of your Microsoft Azure Data Box Edge device adhere to the technical specifications and regulatory standards outlined in this article. The technical specifications describe the Power supply units (PSUs), storage capacity, enclosures, and environmental standards. 

## Compute, memory specifications

The Data Box Edge device has the following specifications for compute and memory:

| Specification           | Value                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| CPU    | 2 X 10 core CPU                     |
| Memory              | 128 GB RAM                  |


## FPGA specifications

A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is included on every Data Box Edge device that enables Machine Learning (ML) scenarios. 

| Specification           | Value                  |
