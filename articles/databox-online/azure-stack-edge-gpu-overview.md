# What is Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU?

Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU is an AI-enabled edge computing device with network data transfer capabilities. This article provides you an overview of the Azure Stack Edge Pro solution, benefits, key capabilities, and the scenarios where you can deploy this device.

Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU is a Hardware-as-a-service solution. Microsoft ships you a cloud-managed device that acts as network storage gateway and has a built-in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) that enables accelerated AI-inferencing. 

## Use cases

Here are the various scenarios where Azure Stack Edge Pro can be used for rapid Machine Learning (ML) inferencing at the edge and preprocessing data before sending it to Azure.

- **Inference with Azure Machine Learning** - With Azure Stack Edge Pro, you can run ML models to get quick results that can be acted on before the data is sent to the cloud. The full data set can optionally be transferred to continue to retrain and improve your ML models. For more information on how to use the Azure ML hardware accelerated models on the Azure Stack Edge Pro device, see 
[Deploy Azure ML hardware accelerated models on Azure Stack Edge Pro](../machine-learning/how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md#deploy-to-a-local-edge-server).

- **Preprocess data** - Transform data before sending it to Azure via compute options such as containerized workloads and Virtual Machines to create a more actionable dataset. Preprocessing can be used to: 

    - Aggregate data.
    - Modify data, for example to remove personal data.
    - Subset data to optimize storage and bandwidth, or for further analysis.
    - Analyze and react to IoT Events. 

- **Transfer data over network to Azure** - Use Azure Stack Edge Pro to easily and quickly transfer data to Azure to enable further compute and analytics or for archival purposes. 

## Key capabilities

Azure Stack Edge Pro has the following capabilities:

|Capability |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Accelerated AI inferencing| Enabled by the built-in GPU (one or two depending on the model).|
|Edge computing      |Supports VM and containerized workloads to allow analysis, processing, and filtering of data. |
|Data access     | Direct data access from Azure Storage Blobs and Azure Files using cloud APIs for additional data processing in the cloud. Local cache on the device is used for fast access of most recently used files.|
|Cloud-managed     |Device and service are managed via the Azure portal.  |
|Offline upload     | Disconnected mode supports offline upload scenarios.|
|Supported file transfer protocols      | Support for standard SMB, NFS, and REST protocols for data ingestion. <br> For more information on supported versions, see [Azure Stack Edge Pro system requirements](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md).|
|Data refresh     | Ability to refresh local files with the latest from cloud.|
|Encryption    | BitLocker support to locally encrypt data and secure data transfer to cloud over *https*.|
|Bandwidth throttling| Throttle to limit bandwidth usage during peak hours.|
<!--|ExpressRoute | Added security through ExpressRoute. Use peering configuration where traffic from local devices to the cloud storage endpoints travels over the ExpressRoute. For more information, see [ExpressRoute overview](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).|-->

## Components

The Azure Stack Edge Pro solution comprises of Azure Stack Edge resource, Azure Stack Edge Pro physical device, and a local web UI.

* **Azure Stack Edge Pro physical device** - A 1U rack-mounted server supplied by Microsoft that can be configured to send data to Azure.
    
* **Azure Stack Edge resource** â€“ A resource in the Azure portal that lets you manage an Azure Stack Edge Pro device from a web interface that you can access from different geographical locations. Use the Azure Stack Edge resource to create and manage resources, view, and manage devices and alerts, and manage shares.  

    For more information, go to [Create an order for your Azure Stack Edge Pro device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep.md#create-a-new-resource).

* **Azure Stack Edge Pro local web UI** - A browser-based local user interface on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device primarily intended for the initial configuration of the device. Use the local web UI also to run diagnostics, shut down and restart the Azure Stack Edge Pro device, view copy logs, and contact Microsoft Support to file a service request.

    For information about using the web-based UI, go to [Use the web-based UI to administer your Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md).

## Region availability

Azure Stack Edge Pro physical device, Azure resource, and target storage account to which you transfer data do not all have to be in the same region.

- **Resource availability** - For this preview release, the resource is available in East US, West EU, and South East Asia regions.

- **Device availability** - For a list of all the countries/regions where the Azure Stack Edge Pro device is available, go to **Availability** section in the **Azure Stack Edge Pro** tab for [Azure Stack Edge Pro pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/#azureStackEdgePro).
    
- **Destination Storage accounts** - The storage accounts that store the data are available in all Azure regions. The regions where the storage accounts store Azure Stack Edge Pro data should be located close to where the device is located for optimum performance. A storage account located far from the device results in long latencies and slower performance.

## Next steps

- Review the [Azure Stack Edge Pro system requirements](azure-stack-edge-gpu-system-requirements.md).

- Understand the [Azure Stack Edge Pro limits](azure-stack-edge-limits.md).
- Deploy [Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep.md) in Azure portal.
