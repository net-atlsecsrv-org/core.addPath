## Deployment configuration checklist

Before you deploy your device, you need to collect information to configure the software on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. Preparing some of this information ahead of time helps streamline the process of deploying the device in your environment. Use the [Azure Stack Edge Pro deployment configuration checklist](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-checklist.md) to note down the configuration details as you deploy your device.


## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Azure Stack Edge resource, your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Azure Stack Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

- Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for a Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not supported.
- You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge Pro/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

    - To create any Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    - To create any IoT Hub resource, make sure that Microsoft.Devices provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
- You have admin or user access to AzureÂ Active Directory Graph API. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).
- You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

### For the Azure Stack Edge Pro device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

- You've reviewed the safety information that was included in the shipment package.
- You have a 1U slot available in a standard 19" rack in your datacenter for rack mounting the device.
- You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
- The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
- You have access to a physical device.


### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

- The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. For more information, see [Azure Stack Edge Pro System Requirements](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md).

- For normal operating conditions of your Azure Stack Edge Pro, you have:

    - A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
    - A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create a new resource
