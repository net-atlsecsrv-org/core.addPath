# Deployment checklist for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device  

This article describes the information that can be gathered ahead of the actual deployment of your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. 

Use the following checklist to ensure you have this information after you have placed an order for an Azure Stack Edge Pro device and before you have received the device. 

## Deployment checklist

| (Optional) Certificates                      | Use the certificates generated by the device <br><br> If bringing your own certificates, you need: <li>Trusted root signing certificate in DER format with *.cer* </li><li>Endpoint certificates in *pfx* format</li>|Endpoint certificates include for Azure Resource Manager, Blob storage, Local web UI.                                                                                                                   |
| Activation                        | Require activation key from the Azure Stack Edge Pro/ Data Box Gateway resource.                                                                                                                                                       | Once generated, the key expires in 3 days.                                                                        |
