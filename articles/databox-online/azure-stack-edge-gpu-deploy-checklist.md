# Deployment checklist for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device  

This article describes the information that can be gathered ahead of the actual deployment of your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. 

Use the following checklist to ensure you have this information after you have placed an order for an Azure Stack Edge Pro device and before you have received the device. 

## Deployment checklist 

| Stage                             | Parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Details                                                                                                           |

| Device   management               | <li>Azure subscription</li><li>Resource providers registered</li><li>Azure Storage account</li>|<li>Enabled for Azure Stack Edge Pro/Data Box Gateway, owner or contributor access.</li><li>In Azure portal, go to **Home > Subscriptions > Your-subscription > Resource providers**. Search for `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` and register. Repeat for `Microsoft.Devices` if deploying IoT workloads.</li><li>Need access credentials</li> |
| Device installation               | Power cables in the package. <br>For US, an SVE 18/3 cable rated for 125 V and 15 Amps with a NEMA 5-15P to C13 (input to output) connector is shipped. | For more information, see the list of [Supported power cords by country](azure-stack-edge-technical-specifications-power-cords-regional.md)  |
|                                   | <li>At least  1 X 1-GbE RJ-45 network cable for Port 1  </li><li> At least 1 X 25-GbE SFP+ copper cable for Port 3, Port 4, Port 5, or Port 6</li>| Customer needs to procure these cables.<br>For a full list of supported network cables, switches, and transceivers for device network cards, see [Cavium FastlinQ 41000 Series Interoperability Matrix](https://www.marvell.com/documents/xalflardzafh32cfvi0z/) and [Mellanox dual port 25G ConnectX-4 channel network adapter compatible products](https://docs.mellanox.com/display/ConnectX4LxFirmwarev14271016/Firmware+Compatible+Products).| 
| First time device connection      | <li>Laptop whose IPv4 settings can be changed. This laptop connects to Port 1 via a switch or a USB to Ethernet adaptor.  </li><!--<li> A minimum of 1 GbE switch must be used for the device once the initial setup is complete. The local web UI will not be accessible if the connected switch is not at least 1 Gbe.</li>-->|   |
| Device sign-in                      | Device administrator password, between 8 and 16 characters and contains three of the following: uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.                                            | Default password is *Password1* which expires at first sign in.                                                     |
| Network settings                  | Device comes with 2 x 1 GbE, 4 x 25 GbE network ports. <li>Port 1 is used to configure management settings only. One or more data ports can be connected and configured. </li><li> At least one data network interface from among Port 2 - Port 6 needs to be connected to the Internet (with connectivity to Azure).</li><li> DHCP and static IPv4 configuration supported. | Static IPv4 configuration requires IP, DNS server, and default gateway.   |
| Compute network settings     | <li>Require 2 free, static, contiguous IPs for Kubernetes nodes, and 1 static IP for IoT Edge service.</li><li>Require one additional IP for each extra service or module that you'll deploy.</li>| Only static IPv4 configuration is supported.|
| (Optional) Web proxy settings     | <li>Web proxy server IP/FQDN, port </li><li>Web proxy username, password</li> | Web proxy not supported with compute setup. |
| Firewall and port settings        | If using firewall, make sure the [listed URLs patterns and ports](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md#networking-port-requirements) are allowed for device IPs. |  |
| (Recommended) Time settings       | Configure time zone, primary NTP server, secondary NTP server. | Configure primary and secondary NTP server on local network.<br>If local server is not available, public NTP servers can be   configured.                                                    |
| (Optional) Update server settings | <li>Require update server IP address on local network, path to WSUS server. </li> | By default, public windows update server is used.|
| Device settings | <li>Device fully qualified domain name (FQDN) </li><li>DNS domain</li> | |
| (Optional) Certificates  | To test non-production workloads, use [Generate certificates option](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-certificates.md#generate-device-certificates) <br><br> If you bring your own certificates including the signing chain(s), [Add certificates](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-certificates.md#bring-your-own-certificates) in appropriate format.| Configure certificates only if you change device name and/or DNS domain. |
| Activation  | Require activation key from the Azure Stack Edge Pro/ Data Box Gateway resource.    | Once generated, the key expires in 3 days. |

<!--
| (Optional) MAC Address            | If MAC address needs to be whitelisted, get the address of the connected port from local UI of the device. |                                                                                                                   |
| (Optional) Network switch port    | Device hosts Hyper-V VMs for compute. Some network switch port configurations donâ€™t accommodate these setups by default.                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                   |-->
