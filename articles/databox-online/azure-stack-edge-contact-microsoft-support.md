    After you have created the Support ticket, a Support engineer will contact you as soon as possible to proceed with your request.

2. If Microsoft Support determines that this is a hardware issue, then one of the following action occurs:

    * A Field Replacement Unit (FRU) for the failed hardware part is sent. Currently, power supply units and hard drives are the only supported FRUs.
    * Only FRUs are replaced within the next business day, everything else requires a full system replacement (FSR) to be shipped.

3. If a Support ticket is raised before 4:30 pm local time (Monday to Friday), an onsite technician is dispatched the next business day to your location to perform  a FRU or a full device replacement.

## Manage a support request

After creating a support ticket, you can manage the lifecycle of the ticket from within the portal.
