# Azure security baseline for Azure Stack Edge

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Microsoft Azure Stack Edge. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Stack Edge. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Stack Edge have been excluded.

To see how Azure Stack Edge completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Stack Edge security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

**Guidance**: Customers deploy a Microsoft-provided, physical, Azure Stack Edge device into their private network for internal access and have options to secure it further. 
For example, the Azure Stack Edge device is accessible over the customer's internal network and requires a customer-configured IP. Additionally, an access password is chosen by the customer to access the user interface of the device. 

Internal traffic is further secured by:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 is required for Azure portal and SDK management of the Azure Stack Edge device.

- Any client access to the device is through the local web UI using standard TLS 1.2 as the default secure protocol.

- Only an authorized Azure Stack Edge Pro device is allowed to join the Azure Stack Edge service that the customer's create in their Azure subscription.

Additional information is available at the referenced links.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-2: Manage application identities securely and automatically

**Guidance**: All Azure Stack Edge devices automatically have a system-assigned managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Currently, the managed identity is used for the cloud management of virtual machines hosted on Azure Stack Edge.

Azure Stack Edge devices boot up into a locked state for local access. For the local device administrator account, you will need to connect to your device through the local web user interface or PowerShell interface and set a strong password. Store and manage your device administrator credential in a secure location such as an Azure Key Vault and rotate the admin password according to your organizational standards.

- [Protect Azure Stack Edge device via password](azure-stack-edge-security.md#protect-the-device-via-password)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Shared

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Single sign-on is not supported for Azure Stack Edge endpoint devices. However, you can choose to enable standard Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) based single sign-on to secure access to your Azure cloud resources.

- [Understand application SSO with Azure AD](../active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Multifactor authentication  is a strong authentication control, but an opt-in feature for the Azure Stack Edge service users. It can be leveraged for supported scenarios such as edge-management of Azure Stack Edge devices at the Azure portal. Note that the local access to the Azure Stack Edge devices does not support multifactor authentication.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Monitor to gather device or container logs for your Azure Stack Edge service. Monitor containers, such as the ones running multiple compute applications at the Kubernetes cluster on your device.

Additionally, a support package, which includes audit logs can be gathered at the local web user interface of the Azure Stack Edge device. Note that the support package is not available at the Azure portal.

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

**Guidance**: Azure Stack Edge solution has several components with strong access-controls to restrict access to business critical devices. Your organization will need an Enterprise Agreement (EA) or Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) or a Microsoft Azure Sponsorship subscription to configure and manage the device: 

Azure Stack Edge service is protected by the Azure security features as a management service hosted in Azure. You can get the encryption key for your resource in Device properties for any software development kit management operations, but can view the encryption key only if you have the appropriate permissions for the Resource Graph API.

The Azure Stack Edge Pro device is an on-premises device that helps transform your data by processing it locally and then sending it to Azure. Your device:

- needs an activation key to access the Azure Stack Edge service.
- is protected at all times by a device password.
- has secure boot enabled.

- is a locked-down device. The device Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and BIOS are password-protected. The BIOS is protected by limited user-access.
- runs Windows Defender Device Guard. Device Guard lets you run only trusted applications that you define in your code-integrity policies.

Follow the best practices to protect all credentials and secrets used to access Azure Stack Edge. 

- [Password best practices](azure-stack-edge-security.md#protect-the-device-via-password)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: Azure
Stack Edge has a user named 'EdgeUser' that can configure the device. It also
has Azure Resource Manager user 'EdgeArmUser' for the local Azure Resource
Manager features on the device. 

Best practices should be followed to protect
the:

- Credentials used to
access the on-premises device

- SMB share credentials.

- Access to client
systems that have been configured to use NFS shares.

- Local storage account
keys used to access the local storage accounts when using the Blob REST API.

Stack Edge treats all interacted data as sensitive with only authorized users having access to this data. You should follow best practices to protect the credentials used to
access Azure Stack Edge service.

- [Azure Stack Edge Pro security and data protection](azure-stack-edge-security.md#protect-the-device-via-password)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Shared

### DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: Azure
Stack Edge uses secure channels for data in flight. These are:

- Standard TLS 1.2 is used for data that travels between the device and Azure cloud. There is no fallback to TLS 1.1 and earlier. Agent communication will be blocked if TLS 1.2 isn't supported. TLS 1.2 is also required for Azure portal and  software development kit (SDK) management.

- When clients access your device through the local web user interface of a browser, standard TLS 1.2 is used as the default secure protocol

The best practice is to configure your browser to use TLS 1.2. Use SMB 3.0 with encryption to protect data when you copy it from your data servers.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources to build a full view of the activity that occurred while investigating potential incidents. Diverse log types should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  Also ensure insights and learnings are captured for historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Choose the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or a third-party software capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

### GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy 

**Guidance**: Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.

### GS-7: Define logging and threat response strategy

**Guidance**: Establish a logging and threat response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats while meeting compliance requirements. Prioritize providing analysts with high-quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than integration and manual steps. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs

-	Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native Azure capabilities, and other sources 

-	Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest

-	Use of Azure native and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication

-	Processes for handling incidents and post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention
