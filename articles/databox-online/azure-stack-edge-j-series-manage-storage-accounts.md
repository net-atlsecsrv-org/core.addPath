# Use the Azure portal to manage Edge storage accounts on your Azure Stack Edge Pro

<!--[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-all-sku.md)]-->

This article describes how to manage Edge storage accounts on your Azure Stack Edge Pro. You can manage the Azure Stack Edge Pro via the Azure portal or via the local web UI. Use the Azure portal to add or delete Edge storage accounts on your device.

## About Edge storage accounts

You can transfer data from your Azure Stack Edge Pro device via the SMB, NFS, or REST protocols. To transfer data to Blob storage using the REST APIs, you need to create Edge storage accounts on your Azure Stack Edge Pro. 

The Edge storage accounts that you add on the Azure Stack Edge Pro device are mapped to Azure Storage accounts. Any data written to the Edge storage accounts is automatically pushed to the cloud.

A diagram detailing the two types of accounts and how the data flows from each of these accounts to Azure is shown below:

The list of containers is updated to reflect the newly added container.
