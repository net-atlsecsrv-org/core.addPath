The hardware components of your Azure Stack Edge Pro R device adhere to the technical specifications outlined in this article. The technical specifications describe the Power supply units (PSUs), storage capacity, enclosures, and environmental standards.


## Compute, memory specifications

The Azure Stack Edge Pro R device have the following specifications for compute and memory:

| Specification       | Value                  |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| CPU    | 2 X 10 core CPU, Intel Xeon Silver 4114 |
| Memory              | 256 GB RAM (2666 MT/s)     |


## Compute acceleration specifications

| Heat dissipation (maximum)                   | 2891 BTU/hr                |
| Frequency               | 50/60 Hz                   |
| Voltage range selection | Auto ranging: 115-230 V AC |
| Hot pluggable           | Yes                        |

## Network specifications

The Azure Stack Edge Pro R device has four network interfaces, PORT1 - PORT4. 


|Specification  |Description                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
|Network interfaces    |**2 x 1 Gbe RJ45** <br> PORT 1 is used as management interface for initial setup and is static by default. After the initial setup is complete, you can use the interface for data with any IP address. However, on reset, the interface reverts back to static IP. <br>The other interface PORT 2 is user configurable, can be used for data transfer, and is DHCP by default.     |
|Network interfaces    |**2 x 25 Gbe SFP28** <br> These data interfaces PORT 3 and PORT 4 can be configured as DHCP (default) or static.            |

Your Azure Stack Edge Pro R device has the following network hardware:

* **Mellanox dual port 25G ConnectX-4 channel network adapter** - PORT 3 and PORT 4.
