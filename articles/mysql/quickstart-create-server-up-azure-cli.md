# Quickstart: Create an Azure Database for MySQL using a simple Azure CLI command - az mysql up (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [az mysql up](/cli/azure/ext/db-up/mysql#ext-db-up-az-mysql-up) Azure CLI command is in preview.

Azure Database for MySQL is a managed service that enables you to run, manage, and scale highly available MySQL databases in the cloud. The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command-line or in scripts. This quickstart shows you how to use the [az mysql up](/cli/azure/ext/db-up/mysql#ext-db-up-az-mysql-up) command to create an Azure Database for MySQL server using the Azure CLI. In addition to creating the server, the `az mysql up` command creates a sample database, a root user in the database, opens the firewall for Azure services, and creates default firewall rules for the client computer. This helps to expedite the development process.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.

This article requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later locally. To see the version installed, run the `az --version` command. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

You'll need to login to your account using the [az login](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) command. Note the **id** property from the command output for the corresponding subscription name.

```azurecli
az login
```

If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the appropriate subscription in which the resource should be billed. Select the specific subscription ID under your account using [az account set](/cli/azure/account) command. Substitute the **subscription ID** property from the **az login** output for your subscription into the subscription ID placeholder.

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <subscription id>
```

## Create an Azure Database for MySQL server

To use the commands, install the [db-up](/cli/azure/ext/db-up) extension. If an error is returned, ensure you have installed the latest version of the Azure CLI. See [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

```azurecli
az extension add --name db-up
```

Create an Azure Database for MySQL server using the following command:

```azurecli
az mysql up
```

The server is created with the following default values (unless you manually override them):

**Setting** | **Default value** | **Description**
---|---|---
server-name | System generated | A unique name that identifies your Azure Database for MySQL server.
resource-group | System generated | A new Azure resource group.
sku-name | GP_Gen5_2 | The name of the sku. Follows the convention {pricing tier}\_{compute generation}\_{vCores} in shorthand. The default is a General Purpose Gen5 server with 2 vCores. See our [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/) for more information about the tiers.
backup-retention | 7 | How long a backup should be retained. Unit is days.
geo-redundant-backup | Disabled | Whether geo-redundant backups should be enabled for this server or not.
location | westus2 | The Azure location for the server.
ssl-enforcement | Enabled | Whether SSL should be enabled or not for this server.
storage-size | 5120 | The storage capacity of the server (unit is megabytes).
version | 5.7 | The MySQL major version.
admin-user | System generated | The username for the administrator login.
admin-password | System generated | The password of the administrator user.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the `az mysql up` command and its additional parameters, see the [Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure/ext/db-up/mysql#ext-db-up-az-mysql-up).

Once your server is created, it comes with the following settings:

- A firewall rule called "devbox" is created. The Azure CLI attempts to detect the IP address of the machine the `az mysql up` command is run from and allows that IP address.
- "Allow access to Azure services" is set to ON. This setting configures the server's firewall to accept connections from all Azure resources, including resources not in your subscription.
- The `wait_timeout` parameter is set to 8 hours
- An empty database named "sampledb" is created
- A new user named "root" with privileges to "sampledb" is created

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Database for MySQL communicates over port 3306. When connecting from within a corporate network, outbound traffic over port 3306 may not be allowed by your network's firewall. Have your IT department open port 3306 to connect to your server.

## Get the connection information

After the `az mysql up` command is completed, a list of connection strings for popular programming languages is returned to you. These connection strings are pre-configured with the specific attributes of your newly created Azure Database for MySQL server.

You can use the [az mysql show-connection-string](/cli/azure/ext/db-up/mysql#ext-db-up-az-mysql-show-connection-string) command to list these connection strings again.

## Clean up resources

Clean up all resources you created in the quickstart using the following command. This command deletes the Azure Database for MySQL server and the resource group.

```azurecli
az mysql down --delete-group
```

If you would just like to delete the newly created server, you can run [az mysql down](/cli/azure/ext/db-up/mysql#ext-db-up-az-mysql-down) command.

```azurecli
az mysql down
```
