# Monitor and scale an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script scales compute and storage for a single Azure Database for MySQL server after querying the metrics. Compute can scale up or down. Storage can only scale up.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Sample script
Update the script with your subscription ID.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/scale-mysql-server/scale-mysql-server.sh "Create and scale Azure Database for MySQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it after the script has been run. 
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/scale-mysql-server/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the commands outlined in the following table:

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az mysql server create](/cli/azure/mysql/server#az-mysql-server-create) | Creates a MySQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az mysql server update](/cli/azure/mysql/server#az-mysql-server-update) | Updates properties of the MySQL server. |
| [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list) | List the metric value for the resources. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
