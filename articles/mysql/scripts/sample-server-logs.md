# Enable and download server slow query logs of an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script enables and downloads the slow query logs of a single Azure Database for MySQL server.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Sample script
In this sample script, edit the highlighted lines to update the admin username and password to your own. Replace the &lt;log_file_name&gt; in the `az monitor` commands with your own server log file name.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/server-logs/server-logs.sh?highlight=15-16 "Manipulate with server logs.")]

## Clean up deployment
Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it after the script has been run. 
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/server-logs/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the commands outlined in the following table:

| **Command** | **Notes** |

| [az mysql server create](/cli/azure/mysql/server#az-mysql-server-create) | Creates a MySQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az mysql server configuration list](/cli/azure/mysql/server/configuration#az-mysql-server-configuration-list) | List the configuration values for a server. |
| [az mysql server configuration set](/cli/azure/mysql/server/configuration#az-mysql-server-configuration-set) | Update the configuration of a server. |
| [az mysql server-logs list](/cli/azure/mysql/server-logs#az-mysql-server-logs-list) | List log files for a server. |
| [az mysql server-logs download](/cli/azure/mysql/server-logs#az-mysql-server-logs-download) | Download log files. |
