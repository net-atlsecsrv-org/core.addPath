# Restore an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script restores a single Azure Database for MySQL server to a previous point in time.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this sample requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script
In this sample script, change the highlighted lines to customize the admin username and password. Replace the subscription ID used in the az monitor commands with your own subscription ID.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/backup-restore-pitr/backup-restore.sh?highlight=15-16 "Restore Azure Database for MySQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/backup-restore-pitr/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az mysql server create](/cli/azure/mysql/server) | Creates a MySQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az mysql server restore](/cli/azure/mysql/server) | Restore a server from backup. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
