# List and update configurations of an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script lists all available configuration parameters as well as their allowable values for Azure Database for MySQL server, and sets the *innodb_lock_wait_timeout* to a value that is other than the default one.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Sample script
In this sample script, edit the highlighted lines to update the admin username and password to your own.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/change-server-configurations/change-server-configurations.sh?highlight=15-16 "List and update configurations of Azure Database for MySQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it after the script has been run. 
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/change-server-configurations/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]
