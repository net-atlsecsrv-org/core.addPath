# Azure Database for MySQL management stored procedures

Stored procedures are available on Azure Database for MySQL servers to help manage your MySQL server. This includes managing your server's connections, queries, and setting up Data-in Replication.  

## Data-in Replication stored procedures

Data-in Replication allows you to synchronize data from a MySQL server running on-premises, in virtual machines, or database services hosted by other cloud providers into the Azure Database for MySQL service.

The following stored procedures are used to set up or remove Data-in Replication between a master and replica.

|**Stored Procedure Name**|**Input Parameters**|**Output Parameters**|**Usage Note**|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|*mysql.az_replication_change_master*|master_host<br/>master_user<br/>master_password<br/>master_port<br/>master_log_file<br/>master_log_pos<br/>master_ssl_ca|N/A|To transfer data with SSL mode, pass in the CA certificateâ€™s context into the master_ssl_ca parameter. </br><br>To transfer data without SSL, pass in an empty string into the master_ssl_ca parameter.|
|*mysql.az_replication _start*|N/A|N/A|Starts replication.|
|*mysql.az_replication _stop*|N/A|N/A|Stops replication.|
|*mysql.az_replication _remove_master*|N/A|N/A|Removes the replication relationship between the master and replica.|
|*mysql.az_replication_skip_counter*|N/A|N/A|Skips one replication error.|

To set up Data-in Replication between a master and a replica in Azure Database for MySQL, refer to [how to configure Data-in Replication](howto-data-in-replication.md).

## Other stored procedures

The following stored procedures are available in Azure Database for MySQL to manage your server.

|**Stored Procedure Name**|**Input Parameters**|**Output Parameters**|**Usage Note**|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|*mysql.az_kill*|processlist_id|N/A|Equivalent to [`KILL CONNECTION`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/kill.html) command. Will terminate the connection associated with the provided processlist_id after terminating any statement the connection is executing.|
|*mysql.az_kill_query*|processlist_id|N/A|Equivalent to [`KILL QUERY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/kill.html) command. Will terminate the statement the connection is currently executing. Leaves the connection itself alive.|
|*mysql.az_load_timezone*|N/A|N/A|Loads time zone tables to allow the `time_zone` parameter to be set to named values (ex. "US/Pacific").|
