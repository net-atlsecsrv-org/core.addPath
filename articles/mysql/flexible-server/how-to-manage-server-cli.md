# Manage an Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server (Preview) using the Azure CLI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is currently in public preview.

This article shows you how to manage your Flexible Server (Preview) deployed in Azure. Management tasks include compute and storage scaling, admin password reset, and viewing server details.

## Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin. This article requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later locally. To see the version installed, run the `az --version` command. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

You'll need to log in to your account using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. Note the **id** property, which refers to **Subscription ID** for your Azure account.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

Select the specific subscription under your account using [az account set](/cli/azure/account) command. Make a note of the **id** value from the **az login** output to use as the value for **subscription** argument in the command. If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the appropriate subscription in which the resource should be billed. To get all your subscription, use [az account list](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list).

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <subscription id>
```

> [!Important]
> If you have not already created a flexible server yet, please create one to get started with this how to guide.

## Scale compute and storage

You can scale up your compute tier, vCores, and storage easily using the following command. You can see all the server operation you can perform [az mysql flexible-server update](/cli/azure/mysql/flexible-server#az_mysql_flexible_server_update)

```azurecli-interactive
az mysql flexible-server update --resource-group myresourcegroup --name mydemoserver --sku-name Standard_D4ds_v4 --storage-size 6144
```

Here are the details for arguments above :

**Setting** | **Sample value** | **Description**
---|---|---
name | mydemoserver | Enter a unique name for your Azure Database for MySQL server. The server name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must contain from 3 to 63 characters.
resource-group | myresourcegroup | Provide the name of the Azure resource group.
sku-name|Standard_D4ds_v4|Enter the name of the compute tier and size. Follows the convention Standard_{VM size} in shorthand. See the [pricing tiers](../concepts-pricing-tiers.md) for more information.
storage-size | 6144 | The storage capacity of the server (unit is megabytes). Minimum 5120 and increases in 1024 increments.

> [!Important]
> - Storage can be scaled up (however, you cannot scale storage down)

You can use any of these commands to create, delete , list and view database properties of a database on your server

|[az mysql flexible-server db delete](/cli/azure/mysql/flexible-server/db#az_mysql_flexible_server_db_delete)|```az mysql flexible-server db delete -g myresourcegroup -s mydemoserver -n mydatabasename```|Delete your database from your server. This command does not delete your server. |
|[az mysql flexible-server db list](/cli/azure/mysql/flexible-server/db#az_mysql_flexible_server_db_list)|```az mysql flexible-server db list -g myresourcegroup -s mydemoserver```|lists all the databases on the server|
|[az mysql flexible-server db show](/cli/azure/mysql/flexible-server/db#az_mysql_flexible_server_db_show)|```az mysql flexible-server db show -g myresourcegroup -s mydemoserver -n mydatabasename```|Shows more details of the database|

## Update admin password
You can change the administrator role's password with this command
```azurecli-interactive
az mysql flexible-server update --resource-group myresourcegroup --name mydemoserver --admin-password <new-password>
```

> [!Important]
