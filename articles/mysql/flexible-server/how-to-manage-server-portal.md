> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is currently in public preview.

This article shows you how to manage your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible servers (Preview). Management tasks include compute and storage scaling, rest server administrator password and delete your server.

## Sign in
Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Go to your flexible server resource in the Azure portal.

## Scale compute and storage

After server creation you can scale between the various [pricing tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/) as your needs change. You can also scale up or down your compute and memory by increasing or decreasing vCores.

1. Select your server in the Azure portal. Select **Compute + Storage**, located in the **Settings** section.

2. You can change the **Compute Tier**, **vCore**, **Storage** to scale up the server using higher compute tier or scale up within the same tier by increasing storage or vCores to a value you want.
