# Backup and restore in Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is currently in public preview.

Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, automatically creates server backups and securely stores them in local redundant storage within the region. Backups can be used to restore your server to a point-in-time. Backup and restore are an essential part of any business continuity strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion.

## Backup overview

Flexible Server takes snapshot backups of the data files and stores them in a local redundant storage. The server also performs transaction logs backup and also stores them in local redundant storage. These backups allow you to restore a server to any point-in-time within your configured backup retention period. The default backup retention period is seven days. You can optionally configure the database backup from 1 to 35 days. All backups are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption for the data stored at rest.

These backup files cannot be exported. The backups can only be used for restore operations in Flexible server. You can also use [mysqldump](../concepts-migrate-dump-restore.md#dump-and-restore-using-mysqldump-utility) from a MySQL client to copy a database.

## Backup frequency

Backups on flexible servers are snapshot-based. The first full snapshot backup is scheduled immediately after a server is created. That first full snapshot backup is retained as the server's base backup. Subsequent snapshot backups are differential backups only.

Differential snapshot backups occur at least once a day. Differential snapshot backups do not occur on a fixed schedule. Differential snapshot backups occur every 24 hours unless the binary logs in MySQL exceeds 50-GB since the last differential backup. In a day, a maximum of six differential snapshots are allowed. Transaction log backups occur every five minutes.

## Backup retention

Database backups are stored in a local redundant storage (LRS)-- which is stored in three copies within a region. Backups are retained based on the backup retention period setting on the server. You can select a retention period of 1 to 35 days with a default retention period is seven days. You can set the retention period during server creation or later by updating the backup configuration using Azure portal.

The backup retention period governs how far back in time can a point-in-time restore operation be performed, since it's based on backups available. The backup retention period can also be treated as a recovery window from a restore perspective. All backups required to perform a point-in-time restore within the backup retention period are retained in backup storage. For example - if the backup retention period is set to seven days, the recovery window is considered last seven days. In this scenario, all the backups required to restore the server in last seven days are retained. With a backup retention window of seven days, database snapshots and transaction log backups are stored for the last eight days (1 day prior to the window).

## Backup storage cost

Flexible server provides up to 100% of your provisioned server storage as backup storage at no additional cost. Any additional backup storage used is charged in GB per month. For example, if you have provisioned a server with 250 GB of storage, you have 250 GB of storage available for server backups at no additional charge. If the daily backup usage is 25GB, then you can have up to 10 days of free backup storage. Storage consumed for backups more than 250 GB is charged as per the [pricing model](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/).

You can use the [Backup Storage used](../concepts-monitoring.md) metric in Azure Monitor available in the Azure portal to monitor the backup storage consumed by a server. The **Backup Storage** used metric represents the sum of storage consumed by all the database backups and log backups retained based on the backup retention period set for the server. Heavy transactional activity on the server can cause backup storage usage to increase irrespective of the total database size.

The primary means of controlling the backup storage cost is by setting the appropriate backup retention period. You can select a retention period between 1 to 35 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Backups from a database server configured in a zone redundant high availability configuration happens from the primary database server as the overhead is minimal with snapshot backups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Geo-redundant backups are currently not supported with flexible server.

## Point-in-time restore

In Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, performing a point-in-time restore creates a new server from the flexible server's backups in the same region as your source server. It is created with the original server's configuration for the compute tier, number of vCores, storage size, backup retention period, and backup redundancy option. Also, tags and settings such as virtual network and firewall are inherited from the source server. The restored server's compute and storage tier, configuration and security settings can be changed after the restore is completed.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two server parameters which are reset to default values (and are not copied over from the primary server) after the restore operation
> *   time_zone - This value to set to DEFAULT value SYSTEM
> *   event_scheduler - The event_scheduler is set to OFF on the restored server

Point-in-time restore is useful in multiple scenarios. Some of the use cases that are common include -
-   When a user accidentally deletes data in the database
-   User drops an important table or database
-   User application accidentally overwrites good data with bad data due to an application defect.

You can choose between a latest restore point and a custom restore point via [Azure portal](how-to-restore-server-portal.md).

-   **Latest restore point**: The latest restore point helps you to restore the server to the last backup performed on the source server. The timestamp for restore will also displayed on the portal. This option is useful to quickly restore the server to the most updated state.
-   **Custom restore point**: This will allow you to choose any point-in-time within the retention period defined for this flexible server. This option is useful to restore the server at the precise point in time to recover from a user error.

The estimated time of recovery depends on several factors including the database sizes, the transaction log backup size, the compute size of the SKU, and the time of the restore as well. The transaction log recovery is the most time consuming part of the restore process. If the restore time is chosen closer to the full or differential snapshot backup schedule, the restores are faster since transaction log application is minimal. To estimate the accurate recovery time for your server, we highly recommend to test it in your environment as it has too many environment specific variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are restoring a flexible server configured with zone redundant high availability, the restored server will be configured in the same region and zone as your primary server, and deployed as a single flexible server in a non-HA mode. Refer to [zone redundant high availability](concepts-high-availability.md) for flexible server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleted servers **cannot** be restored. If you delete the server, all databases that belong to the server are also deleted and cannot be recovered. To protect server resources, post deployment, from accidental deletion or unexpected changes, administrators can leverage [management locks](../../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md).

## Perform post-restore tasks

After a restore from either **latest restore point** or **custom restore point** recovery mechanism, you should perform the following tasks to get your users and applications back up and running:

-   If the new server is meant to replace the original server, redirect clients and client applications to the new server.
-   Ensure appropriate server-level firewall and virtual network rules are in place for users to connect.
-   Ensure appropriate logins and database level permissions are in place.
-   Configure alerts, as appropriate.
