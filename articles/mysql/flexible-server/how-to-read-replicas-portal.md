# How to create and manage read replicas in Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server using the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read replicas in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is in preview.

In this article, you will learn how to create and manage read replicas in the Azure Database for MySQL flexible server using the Azure portal.

> [!Note]
> Replica is not supported on high availability enabled server. 

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure Database for MySQL server Flexible Server](quickstart-create-server-portal.md) that will be used as the source server.

## Create a read replica

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you create a replica for a source that has no existing replicas, the source will first restart to prepare itself for replication. Take this into consideration and perform these operations during an off-peak period.

A read replica server can be created using the following steps:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select the existing Azure Database for MySQL flexible server that you want to use as a source. This action opens the **Overview** page.

3. Select **Replication** from the menu, under **SETTINGS**.

4. Select **Add Replica**.

5. Enter a name for the replica server.

6. Select **OK** to confirm creation of the replica.

> [!NOTE]
> Read replicas are created with the same server configuration as the source. The replica server configuration can be changed after it has been created. The replica server is always created in the same resource group, same location and same subscription as the source server. If you want to create a replica server to a different resource group or different subscription, you can [move the replica server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) after creation. It is recommended that the replica server's configuration should be kept at equal or greater values than the source to ensure the replica is able to keep up with the source.

Once the replica server has been created, it can be viewed from the **Replication** blade.

## Stop replication to a replica server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Stopping replication to a server is irreversible. Once replication has stopped between a source and replica, it cannot be undone. The replica server then becomes a standalone server and now supports both read and writes. This server cannot be made into a replica again.

To stop replication between a source and a replica server from the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your source Azure Database for MySQL flexible server. 

2. Select **Replication** from the menu, under **SETTINGS**.

3. Select the replica server you wish to stop replication for.

4. Select **Stop replication**.

5. Confirm you want to stop replication by clicking **OK**.

## Delete a replica server

To delete a read replica server from the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your source Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.

2. Select **Replication** from the menu, under **SETTINGS**.

3. Select the replica server you wish to delete.

4. Select **Delete replica**

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replica-portal/delete-replica.png" alt-text="Azure Database for MySQL - Delete replica":::

5. Type the name of the replica and click **Delete** to confirm deletion of the replica.

## Delete a source server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a source server stops replication to all replica servers and deletes the source server itself. Replica servers become standalone servers that now support both read and writes.

To delete a source server from the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your source Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.

2. From the **Overview**, select **Delete**.

   [:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replica-portal/delete-master-overview.png" alt-text="Azure Database for MySQL - Delete source":::](./media/how-to-read-replica-portal/delete-master-overview.png#lightbox)

3. Type the name of the source server and click **Delete** to confirm deletion of the source server.

## Monitor replication

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the replica Azure Database for MySQL flexible server you want to monitor.

2. Under the **Monitoring** section of the sidebar, select **Metrics**:

3. Select **Replication lag in seconds** from the dropdown list of available metrics.

4. Select the time range you wish to view. The image below selects a 30 minute time range.

5. View the replication lag for the selected time range. The image below displays the last 30 minutes.
