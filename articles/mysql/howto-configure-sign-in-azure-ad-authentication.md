# Use Azure Active Directory for authenticating with MySQL

This article will walk you through the steps how to configure Azure Active Directory access with Azure Database for MySQL, and how to connect using an Azure AD token.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD authentication for Azure Database for MySQL is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Setting the Azure AD Admin user

Only an Azure AD Admin user can create/enable users for Azure AD-based authentication. To create and Azure AD Admin user, please follow the following steps

1. In the Azure portal, select the instance of Azure Database for MySQL that you want to enable for Azure AD.
2. Under Settings, select Active Directory Admin:

![set azure ad administrator][2]

3. Select a valid Azure AD user in the customer tenant to be Azure AD administrator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When setting the administrator, a new user is added to the Azure Database for MySQL server with full administrator permissions.

Only one Azure AD admin can be created per MySQL server and selection of another one will overwrite the existing Azure AD admin configured for the server.

In a future release we will support specifying an Azure AD group instead of an individual user to have multiple administrators, however this is currently not supported yet.

After configuring the administrator, you can now sign in:

## Connecting to Azure Database for MySQL using Azure AD

The following high-level diagram summarizes the workflow of using Azure AD authentication with Azure Database for MySQL:

![authentication flow][1]

We’ve designed the Azure AD integration to work with common MySQL tools like the mysql CLI, which are not Azure AD aware and only support specifying username and password when connecting to MySQL. We pass the Azure AD token as the password as shown in the picture above.

We currently have tested the following clients:

- MySQLWorkbench 
- Mysql CLI

We have also tested most common application drivers, you can see details at the end of this page.

These are the steps that a user/application will need to do authenticate with Azure AD described below:

### Step 1: Authenticate with Azure AD

Make sure you have the [Azure CLI installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Invoke the Azure CLI tool to authenticate with Azure AD. It requires you to give your Azure AD user ID and the password.

```
az login
```

This command will launch a browser window to the Azure AD authentication page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use Azure Cloud Shell to perform these steps.
> Please be aware that when retrieving Azure AD access token in the Azure Cloud Shell you will need to explicitly call `az login` and sign in again (in the separate window with a code). After that sign in the `get-access-token` command will work as expected.

### Step 2: Retrieve Azure AD access token

Invoke the Azure CLI tool to acquire an access token for the Azure AD authenticated user from step 1 to access Azure Database for MySQL.

Example (for Public Cloud):

```shell
az account get-access-token --resource https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net
```

The above resource value must be specified exactly as shown. For other clouds, the resource value can be looked up using:

```shell
az cloud show
```

For Azure CLI version 2.0.71 and later, the command can be specified in the following more convenient version for all clouds:

```shell
az account get-access-token --resource-type oss-rdbms
```

After authentication is successful, Azure AD will return an access token:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "TOKEN",
  "expiresOn": "...",
  "subscription": "...",
  "tenant": "...",
  "tokenType": "Bearer"
}
```

The token is a Base 64 string that encodes all the information about the authenticated user, and which is targeted to the Azure Database for MySQL service.

> [!NOTE]
> The access token validity is anywhere between 5 minutes to 60 minutes. We recommend you get the access token just before initiating the login to Azure Database for MySQL.

### Step 3: Use token as password for logging in with MySQL

When connecting you need to use the access token as the MySQL user password. When using GUI clients such as MySQLWorkbench, you can use the method above to retrieve the token. 

When using the CLI, you can use this short-hand to connect: 

**Example (Linux/macOS):**
```
mysql -h mydb.mysql.database.azure.com \ 
  --user user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com@mydb \ 
  --enable-cleartext-plugin \ 
  --password=`az account get-access-token --resource-type oss-rdbms --output tsv --query accessToken`
```

Note the “enable-cleartext-plugin” setting – you need to use a similar configuration with other clients to make sure the token gets sent to the server without being hashed.

You are now authenticated to your MySQL server using Azure AD authentication.

## Creating Azure AD users in Azure Database for MySQL

To add an Azure AD user to your Azure Database for MySQL database, perform the following steps after connecting (see later section on how to connect):

1. First ensure that the Azure AD user `<user>@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` is a valid user in Azure AD tenant.
2. Sign in to your Azure Database for MySQL instance as the Azure AD Admin user.
3. Create user `<user>@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` in Azure Database for MySQL.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE AADUSER 'user1@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com';
```

For user names that exceed 32 characters, it is recommended you use an alias instead, to be used when connecting: 

Example:

```sql
CREATE AADUSER 'userWithLongName@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com' as 'userDefinedShortName'; 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Authenticating a user through Azure AD does not give the user any permissions to access objects within the Azure Database for MySQL database. You must grant the user the required permissions manually.

## Creating Azure AD groups in Azure Database for MySQL

To enable an Azure AD group for access to your database, use the same mechanism as for users, but instead specify the group name:

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE AADUSER 'Prod_DB_Readonly';
```

When logging in, members of the group will use their personal access tokens, but sign with the group name specified as the username.

## Token Validation

Azure AD authentication in Azure Database for MySQL ensures that the user exists in the MySQL server, and it checks the validity of the token by validating the contents of the token. The following token validation steps are performed:

-	Token is signed by Azure AD and has not been tampered with
-	Token was issued by Azure AD for the tenant associated with the server
-	Token has not expired
-	Token is for the Azure Database for MySQL resource (and not another Azure resource)

## Compatibility with application drivers

Most drivers are supported, however make sure to use the settings for sending the password in clear-text, so the token gets sent without modification.

* C/C++
  * libmysqlclient: Supported
  * mysql-connector-c++: Supported
* Java
  * Connector/J (mysql-connector-java): Supported, must utilize `useSSL` setting
* Python
  * Connector/Python: Supported
* Ruby
  * mysql2: Supported
* .NET
  * mysql-connector-net: Supported, need to add plugin for mysql_clear_password
  * mysql-net/MySqlConnector: Supported
