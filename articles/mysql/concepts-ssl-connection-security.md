# SSL connectivity in Azure Database for MySQL

Azure Database for MySQL supports connecting your database server to client applications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Enforcing SSL connections between your database server and your client applications helps protect against "man in the middle" attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and your application.

## SSL Default settings

By default, the database service should be configured to require SSL connections when connecting to MySQL.  We recommend to avoid disabling the SSL option whenever possible.

When provisioning a new Azure Database for MySQL server through the Azure portal and CLI, enforcement of SSL connections is enabled by default. 

Connection strings for various programming languages are shown in the Azure portal. Those connection strings include the required SSL parameters to connect to your database. In the Azure portal, select your server. Under the **Settings** heading, select the **Connection strings**. The SSL parameter varies based on the connector, for example "ssl=true" or "sslmode=require" or "sslmode=required" and other variations.

To learn how to enable or disable SSL connection when developing application, refer to [How to configure SSL](howto-configure-ssl.md).

## TLS connectivity in Azure Database for MySQL

Azure Database for MySQL supports encryption for clients connecting to your database server using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is an industry standard protocol that ensures secure network connections between your database server and client applications, allowing you to adhere to compliance requirements.

### TLS settings

Customers now have the ability to enforce the TLS version for the client connecting to their Azure Database for MySQL. To use the TLS option, use the **Minimum TLS Version** option setting. The following values are allowed for this option setting:

|  Minimum TLS Setting             | TLS Version supported                |
|:---------------------------------|-------------------------------------:|
| TLSEnforcementDisabled (default) | No TLS required                      |
| TLS1_0                           | TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2 and higher |
| TLS1_1                           | TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2 and higher          |
| TLS1_2                           | TLS version 1.2 and higher           |


For example, setting this minimum TLS setting version to TLS 1.0 means your server will allow connections from clients using TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2+. Alternatively, setting this to 1.2 means that you only allow connections from clients using TLS 1.2 and all connections with TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will be rejected.

> [!Note] 
> Azure Database for MySQL defaults to TLS being disabled for all new servers.
>
> Currently the TLS versions supported by Azure Database for MySQL are TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.

To learn how to set the TLS setting for your Azure Database for MySQL, refer to [How to configure TLS setting](howto-tls-configurations.md).
