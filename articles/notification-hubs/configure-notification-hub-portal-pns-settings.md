# Set up push notifications in a notification hub in the Azure portal

Azure Notification Hubs provides a push engine that's easy to use and that scales out. Use Notification Hubs to send notifications to any platform (iOS, Android, Windows, Kindle, Baidu) and from any back end (cloud or on-premises). For more information, see [What is Azure Notification Hubs?](notification-hubs-push-notification-overview.md).

In this quickstart, you'll use the platform notification system (PNS) settings in Notification Hubs to set up push notifications on multiple platforms. The quickstart shows you the steps to take in the Azure portal.

If you haven't already created a notification hub, create one now. For more information, see [Create an Azure notification hub in the Azure portal](create-notification-hub-portal.md).
