# Localization string IDs

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning.md)]

The **Localization** element enables you to support multiple locales or languages in the policy for the user journeys. This article provides the list of localization IDs that you can use in your policy. To get familiar with UI localization, see [Localization](localization.md).

| **logonIdentifier_email** | Email Address |
| **requiredField_email** | Please enter your email |
| **invalid_email** | Please enter a valid email address |
| **email_pattern** | ^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&''*+/=?^_\`{\|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$ |

The ID of the identity providers is configured in the user journey  **ClaimsExchange** element. To localize the title of the identity provider, the **ElementType** is set to `ClaimsProvider`, while the **StringId** is set to the ID of the `ClaimsExchange`.

```xml
<OrchestrationStep Order="2" Type="ClaimsExchange">
  <Preconditions>
    <Precondition Type="ClaimsExist" ExecuteActionsIf="true">
      <Value>objectId</Value>
      <Action>SkipThisOrchestrationStep</Action>
    </Precondition>
  </Preconditions>
  <ClaimsExchanges>
    <ClaimsExchange Id="FacebookExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="Facebook-OAUTH" />
    <ClaimsExchange Id="MicrosoftExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="MSA-OIDC" />
    <ClaimsExchange Id="GoogleExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="Google-OAUTH" />
    <ClaimsExchange Id="SignUpWithLogonEmailExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="LocalAccount" />
  </ClaimsExchanges>

```
