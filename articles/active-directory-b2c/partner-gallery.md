# Azure Active Directory B2C ISV partners

Our ISV partner network extends our solution capabilities to help you build seamless end-user experiences. With Azure AD B2C, you can integrate with ISV partners to enable Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) methods, do role-based access control, enable identity verification and proofing, improve security with bot detection and fraud protection, and meet Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) Secure Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements. Use our detailed sample walkthroughs to learn how to integrate apps with the ISV partners.
