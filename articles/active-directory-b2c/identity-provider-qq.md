## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-customization-prerequisites](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-customization-prerequisites.md)]

## Create a QQ application

To use a QQ account as an identity provider in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), you need to create an application in your tenant that represents it. If you don't already have a QQ account, you can sign up at [https://ssl.zc.qq.com/en/index.html?type=1&ptlang=1033](https://ssl.zc.qq.com/en/index.html?type=1&ptlang=1033).

### Register for the QQ developer program

1. Sign in to the [QQ developer portal](http://open.qq.com) with your QQ account credentials.
1. After signing in, go to [https://open.qq.com/reg](https://open.qq.com/reg) to register yourself as a developer.
1. Select **个人** (individual developer).
1. Enter the required information and select **下一步** (next step).
1. Complete the email verification process. You will need to wait a few days to be approved after registering as a developer.

### Register a QQ application

1. Go to [https://connect.qq.com/index.html](https://connect.qq.com/index.html).
1. Select **应用管理** (app management).
1. Select **创建应用** (create app) and enter the required information.
1. Enter `https://your-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-tenant-name}.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp` in **授权回调域** (callback URL). For example, if your `tenant_name` is contoso, set the URL to be `https://contoso.b2clogin.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`.
1. Select **创建应用** (create app).
1. On the confirmation page, select **应用管理** (app management) to return to the app management page.
1. Select **查看** (view) next to the app you created.
1. Select **修改** (edit).
1. Copy the **APP ID** and **APP KEY**. You need both of these values to add the identity provider to your tenant.

5. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
6. For **Options**, choose `Manual`.
7. Enter a **Name** for the policy key. For example, `QQSecret`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
8. In **Secret**, enter your client secret that you previously recorded.
9. For **Key usage**, select `Signature`.
10. Click **Create**.

## Add a claims provider

If you want users to sign in by using a QQ account, you need to define the account as a claims provider that Azure AD B2C can communicate with through an endpoint. The endpoint provides a set of claims that are used by Azure AD B2C to verify that a specific user has authenticated.

You can define a QQ account as a claims provider by adding it to the **ClaimsProviders** element in the extension file of your policy.

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml*.
2. Find the **ClaimsProviders** element. If it does not exist, add it under the root element.
3. Add a new **ClaimsProvider** as follows:

    ```xml
    <ClaimsProvider>
      <Domain>qq.com</Domain>
      <DisplayName>QQ (Preview)</DisplayName>
      <TechnicalProfiles>
        <TechnicalProfile Id="QQ-OAUTH">
          <DisplayName>QQ</DisplayName>
          <Protocol Name="OAuth2" />
          <Metadata>
            <Item Key="ProviderName">qq</Item>
            <Item Key="authorization_endpoint">https://graph.qq.com/oauth2.0/authorize</Item>
            <Item Key="AccessTokenEndpoint">https://graph.qq.com/oauth2.0/token</Item>
            <Item Key="ClaimsEndpoint">https://graph.qq.com/oauth2.0/me</Item>
            <Item Key="scope">get_user_info</Item>
            <Item Key="HttpBinding">GET</Item>
            <Item Key="ClaimsResponseFormat">JsonP</Item>
            <Item Key="ResponseErrorCodeParamName">error</Item>
            <Item Key="external_user_identity_claim_id">openid</Item>
            <Item Key="client_id">Your QQ application ID</Item>
          </Metadata>
          <CryptographicKeys>
            <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_QQSecret" />
          </CryptographicKeys>
          <OutputClaims>
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="UserId" PartnerClaimType="openid" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" DefaultValue="qq.com" AlwaysUseDefaultValue="true" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="socialIdpAuthentication" AlwaysUseDefaultValue="true" />
          </OutputClaims>
          <OutputClaimsTransformations>
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateSubjectClaimFromAlternativeSecurityId" />
          </OutputClaimsTransformations>
          <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-SocialLogin" />
        </TechnicalProfile>
      </TechnicalProfiles>
    </ClaimsProvider>
    ```

4. Set **client_id** to the application ID from the application registration.
5. Save the file.

### Upload the extension file for verification

By now, you have configured your policy so that Azure AD B2C knows how to communicate with your QQ account. Try uploading the extension file of your policy just to confirm that it doesn't have any issues so far.

1. On the **Custom Policies** page in your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **Upload Policy**.
2. Enable **Overwrite the policy if it exists**, and then browse to and select the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* file.
3. Click **Upload**.

## Register the claims provider

At this point, the identity provider has been set up, but it’s not available in any of the sign-up/sign-in screens. To make it available, you create a duplicate of an existing template user journey, and then modify it so that it also has the QQ identity provider.

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkBase.xml* file from the starter pack.
2. Find and copy the entire contents of the **UserJourney** element that includes `Id="SignUpOrSignIn"`.
3. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* and find the **UserJourneys** element. If the element doesn't exist, add one.
4. Paste the entire content of the **UserJourney** element that you copied as a child of the **UserJourneys** element.
5. Rename the ID of the user journey. For example, `SignUpSignInQQ`.

### Display the button

The **ClaimsProviderSelection** element is analogous to an identity provider button on a sign-up/sign-in screen. If you add a **ClaimsProviderSelection** element for a QQ account, a new button shows up when a user lands on the page.

1. Find the **OrchestrationStep** element that includes `Order="1"` in the user journey that you created.
2. Under **ClaimsProviderSelects**, add the following element. Set the value of **TargetClaimsExchangeId** to an appropriate value, for example `QQExchange`:

    ```xml
    <ClaimsProviderSelection TargetClaimsExchangeId="QQExchange" />
    ```

### Link the button to an action

Now that you have a button in place, you need to link it to an action. The action, in this case, is for Azure AD B2C to communicate with a QQ account to receive a token.

1. Find the **OrchestrationStep** that includes `Order="2"` in the user journey.
2. Add the following **ClaimsExchange** element making sure that you use the same value for ID that you used for **TargetClaimsExchangeId**:

    ```xml
    <ClaimsExchange Id="QQExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="QQ-OAuth" />
    ```

    Update the value of **TechnicalProfileReferenceId** to the ID of the technical profile you created earlier. For example, `QQ-OAuth`.

3. Save the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* file and upload it again for verification.

## Add QQ identity provider to a user flow 

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.
1. Click the user flow that you want to the QQ identity provider.
1. Under the **Social identity providers**, select **QQ**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.
1. For **Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Click **Run user flow**

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="b2c-custom-policy"

## Update and test the relying party file

Update the relying party (RP) file that initiates the user journey that you created.

1. Make a copy of *SignUpOrSignIn.xml* in your working directory, and rename it. For example, rename it to *SignUpSignInQQ.xml*.
1. Open the new file and update the value of the **PolicyId** attribute for **TrustFrameworkPolicy** with a unique value. For example, `SignUpSignInQQ`.
1. Update the value of **PublicPolicyUri** with the URI for the policy. For example,`http://contoso.com/B2C_1A_signup_signin_QQ`
1. Update the value of the **ReferenceId** attribute in **DefaultUserJourney** to match the ID of the new user journey that you created (SignUpSignQQ).
1. Save your changes, upload the file.
1. Under **Custom policies**, select **B2C_1A_signup_signin**.
1. For **Select Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select **Run now** and select QQ to sign in with QQ and test the custom policy.
