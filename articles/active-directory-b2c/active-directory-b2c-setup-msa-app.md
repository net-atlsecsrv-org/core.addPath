# Set up sign-up and sign-in with a Microsoft account using Azure Active Directory B2C

## Create a Microsoft account application

To use a Microsoft account as an [identity provider](active-directory-b2c-reference-oidc.md) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you need to create an application in your tenant that represents it. If you donâ€™t already have a Microsoft account, you can get it at [https://www.live.com/](https://www.live.com/).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**
1. Enter a **Name** for your application. For example, *MSAapp1*.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**. This option targets the widest set of Microsoft identities.

   For more information on the different account type selections, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md).
1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web** and enter `https://your-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp` in the text box. Replace `your-tenant-name` with your Azure AD B2C tenant name.
1. Select **Register**
1. Record the **Application (client) ID** shown on the application Overview page. You need this when you configure the identity provider in the next section.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets**
1. Click **New client secret**
1. Enter a **Description** for the secret, for example *Application password 1*, and then click **Add**.
1. Record the application password shown in the **VALUE** column. You need this when you configure the identity provider in the next section.

## Configure a Microsoft account as an identity provider

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the global administrator of your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant by clicking the **Directory and subscription filter** in the top menu and choosing the directory that contains your tenant.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Identity providers**, and then select **Add**.
1. Provide a **Name**. For example, enter *MSA*.
1. Select **Identity provider type**, select **Microsoft Account**, and click **OK**.
1. Select **Set up this identity provider** and enter the Application (client) ID that you recorded earlier in the **Client ID** text box, and enter the client secret that you recorded in the **Client secret** text box.
1. Click **OK** and then click **Create** to save your Microsoft account configuration.
