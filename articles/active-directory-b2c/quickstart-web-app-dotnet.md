# Quickstart: Set up sign in for an ASP.NET application using Azure Active Directory B2C

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) provides cloud identity management to keep your application, business, and customers protected. Azure AD B2C enables your applications to authenticate to social accounts and enterprise accounts using open standard protocols. In this quickstart, you use an ASP.NET application to sign in using a social identity provider and call an Azure AD B2C protected web API.
