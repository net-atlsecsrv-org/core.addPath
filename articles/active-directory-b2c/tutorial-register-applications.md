# Tutorial: Register an application in Azure Active Directory B2C

Before your [applications](active-directory-b2c-apps.md) can interact with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, they must be registered in a tenant that you manage. This tutorial shows you how to register a web application using the Azure portal.

In this article, you learn how to:

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already created your own [Azure AD B2C Tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md), create one now. You can use an existing Azure AD B2C tenant.

## Register a web application

1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant by clicking the **Directory and subscription filter** in the top menu and choosing the directory that contains your tenant.
2. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
3. Select **Applications**, and then select **Add**.
4. Enter a name for the application. For example, *webapp1*.
5. For **Include web app/ web API** and **Allow implicit flow**, select **Yes**.
6. For **Reply URL**, enter an endpoint where Azure AD B2C should return any tokens that your application requests. For example, you can set it to listen locally at `https://localhost:44316` If you don't yet know the port number, you can enter a placeholder value and change it later. For testing purposes you could set it to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of a token for inspection. For this tutorial, set it to `https://jwt.ms`. 

    The reply URL must begin with the scheme `https`, and all reply URL values must share a single DNS domain. For example, if the application has a reply URL of `https://login.contoso.com`, you can add to it like this URL `https://login.contoso.com/new`. Or, you can refer to a DNS subdomain of `login.contoso.com`, such as `https://new.login.contoso.com`. If you want to have an application with `login-east.contoso.com` and `login-west.contoso.com` as reply URLs, you must add those reply URLs in this order: `https://contoso.com`, `https://login-east.contoso.com`, `https://login-west.contoso.com`. You can add the latter two because they're subdomains of the first reply URL, `contoso.com`.

7. Click **Create**.

## Create a client secret

If your application exchanges a code for a token, you need to create an application secret.

1. Select **Keys** and then click **Generate key**.
2. Select **Save** to view the key. Make note of the **App key** value. You use the value as the application secret in your application's code.
