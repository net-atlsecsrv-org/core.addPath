# Tutorial to configure Nevis with Azure Active Directory B2C for passwordless authentication

In this sample tutorial, learn how to extend Azure AD B2C with  [Nevis](https://www.nevis.net/solution/authentication-cloud) to enable passwordless authentication. Nevis provides a mobile-first, fully branded end-user experience with Nevis Access app to provide strong customer authentication and comply with Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) transaction requirements.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

- A Nevis [trial account](https://www.nevis-security.com/aadb2c/)

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have one, get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- An [Azure AD B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant) that is linked to your Azure subscription.

- Configured Azure AD B2C environment for using [custom policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-get-started), if you wish to integrate Nevis into your sign-up policy flow.

## Scenario description

In this scenario, add fully branded access app to your back-end application for passwordless authentication. The following components make up the solution:

- An Azure AD B2C tenant, with a combined sign-in and sign-up policy to your back-end
- Nevis instance and its REST API to enhance Azure AD B2C
- Your own branded access app

The diagram shows the implementation.

|Step | Description |
|:-----| :-----------|
| 1. | A user attempts to sign in or sign up to an application via Azure AD B2C sign-in and sign-up policy.
| 2. | During sign-up, the Nevis Access App is registered to the user device using a QR code. A private key is generated on the user device and is used to sign the user requests.
| 3. |  Azure AD B2C uses a RESTful technical profile to start the login with the Nevis solution.
| 4. | The login request is sent to the access app, either as a push message, QR code or as a deep-link.
| 5. | The user approves the sign-in attempt with their biometrics. A message is then returned to Nevis, which verifies the login with the stored public key.
| 6. | Azure AD B2C sends one last request to Nevis to confirm that the login was successfully completed.
| 7. |Based on the success/failure message from Azure AD B2C user is granted/denied access to the application.

## Integrate your Azure AD B2C tenant
