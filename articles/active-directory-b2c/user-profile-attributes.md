# User profile attributes

Your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C directory user profile comes with a built-in set of attributes, such as given name, surname, city, postal code, and phone number. You can extend the user profile with your own application data without requiring an external data store. Most of the attributes that can be used with Azure AD B2C user profiles are also supported by Microsoft Graph. This article describes supported Azure AD B2C user profile attributes. It also notes those attributes that are not supported by Microsoft Graph, as well as Microsoft Graph attributes that should not be used with Azure AD B2C.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should not use built-in or extension attributes to store sensitive personal data, such as account credentials, government identification numbers, cardholder data, financial account data, healthcare information, or sensitive background information.

You can also integrate with external systems. For example, you can use Azure AD B2C for authentication, but delegate to an external customer relationship management (CRM) or customer loyalty database as the authoritative source of customer data. For more information, see the [remote profile](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/samples/tree/master/policies/remote-profile) solution.

The table below lists the [user resource type](/graph/api/resources/user) attributes that are supported by the Azure AD B2C directory user profile. It gives the following information about each attribute:

- Attribute name used by Azure AD B2C (followed by the Microsoft Graph name in parentheses, if different)
- Attribute data type
- Attribute description
- If the attribute is available in the Azure portal
- If the attribute can be used in a user flow
- If the attribute can be used in a custom policy [Azure AD technical profile](active-directory-technical-profile.md) and in which section (&lt;InputClaims&gt;, &lt;OutputClaims&gt;, or &lt;PersistedClaims&gt;)

## Extension attributes

You'll often need to create your own attributes, as in the following cases:

- A customer-facing application needs to persist for an attribute like **LoyaltyNumber**.
- An identity provider has a unique user identifier like **uniqueUserGUID** that must be saved.
- A custom user journey needs to persist for a state of a user, like **migrationStatus**.

Azure AD B2C extends the set of attributes stored on each user account. Extension attributes [extend the schema](/graph/extensibility-overview#schema-extensions) of the user objects in the directory. The extension attributes can only be registered on an application object, even though they might contain data for a user. The extension attribute is attached to the application called b2c-extensions-app. Do not modify this application, as it's used by Azure AD B2C for storing user data. You can find this application under Azure Active Directory App registrations.

> [!NOTE]
> - Up to 100 extension attributes can be written to any user account.
> - If the b2c-extensions-app application is deleted, those extension attributes are removed from all users along with any data they contain.
> - If an extension attribute is deleted by the application, it's removed from all user accounts and the values are deleted.
> - The underlying name of the extension attribute is generated in the format "Extension_" + Application ID + "_" + Attribute name. For example, if you create an extension attribute LoyaltyNumber, and the b2c-extensions-app Application ID is 831374b3-bd50-41bf-aa54-263ec9e050fc, the underlying extension attribute name will be: extension_831374b3bd5041bfaa54263ec9e050fc_LoyaltyNumber. You use the underlying name when you run Graph API queries to create or update user accounts.

The following data types are supported when defining a property in a schema extension:

|Property type |Remarks  |
|--------------|---------|
|Boolean    | Possible values: **true** or **false**. |
|DateTime   | Must be specified in ISO 8601 format. Will be stored in UTC.   |
|Integer    | 32-bit value.               |
|String     | 256 characters maximum.     |
