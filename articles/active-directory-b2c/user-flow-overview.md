# User flows in Azure Active Directory B2C

To help you set up the most common identity tasks for your applications, the Azure AD B2C portal includes predefined, configurable policies called **user flows**. A user flow lets you determine how users interact with your application when they do things like sign in, sign up, edit a profile, or reset a password. With user flows, you can control the following capabilities:

- Account types used for sign-in, such as social accounts like a Facebook or local accounts
- Attributes to be collected from the consumer, such as first name, postal code, and shoe size
- Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
- Customization of the user interface
- Information that the application receives as claims in a token

You can create many user flows of different types in your tenant and use them in your applications as needed. User flows can be reused across applications. This flexibility enables you to define and modify identity experiences with minimal or no changes to your code. Your application triggers a user flow by using a standard HTTP authentication request that includes a user flow parameter. A customized [token](tokens-overview.md) is received as a response.

The following examples show the "p" query string parameter that specifies the user flow to be used:

```
https://contosob2c.b2clogin.com/contosob2c.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e      // Your registered Application ID
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A44321%2F    // Your registered Reply URL, url encoded
&response_mode=form_post                            // 'query', 'form_post' or 'fragment'
&response_type=id_token
&scope=openid
&nonce=dummy
&state=12345                                        // Any value provided by your application
&p=b2c_1_siup                                       // Your sign-up user flow
```

```

client_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e      // Your registered Application ID
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A44321%2F    // Your registered Reply URL, url encoded
&response_mode=form_post                            // 'query', 'form_post' or 'fragment'
&response_type=id_token
&scope=openid
&nonce=dummy
&state=12345                                        // Any value provided by your application
&p=b2c_1_siin                                       // Your sign-in user flow
```

## User flow versions

Azure AD B2C includes several types of user flows:

- **Sign up and sign in** - Handles both of the sign-up and sign-in experiences with a single configuration. Users are led down the right path depending on the context. Also included are separate **sign-up** or **sign-in** user flows. But we generally recommend the combined sign up and sign in user flow.
- **Profile editing** - Enables users to edit their profile information.
- **Password reset** - Enables you to configure whether and how users can reset their password.

Most user flow types have both a **Recommended** version and a **Standard** version. For details, see [user flow versions](user-flow-versions.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've worked with user flows in Azure AD B2C before, you'll notice that we've changed the way we reference user flow versions. Previously, we offered V1 (production-ready) versions, and V1.1 and V2 (preview) versions. Now, we've consolidated user flows into two versions:
>
>- **Recommended** user flows are the new preview versions of user flows. They're thoroughly tested and combine all the features of the legacy **V2** and **V1.1** versions. Going forward, the new recommended user flows will be maintained and updated. Once you move to these new recommended user flows, you'll have access to new features as they're released.
>- **Standard** user flows, previously known as **V1**, are generally available, production-ready user flows. If your user flows are mission-critical and depend on highly stable versions, you can continue to use standard user flows, realizing that these versions won't be maintained and updated.
>
>All legacy preview user flows (V1.1 and V2) are on a path to deprecation by **August 1, 2021**. Wherever possible, we highly recommend that you [switch to the new **Recommended** user flows](user-flow-versions.md#how-to-switch-to-a-new-recommended-user-flow) as soon as possible so you can always take advantage of the latest features and updates.

## Linking user flows

A **sign-up or sign-in** user flow with local accounts includes a **Forgot password?** link on the first page of the experience. Clicking this link doesn't automatically trigger a password reset user flow.

Instead, the error code `AADB2C90118` is returned to your application. Your application needs to handle this error code by running a specific user flow that resets the password. To see an example, take a look at a [simple ASP.NET sample](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-SUSI) that demonstrates the linking of user flows.

## Email address storage

An email address can be required as part of a user flow. If the user authenticates with a social identity provider, the email address is stored in the **otherMails** property. If a local account is based on a user name, then the email address is stored in a strong authentication detail property. If a local account is based on an email address, then the email address is stored in the **signInNames** property.

The email address isn't guaranteed to be verified in any of these cases. A tenant administrator can disable email verification in the basic policies for local accounts. Even if email address verification is enabled, addresses aren't verified if they come from a social identity provider and they haven't been changed.

Only the **otherMails** and **signInNames** properties are exposed through the Microsoft Graph API. The email address in the strong authentication detail property is not available.
