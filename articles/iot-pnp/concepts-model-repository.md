# Device model repository

The device model repository (DMR) enables device builders to manage and share IoT Plug and Play device models. The device models are JSON LD documents defined using the [Digital Twins Modeling Language (DTDL)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md).

The DMR defines a pattern to store DTDL interfaces in a folder structure based on the device twin model identifier (DTMI). You can locate an interface in the DMR by converting the DTMI to a relative path. For example, the `dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1` DTMI translates to `/dtmi/com/example/thermostat-1.json`.

## Public device model repository

Microsoft hosts a public DMR with these characteristics:

- Curated models. Microsoft reviews and approves all available interfaces using a GitHub pull request (PR) validation workflow.
- Immutability.  After it's published, an interface can't be updated.
- Hyper-scale. Microsoft provides the required infrastructure to create a secure, scalable endpoint where you can publish and consume device models.

## Custom device model repository

You can use the same DMR pattern in any storage medium, such as local file system or custom HTTP web servers, to create a custom DMR. You can retrieve device models from the custom DMR in the same way as from the public DMR simply by changing the base URL used to access the DMR.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft provides tools to validate device models in the public DMR. You can reuse these tools in custom repositories.

## Public models

The public device models stored in the model repository are available for everyone to consume and integrate in their applications. Public device models enable an open eco-system for device builders and solution developers to share and reuse their IoT Plug and Play device models.

Refer to the [Publish a model](#publish-a-model) section for instructions on how to publish a model in the model repository to make it public.

Users can browse, search, and view public interfaces from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models).

All interfaces in the `dtmi` folders are also available from the public endpoint [https://devicemodels.azure.com](https://devicemodels.azure.com)

### Resolve models

To programmatically access these interfaces, you need to convert a DTMI to a relative path that you can use to query the public endpoint. The following code sample shows you how to do this:

To convert a DTMI to an absolute path we use the `DtmiToPath` function, with `IsValidDtmi`:

```cs
static string DtmiToPath(string dtmi)
{
    if (!IsValidDtmi(dtmi))
    {
        return null;
    }
    // dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1 -> dtmi/com/example/thermostat-1.json
    return $"/{dtmi.ToLowerInvariant().Replace(":", "/").Replace(";", "-")}.json";
}

static bool IsValidDtmi(string dtmi)
{
    // Regex defined at https://github.com/Azure/digital-twin-model-identifier#validation-regular-expressions
    Regex rx = new Regex(@"^dtmi:[A-Za-z](?:[A-Za-z0-9_]*[A-Za-z0-9])?(?::[A-Za-z](?:[A-Za-z0-9_]*[A-Za-z0-9])?)*;[1-9][0-9]{0,8}$");
    return rx.IsMatch(dtmi);
}
```

With the resulting path and the base URL for the repository we can obtain the interface:

```cs
const string _repositoryEndpoint = "https://devicemodels.azure.com";

string dtmiPath = DtmiToPath(dtmi.ToString());
string fullyQualifiedPath = $"{_repositoryEndpoint}{dtmiPath}";
string modelContent = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(fullyQualifiedPath);
```

## Publish a model

> [!Important]
> You must have a GitHub account to be able to submit models to the public DMR.

1. Fork the public GitHub repo: [https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models).
1. Clone the forked repo. Optionally create a new branch to keep your changes isolated from the `main` branch.
1. Add the new interfaces to the `dtmi` folder using the folder/filename convention. See the [add-model](#add-model) tool.
1. Validate the device models locally using the [scripts to validate changes](#validate-files) section.
1. Commit the changes locally and push to your fork.
1. From your fork, create a pull request that targets the `main` branch. See [Creating an issue or pull request](https://docs.github.com/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) docs.
1. Review the [pull request requirements](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models/blob/main/pr-reqs.md).

The pull request triggers a series of GitHub actions that will validate the new submitted interfaces, and make sure your pull request satisfies all the checks.

Microsoft will respond to a pull request with all checks in three business days.

### add-model

The following steps show you how the add-model.js script helps you add a new interface. This script requires Node.js to run:

1. From a command prompt, navigate to the local git repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run add-model <path-to-file-to-add>`

Watch the console output for any error messages.

### Local validation

You can run the same validation checks locally before submitting the pull request to help diagnose issues in advance.

#### validate-files

`npm run validate-files <file1.json> <file2.json>` checks the file path matches the expected folder and file names.

#### validate-ids

`npm run validate-ids <file1.json> <file2.json>` checks that all IDs defined in the document use the same root as the main ID.

#### validate-deps

`npm run validate-deps <file1.json> <file2.json>` checks all the dependencies are available in the `dtmi` folder.

#### validate-models

You can run the [DTDL Validation Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/DTDL-Validator) to validate your device models locally.

## Next steps

The suggested next step is to review the [IoT Plug and Play architecture](concepts-architecture.md).
