# As a device developer, I want to see a working IoT Plug and Play device sample connecting to IoT Hub and sending properties, commands and telemetry. As a solution developer, I want to use a tool to view the properties, commands, and telemetry an IoT Plug and Play device reports to the IoT hub it connects to.

# Quickstart: Connect a sample IoT Plug and Play Preview device application running on Windows to IoT Hub (C Windows)

This quickstart shows you how to build a sample IoT Plug and Play device application, connect it to your IoT hub, and use the Azure IoT explorer tool to view the information it sends to the hub. The sample application is written in C and is included in the Azure IoT Hub Device C SDK. A solution developer can use the Azure IoT explorer tool to understand the capabilities of an IoT Plug and Play device without the need to view any device code.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need to install the following software on your local machine:

* [Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - make sure that you include the **NuGet package manager** component and the **Desktop Development with C++** workload when you install Visual Studio.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/).
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

### Install the Azure IoT explorer

Download and install the latest release of **Azure IoT explorer** from the tool's [repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases) page, by selecting the .msi file under "Assets" for the most recent update.

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-prepare-iot-hub-windows.md](../../includes/iot-pnp-prepare-iot-hub-windows.md)]

## Prepare the development environment

In this quickstart, you prepare a development environment you can use to clone and build the Azure IoT Hub Device C SDK.

Open a command prompt in the directory of your choice. Execute the following command to clone the [Azure IoT C SDKs and Libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository into this location:

```cmd/sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c --recursive -b public-preview
```

You should expect this operation to take several minutes to complete.

## Build the code

You use the device SDK to build the included sample code. The application you build simulates a device that connects to an IoT hub. The application sends telemetry and properties and receives commands.

1. Create a `cmake` subdirectory in the device SDK root folder, and navigate to that folder:

    ```cmd\sh
    cd <root folder>\azure-iot-sdk-c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

1. Run the following commands to build the device SDK and the generated code stub:

    ```cmd\sh
    cmake ..
    cmake --build . -- /m /p:Configuration=Release
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If cmake can't find your C++ compiler, you get build errors when you run the previous command. If that happens, try running this command at the [Visual Studio command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

## Run the device sample

Run a sample application in the SDK to simulate an IoT Plug and Play device that sends telemetry to your IoT hub. To run the sample application, use these commands and pass the _device connection string_ as a parameter.

```cmd\sh
cd digitaltwin_client\samples\digitaltwin_sample_device\Release
copy ..\EnvironmentalSensor.interface.json .
digitaltwin_sample_device.exe "<YourDeviceConnectionString>"
```

The device is now ready to receive commands and property updates, and has begun sending telemetry data to the hub. Keep the sample running as you complete the next steps.

## Use the Azure IoT explorer to validate the code

1. Open Azure IoT explorer. You see the **App configurations** page.

1. Enter your _IoT Hub connection string_ and select **Connect**.

1. After you connect, you see the **Devices** overview page.

1. To ensure the tool can read the interface model definitions from your device, select **Settings**. In the Settings menu, **On the connected device** may already appear in the Plug and Play configurations; if it does not, select **+ Add module definition source** and then **On the connected device** to add it.

1. Back on the **Devices** overview page, find the device identity you created previously. With the device application still running in the command prompt, check that the device's **Connection state** in Azure IoT explorer is reporting as _Connected_ (if not, hit **Refresh** until it is). Select the device to view more details.

1. Expand the interface with ID **urn:YOUR_COMPANY_NAME_HERE:EnvironmentalSensor:1** to reveal the interface and IoT Plug and Play primitivesâ€”properties, commands, and telemetry.

1. Select the **Telemetry** page and hit _Start_ to view the telemetry data the device is sending.

1. Select the **Properties (non-writable)** page to view the non-writable properties reported by the device.

1. Select the **Properties (writable)** page to view the writable properties you can update.

1. Expand property **name**, update with a new name and select **Update writable property**. 

1. To see the new name show up in the **Reported Property** column, select the **Refresh** button on top of the page.

1. Select the **Commands** page to view all the commands the device supports.

1. Expand the **blink** command and set a new blink time interval. Select **Send command** to call the command on the device.

1. Go to the simulated device command prompt and read through the printed confirmation messages, to verify that the commands have executed as expected.
