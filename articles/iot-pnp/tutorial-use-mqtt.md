# Tutorial - Use MQTT to develop an IoT Plug and Play device client

You should use one of the Azure IoT Device SDKs to build your IoT Plug and Play device clients if at all possible. However, in scenarios such as using a memory constrained device, you may need to use an MQTT library to communicate with your IoT hub.

The sample in this tutorial uses the [Eclipse Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) MQTT library and Visual Studio. The steps in this tutorial assume you're using Windows on your development machine.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-prerequisites](../../includes/iot-pnp-prerequisites.md)]

To complete this tutorial on Windows, install the following software on your local Windows environment:

* [Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - make sure you include the **Desktop Development with C++** workload when you [install](/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?preserve-view=true&view=vs-2019) Visual Studio
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

Use the *Azure IoT explorer* tool to add a new device to your IoT Hub. You configured your IoT hub and the Azure IoT explorer tool when you completed [Set up your environment for the IoT Plug and Play quickstarts and tutorials](set-up-environment.md):

1. Launch the **Azure IoT explorer** tool.
1. On the **IoT hubs** page, select **View devices in this hub**.
1. On the **Devices** page, select **+ New**.
1. Create a device called *my-mqtt-device* that uses an autogenerated symmetric key.
1. On the **Device identity** page, expand **Connection string with SAS token**.
1. Choose the **Primary key** to use as the **Symmetric key**, set the expiration time to 60 minutes, and select **Generate**.
1. Copy the generated **SAS token connection string**, you use this value later in the tutorial.

## Clone sample repo

Use the following command to clone the sample repository to a suitable location on your local machine:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/IoTMQTTSample.git
```

## Install MQTT library

Use the `vcpkg` tool to download and build the Eclipse Mosquitto library.

Use the following command to clone the **Vcpkg** repository to a suitable location on your local machine:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

Use the following commands to prepare the `vcpkg` environment. You need an elevated command prompt when you run `vcpkg integrate install`:

```cmd
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg integrate install
```

Use the following command to download and build the Eclipse Mosquitto library:

```cmd
.\vcpkg install mosquitto:x64-windows
```

## Migrate the sample to IoT Plug and Play

### Review the non-IoT Plug and Play sample code

Update the code with details of your IoT hub and device before you build and run it.

To view the sample code in Visual Studio, open the *MQTTWin32.sln* solution file in the *IoTMQTTSample\src\Windows* folder.

In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the **TelemetryMQTTWin32** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.

In the **TelemetryMQTTWin32** project, open the **MQTT_Mosquitto.cpp** source file. Update the connection information definitions with the device details you made a note of previously. Replace the token string placeholders for the:

* `IOTHUBNAME` identifier with the name of your IoT hub.
* `DEVICEID` identifier with `my-mqtt-device`.
* `PWD` identifier with the correct part of the SAS token connection string you generated for the device. Use the part of the connection string from `SharedAccessSignature sr=` through to the end.

Verify the code is working correctly, by starting Azure IoT explorer, start listening the telemetry.

Run the application (Ctrl+F5), after couple of seconds you see output that looks like:

In Azure IoT explorer, you can see that the device isn't an IoT Plug and Play device:

### Make the device an IoT Plug and Play device

IoT Plug and Play device must follow a set of simple conventions. If a device sends a model ID when it connects, it becomes an IoT Plug and Play device.

In this sample, you add a model ID to the MQTT connection packet. You pass the model ID as querystring parameter in the `USERNAME` and change the `api-version` to `2020-09-30`:

```c
// computed Host Username and Topic
//#define USERNAME IOTHUBNAME ".azure-devices.net/" DEVICEID "/?api-version=2018-06-30"
#define USERNAME IOTHUBNAME ".azure-devices.net/" DEVICEID "/?api-version=2020-09-30&model-id=dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1"
#define PORT 8883
#define HOST IOTHUBNAME //".azure-devices.net"
#define TOPIC "devices/" DEVICEID "/messages/events/"
```

Rebuild and run the sample.

The device twin now includes the model ID:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-use-mqtt/model-id-iot-explorer.png" alt-text="View the model ID in Azure IoT explorer":::

You can now navigate the IoT Plug and Play component:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-use-mqtt/components-iot-explorer.png" alt-text="View components in Azure IoT explorer":::

You can now modify your device code to implement the telemetry, properties, and commands defined in your model. To see an example implementation of the thermostat device using the Mosquitto library, see [Using MQTT PnP with Azure IoTHub without the IoT SDK on Windows](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/IoTMQTTSample/tree/master/src/Windows/PnPMQTTWin32) on GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
>The client uses the `IoTHubRootCA_Baltimore.pem` root certificate file to verify the identity of the IoT hub it connects to.

### MQTT topics

The following definitions are for the MQTT topics the device uses to send information to the IoT hub. To learn more, see [Communicate with your IoT hub using the MQTT protocol](../iot-hub/iot-hub-mqtt-support.md):

* The `DEVICE_CAPABILITIES_MESSAGE` defines the topic the device uses to report the interfaces it implements.
* The `DEVICETWIN_PATCH_MESSAGE` defines the topic the device uses to report property updates to the IoT hub.
* The `DEVICE_TELEMETRY_MESSAGE` defines the topic the device uses to send telemetry to your IoT hub.
