# As a device builder, I want to understand difference between DTDL models that use components and models that don't use components.

# IoT Plug and Play components in models

In the IoT Plug and Play conventions, a device is an IoT Plug and Play device if it presents its digital twins definition language (DTDL) model ID when it connects to an IoT hub.

The following snippet shows some example model IDs:

```json
 "@id": "dtmi:com:example:TemperatureController;1"
 "@id": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
```

## No components

A simple model doesn't use embedded or cascaded components. It includes header information and a contents section to define telemetry, properties, and commands.

The following example shows part of a simple model that doesn't use components:

```json
{
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "Thermostat",
  "description": "Reports current temperature and provides desired temperature control.",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": [
        "Telemetry",
        "Temperature"
      ],
      "name": "temperature",
      "displayName": "Temperature",
      "description": "Temperature in degrees Celsius.",
      "schema": "double",
      "unit": "degreeCelsius"
    },
    {
      "@type": [
        "Property",
...
```

Although the model doesn't explicitly define a component, it behaves as if there is a single component with all the telemetry, property, and command definitions.

The following screenshot shows how the model displays in the Azure IoT explorer tool:

The model ID is stored in a device twin property as the following screenshot shows:

A DTDL model without components is a useful simplification for a device with a single set of telemetry, properties, and commands. A model that doesn't use components makes it easy to migrate an existing device to be an IoT Plug and Play device - you create a DTDL model that describes your actual device without the need to define any components.

## Multiple components

Components let you build a model interface as an assembly of other interfaces.

For example, the [Thermostat](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/samples/Thermostat.json) interface is defined as a model. You can incorporate this interface as one or more components when when you define the [Temperature Controller model](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/samples/TemperatureController.json). In the following example, these components are called `thermostat1` and `thermostat2`.

For a DTDL model with multiple components, there are two or more component sections. Each section has `@type` set to `Component` and explicitly refers to a schema as shown in the following snippet:

```json
{
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:TemperatureController;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "Temperature Controller",
  "description": "Device with two thermostats and remote reboot.",
  "contents": [
...
    {
      "@type" : "Component",
      "schema": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
      "name": "thermostat1",
      "displayName": "Thermostat One",
      "description": "Thermostat One of Two."
    },
    {
      "@type" : "Component",
      "schema": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
      "name": "thermostat2",
      "displayName": "Thermostat Two",
      "description": "Thermostat Two of Two."
    },
    {
      "@type": "Component",
      "schema": "dtmi:azure:DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation;1",
      "name": "deviceInformation",
      "displayName": "Device Information interface",
      "description": "Optional interface with basic device hardware information."
    }
...
```

This model has three components defined in the contents section -  two `Thermostat` components and a `DeviceInformation` component. There's also a default root component.
