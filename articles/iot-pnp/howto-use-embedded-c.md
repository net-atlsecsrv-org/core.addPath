# Implement IoT Plug and Play on constrained devices

If you're developing for *constrained devices*, you can use IoT Plug and Play with the [Azure SDK for Embedded C IoT client libraries](https://aka.ms/embeddedcsdk) or with [Azure RTOS](/azure/rtos/overview-rtos). This article includes links and resources for these constrained scenarios.

## Use the SDK for Embedded C

The SDK for Embedded C offers a lightweight solution to connect constrained devices to Azure IoT services, including using the [IoT Plug and Play conventions](concepts-convention.md). The following links include samples for real device and for educational and debugging purposes.

### Use a real device

For a complete end-to-end tutorial using the SDK for Embedded C, the Device Provisioning Service, and IoT Plug and Play on a real device, see [Repurpose PIC-IoT Wx Development Board to Connect to Azure through IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Microchip-PIC-IoT-Wx).

### Introductory samples

The SDK for Embedded C repository contains [several samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/samples/iot#iot-hub-plug-and-play-sample) that show you how to use IoT Plug and Play:

> [!NOTE]
> These samples are shown running on Windows and Linux for educational and debugging purposes. In a production scenario, the samples are intended for constrained devices only.

- [Temperature Controller example with the SDK for Embedded C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/samples/iot/paho_iot_hub_pnp_component_sample.c)

## Using Azure RTOS

Azure RTOS includes a lightweight layer that adds native connectivity to Azure IoT cloud services. This layer provides a simple mechanism to connect constrained devices to Azure IoT while using the advanced features of Azure RTOS. To learn more, see the [What is Microsoft Azure RTOS](/azure/rtos/overview-rtos).

### Toolchains

The Azure RTOS samples are provided with different kinds of of IDE and toolchain combinations, such as:

- IAR: IAR's [Embedded Workbench](https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/) IDE
- GCC/CMake: Build on top of the open source [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system and [GNU Arm Embedded toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).
- MCUExpresso: NXP's [MCUXpresso IDE](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE)
- STM32Cube: STMicroelectronic's [STM32Cube IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- MPLAB: Microchip's [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)

## Next steps

Now that you've learned about the options for implementing IoT Plug and Play on constrained devices, a suggested next step is to learn about the [IoT Plug and Play conventions](concepts-convention.md).
