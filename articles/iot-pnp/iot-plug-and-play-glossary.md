- Devices to send telemetry to a cloud-based solution.
- A cloud-based solution to manage connected devices.

## Azure IoT device SDK

There are device SDKs for multiple languages that you can use to build IoT Plug and Play device client applications. One of the requirements for [device  certification](#device-certification) is that the device client code uses one of the Azure IoT device SDKs.

## Certified for IoT device catalog

The [Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/) lists [IoT Plug and Play devices](#iot-plug-and-play-device) that have passed the [device certification](#device-certification) tests. The [device capability models](#device-capability-model) for the IoT Plug and Play devices in the catalog and published in the public model repository.

## Commands

Commands defined in an [interface](#interface) represent methods that can be executed on the [digital twin](#digital-twin). For example, a command to reboot a device.

## Common interface

All [IoT Plug and Play devices](#iot-plug-and-play-device) are expected to implement some common [interfaces](#interface). For example, the device information interface defines hardware and operating system information about the device. [Device certification](#device-certification) requires your device to implement several common interfaces. You can retrieve common interface definitions from the public model repository.

## Company model repository

An organization can use a company [model repository](#model-repository) as a private store for [device capability models](#device-capability-model) and [interfaces](#interface).

## Connection string

A connection string encapsulates the information required to connect to an endpoint. A connection string typically includes the address of the endpoint and security information, but connection string formats vary across services. There are two types of connection string associated with the IoT Hub service:

- Device connection strings enable [IoT Plug and Play devices](#iot-plug-and-play-device) to connect to the device-facing endpoints on an IoT hub. Client code on a device uses the connection string to establish a secure connection with an IoT hub.
- IoT Hub connection strings enable back-end solutions and tools to connect securely to the service-facing endpoints on an IoT hub. These solutions and tools manage the IoT hub and the devices connected to it.
- Company model repository connection strings enable back-end solutions and tools to connect securely to a [Company model repository](#company-model-repository). These solutions and tools consume or manage the [device capability models](#device-capability-model) and [interfaces](#interface) in the repository.

## Device capability model

A device capability model describes an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) and defines the set of [interfaces](#interface) implemented by the device. A device capability model typically corresponds to a physical device, product, or SKU. You use the [Digital Twin Definition Language](#digital-twin-definition-language) to define a device capability model.

## Device certification

Device certification is the process of certifying an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) so that it can be added to the [Certified for IoT device catalog](#certified-for-iot-device-catalog) and its [device capability model](#device-capability-model) and [interfaces](#interface) added to the [public model repository](#public-model-repository).

## Device developer

A device developer uses a [device capability model](#device-capability-model), [interfaces](#interface), and an [Azure IoT device SDK](#azure-iot-device-sdk) to implement code to run on an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device).

## Device modeling

A [device developer](#device-developer) uses the [Digital Twin Definition Language](#digital-twin-definition-language) to model the capabilities of an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device). The model can be shared using a model repository. A device developer can generate skeleton device code from the model. A [solution developer](#solution-developer) can configure an IoT solution from the model.

## Device Provisioning Service

[Azure IoT Central](#azure-iot-central) uses the Device Provisioning Service to manage all device registration and connection. For more information, see [Device connectivity in Azure IoT Central](../iot-central/preview/overview-iot-central-get-connected.md). You can also use the Device Provisioning Service to manage device registration and connection to your IoT Hub-based IoT solution. For more information, see [Provisioning devices with Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md).

## Device registration

Before an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) can connect to an IoT solution, it must be registered with the solution. [Azure IoT Central](#azure-iot-central) uses the [Device Provisioning Service](#device-provisioning-service) to manage device registration. In a custom IoT solution, you can register devices with your IoT hub in the Azure portal or programmatically.

## Device-first

[Azure IoT Central](#azure-iot-central) supports a device-first registration and connection scenario. In this scenario, an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) can connect to an IoT Central application without being registered in advance. Registration happens automatically when a device first connects to the application.

## Digital twin

A digital twin is a model of an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device). A digital twin is modeled using the [Digital Twin Definition Language](#digital-twin-definition-language). You can use the [Azure IoT device SDKs](#azure-iot-device-sdk) to interact with digital twins at run time. For example, you can set a property value in a digital twin on a device and the SDK communicates this change to your IoT solution in the cloud.

## Digital twin change events

When an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) is connected to an [IoT hub](#azure-iot-hub), the hub can use its routing capability to send notifications of digital twin changes. For example, whenever a [property](#properties) value changes on a device, IoT Hub can send a notification to an endpoint such as a Service Bus queue.

## Digital Twin Definition Language

A language for describing models and interfaces for [IoT Plug and Play devices](#iot-plug-and-play-device). Use the [Digital Twin Definition Language](https://aka.ms/DTDL) to describe a [digital twin's](#digital-twin) capabilities and enable the IoT platform and IoT solutions to leverage the semantics of the entity.

## Digital twin route

A route set up in an [IoT hub](#azure-iot-hub) to deliver [digital twin change events](#digital-twin-change-events) to and endpoint such as a Service Bus queue.

## Interface

An interface describes related capabilities that are implemented by a [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) or [digital twin](#digital-twin). You can reuse interfaces across different [device capability models](#device-capability-model).

## IoT Hub query language

The IoT Hub query language is used for multiple purposes. For example, you can use the language to search for [devices registered](#device-registration) with your IoT hub or refine the [digital twin routing](#digital-twin-route) behavior.

## IoT Plug and Play device

An IoT Plug and Play device is typically a small-scale, standalone computing device that collects data or controls other devices, and that runs software or firmware that implements a [device capability model](#device-capability-model).  For example, an IoT Plug and Play device might be an environmental monitoring device, or a controller for a smart-agriculture irrigation system. You can write a cloud-hosted IoT solution to command, control, and receive data from IoT Plug and Play devices. The [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](#certified-for-iot-device-catalog) lists available IoT Plug and Play devices. Each IoT Plug and Play device in the catalog has been validated, and has a [device capability model](#device-capability-model).

## Microsoft Partner Center

[Microsoft Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/) is where your organization manages its end-to-end relationship with Microsoft. You need a Microsoft Partner Center account before you can certify your [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) in the [Azure Certified for IoT portal](#azure-certified-for-iot-portal).

## Model discovery

When an [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) connects to an IoT solution, the solution can discover the capabilities of the device by finding the [device capability model](#device-capability-model). A device can send its capability model to the solution, or the solution can find a device capability model in a [model repository](#model-repository).

## Model repository

A model repository stores [device capability models](#device-capability-model) and [interfaces](#interface). There's a single [public model repository](#public-model-repository). Organizations can create their own organizational model repositories.

## Model repository REST API

An API for managing and interacting with model repositories. For example, you can use the API to add [device capability models](#device-capability-model) and search for capability models.

## Properties

Properties are data fields defined in an [interface](#interface) that represent some state of a digital twin. You can declare properties as read-only or writable. Read-only properties, such as serial number, are set by code running on the [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) itself.  Writable properties, such as an alarm threshold, are typically set from the cloud-based IoT solution.

## Public model repository

There is a single public model repository that stores [device capability models](#device-capability-model) and [interfaces](#interface) for [certified devices](#device-certification). The public model repository also stores [common interface](#common-interface) definitions.

## Registration ID

A registration ID uniquely identifies a device in the [Device Provisioning Service](#device-provisioning-service). This ID isn't the same as the device ID that's a unique identifier for a device in an [IoT hub](#azure-iot-hub).

## Scope ID

The Scope ID scope uniquely identifies a [Device Provisioning Service](#device-provisioning-service) instance.

## Shared access signature

Shared access signatures are an authentication mechanism based on SHA-256 secure hashes or URIs. Shared access signature authentication has two components: a shared access policy and a shared access signature (often called a token). An [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) uses a shared access signature to authenticate with an [IoT hub](#azure-iot-hub).

## Solution developer

A solution developer creates the solution back end. A solution developer typically works with Azure resources such as [IoT Hub](#azure-iot-hub) and  [model repositories](#model-repository), or works with [IoT Central](#azure-iot-central).

## Telemetry

Telemetry fields defined in an [interface](#interface) represent measurements. These measurements are typically values such as sensor readings that are sent by the [IoT Plug and Play device](#iot-plug-and-play-device) as a stream of data.

## Visual Studio code

Visual Studio code is a modern code editor available for multiple platforms. Extensions, such as those in the [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools) pack, enable you to customize the editor to support a wide range of development scenarios.
