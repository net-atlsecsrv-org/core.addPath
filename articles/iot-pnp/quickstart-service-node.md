# Quickstart: Interact with an IoT Plug and Play Preview device that's connected to your solution (Node.js)

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-quickstarts-service-selector.md](../../includes/iot-pnp-quickstarts-service-selector.md)]

IoT Plug and Play Preview simplifies IoT by enabling you to interact with a device's capabilities without knowledge of the underlying device implementation. This quickstart shows you how to use Node.js to connect to and control an IoT Plug and Play device that's connected to your solution.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need Node.js on your development machine. You can download the latest recommended version for multiple platforms from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

You can verify the current version of Node.js on your development machine using the following command:

```cmd/sh
node --version
```

Install the [Node service SDK with IoT Plug and Play support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-iot-digitaltwins-service) by running the following command:

```cmd/sh
npm i azure-iot-digitaltwins-service
```

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-prepare-iot-hub.md](../../includes/iot-pnp-prepare-iot-hub.md)]

Run the following command to get the _IoT hub connection string_ for your hub. Make a note of this connection string, you use it later in this quickstart:

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub show-connection-string --hub-name <YourIoTHubName> --output table
```

Run the following command to get the _device connection string_ for the device you added to the hub. Make a note of this connection string, you use it later in this quickstart:

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name <YourIoTHubName> --device-id <YourDeviceID> --output
```

## Run the sample device

In this quickstart, you can use a sample thermostat device that's written in Node.js as the IoT Plug and Play device. To run the sample device:

1. Open a terminal window in a folder of your choice. Run the following command to clone the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node) GitHub repository into this location:

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node
    ```

1. This terminal window is used as your **device** terminal. Go to the folder of your cloned repository, and navigate to the */azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/pnp* folder. Install all the dependencies by running the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Configure the _device connection string_:

    ```cmd/sh
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING=<YourDeviceConnectionString>
    ```

1. Run the sample thermostat device with the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    node simple_thermostat.js
    ```

1. You see messages saying that the device has sent some information and reported itself online. These messages indicate that the device has begun sending telemetry data to the hub, and is now ready to receive commands and property updates. Don't close this terminal, you need it to confirm the service sample is working.

## Run the sample solution

In this quickstart, you use a sample IoT solution in Node.js to interact with the sample device you just set up.

1. Open another terminal window to use as your **service** terminal. The service SDK is in preview, so you need to clone the samples from a [preview branch of the Node SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/tree/pnp-preview-refresh):

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node -b public-preview-pnp
    ```

1. Go to the folder of this cloned repository branch, and navigate to the */azure-iot-samples-node/digital-twins/samples/service/javascript* folder. Install all the dependencies by running the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Configure environment variables for your device ID and _IoT Hub connection string_:

    ```cmd/sh
    set IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING=<YourIOTHubConnectionString>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_ID=<Your device ID>
    ```

### Read a property

1. When you ran the sample thermostat device in the **device** terminal, you saw the following messages indicating its online status:

    ```cmd/sh
    properties have been reported for component
    sending telemetry message 0...
    ```

1. Go to the **service** terminal and use the following command to run the sample for reading device information:

    ```cmd/sh
    node get_digital_twin.js
    ```

1. In the **service** terminal output, notice the response of the digital twin. You see the device's model ID and associated properties reported:

    ```json
    "$dtId": "mySimpleThermostat",
    "serialNumber": "123abc",
    "maxTempSinceLastReboot": 51.96167432818655,
    "$metadata": {
      "$model": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
      "serialNumber": { "lastUpdateTime": "2020-07-09T14:04:00.6845182Z" },
      "maxTempSinceLastReboot": { "lastUpdateTime": "2020-07-09T14:04:00.6845182" }
    }
    ```

1. The following snippet shows the code in *get_digital_twin.js* that retrieves the device twin's model ID:

    ```javascript
    console.log("Model Id: " + inspect(digitalTwin.$metadata.$model))
    ```

In this scenario, it outputs `Model Id: dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1`.

### Update a writable property

1. Open the file *update_digital_twin_property.js* in a code editor.

1. Review the sample code. You can see how to create a JSON patch to update your device's digital twin. In this sample, the code replaces the thermostat's temperature with the value 42:

    ```javascript
    const patch = [{
        op: 'add',
        path: 'targetTemperature',
        value: '42'
      }]
    ```

1. In the **service** terminal, use the following command to run the sample for updating the property:

    ```cmd/sh
    node update_digital_twin_property.js
    ```

1. The **service** terminal output shows the updated device information. Scroll to the `thermostat1` component to see the new `targetTemperature` value of 42:

    ```json
    "modelId": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
        "version": 12,
        "properties": {
            "desired": {
                "targetTemperature": "42",
                "$metadata": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2020-07-09T13:55:50.7976985Z",
                    "$lastUpdatedVersion": 5,
                    "targetTemperature": {
                        "$lastUpdated": "2020-07-09T13:55:50.7976985Z",
                        "$lastUpdatedVersion": 5
                    }
                },
                "$version": 5
            },
            "reported": {
                "serialNumber": "123abc",
                "maxTempSinceLastReboot": 32.279942997143785,
                "targetTemperature": {
                    "value": "42",
                    "ac": 200,
                    "ad": "Successfully executed patch for targetTemperature",
                    "av": 2
                },
    ```

1. In your **device** terminal, you see the device has received the update:

    ```cmd/sh
    Received an update for targetTemperature: 42
    updated the property
    ```

1. In your **service** terminal, run the following command to confirm the property is updated:

    ```cmd/sh
    node get_digital_twin.js
    ```

1. In the **service** terminal output, in the digital twin response under the `thermostat1` component, you see the updated target temperature reported. It might take a while for the device to finish the update. Repeat this step until the device has processed the property update:

    ```json
    "$model": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",
    "targetTemperature": {
      "desiredValue": 42,
      "desiredVersion": 4,
      "ackVersion": 4,
      "ackCode": 200,
      "ackDescription": "Successfully executed patch for targetTemperature",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2020-07-09T13:55:30.5062641Z"
    }
    ```

### Invoke a command

1. Open the file *invoke_command.js* and review the code.

1. Go to the **service** terminal. Use the following command to run the sample for invoking the command:

    ```cmd/sh
    node invoke_command.js
    ```

1. Output in the **service** terminal shows the following confirmation:

    ```cmd/sh
    {
        xMsCommandStatuscode: 200,  
        xMsRequestId: 'ee9dd3d7-4405-4983-8cee-48b4801fdce2',  
        connection: 'close',  'content-length': '18',  
        'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',  
        date: 'Thu, 09 Jul 2020 15:05:14 GMT',  
        server: 'Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0',  vary: 'Origin',  
        body: 'min/max response'
    }
    ```

1. In the **device** terminal, you see the command is acknowledged:

    ```cmd/sh
    MaxMinReport [object Object]
    Response to method 'getMaxMinReport' sent successfully.
    ```
