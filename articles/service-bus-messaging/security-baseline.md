# Azure security baseline for Service Bus

The Azure Security Baseline for Service Bus contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks 

**Guidance**: The integration of Service Bus with the Azure Private Link service enables secure private access to messaging capabilities from workloads such as virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks. Create a private endpoint connection to your Service Bus namespace. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network. All traffic to the service can be routed through that private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed.

You can also secure your Azure Service Bus namespace by using firewalls. Azure Service Bus supports IP-based access controls for inbound firewall support. You can set firewall rules by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

- [Allow access to Azure Service Bus namespaces via private endpoints](private-link-service.md)

- [Allow access to Azure Service Bus namespace from specific IP addresses or ranges](service-bus-ip-filtering.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: If using Azure virtual machines to access your Service Bus entities, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations. 

Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your Service Bus resources in Azure.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: If using Azure virtual machines to access your Service Bus entities, select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection capabilities. If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not required for your organization, you may use Azure Service Bus's built-in firewall feature. You can limit access to your Service Bus namespace for a limited range of IP addresses, or a specific IP address by using Firewall rules.

- [How to add a firewall rule in Service Bus namespaces for a specified IP address](service-bus-ip-filtering.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall which filter traffic to and from Service Bus resources. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ServiceBus) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change. 

- [Understand and use Service Tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources associated with your Azure Service Bus namespaces with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ServiceBus" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Service Bus namespaces. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions related to Azure Service Bus, such as:

- Service Bus should use a virtual network service endpoint
- Diagnostic logs in Service Bus should be enabled

You may also construct custom policy definitions if the built-in definitions do not fit your organization's needs.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for virtual networks and other resources related to network security and traffic flow that are associated with your Service Bus namespaces. For individual network security group rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need, duration, and other descriptive information for any rules that allow traffic to or from a network associated with your Service Bus namespaces. 

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources. 

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Microsoft Azure provides integrated access control management for resources and applications based on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). A key advantage of using Azure AD with Azure Service Bus is that you don't need to store your credentials in the code anymore. Instead, you can request an OAuth 2.0 access token from the Microsoft Identity platform. The resource name to request a token is https://servicebus.azure.net/. Azure AD authenticates the security principal (a user, group, or service principal) running the application. If the authentication succeeds, Azure AD returns an access token to the application, and the application can then use the access token to authorize request to Azure Service Bus resources.

## Data recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

**Guidance**: Configure geo-disaster recovery for Azure Service Bus. When entire Azure regions or datacenters (if no availability zones are used) experience downtime, it is critical for data processing to continue to operate in a different region or datacenter. As such, Geo-disaster recovery and Geo-replication are important features for any enterprise. Azure Service Bus supports both geo-disaster recovery and geo-replication, at the namespace level.

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Azure Service Bus provides encryption of data at rest with Azure Storage Service Encryption (Azure SSE). Service Bus relies on Azure Storage to store the data and by default, all the data that is stored with Azure Storage is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys. If you use Azure Key Vault for storing customer-managed keys, ensure regular automated backups of your Keys.

Ensure regular automated backups of your Key Vault Secrets with the following PowerShell command: Backup-AzKeyVaultSecret

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Enable soft-delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion. Azure Service Bus requires customer-managed keys to have Soft Delete and Do Not Purge configured.

## Incident response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: 
Develop an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure there are written incident response plans that define all the roles of personnel as well as the phases of incident handling and management from detection to post-incident review. 

- [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

- [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems' incident response capabilities on a regular cadence. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: 
Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: 
Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the continuous export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You can use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
