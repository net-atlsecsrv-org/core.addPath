# Java message service (JMS) 2.0 entities

Client applications connecting to Azure Service Bus Premium and using the [Azure Service Bus JMS library](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure/azure-servicebus-jms) can use the below entities.

## Queues

Queues in JMS are semantically comparable with the traditional [Service Bus queues](service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#queues).

To create a Queue, use the below methods in the `JMSContext` class -

```java
Queue createQueue(String queueName)
```

## Topics

Topics in JMS are semantically comparable with the traditional [Service Bus topics](service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#topics-and-subscriptions).

To create a Topic, use the below methods in the `JMSContext` class -

```java
Topic createTopic(String topicName)
```

## Temporary queues

If a client application requires a temporary entity that exists for the lifetime of the application, it can use Temporary queues. These entities are used in the [Request-Reply](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RequestReply.html) pattern.

To create a temporary queue, use the below methods in the `JMSContext` class -

```java
TemporaryQueue createTemporaryQueue()
```

## Temporary topics

Just like Temporary Queues, Temporary Topics exist to enable publish/subscribe through a temporary entity that exists for the lifetime of the application.

To create a temporary topic, use the below methods in the `JMSContext` class -

```java
TemporaryTopic createTemporaryTopic()
```

## Java message service (JMS) subscriptions

While these are semantically similar to the [Subscriptions](service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#topics-and-subscriptions) (that is, exist on a topic and enable publish/subscribe semantics), the Java Message Service spec introduces the concepts of **Shared**, **Unshared**, **Durable, and **Non-durable** attributes for a given subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> The below subscriptions are available in Azure Service Bus Premium tier for client applications connecting to Azure Service Bus using the [Azure Service Bus JMS library](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure/azure-servicebus-jms).
>
> Only durable subscriptions can be created using the Azure portal.
>

### Shared durable subscriptions

A shared durable subscription is used when all the messages published on a topic are to be received and processed by an application, regardless of whether the application is actively consuming from the subscription at all times.

Any application that is authenticated to receive from Service Bus can receive from the shared durable subscription.

To create a shared durable subscription, use the below methods on the `JMSContext` class -

```java
JMSConsumer createSharedDurableConsumer(Topic topic, String name)

JMSConsumer createSharedDurableConsumer(Topic topic, String name, String messageSelector)
```

The shared durable subscription continues to exist unless deleted using the `unsubscribe` method on the `JMSContext` class.

```java
void unsubscribe(String name)
```

### Unshared durable subscriptions

Like a shared durable subscription, an unshared durable subscription is used when all the messages published on a topic are to be received and processed by an application, regardless of whether the application is actively consuming from the subscription.

However, since this is an unshared subscription, only the application that created the subscription can receive from it.

To create an unshared durable subscription, use the below methods from `JMSContext` class - 

```java
JMSConsumer createDurableConsumer(Topic topic, String name)

JMSConsumer createDurableConsumer(Topic topic, String name, String messageSelector, boolean noLocal)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `noLocal` feature is currently unsupported and ignored.
>

The unshared durable subscription continues to exist unless deleted using the `unsubscribe` method on the `JMSContext` class.

```java
void unsubscribe(String name)
```

### Shared non-durable subscriptions

A shared non-durable subscription is used when multiple client applications need to receive and process messages from a single subscription, only until they are actively consuming/receiving from it.

Since the subscription is not durable, it is not persisted. Messages are not received by this subscription when there are no active consumers on it.

To create a shared non-durable subscription, create a `JmsConsumer` as shown in the below methods from the `JMSContext` class -

```java
JMSConsumer createSharedConsumer(Topic topic, String sharedSubscriptionName)

JMSConsumer createSharedConsumer(Topic topic, String sharedSubscriptionName, String messageSelector)
```

The shared non-durable subscription continues to exist until there are active consumers receiving from it.

### Unshared non-durable subscriptions

An unshared non-durable subscription is used when the client application needs to receive and process message from a subscription, only until it is actively consuming from it. Only one consumer can exist on this subscription, that is, the client that created the subscription.

Since the subscription is not durable, it is not persisted. Messages are not received by this subscription when there is no active consumer on it.

To create an unshared non-durable subscription, create a `JMSConsumer` as shown in the below methods from the `JMSContext` class -

```java
JMSConsumer createConsumer(Destination destination)

JMSConsumer createConsumer(Destination destination, String messageSelector)

JMSConsumer createConsumer(Destination destination, String messageSelector, boolean noLocal)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `noLocal` feature is currently unsupported and ignored.
>

The unshared non-durable subscription continues to exist until there is an active consumer receiving from it.

### Message selectors

Just like **Filters and Actions** exist for regular Service Bus subscriptions, **Message Selectors** exist for JMS Subscriptions.

Message selectors can be set up on each of the JMS subscriptions and exist as a filter condition on the message header properties. Only messages with header properties matching the message selector expression are delivered. A value of null or an empty string indicates that there is no message selector for the JMS Subscription/Consumer.

## Additional concepts for Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0 subscriptions

### Client scoping

Subscriptions, as specified in the Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0 API, may or may not be *scoped to specific client application/s* (identified with the appropriate `clientId`).

Once the subscription is scoped, it **can only be accessed** from client applications that have the same client id. 

Any attempts to access a subscription scoped to a specific client ID (say clientId1) from an application having another client ID (say clientId2) will lead to the creation of another subscription scoped to the other client ID (clientId2).

> [!NOTE]
> Client ID can be null or empty, but it must match the client ID set on the JMS client application. From the Azure Service Bus perspective, a null client ID and an empty client id have the same behavior.
>
> If the client ID is set to null or empty, it is only accessible to client applications whose client ID is also set to null or empty.
>

### Shareability

**Shared** subscriptions permit multiple client/consumer (that is, JMSConsumer objects) to receive messages from them.

>[!NOTE]
> Shared subscriptions scoped to a specific client ID can still be accessed by multiple client/consumers (i.e. JMSConsumer objects), but each of the client applications must have the same client ID.
>
 

**Unshared** subscriptions permit only a single client/consumer (that is, JMSConsumer object) to receive messages from them. If a `JMSConsumer` is created on an unshared subscription while it already has an active `JMSConsumer` listening to messages on it, a `JMSException` is thrown.


### Durability

**Durable** subscriptions are persisted and continue to collect messages from the topic, irrespective of whether an application (`JMSConsumer`) is consuming messages from it.

**Non-durable** subscriptions are not-persisted and collect messages from the topic as long as an application (`JMSConsumer`) is consuming messages from it. 

## Representation of client scoped subscriptions

Given that the client scoped (JMS) subscriptions must co-exist with the existing [subscriptions](service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#topics-and-subscriptions), the way the client scoped (JMS) subscriptions are represented follow the below format.

   * **\<SUBSCRIPTION-NAME\>**$**\<CLIENT-ID\>**$**D** (for durable subscriptions)
   * **\<SUBSCRIPTION-NAME\>**$**\<CLIENT-ID\>**$**ND** (for non-durable subscriptions)

Here, **$** is the delimiter.
