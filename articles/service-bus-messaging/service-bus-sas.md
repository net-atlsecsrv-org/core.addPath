# Service Bus access control with Shared Access Signatures

*Shared Access Signatures* (SAS) are the primary security mechanism for Service Bus messaging. This article discusses SAS, how they work, and how to use them in a platform-agnostic way.

SAS guards access to Service Bus based on authorization rules. Those are configured either on a namespace, or a messaging entity (relay, queue, or topic). An authorization rule has a name, is associated with specific rights, and carries a pair of cryptographic keys. You use the rule's name and key via the Service Bus SDK or in your own code to generate a SAS token. A client can then pass the token to Service Bus to prove authorization for the requested operation.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Service Bus supports authorizing access to a Service Bus namespace and its entities using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Authorizing users or applications using OAuth 2.0 token returned by Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over shared access signatures (SAS). With Azure AD, there is no need to store the tokens in your code and risk potential security vulnerabilities.
>
> Microsoft recommends using Azure AD with your Azure Service Bus applications when possible. For more information, see the following articles:
> - [Authenticate and authorize an application with Azure Active Directory to access Azure Service Bus entities](authenticate-application.md).
> - [Authenticate a managed identity with Azure Active Directory to access Azure Service Bus resources](service-bus-managed-service-identity.md)

## Overview of SAS

Shared Access Signatures are a claims-based authorization mechanism using simple tokens. Using SAS, keys are never passed on the wire. Keys are used to cryptographically sign information that can later be verified by the service. SAS can be used similar to a username and password scheme where the client is in immediate possession of an authorization rule name and a matching key. SAS can also be used similar to a federated security model, where the client receives a time-limited and signed access token from a security token service without ever coming into possession of the signing key.

SAS authentication in Service Bus is configured with named [Shared Access Authorization Rules](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) having associated access rights, and a pair of primary and secondary cryptographic keys. The keys are 256-bit values in Base64 representation. You can configure rules at the namespace level, on Service Bus [relays](../azure-relay/relay-what-is-it.md), [queues](service-bus-messaging-overview.md#queues), and [topics](service-bus-messaging-overview.md#topics).

The [Shared Access Signature](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.sharedaccesssignaturetokenprovider) token contains the name of the chosen authorization rule, the URI of the resource that shall be accessed, an expiry instant, and an HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic signature computed over these fields using either the primary or the secondary cryptographic key of the chosen authorization rule.

## Shared Access Authorization Policies

Each Service Bus namespace and each Service Bus entity has a Shared Access Authorization policy made up of rules. The policy at the namespace level applies to all entities inside the namespace, irrespective of their individual policy configuration.

For each authorization policy rule, you decide on three pieces of information: **name**, **scope**, and **rights**. The **name** is just that; a unique name within that scope. The scope is easy enough: it's the URI of the resource in question. For a Service Bus namespace, the scope is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as `https://<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net/`.

The rights conferred by the policy rule can be a combination of:

* 'Send' - Confers the right to send messages to the entity
* 'Listen' - Confers the right to listen (relay) or receive (queue, subscriptions) and all related message handling
* 'Manage' - Confers the right to manage the topology of the namespace, including creating and deleting entities

The 'Manage' right includes the 'Send' and 'Receive' rights.

A namespace or entity policy can hold up to 12 Shared Access Authorization rules, providing room for three sets of rules, each covering the basic rights and the combination of Send and Listen. This limit underlines that the SAS policy store is not intended to be a user or service account store. If your application needs to grant access to Service Bus based on user or service identities, it should implement a security token service that issues SAS tokens after an authentication and access check.

An authorization rule is assigned a *Primary Key* and a *Secondary Key*. These are cryptographically strong keys. Don't lose them or leak them - they'll always be available in the [Azure portal][Azure portal]. You can use either of the generated keys, and you can regenerate them at any time. If you regenerate or change a key in the policy, all previously issued tokens based on that key become instantly invalid. However, ongoing connections created based on such tokens will continue to work until the token expires.

When you create a Service Bus namespace, a policy rule named **RootManageSharedAccessKey** is automatically created for the namespace. This policy has Manage permissions for the entire namespace. It's recommended that you treat this rule like an administrative **root** account and don't use it in your application. You can create additional policy rules in the **Configure** tab for the namespace in the portal, via PowerShell or Azure CLI.

## Configuration for Shared Access Signature authentication

You can configure the [SharedAccessAuthorizationRule](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) rule on Service Bus namespaces, queues, or topics. Configuring a [SharedAccessAuthorizationRule](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) on a Service Bus subscription is currently not supported, but you can use rules configured on a namespace or topic to secure access to subscriptions. For a working sample that illustrates this procedure, see the [Using Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication with Service Bus Subscriptions](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Using-Shared-Access-e605b37c) sample.

![SAS](./media/service-bus-sas/service-bus-namespace.png)

In this figure, the *manageRuleNS*, *sendRuleNS*, and *listenRuleNS* authorization rules apply to both queue Q1 and topic T1, while *listenRuleQ* and *sendRuleQ* apply only to queue Q1 and *sendRuleT* applies only to topic T1.

## Generate a Shared Access Signature token

Any client that has access to name of an authorization rule name and one of its signing keys can generate a SAS token. The token is generated by crafting a string in the following format:

```
SharedAccessSignature sig=<signature-string>&se=<expiry>&skn=<keyName>&sr=<URL-encoded-resourceURI>
```

* **`se`** - Token expiry instant. Integer reflecting seconds since the epoch `00:00:00 UTC` on 1 January 1970 (UNIX epoch) when the token expires.
* **`skn`** - Name of the authorization rule.
* **`sr`** - URI of the resource being accessed.
* **`sig`** - Signature.

The `signature-string` is the SHA-256 hash computed over the resource URI (**scope** as described in the previous section) and the string representation of the token expiry instant, separated by LF.

The hash computation looks similar to the following pseudo code and returns a 256-bit/32-byte hash value.

```
SHA-256('https://<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net/'+'\n'+ 1438205742)
```

The token contains the non-hashed values so that the recipient can recompute the hash with the same parameters, verifying that the issuer is in possession of a valid signing key.

The resource URI is the full URI of the Service Bus resource to which access is claimed. For example, `http://<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net/<entityPath>` or `sb://<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net/<entityPath>`; that is, `http://contoso.servicebus.windows.net/contosoTopics/T1/Subscriptions/S3`. 

**The URI must be [percent-encoded](/dotnet/api/system.web.httputility.urlencode?view=netcore-3.1).**

The shared access authorization rule used for signing must be configured on the entity specified by this URI, or by one of its hierarchical parents. For example, `http://contoso.servicebus.windows.net/contosoTopics/T1` or `http://contoso.servicebus.windows.net` in the previous example.

A SAS token is valid for all resources prefixed with the `<resourceURI>` used in the `signature-string`.

> [!NOTE]
> For examples of generating a SAS token using different programming languages, see [Generate SAS token](/rest/api/eventhub/generate-sas-token). 

## Regenerating keys

It is recommended that you periodically regenerate the keys used in the [SharedAccessAuthorizationRule](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) object. The primary and secondary key slots exist so that you can rotate keys gradually. If your application generally uses the primary key, you can copy the primary key into the secondary key slot, and only then regenerate the primary key. The new primary key value can then be configured into the client applications, which have continued access using the old primary key in the secondary slot. Once all clients are updated, you can regenerate the secondary key to finally retire the old primary key.

If you know or suspect that a key is compromised and you have to revoke the keys, you can regenerate both the [PrimaryKey](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) and the [SecondaryKey](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) of a [SharedAccessAuthorizationRule](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule), replacing them with new keys. This procedure invalidates all tokens signed with the old keys.

## Shared Access Signature authentication with Service Bus

The scenarios described as follows include configuration of authorization rules, generation of SAS tokens, and client authorization.

For a full working sample of a Service Bus application that illustrates the configuration and uses SAS authorization, see [Shared Access Signature authentication with Service Bus](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Shared-Access-Signature-0a88adf8). A related sample that illustrates the use of SAS authorization rules configured on namespaces or topics to secure Service Bus subscriptions is available here: [Using Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication with Service Bus Subscriptions](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Using-Shared-Access-e605b37c).

## Access Shared Access Authorization rules on an entity

With Service Bus .NET Framework libraries, you can access a [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.SharedAccessAuthorizationRule](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule) object configured on a Service Bus queue or topic through the [AuthorizationRules](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.authorizationrules) collection in the corresponding [QueueDescription](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.queuedescription) or [TopicDescription](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.topicdescription).

The following code shows how to add authorization rules for a queue.

```csharp
// Create an instance of NamespaceManager for the operation
NamespaceManager nsm = NamespaceManager.CreateFromConnectionString(
    <connectionString> );
QueueDescription qd = new QueueDescription( <qPath> );

// Create a rule with send rights with keyName as "contosoQSendKey"
// and add it to the queue description.
qd.Authorization.Add(new SharedAccessAuthorizationRule("contosoSendKey",
    SharedAccessAuthorizationRule.GenerateRandomKey(),
    new[] { AccessRights.Send }));

// Create a rule with listen rights with keyName as "contosoQListenKey"
// and add it to the queue description.
qd.Authorization.Add(new SharedAccessAuthorizationRule("contosoQListenKey",
    SharedAccessAuthorizationRule.GenerateRandomKey(),
    new[] { AccessRights.Listen }));

// Create a rule with manage rights with keyName as "contosoQManageKey"
// and add it to the queue description.
// A rule with manage rights must also have send and receive rights.
qd.Authorization.Add(new SharedAccessAuthorizationRule("contosoQManageKey",
    SharedAccessAuthorizationRule.GenerateRandomKey(),
    new[] {AccessRights.Manage, AccessRights.Listen, AccessRights.Send }));

// Create the queue.
nsm.CreateQueue(qd);
```

## Use Shared Access Signature authorization

Applications using the Azure .NET SDK with the Service Bus .NET libraries can use SAS authorization through the [SharedAccessSignatureTokenProvider](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.sharedaccesssignaturetokenprovider) class. The following code illustrates the use of the token provider to send messages to a Service Bus queue. Alternative to the usage shown here, you can also pass a previously issued token to the token provider factory method.

```csharp
Uri runtimeUri = ServiceBusEnvironment.CreateServiceUri("sb",
    <yourServiceNamespace>, string.Empty);
MessagingFactory mf = MessagingFactory.Create(runtimeUri,
    TokenProvider.CreateSharedAccessSignatureTokenProvider(keyName, key));
QueueClient sendClient = mf.CreateQueueClient(qPath);

//Sending hello message to queue.
BrokeredMessage helloMessage = new BrokeredMessage("Hello, Service Bus!");
helloMessage.MessageId = "SAS-Sample-Message";
sendClient.Send(helloMessage);
```

You can also use the token provider directly for issuing tokens to pass to other clients.

Connection strings can include a rule name (*SharedAccessKeyName*) and rule key (*SharedAccessKey*) or a previously issued token (*SharedAccessSignature*). When those are present in the connection string passed to any constructor or factory method accepting a connection string, the SAS token provider is automatically created and populated.

Note that to use SAS authorization with Service Bus relays, you can use SAS keys configured on the Service Bus namespace. If you explicitly create a relay on the namespace ([NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) with a [RelayDescription](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.relaydescription)) object, you can set the SAS rules just for that relay. To use SAS authorization with Service Bus subscriptions, you can use SAS keys configured on a Service Bus namespace or on a topic.

## Use the Shared Access Signature (at HTTP level)

Now that you know how to create Shared Access Signatures for any entities in Service Bus, you are ready to perform an HTTP POST:

```http
POST https://<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net/<yourentity>/messages
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: SharedAccessSignature sr=https%3A%2F%2F<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net%2F<yourentity>&sig=<yoursignature from code above>&se=1438205742&skn=KeyName
ContentType: application/atom+xml;type=entry;charset=utf-8
```

Remember, this works for everything. You can create SAS for a queue, topic, or subscription.

If you give a sender or client a SAS token, they don't have the key directly, and they cannot reverse the hash to obtain it. As such, you have control over what they can access, and for how long. An important thing to remember is that if you change the primary key in the policy, any Shared Access Signatures created from it are invalidated.

## Use the Shared Access Signature (at AMQP level)

In the previous section, you saw how to use the SAS token with an HTTP POST request for sending data to the Service Bus. As you know, you can access Service Bus using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) that is the preferred protocol to use for performance reasons, in many scenarios. The SAS token usage with AMQP is described in the document [AMQP Claim-Based Security Version 1.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/50506/amqp-cbs-v1%200-wd02%202013-08-12.doc) that is in working draft since 2013 but it's supported by Azure today.

Before starting to send data to Service Bus, the publisher must send the SAS token inside an AMQP message to a well-defined AMQP node named **$cbs** (you can see it as a "special" queue used by the service to acquire and validate all the SAS tokens). The publisher must specify the **ReplyTo** field inside the AMQP message; this is the node in which the service replies to the publisher with the result of the token validation (a simple request/reply pattern between publisher and service). This reply node is created "on the fly," speaking about "dynamic creation of remote node" as described by the AMQP 1.0 specification. After checking that the SAS token is valid, the publisher can go forward and start to send data to the service.

The following steps show how to send the SAS token with AMQP protocol using the [AMQP.NET Lite](https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite) library. This is useful if you can't use the official Service Bus SDK (for example on WinRT, .NET Compact Framework, .NET Micro Framework and Mono) developing in C\#. Of course, this library is useful to help understand how claims-based security works at the AMQP level, as you saw how it works at the HTTP level (with an HTTP POST request and the SAS token sent inside the "Authorization" header). If you don't need such deep knowledge about AMQP, you can use the official Service Bus SDK with .NET Framework applications, which will do it for you.

### C&#35;

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Send claim-based security (CBS) token
/// </summary>
/// <param name="shareAccessSignature">Shared access signature (token) to send</param>
private bool PutCbsToken(Connection connection, string sasToken)
{
    bool result = true;
    Session session = new Session(connection);

    string cbsClientAddress = "cbs-client-reply-to";
    var cbsSender = new SenderLink(session, "cbs-sender", "$cbs");
    var cbsReceiver = new ReceiverLink(session, cbsClientAddress, "$cbs");

    // construct the put-token message
    var request = new Message(sasToken);
    request.Properties = new Properties();
    request.Properties.MessageId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    request.Properties.ReplyTo = cbsClientAddress;
    request.ApplicationProperties = new ApplicationProperties();
    request.ApplicationProperties["operation"] = "put-token";
    request.ApplicationProperties["type"] = "servicebus.windows.net:sastoken";
    request.ApplicationProperties["name"] = Fx.Format("amqp://{0}/{1}", sbNamespace, entity);
    cbsSender.Send(request);

    // receive the response
    var response = cbsReceiver.Receive();
    if (response == null || response.Properties == null || response.ApplicationProperties == null)
    {
        result = false;
    }
    else
    {
        int statusCode = (int)response.ApplicationProperties["status-code"];
        if (statusCode != (int)HttpStatusCode.Accepted && statusCode != (int)HttpStatusCode.OK)
        {
            result = false;
        }
    }

    // the sender/receiver may be kept open for refreshing tokens
    cbsSender.Close();
    cbsReceiver.Close();
    session.Close();

    return result;
}
```

The `PutCbsToken()` method receives the *connection* (AMQP connection class instance as provided by the [AMQP .NET Lite library](https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite)) that represents the TCP connection to the service and the *sasToken* parameter that is the SAS token to send.

> [!NOTE]
> It's important that the connection is created with **SASL authentication mechanism set to ANONYMOUS** (and not the default PLAIN with username and password used when you don't need to send the SAS token).
>
>

Next, the publisher creates two AMQP links for sending the SAS token and receiving the reply (the token validation result) from the service.

The AMQP message contains a set of properties, and more information than a simple message. The SAS token is the body of the message (using its constructor). The **"ReplyTo"** property is set to the node name for receiving the validation result on the receiver link (you can change its name if you want, and it will be created dynamically by the service). The last three application/custom properties are used by the service to indicate what kind of operation it has to execute. As described by the CBS draft specification, they must be the **operation name** ("put-token"), the **type of token** (in this case, a `servicebus.windows.net:sastoken`), and the **"name" of the audience** to which the token applies (the entire entity).

After sending the SAS token on the sender link, the publisher must read the reply on the receiver link. The reply is a simple AMQP message with an application property named **"status-code"** that can contain the same values as an HTTP status code.
