# How to use the Java Message Service (JMS) API with Service Bus and AMQP 1.0
The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) 1.0 is an efficient, reliable, wire-level messaging protocol that you can use to build robust, cross-platform messaging applications.

Support for AMQP 1.0 in Service Bus means that you can use the queuing and publish/subscribe brokered messaging features from a range of platforms using an efficient binary protocol. Furthermore, you can build applications comprised of components built using a mix of languages, frameworks, and operating systems.

This article explains how to use Service Bus messaging features (queues and publish/subscribe topics) from Java applications using the popular Java Message Service (JMS) API standard. There is a [companion article](service-bus-amqp-dotnet.md) that explains how to do the same using the Service Bus .NET API. You can use these two guides together to learn about cross-platform messaging using AMQP 1.0.

## Get started with Service Bus
This guide assumes that you already have a Service Bus namespace containing a queue named **basicqueue**. If you do not, then you can [create the namespace and queue](service-bus-create-namespace-portal.md) using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For more information about how to create Service Bus namespaces and queues, see [Get started with Service Bus queues](service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Partitioned queues and topics also support AMQP. For more information, see [Partitioned messaging entities](service-bus-partitioning.md) and [AMQP 1.0 support for Service Bus partitioned queues and topics](service-bus-partitioned-queues-and-topics-amqp-overview.md).

## Downloading the AMQP 1.0 JMS client library
For information about where to download the latest version of the Apache Qpid JMS AMQP 1.0 client library, visit [https://qpid.apache.org/download.html](https://qpid.apache.org/download.html).

You must add the following four JAR files from the Apache Qpid JMS AMQP 1.0 distribution archive to the Java CLASSPATH when building and running JMS applications with Service Bus:

* geronimo-jms\_1.1\_spec-1.0.jar
* qpid-jms-client-[version].jar

> [!NOTE]
> JMS JAR names and versions may have changed. For details, see [Qpid JMS - AMQP 1.0](https://qpid.apache.org/maven.html#qpid-jms-amqp-10).

## Coding Java applications
### Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
JMS uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to create a separation between logical names and physical names. Two types of JMS objects are resolved using JNDI: ConnectionFactory and Destination. JNDI uses a provider model into which you can plug different directory services to handle name resolution duties. The Apache Qpid JMS AMQP 1.0 library comes with a simple properties file-based JNDI Provider that is configured using a properties file of the following format:

```TEXT
# servicebus.properties - sample JNDI configuration

# Register a ConnectionFactory in JNDI using the form:
# connectionfactory.[jndi_name] = [ConnectionURL]
connectionfactory.SBCF = amqps://[SASPolicyName]:[SASPolicyKey]@[namespace].servicebus.windows.net

# Register some queues in JNDI using the form
# queue.[jndi_name] = [physical_name]
# topic.[jndi_name] = [physical_name]
queue.QUEUE = queue1
```

#### Setup JNDI context and Configure the ConnectionFactory

The **ConnectionString** referenced in the one available in the 'Shared Access Policies' in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **Primary Connection String**
```java
// The connection string builder is the only part of the azure-servicebus SDK library
// we use in this JMS sample and for the purpose of robustly parsing the Service Bus 
// connection string. 
ConnectionStringBuilder csb = new ConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString);
        
// set up JNDI context
Hashtable<String, String> hashtable = new Hashtable<>();
hashtable.put("connectionfactory.SBCF", "amqps://" + csb.getEndpoint().getHost() + "?amqp.idleTimeout=120000&amqp.traceFrames=true");
hashtable.put("queue.QUEUE", "BasicQueue");
hashtable.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.apache.qpid.jms.jndi.JmsInitialContextFactory");
Context context = new InitialContext(hashtable);

ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup("SBCF");

// Look up queue
Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup("QUEUE");
```

#### Configure Producer and Consumer Destination Queues
The entry used to define a destination in the Qpid properties file JNDI provider is of the following format:

To create the destination queue for the Producer - 
```java
String queueName = "queueName";
Destination queue = (Destination) queueName;

ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup("SBCF");
Connection connection - cf.createConnection(csb.getSasKeyName(), csb.getSasKey());

Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE);

// Create Producer
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);
```

To create a destination queue for the Consumer - 
```java
String queueName = "queueName";
Destination queue = (Destination) queueName;

ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup("SBCF");
Connection connection - cf.createConnection(csb.getSasKeyName(), csb.getSasKey());

Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE);

// Create Consumer
MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue);
```

### Write the JMS application
There are no special APIs or options required when using JMS with Service Bus. However, there are a few restrictions that will be covered later. As with any JMS application, the first thing required is configuration of the JNDI environment, to be able to resolve a **ConnectionFactory** and destinations.

#### Configure the JNDI InitialContext
The JNDI environment is configured by passing a hashtable of configuration information into the constructor of the javax.naming.InitialContext class. The two required elements in the hashtable are the class name of the Initial Context Factory and the Provider URL. The following code shows how to configure the JNDI environment to use the Qpid properties file based JNDI Provider with a properties file named **servicebus.properties**.

```java
// set up JNDI context
Hashtable<String, String> hashtable = new Hashtable<>();
hashtable.put("connectionfactory.SBCF", "amqps://" + csb.getEndpoint().getHost() + \
"?amqp.idleTimeout=120000&amqp.traceFrames=true");
hashtable.put("queue.QUEUE", "BasicQueue");
hashtable.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.apache.qpid.jms.jndi.JmsInitialContextFactory");
Context context = new InitialContext(hashtable);
``` 

### A simple JMS application using a Service Bus queue
The following example program sends JMS TextMessages to a Service Bus queue with the JNDI logical name of QUEUE, and receives the messages back.

## AMQP disposition and Service Bus operation mapping
Here is how an AMQP disposition translates to a Service Bus operation:

```Output
ACCEPTED = 1; -> Complete()
REJECTED = 2; -> DeadLetter()
RELEASED = 3; (just unlock the message in service bus, will then get redelivered)
MODIFIED_FAILED = 4; -> Abandon() which increases delivery count
MODIFIED_FAILED_UNDELIVERABLE = 5; -> Defer()
```

## JMS Topics vs. Service Bus Topics
Using Azure Service Bus topics and subscriptions through the Java Message Service (JMS) API provides basic send and receive capabilities. It's a convenient choice when porting applications from other message brokers with JMS compliant APIs, even though Service Bus topics differ from JMS Topics and require a few adjustments. 

Azure Service Bus topics route messages into named, shared, durable subscriptions that are managed through the Azure Resource Management interface, the Azure command line tools, or through the Azure portal. Each subscription allows for up to 2000 selection rules, each of which may have a filter condition and, for SQL filters, also a metadata transformation action. Each filter condition match selects the input message to be copied into tehj subscription.  

Receiving messages from subscriptions is identical receiving messages from queues. Each subscription has an associated dead-letter queue as well as the ability to automatically forward messages to another queue or topics. 

JMS Topics allow clients to dynamically create nondurable and durable subscribers that optionally allow filtering  messages with message selectors. These unshared entities are not supported by Service Bus. The SQL filter rule syntax for Service Bus is, however, very similar to the message selector syntax supported by JMS. 

The JMS Topic publisher side is compatible with Service Bus, as shown in this sample, but dynamic subscribers are not. The following topology-related JMS APIs are not supported with Service Bus. 

## Unsupported features and restrictions
The following restrictions exist when using JMS over AMQP 1.0 with Service Bus, namely:

* Only one **MessageProducer** or **MessageConsumer** is allowed per **Session**. If you need to create multiple **MessageProducers** or **MessageConsumers** in an application, create a dedicated **Session** for each of them.
* Volatile topic subscriptions are not currently supported.
* **MessageSelectors** are not currently supported.
* Transacted sessions and distributed transactions are not supported.

Additionally, Azure Service Bus splits the control plane from the data plane and therefore does not support several of
JMS's dynamic topology functions:

| Unsupported method          | Replace with                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| createDurableSubscriber     | create a Topic subscription porting the message selector                                 |
| createDurableConsumer       | create a Topic subscription porting the message selector                                 |
| createSharedConsumer        | Service Bus topics are always shareable, see above                                       |
| createSharedDurableConsumer | Service Bus topics are always shareable, see above                                       |
| createTemporaryTopic        | create a topic via management API/tools/portal with *AutoDeleteOnIdle* set to an expiration period |
| createTopic                 | create a topic via management API/tools/portal                                           |
| unsubscribe                 | delete the topic management API/tools/portal                                             |
| createBrowser               | unsupported. Use the Peek() functionality of the Service Bus API                         |
| createQueue                 | create a queue via management API/tools/portal                                           | 
| createTemporaryQueue        | create a queue via management API/tools/portal with *AutoDeleteOnIdle* set to an expiration period |
| receiveNoWait               | utilize the receive() method provided by the Service Bus SDK and specify a very low or zero timeout |

## Summary
This how-to guide showed how to use Service Bus brokered messaging features (queues and publish/subscribe topics) from Java using the popular JMS API and AMQP 1.0.

You can also use Service Bus AMQP 1.0 from other languages, including .NET, C, Python, and PHP. Components built using these different languages can exchange messages reliably and at full fidelity using the AMQP 1.0 support in Service Bus.
