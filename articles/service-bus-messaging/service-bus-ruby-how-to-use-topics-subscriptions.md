# Quickstart: How to use Service Bus topics and subscriptions with Ruby
 
[!INCLUDE [service-bus-selector-topics](../../includes/service-bus-selector-topics.md)]

This article describes how to use Service Bus topics and subscriptions from Ruby applications. The scenarios covered include:

- Creating topics and subscriptions 
- Creating subscription filters 
- Sending messages to a topic 
- Receiving messages from a subscription
- Deleting topics and subscriptions


## Prerequisites
1. An Azure subscription. To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. You can activate your [Visual Studio or MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A85619ABF) or sign-up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A85619ABF).
2. Follow steps in the [Quickstart: Use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus topic and subscriptions to the topic](service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal.md) to create a Service Bus **namespace** and get the **connection string**. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > You will create a **topic** and a **subscription** to the topic by using **Ruby** in this quickstart. 

[!INCLUDE [service-bus-ruby-setup](../../includes/service-bus-ruby-setup.md)]

## Create a topic
The **Azure::ServiceBusService** object enables you to work with topics. The following code creates an **Azure::ServiceBusService** object. To create a topic, use the `create_topic()` method. The following example creates a topic or prints out any errors.

```ruby
azure_service_bus_service = Azure::ServiceBus::ServiceBusService.new(sb_host, { signer: signer})
begin
  topic = azure_service_bus_service.create_topic("test-topic")
rescue
  puts $!
end
```

You can also pass an **Azure::ServiceBus::Topic** object with additional options, which enable you to override default topic settings such as message time to live or maximum queue size. The following example shows setting the maximum queue size to 5 GB and time to live to 1 minute:

```ruby
topic = Azure::ServiceBus::Topic.new("test-topic")
topic.max_size_in_megabytes = 5120
topic.default_message_time_to_live = "PT1M"

topic = azure_service_bus_service.create_topic(topic)
```

## Create subscriptions
Topic subscriptions are also created with the **Azure::ServiceBusService** object. Subscriptions are named and can have an optional filter that restricts the set of messages delivered to the subscription's virtual queue.

By default, subscriptions are persistent. They continue to exist until either they, or the topic they are associated with, are deleted. If your application contains logic to create a subscription, it should first check if the subscription already exists by using the getSubscription method.

You can have the subscriptions automatically deleted by setting the [AutoDeleteOnIdle property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptiondescription.autodeleteonidle).

### Create a subscription with the default (MatchAll) filter
If no filter is specified when a new subscription is created, the **MatchAll** filter (default) is used. When the **MatchAll** filter is used, all messages published to the topic are placed in the subscription's virtual queue. The following example creates a subscription named "all-messages" and uses the default **MatchAll** filter.

```ruby
subscription = azure_service_bus_service.create_subscription("test-topic", "all-messages")
```

### Create subscriptions with filters
You can also define filters that enable you to specify which messages sent to a topic should show up within a specific subscription.

The most flexible type of filter supported by subscriptions is the **Azure::ServiceBus::SqlFilter**, which implements a subset of SQL92. SQL filters operate on the properties of the messages that are published to the topic. For more details about the expressions that can be used with a SQL filter, review the [SqlFilter](service-bus-messaging-sql-filter.md) syntax.

You can add filters to a subscription by using the `create_rule()` method of the **Azure::ServiceBusService** object. This method enables you to add new filters to an existing subscription.

Since the default filter is applied automatically to all new subscriptions, you must first remove the default filter, or the **MatchAll** overrides any other filters you may specify. You can remove the default rule by using the `delete_rule()` method on the **Azure::ServiceBusService** object.

The following example creates a subscription named "high-messages" with an **Azure::ServiceBus::SqlFilter** that only selects messages that have a custom `message_number` property greater than 3:

```ruby
subscription = azure_service_bus_service.create_subscription("test-topic", "high-messages")
azure_service_bus_service.delete_rule("test-topic", "high-messages", "$Default")

rule = Azure::ServiceBus::Rule.new("high-messages-rule")
rule.topic = "test-topic"
rule.subscription = "high-messages"
rule.filter = Azure::ServiceBus::SqlFilter.new({
  :sql_expression => "message_number > 3" })
rule = azure_service_bus_service.create_rule(rule)
```

Similarly, the following example creates a subscription named `low-messages` with an **Azure::ServiceBus::SqlFilter** that only selects messages that have a `message_number` property less than or equal to 3:

```ruby
subscription = azure_service_bus_service.create_subscription("test-topic", "low-messages")
azure_service_bus_service.delete_rule("test-topic", "low-messages", "$Default")

rule = Azure::ServiceBus::Rule.new("low-messages-rule")
rule.topic = "test-topic"
rule.subscription = "low-messages"
rule.filter = Azure::ServiceBus::SqlFilter.new({
  :sql_expression => "message_number <= 3" })
rule = azure_service_bus_service.create_rule(rule)
```

When a message is now sent to `test-topic`, it is always be delivered to receivers subscribed to the `all-messages` topic subscription, and selectively delivered to receivers subscribed to the `high-messages` and `low-messages` topic subscriptions (depending upon the message content).

## Send messages to a topic
To send a message to a Service Bus topic, your application must use the `send_topic_message()` method on the **Azure::ServiceBusService** object. Messages sent to Service Bus topics are instances of the **Azure::ServiceBus::BrokeredMessage** objects. **Azure::ServiceBus::BrokeredMessage** objects have a set of standard properties (such as `label` and `time_to_live`), a dictionary that is used to hold custom application-specific properties, and a body of string data. An application can set the body of the message by passing a string value to the `send_topic_message()` method and any required standard properties are populated by default values.

The following example demonstrates how to send five test messages to `test-topic`. The `message_number` custom property value of each message varies on the iteration of the loop (it determines which subscription receives it):

```ruby
5.times do |i|
  message = Azure::ServiceBus::BrokeredMessage.new("test message " + i,
    { :message_number => i })
  azure_service_bus_service.send_topic_message("test-topic", message)
end
```

Service Bus topics support a maximum message size of 256 KB in the [Standard tier](service-bus-premium-messaging.md) and 1 MB in the [Premium tier](service-bus-premium-messaging.md). The header, which includes the standard and custom application properties, can have
a maximum size of 64 KB. There is no limit on the number of messages held in a topic but there is a cap on the total size of the messages held by a topic. This topic size is defined at creation time, with an upper limit of 5 GB.

## Receive messages from a subscription
Messages are received from a subscription using the `receive_subscription_message()` method on the **Azure::ServiceBusService** object. By default, messages are read(peak) and locked without deleting it from the subscription. You can read and delete the message from the subscription by setting the `peek_lock` option to **false**.

The default behavior makes the reading and deleting a two-stage operation, which also makes it possible to support applications that cannot tolerate missing messages. When Service Bus receives a request, it finds the next message to be consumed, locks it to prevent other consumers receiving it, and then returns it to the application. After the application finishes processing the message (or stores it reliably for future processing), it completes the second stage of the receive process by calling `delete_subscription_message()` method and providing the message to be deleted as a parameter. The `delete_subscription_message()` method marks the message as being consumed and remove it from the subscription.

If the `:peek_lock` parameter is set to **false**, reading, and deleting the message becomes the simplest model, and works best for scenarios in which an application can tolerate not processing a message when a failure occurs. Consider a scenario in which the consumer issues the receive request and then crashes before processing it. Because Service Bus has marked the message as being consumed, then when the application restarts and begins consuming messages again, it has missed the message that was consumed prior to the crash.

The following example demonstrates how messages can be received and processed using `receive_subscription_message()`. The example first receives and deletes a message from the `low-messages` subscription by using `:peek_lock` set to **false**, then it receives another message from the `high-messages` and then deletes the message using `delete_subscription_message()`:

```ruby
message = azure_service_bus_service.receive_subscription_message(
  "test-topic", "low-messages", { :peek_lock => false })
message = azure_service_bus_service.receive_subscription_message(
  "test-topic", "high-messages")
azure_service_bus_service.delete_subscription_message(message)
```

## How to handle application crashes and unreadable messages
Service Bus provides functionality to help you gracefully recover from errors in your application or difficulties processing a message. If a receiver application is unable to process the message for some reason, then it can call the `unlock_subscription_message()` method on the **Azure::ServiceBusService** object. It causes Service Bus to unlock the message within the subscription and make it available to be received again, either by the same consuming application or by another consuming application.

There is also a timeout associated with a message locked within the subscription, and if the application fails to process the message before the lock timeout expires (for example, if the application crashes), then Service Bus unlocks the message automatically and make it available to be received again.

In the event that the application crashes after processing the message but before the `delete_subscription_message()` method is called, then the message is redelivered to the application when it restarts. It is often called *at least once processing*; that is, each message is processed at least once but in certain situations the same message may be redelivered. If the scenario cannot tolerate duplicate processing, then application developers should add additional logic to their application to handle duplicate message delivery. This logic is often achieved using the `message_id` property of the message, which remains constant across delivery attempts.

## Delete topics and subscriptions
Topics and subscriptions are persistent unless the [AutoDeleteOnIdle property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptiondescription.autodeleteonidle) is set. They can be deleted either through the [Azure portal][Azure portal] or programmatically. The following example demonstrates how to delete the topic named `test-topic`.

```ruby
azure_service_bus_service.delete_topic("test-topic")
```

Deleting a topic also deletes any subscriptions that are registered with the topic. Subscriptions can also be deleted independently. The following code demonstrates how to delete the subscription named `high-messages` from the `test-topic` topic:

```ruby
azure_service_bus_service.delete_subscription("test-topic", "high-messages")
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can manage Service Bus resources with [Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer/). The Service Bus Explorer allows users to connect to a Service Bus namespace and administer messaging entities in an easy manner. The tool provides advanced features like import/export functionality or the ability to test topic, queues, subscriptions, relay services, notification hubs and events hubs.
