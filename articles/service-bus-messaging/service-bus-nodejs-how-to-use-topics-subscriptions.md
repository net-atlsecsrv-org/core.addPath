# Quickstart: How to Use Service Bus topics and subscriptions with Node.js and the azure-sb package
In this tutorial, you learn how to create Node.js applications to send messages to a Service Bus topic and receive messages from a Service Bus subscription using the [azure-sb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-sb) package. The samples are written in JavaScript and use the Node.js [Azure module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure) which internally uses the `azure-sb` package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [azure-sb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-sb) package uses [Service Bus REST run-time APIs](/rest/api/servicebus/service-bus-runtime-rest). You can get a faster experience using the new [@azure/service-bus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/service-bus) package which uses the faster [AMQP 1.0 protocol](service-bus-amqp-overview.md). 
> 
> To learn more about the new package, see [How to use Service Bus topics and subscriptions with Node.js and @azure/service-bus package](./service-bus-nodejs-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions-new-package.md), otherwise continue reading to see how to use the [azure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure) package.

The scenarios covered here include:

- Creating topics and subscriptions 
- Creating subscription filters 
- Sending messages to a topic 
- Receiving messages from a subscription
- Deleting topics and subscriptions 

For more information about topics and subscriptions, see [Next steps](#next-steps) section.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription. To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. You can activate your [Visual Studio or MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A85619ABF) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A85619ABF).
- Follow steps in the [Quickstart: Use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus topic and subscriptions to the topic](service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal.md) to create a Service Bus **namespace** and get the **connection string**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You will create a **topic** and a **subscription** to the topic by using **Node.js** in this quickstart. 

## Create a Node.js application
Create a blank Node.js application. For instructions on creating a Node.js application, see [Create and deploy a Node.js application to an Azure Web Site], [Node.js Cloud Service][Node.js Cloud Service] using Windows PowerShell, or Web Site with WebMatrix.

## Configure your application to use Service Bus
To use Service Bus, download the Node.js Azure package. This package includes a set of libraries that
communicate with the Service Bus REST services.

### Use Node Package Manager (NPM) to obtain the package
1. Open a command-line interface such as **PowerShell** (Windows), **Terminal** (Mac), or **Bash** (Unix).
2. Navigate to the folder where you created your sample application.
3. Type **npm install azure** in the command window, which should
   result in the following output:

   ```
       azure@0.7.5 node_modules\azure
   ├── dateformat@1.0.2-1.2.3
   ├── xmlbuilder@0.4.2
   ├── node-uuid@1.2.0
   ├── mime@1.2.9
   ├── underscore@1.4.4
   ├── validator@1.1.1
   ├── tunnel@0.0.2
   ├── wns@0.5.3
   ├── xml2js@0.2.7 (sax@0.5.2)
   └── request@2.21.0 (json-stringify-safe@4.0.0, forever-agent@0.5.0, aws-sign@0.3.0, tunnel-agent@0.3.0, oauth-sign@0.3.0, qs@0.6.5, cookie-jar@0.3.0, node-uuid@1.4.0, http-signature@0.9.11, form-data@0.0.8, hawk@0.13.1)
   ```
3. You can manually run the **ls** command to verify that a
   **node\_modules** folder was created. Inside that folder, find the
   **azure** package, which contains the libraries you need to access
   Service Bus topics.

### Import the module
Using Notepad or another text editor, add the following to the top of the **server.js** file of the application:

```javascript
var azure = require('azure');
```

### Set up a Service Bus connection
The Azure module reads the environment variable `AZURE_SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING` for the connection string that you obtained as part of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites). If you need instructions for getting the connection string again, see [Get the connection string](service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal.md#get-the-connection-string). If this environment variable is not set, you must specify the account information when calling `createServiceBusService`.

For an example of setting the environment variables for an Azure Cloud Service, see [Set environment variables](../container-instances/container-instances-environment-variables.md#azure-cli-example).



## Create a topic
The **ServiceBusService** object enables you to work with topics. The
following code creates a **ServiceBusService** object. Add it near the
top of the **server.js** file, after the statement to import the azure
module:

```javascript
var serviceBusService = azure.createServiceBusService();
```

If you call `createTopicIfNotExists` on the **ServiceBusService**
object, the specified topic is returned (if it exists), or a new
topic with the specified name is created. The following code uses
`createTopicIfNotExists` to create or connect to the topic named
`MyTopic`:

```javascript
serviceBusService.createTopicIfNotExists('MyTopic',function(error){
    if(!error){
        // Topic was created or exists
        console.log('topic created or exists.');
    }
});
```

The `createTopicIfNotExists` method also supports additional options, which
enable you to override default topic settings such as message time to
live or maximum topic size. 

The following example sets the maximum topic size to 5 GB with a time to live of one minute:

```javascript
var topicOptions = {
        MaxSizeInMegabytes: '5120',
        DefaultMessageTimeToLive: 'PT1M'
    };

serviceBusService.createTopicIfNotExists('MyTopic', topicOptions, function(error){
    if(!error){
        // topic was created or exists
    }
});
```

### Filters
Optional filtering operations can be applied to operations performed using **ServiceBusService**. Filtering operations can include logging, automatically retrying, etc. Filters are objects that implement a method with the signature:

```javascript
function handle (requestOptions, next)
```

After performing preprocessing on the request options, the method calls `next`, and passes a callback with the following signature:

```javascript
function (returnObject, finalCallback, next)
```

In this callback, and after processing the `returnObject` (the response from the request to the server), the callback must either invoke next (if it exists) to continue processing other filters, or invoke `finalCallback` to end the service invocation.

Two filters that implement retry logic are included with the Azure SDK for Node.js, **ExponentialRetryPolicyFilter** and **LinearRetryPolicyFilter**. The following code creates a **ServiceBusService** object that uses the **ExponentialRetryPolicyFilter**:

```javascript
var retryOperations = new azure.ExponentialRetryPolicyFilter();
var serviceBusService = azure.createServiceBusService().withFilter(retryOperations);
```

## Create subscriptions
Topic subscriptions are also created with the **ServiceBusService**
object. Subscriptions are named, and can have an optional filter that
restricts the set of messages delivered to the subscription's virtual
queue.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, subscriptions are persistent until
> either they, or the topic they are associated with, are deleted. If your
> application contains logic to create a subscription, it should first
> check if the subscription exists by using the
> `getSubscription` method.
>
> You can have the subscriptions automatically deleted by setting the [AutoDeleteOnIdle property](/javascript/api/@azure/arm-servicebus/sbsubscription?view=azure-node-latest#autodeleteonidle).

### Create a subscription with the default (MatchAll) filter
The **MatchAll** filter is the default filter used when a subscription is created. When you use the **MatchAll**
filter, all messages published to the topic are placed in the
subscription's virtual queue. The following example creates a
subscription named AllMessages and uses the default **MatchAll**
filter.

```javascript
serviceBusService.createSubscription('MyTopic','AllMessages',function(error){
    if(!error){
        // subscription created
    }
});
```

### Create subscriptions with filters
You can also create filters that allow you to scope which messages sent
to a topic should show up within a specific topic subscription.

The most flexible type of filter supported by subscriptions is the
**SqlFilter**, which implements a subset of SQL92. SQL filters operate
on the properties of the messages that are published to the topic. For
more details about the expressions that can be used with a SQL filter,
review the [SqlFilter.SqlExpression][SqlFilter.SqlExpression] syntax.

Filters can be added to a subscription by using the `createRule`
method of the **ServiceBusService** object. This method allows you to
add new filters to an existing subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the default filter is applied automatically to all new
> subscriptions, you must first remove the default filter or the
> **MatchAll** will override any other filters you may specify. You can
> remove the default rule by using the `deleteRule` method of the
> **ServiceBusService** object.
>
>

The following example creates a subscription named `HighMessages` with a
**SqlFilter** that only selects messages that have a custom `messagenumber` property greater than 3:

```javascript
serviceBusService.createSubscription('MyTopic', 'HighMessages', function (error){
    if(!error){
        // subscription created
        rule.create();
    }
});
var rule={
    deleteDefault: function(){
        serviceBusService.deleteRule('MyTopic',
            'HighMessages',
            azure.Constants.ServiceBusConstants.DEFAULT_RULE_NAME,
            rule.handleError);
    },
    create: function(){
        var ruleOptions = {
            sqlExpressionFilter: 'messagenumber > 3'
        };
        rule.deleteDefault();
        serviceBusService.createRule('MyTopic',
            'HighMessages',
            'HighMessageFilter',
            ruleOptions,
            rule.handleError);
    },
    handleError: function(error){
        if(error){
            console.log(error)
        }
    }
}
```

Similarly, the following example creates a subscription named
`LowMessages` with a **SqlFilter** that only selects messages that have
a `messagenumber` property less than or equal to 3:

```javascript
serviceBusService.createSubscription('MyTopic', 'LowMessages', function (error){
    if(!error){
        // subscription created
        rule.create();
    }
});
var rule={
    deleteDefault: function(){
        serviceBusService.deleteRule('MyTopic',
            'LowMessages',
            azure.Constants.ServiceBusConstants.DEFAULT_RULE_NAME,
            rule.handleError);
    },
    create: function(){
        var ruleOptions = {
            sqlExpressionFilter: 'messagenumber <= 3'
        };
        rule.deleteDefault();
        serviceBusService.createRule('MyTopic',
            'LowMessages',
            'LowMessageFilter',
            ruleOptions,
            rule.handleError);
    },
    handleError: function(error){
        if(error){
            console.log(error)
        }
    }
}
```

When a message is now sent to `MyTopic`, it is delivered to
receivers subscribed to the `AllMessages` topic subscription, and
selectively delivered to receivers subscribed to the `HighMessages` and
`LowMessages` topic subscriptions (depending upon the message content).

## How to send messages to a topic
To send a message to a Service Bus topic, your application must use the
`sendTopicMessage` method of the **ServiceBusService** object.
Messages sent to Service Bus topics are **BrokeredMessage** objects.
**BrokeredMessage** objects have a set of standard properties (such as
`Label` and `TimeToLive`), a dictionary that is used to hold custom
application-specific properties, and a body of string data. An
application can set the body of the message by passing a string value to
the `sendTopicMessage` and any required standard properties are populated by default values.

The following example demonstrates how to send five test messages to
`MyTopic`. The `messagenumber` property value of each
message varies on the iteration of the loop (this property determines which
subscriptions receive it):

```javascript
var message = {
    body: '',
    customProperties: {
        messagenumber: 0
    }
}

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    message.customProperties.messagenumber=i;
    message.body='This is Message #'+i;
    serviceBusService.sendTopicMessage(topic, message, function(error) {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error);
      }
    });
}
```

Service Bus topics support a maximum message size of 256 KB in the [Standard tier](service-bus-premium-messaging.md) and 1 MB in the [Premium tier](service-bus-premium-messaging.md). The header, which includes the standard and custom application properties, can have
a maximum size of 64 KB. There is no limit on the number of messages
held in a topic, but there is a limit on the total size of the messages
held by a topic. This topic size is defined at creation time, with an
upper limit of 5 GB.

## Receive messages from a subscription
Messages are received from a subscription using the
`receiveSubscriptionMessage` method on the **ServiceBusService**
object. By default, messages are deleted from the subscription as they
are read. However, you can set the optional parameter
`isPeekLock` to **true** to read (peek) and lock the message without
deleting it from the subscription.

The default behavior of reading and deleting the message as part of the
receive operation is the simplest model, and works best for scenarios in
which an application can tolerate not processing a message when there is a failure. To understand this behavior, consider a scenario in which the
consumer issues the receive request and then crashes before processing
it. Because Service Bus has marked the message as being consumed,
then when the application restarts and begins consuming messages again,
it has missed the message that was consumed prior to the crash.

If the `isPeekLock` parameter is set to **true**, the receive becomes
a two-stage operation, which makes it possible to support applications
that cannot tolerate missed messages. When Service Bus receives a
request, it finds the next message to consume, locks it to prevent
other consumers from receiving it, and returns it to the application.
After the application processes the message (or stores it
reliably for future processing), it completes the second stage of the
receive process by calling **deleteMessage** method, and passes the
message to delete as a parameter. The **deleteMessage** method marks the message as consumed and removes it from the subscription.

The following example demonstrates how messages can be received and
processed using `receiveSubscriptionMessage`. The example first
receives and deletes a message from the 'LowMessages' subscription, and
then receives a message from the 'HighMessages' subscription using
`isPeekLock` set to true. It then deletes the message using
`deleteMessage`:

```javascript
serviceBusService.receiveSubscriptionMessage('MyTopic', 'LowMessages', function(error, receivedMessage){
    if(!error){
        // Message received and deleted
        console.log(receivedMessage);
    }
});
serviceBusService.receiveSubscriptionMessage('MyTopic', 'HighMessages', { isPeekLock: true }, function(error, lockedMessage){
    if(!error){
        // Message received and locked
        console.log(lockedMessage);
        serviceBusService.deleteMessage(lockedMessage, function (deleteError){
            if(!deleteError){
                // Message deleted
                console.log('message has been deleted.');
            }
        })
    }
});
```

## How to handle application crashes and unreadable messages
Service Bus provides functionality to help you gracefully recover from
errors in your application or difficulties processing a message. If a
receiver application is unable to process the message for some reason,
then it can call the `unlockMessage` method on the
**ServiceBusService** object. This method causes Service Bus to unlock the
message within the subscription and make it available to be received
again. In this instance, either by the same consuming application or by another consuming application.

There is also a timeout associated with a message locked within the
subscription. If the application fails to process the message before
the lock timeout expires (for example, if the application crashes), then
Service Bus unlocks the message automatically and makes it available
to be received again.

In the event the application crashes after processing the message
but before the `deleteMessage` method is called, the message is redelivered 
to the application when it restarts. This behavior is often called
*At Least Once Processing*. That is, each message is processed at
least once, but in certain situations the same message may be
redelivered. If the scenario cannot tolerate duplicate processing, then
you should add logic to your application
to handle duplicate message delivery. You can use the
**MessageId** property of the message, which remains constant across
delivery attempts.

## Delete topics and subscriptions
Topics and subscriptions are persistent unless the [AutoDeleteOnIdle property](/javascript/api/@azure/arm-servicebus/sbsubscription?view=azure-node-latest#autodeleteonidle) is set, and must be explicitly deleted
either through the [Azure portal][Azure portal] or programmatically.
The following example demonstrates how to delete the topic named `MyTopic`:

```javascript
serviceBusService.deleteTopic('MyTopic', function (error) {
    if (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
});
```

Deleting a topic also deletes any subscriptions that are registered
with the topic. Subscriptions can also be deleted independently. The
following example shows how to delete a subscription named
`HighMessages` from the `MyTopic` topic:

```javascript
serviceBusService.deleteSubscription('MyTopic', 'HighMessages', function (error) {
    if(error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can manage Service Bus resources with [Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer/). The Service Bus Explorer allows users to connect to a Service Bus namespace and administer messaging entities in an easy manner. The tool provides advanced features like import/export functionality or the ability to test topic, queues, subscriptions, relay services, notification hubs and events hubs.
