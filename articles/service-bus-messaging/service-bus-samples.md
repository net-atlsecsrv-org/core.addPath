## Service Bus Explorer

In addition, the [Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer) is a sample hosted on GitHub that enables you to connect to a Service Bus service namespace and easily manage messaging entities. The tool provides advanced features such as import/export functionality, and the ability to test messaging entities and relay services. You can find the full Service Bus Explorer source and documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer).
