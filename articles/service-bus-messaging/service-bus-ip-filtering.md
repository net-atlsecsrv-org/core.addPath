# Use Firewall rules

For scenarios in which Azure Service Bus is only accessible from certain well-known sites, Firewall rules enable you to configure rules for accepting traffic originating from specific IPv4 addresses. For example, these addresses may be those of a corporate NAT gateway.

## When to use

If you are looking to setup Service Bus such that it should receive traffic only from a specified range of IP addresses and reject everything else, then you can leverage a *Firewall* to block Service Bus endpoints from other IP addresses. For example, you are using Service Bus with [Azure Express Route][express-route] to create private connections to your on-premises infrastructure. 

## How filter rules are applied

The IP filter rules are applied at the Service Bus namespace level. Therefore, the rules apply to all connections from clients using any supported protocol.

Any connection attempt from an IP address that does not match an allowed IP rule on the Service Bus namespace is rejected as unauthorized. The response does not mention the IP rule.

## Default setting

By default, the **IP Filter** grid in the portal for Service Bus is empty. This default setting means that your namespace accepts connections any IP address. This default setting is equivalent to a rule that accepts the 0.0.0.0/0 IP address range.

## IP filter rule evaluation

IP filter rules are applied in order and the first rule that matches the IP address determines the accept or reject action.

>[!WARNING]

> Trusted Microsoft services are not supported when IP Filtering (Firewall rules) are implemented, and will be made available soon.

### Creating a virtual network and firewall rule with Azure Resource Manager templates

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Firewalls and Virtual Networks are supported only in the **premium** tier of Service Bus.

The following Resource Manager template enables adding a virtual network rule to an existing Service Bus namespace.

Template parameters:

- **ipMask** is a single IPv4 address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, in CIDR notation 70.37.104.0/24 represents the 256 IPv4 addresses from 70.37.104.0 to 70.37.104.255, with 24 indicating the number of significant prefix bits for the range.

> [!NOTE]
> While there are no deny rules possible, the Azure Resource Manager template has the default action set to **"Allow"** which doesn't restrict connections.
> When making Virtual Network or Firewalls rules, we must change the
> ***"defaultAction"***
> 
> from
> ```json
> "defaultAction": "Allow"
> ```
> to
> ```json
> "defaultAction": "Deny"
> ```
>
