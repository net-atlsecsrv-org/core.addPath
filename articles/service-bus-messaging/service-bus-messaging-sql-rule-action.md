# SQLRuleAction syntax

A *SqlRuleAction* is an instance of the [SqlRuleAction](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sqlruleaction) class, and represents set of actions written in SQL-language based syntax that is performed against a [BrokeredMessage](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage).   
  
This article lists details about the SQL rule action grammar.  
  
```  
<statements> ::=
    <statement> [, ...n]  
  
```  
  
```  
<statement> ::=
    <action> [;]
    Remarks
    -------
    Semicolon is optional.  
  
```  
  
```  
<action> ::=
    SET <property> = <expression>
    REMOVE <property>  
```

```
<expression> ::=
    <constant>
    | <function>
    | <property>
    | <expression> { + | - | * | / | % } <expression>
    | { + | - } <expression>
    | ( <expression> )
``` 

```
<property> := 
    [<scope> .] <property_name>
``` 
  
## Arguments  
  
-   `<scope>` is an optional string indicating the scope of the `<property_name>`. Valid values are `sys` or `user`. The `sys` value indicates system scope where `<property_name>` is a public property name of the [BrokeredMessage Class](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage). `user` indicates user scope where `<property_name>` is a key of the [BrokeredMessage Class](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage) dictionary. `user` scope is the default scope if `<scope>` is not specified.  
  
### Remarks  

An attempt to access a non-existent system property is an error, while an attempt to access a non-existent user property is not an error. Instead, a non-existent user property is internally evaluated as an unknown value. An unknown value is treated specially during operator evaluation.  
  
## property_name  
  
```  
<property_name> ::=  
     <identifier>  
     | <delimited_identifier>  
  
<identifier> ::=  
     <regular_identifier> | <quoted_identifier> | <delimited_identifier>  
  
```  
  
### Arguments  
 `<regular_identifier>` is a string represented by the following regular expression:  
  
```  
[[:IsLetter:]][_[:IsLetter:][:IsDigit:]]*  
```  
  
 This means any string that starts with a letter and is followed by one or more underscore/letter/digit.  
  
 `[:IsLetter:]` means any Unicode character that is categorized as a Unicode letter. `System.Char.IsLetter(c)` returns `true` if `c` is a Unicode letter.  
  
 `[:IsDigit:]` means any Unicode character that is categorized as a decimal digit. `System.Char.IsDigit(c)` returns `true` if `c` is a Unicode digit.  
  
 A `<regular_identifier>` cannot be a reserved keyword.  
  
 `<delimited_identifier>` is any string that is enclosed with left/right square brackets ([]). A right square bracket is represented as two right square brackets. The following are examples of `<delimited_identifier>`:  
  
```  
[Property With Space]  
[HR-EmployeeID]  
  
```  
  
 `<quoted_identifier>` is any string that is enclosed with double quotation marks. A double quotation mark in identifier is represented as two double quotation marks. It is not recommended to use quoted identifiers because it can easily be confused with a string constant. Use a delimited identifier if possible. The following is an example of `<quoted_identifier>`:  
  
```  
"Contoso & Northwind"  
```  
  
## pattern  
  
```  
<pattern> ::=  
      <expression>  
```  
  
### Remarks
  
 `<pattern>` must be an expression that is evaluated as a string. It is used as a pattern for the LIKE operator.      It can contain the following wildcard characters:  
  
-   `%`:  Any string of zero or more characters.  
  
-   `_`: Any single character.  
  
## escape_char  
  
```  
<escape_char> ::=  
      <expression>  
```  
  
### Remarks
  
 `<escape_char>` must be an expression that is evaluated as a string of length 1. It is used as an escape character for the LIKE operator.  
  
 For example, `property LIKE 'ABC\%' ESCAPE '\'` matches `ABC%` rather than a string that starts with `ABC`.  
  
## constant  
  
```  
<constant> ::=  
      <integer_constant> | <decimal_constant> | <approximate_number_constant> | <boolean_constant> | NULL  
```  
  
### Arguments  
  
-   `<integer_constant>` is a string of numbers that are not enclosed in quotation marks and do not contain decimal points. The values are stored as `System.Int64` internally, and follow the same range.  
  
     The following are examples of long constants:  
  
    ```  
    1894  
    2  
    ```  
  
-   `<decimal_constant>` is a string of numbers that are not enclosed in quotation marks, and contain a decimal point. The values are stored as `System.Double` internally, and follow the same range/precision.  
  
     In a future version, this number might be stored in a different data type to support exact number semantics, so you should not rely on the fact the underlying data type is `System.Double` for `<decimal_constant>`.  
  
     The following are examples of decimal constants:  
  
    ```  
    1894.1204  
    2.0  
    ```  
  
-   `<approximate_number_constant>` is a number written in scientific notation. The values are stored as `System.Double` internally, and follow the same range/precision. The following are examples of approximate number constants:  
  
    ```  
    101.5E5  
    0.5E-2  
    ```  
  
## boolean_constant  
  
```  
<boolean_constant> :=  
      TRUE | FALSE  
```  
  
### Remarks
  
Boolean constants are represented by the keywords `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The values are stored as `System.Boolean`.  
  
## string_constant  
  
```  
<string_constant>  
```  
  
### Remarks
  
String constants are enclosed in single quotation marks and include any valid Unicode characters. A single quotation mark embedded in a string constant is represented as two single quotation marks.  
  
## function  
  
```  
<function> :=  
      newid() |  
      property(name) | p(name)  
```  
  
### Remarks  

The `newid()` function returns a **System.Guid** generated by the `System.Guid.NewGuid()` method.  
  
The `property(name)` function returns the value of the property referenced by `name`. The `name` value can be any valid expression that returns a string value.  
  
## Considerations

- SET is used to create a new property or update the value of an existing property.
- REMOVE is used to remove a property.
- SET performs implicit conversion if possible when the expression type and the existing property type are different.
- Action fails if non-existent system properties were referenced.
- Action does not fail if non-existent user properties were referenced.
- A non-existent user property is evaluated as "Unknown" internally, following the same semantics as [SQLFilter](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sqlfilter) when evaluating operators.
