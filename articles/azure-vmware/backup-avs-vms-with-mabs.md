# Back up Azure VMware Solution VMs with Azure Backup Server

In this article, we go through the procedures to back up VMware virtual machines (VMs) running on Azure VMware Solution by using Azure Backup Server. Before you begin, make sure you thoroughly go through [Set up Microsoft Azure Backup Server for Azure VMware Solution](set-up-mabs-for-avs.md).

Then, we walk through all of the necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"] 
> * Set up a secure channel so that Azure Backup Server can communicate with VMware servers over HTTPS. 
> * Add the account credentials to Azure Backup Server. 
> * Add the vCenter to Azure Backup Server. 
> * Set up a protection group that contains the VMware VMs you want to back up, specify backup settings, and schedule the backup.

## Create a secure connection to the vCenter server

By default, Azure Backup Server communicates with VMware servers over HTTPS. To set up the HTTPS connection, download the VMware certificate authority (CA) certificate and import it on the Azure Backup Server.

### Set up the certificate

1. In the browser, on the Azure Backup Server machine, enter the vSphere Web Client URL.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If the VMware **Getting Started** page doesn't appear, verify the connection and browser proxy settings and try again.

1. On the VMware **Getting Started** page, select **Download trusted root CA certificates**.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/vsphere-web-client.png" alt-text="vSphere Web Client":::

1. Save the **download.zip** file to the Azure Backup Server machine, and then extract its contents to the **certs** folder, which contains the:

   - Root certificate file with an extension that begins with a numbered sequence like .0 and .1.
   - CRL file with an extension that begins with a sequence like .r0 or .r1.

1. In the **certs** folder, right-click the root certificate file and select **Rename** to change the extension to **.crt**.

   The file icon changes to one that represents a root certificate.

1. Right-click the root certificate, and select **Install Certificate**.

1. In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, select **Local Machine** as the destination for the certificate, and select **Next**.

   ![Wizard welcome page](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/certificate-import-wizard1.png)

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If asked, confirm that you want to allow changes to the computer.

1. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**, and select **Browse** to choose the certificate store.

   ![Certificate storage](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-import-wizard-local-store.png)

1. Select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** as the destination folder, and select **OK**.

1. Review the settings, and select **Finish** to start importing the certificate.

   ![Verify certificate is in the proper folder](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-wizard-final-screen.png)

1. After the certificate import is confirmed, sign in to the vCenter server to confirm that your connection is secure.

### Enable TLS 1.2 on Azure Backup Server

VMware 6.7 onwards had TLS enabled as the communication protocol. 

1. Copy the following registry settings, and paste them into Notepad. Then save the file as TLS.REG without the .txt extension.

   ```text
   
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
   
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
   
      "SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
   
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
   
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
   
      "SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
   
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
   
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
   
      "SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
   
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
   
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
   
      "SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
   
   ```

1. Right-click the TLS.REG file, and select **Merge** or **Open** to add the settings to the registry.

## Add the provisioning IP address for Azure VMware Solution ESXi hosts on Azure Backup Server

During the preview, Azure VMware Solution doesn't resolve the ESX host from the virtual machine deployed in the virtual network. You'll need to perform additional steps to add the host file entry on the Azure Backup Server virtual machine.

### Identify the IP address for ESXi hosts

1. Open the browser, and sign in to the vCenter URLs. 

   > [!TIP]
   > You can find the URLs in [Connect to the local vCenter of your private cloud](tutorial-access-private-cloud.md#connect-to-the-local-vcenter-of-your-private-cloud).

1. In the vSphere Client, select the cluster that you plan to enable backup for.

   :::image type="content" source="media/avs-backup/vsphere-client-select-host.png" alt-text="VSphere Client - Select host":::

1. Select **Configure** > **Networking** > **VMKernel adapters**. Under the list of devices, identify the network adapter that has the **Provisioning** role enabled. Make a note of the **IP Address** and ESXi hostname.

   :::image type="content" source="media/avs-backup/vmkernel-adapters-provisioning-enabled.png" alt-text="VMKernel adapters - provisioning enabled devices":::

1. Repeat the previous step for each ESXi host under every cluster that you plan to enable backup for.

### Update the host file on Azure Backup Server

1. Open Notepad as an administrator.

1. Select **File** > **Open**, and search for c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts.

1. Add the entry for each ESXi host along with the IP address that you identified in the previous section.

1. Save your changes, and close Notepad.

## Add the account on Azure Backup Server

1. Open Azure Backup Server, and in the Azure Backup Server console, select **Management** > **Production Servers** > **Manage VMware**.

   ![Azure Backup Server console](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/add-vmware-credentials.png)

1. In the **Manage Credentials** dialog box, select **Add**.

   ![Azure Backup Server Manage Credentials dialog box](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/mabs-manage-credentials-dialog.png)

1. In the **Add Credential** dialog box, enter a name and a description for the new credential. Specify the user name and password you defined on the VMware server.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If the VMware server and Azure Backup Server aren't in the same domain, specify the domain in the **User name** box.

   ![Azure Backup Server Add Credential dialog box](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/mabs-add-credential-dialog2.png)

1. Select **Add** to add the new credential.

1. In the Azure Backup Server console, select **Management** > **Production Servers** > **Add**.

   ![Open Production Server Addition Wizard](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/add-vcenter-to-mabs.png)

1. Select **VMware Servers**, and select **Next**.

   ![Production Server Addition Wizard](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/production-server-add-wizard.png)

1. Specify the IP address of the vCenter.

   ![Specify VMware server](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/add-vmware-server-provide-server-name.png)

1. In the **SSL Port** box, enter the port used to communicate with the vCenter.

   > [!TIP] 
   > Port 443 is the default port, but you can change it if your vCenter listens on a different port.

1. In the **Specify Credential** box, select the credential that you created in the previous section.

1. Select **Add** to add the vCenter to the servers list, and select **Next**.

   ![Add VMware server and credential](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/add-vmware-server-credentials.png)

1. On the **Summary** page, select **Add** to add the vCenter to Azure Backup Server.

   The new server gets added immediately. vCenter doesn't need an agent.

   ![Add VMware server to Azure Backup Server](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/tasks-screen.png)

1. On the **Finish** page, review the settings and then select **Close**.

   ![Finish page](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/summary-screen.png)

   You should see the vCenter server listed under **Production Server** with the type as **VMware Server** and **Agent Status** as **OK**. If you see **Agent Status** as **Unknown**, select **Refresh**.

## Configure a protection group

Protection groups gather multiple VMs and apply the same data retention and backup settings to all VMs in the group.

1. In the Azure Backup Server console, select **Protection** > **New**.

   ![Open the Create New Protection Group wizard](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/open-protection-wizard.png)

1. On the **Create New Protection Group** wizard welcome page, select **Next**.

   ![Create New Protection Group wizard dialog box](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/protection-wizard.png)

1. On the **Select Protection Group Type** page, select **Servers**, and then select **Next**. The **Select Group Members** page appears.

1. On the **Select Group Members** page, select the VMs (or VM folders) that you want to back up, and then select **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you select a folder or VMs, folders inside that folder are also selected for backup. You can uncheck folders or VMs you don't want to back up. If a VM or folder is already being backed up, you can't select it, which ensures duplicate recovery points aren't created for a VM.

   ![Select group members](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/server-add-selected-members.png)

1. On the **Select Data Protection Method** page, enter a name for the protection group and protection settings. 

1. Set the short-term protection to **Disk**, enable online protection, and then select **Next**.

   ![Select data protection method](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/name-protection-group.png)

1. Specify how long you want to keep data backed up to disk.

   - **Retention range**: The number of days that disk recovery points are kept.
   - **Express Full Backup**: How often disk recovery points are taken. To change the times or dates when short-term backups occur, select **Modify**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/avs-backup/new-protection-group-specify-short-term-goals.png" alt-text="Specify your short-term goals for disk-based protection":::

1. On the **Review Disk Storage Allocation** page, review the disk space provided for the VM backups.

   - The recommended disk allocations are based on the retention range you specified, the type of workload, and the size of the protected data. Make any changes required, and then select **Next**.
   - **Data size:** Size of the data in the protection group.
   - **Disk space:** Recommended amount of disk space for the protection group. If you want to modify this setting, allocate total space that's slightly larger than the amount that you estimate each data source grows.
   - **Storage pool details:** Shows the status of the storage pool, which includes total and remaining disk size.

   :::image type="content" source="media/avs-backup/review-disk-allocation.png" alt-text="Review disk space allocated in the storage pool":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > In some scenarios, the data size reported is higher than the actual VM size. We're aware of the issue and currently investigating it.

1. On the **Choose Replica Creation Method** page, indicate how you want to take the initial backup, and select **Next**.

   - The default is **Automatically over the network** and **Now**. If you use the default, specify an off-peak time. If you choose **Later**, specify a day and time.
   - For large amounts of data or less-than-optimal network conditions, consider replicating the data offline by using removable media.

   ![Choose replica creation method](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/replica-creation.png)

1. For **Consistency check options**, select how and when to automate the consistency checks and select **Next**.

   - You can run consistency checks when replica data becomes inconsistent, or on a set schedule.
   - If you don't want to configure automatic consistency checks, you can run a manual check by right-clicking the protection group **Perform Consistency Check**.

1. On the **Specify Online Protection Data** page, select the VMs or VM folders that you want to back up, and then select **Next**. 

   > [!TIP]
   > You can select the members individually or choose **Select All** to choose all members.

   ![Specify online protection data](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/select-data-to-protect.png)

1. On the **Specify Online Backup Schedule** page, indicate how often you want to back up data from local storage to Azure, and then select **Next**. 

   - Cloud recovery points for the data to get generated according to the schedule. 
   - After the recovery point gets generated, it's then transferred to the Recovery Services vault in Azure.

   ![Specify online backup schedule](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/online-backup-schedule.png)

1. On the **Specify Online Retention Policy** page, indicate how long you want to keep the recovery points that get created from the daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly backups to Azure, and then select **Next**.

   - There's no time limit for how long you can keep data in Azure.
   - The only limit is that you can't have more than 9,999 recovery points per protected instance. In this example, the protected instance is the VMware server.

   ![Specify online retention policy](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/retention-policy.png)

1. On the **Summary** page, review the settings and then select **Create Group**.

   ![Protection group member and setting summary](../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/protection-group-summary.png)

## Monitor with the Azure Backup Server console

After you configure the protection group to back up Azure VMware Solution VMs, you can monitor the status of the backup job and alert by using the Azure Backup Server console. Here's what you can monitor.

- On the **Alerts** tab in the **Monitoring** pane, you can monitor errors, warnings, and general information for a protection group, for a specific protected computer, or by message severity. You can view active and inactive alerts and set up email notifications.
- On the **Jobs** tab in the **Monitoring** pane, you can view jobs initiated by Azure Backup Server for a specific protected data source or protection group. You can follow job progress or check resources consumed by jobs.
- In the **Protection** task area, you can check the status of volumes and shares in the protection group. You can also check configuration settings such as recovery settings, disk allocation, and the backup schedule.
- In the **Management** task area, you can view the **Disks, Online**, and **Agents** tabs to check the status of disks in the storage pool, registration to Azure, and deployed DPM agent status.

## Restore VMware virtual machines

In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, there are two ways to find recoverable data. You can search or browse. When you recover data, you might or might not want to restore data or a VM to the same location. For this reason, Azure Backup Server supports three recovery options for VMware VM backups:

- **Original location recovery (OLR)**: Use OLR to restore a protected VM to its original location. You can restore a VM to its original location only if no disks were added or deleted since the backup occurred. If disks were added or deleted, you must use alternate location recovery.
- **Alternate location recovery (ALR)**: When the original VM is missing, or you don't want to disturb the original VM, recover the VM to an alternate location. To recover a VM to an alternate location, you must provide the location of an ESXi host, resource pool, folder, and the storage datastore and path. To help differentiate the restored VM from the original VM, Azure Backup Server appends "-Recovered" to the name of the VM.
- **Individual file location recovery (ILR)**: If the protected VM is a Windows Server VM, individual files or folders inside the VM can be recovered by using the ILR capability of Azure Backup Server. To recover individual files, see the procedure later in this article. Restoring an individual file from a VM is available only for Windows VM and disk recovery points.

### Restore a recovery point

1. In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, select the **Recovery** view. 

1. Using the **Browse** pane, browse or filter to find the VM you want to recover. After you select a VM or folder, the **Recovery points for** pane displays the available recovery points.

   ![Available recovery points](../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/recovery-points.png)

1. In the **Recovery points for** pane, use the calendar and drop-down menus to select a date when a recovery point was taken. Calendar dates in bold have available recovery points. Alternately, you can right-click the VM and select **Show all recovery points** and then select the recovery point from the list.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > For short-term protection, select a disk-based recovery point for faster recovery. After short-term recovery points expire, you see only **Online** recovery points to recover.

1. Before recovering from an online recovery point, ensure the staging location contains enough free space to house the full uncompressed size of the VM you want to recover. The staging location can be viewed or changed by running the **Configure Subscription Settings Wizard**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/avs-backup/mabs-recovery-folder-settings.png" alt-text="Azure Backup Server Recovery Folder Settings":::

1. Select **Recover** to open the **Recovery Wizard**.

   ![Recovery Wizard, Review Recovery Selection page](../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/recovery-wizard.png)

1. Select **Next** to go to the **Specify Recovery Options** screen. Select **Next** again to go to the **Select Recovery Type** screen. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > VMware workloads don't support enabling network bandwidth throttling.

1. On the **Select Recovery Type** page, choose whether to recover to the original instance or a new location, and then select **Next**.

   - If you choose **Recover to original instance**, you don't need to make any more choices in the wizard. The data for the original instance is used.
   - If you choose **Recover as virtual machine on any host**, then on the **Specify Destination** screen, provide the information for **ESXi Host**, **Resource Pool**, **Folder**, and **Path**.

   ![Select Recovery Type page](../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/recovery-type.png)

1. On the **Summary** page, review your settings and select **Recover** to start the recovery process. 

   The **Recovery status** screen shows the progression of the recovery operation.

### Restore an individual file from a VM

You can restore individual files from a protected VM recovery point. This feature is only available for Windows Server VMs. Restoring individual files is similar to restoring the entire VM, except you browse into the VMDK and find the files you want before you start the recovery process. 

> [!NOTE]
> Restoring an individual file from a VM is available only for Windows VM and disk recovery points.

1. In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, select the **Recovery** view.

1. Using the **Browse** pane, browse or filter to find the VM you want to recover. After you select a VM or folder, the **Recovery points for** pane displays the available recovery points.

   ![Recovery points available](../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-rp-disk.png)

1. In the **Recovery points for** pane, use the calendar to select the date that contains the desired recovery points. Depending on how the backup policy was configured, dates can have more than one recovery point. 

1. After you select the day when the recovery point was taken, make sure you choose the correct **Recovery time**. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the selected date has multiple recovery points, choose your recovery point by selecting it in the **Recovery time** drop-down menu. 

   After you choose the recovery point, the list of recoverable items appears in the **Path** pane.

1. To find the files you want to recover, in the **Path** pane, double-click the item in the **Recoverable Item** column to open it. Then select the file or folders you want to recover. To select multiple items, select the **Ctrl** key while you select each item. Use the **Path** pane to search the list of files or folders that appear in the **Recoverable Item** column.
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > **Search list below** doesn't search into subfolders. To search through subfolders, double-click the folder. Use the **Up** button to move from a child folder into the parent folder. You can select multiple items (files and folders), but they must be in the same parent folder. You can't recover items from multiple folders in the same recovery job.

   ![Review recovery selection](../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-rp-disk-ilr-2.png)

1. When you've selected the items for recovery, in the Administrator Console tool ribbon, select **Recover** to open the **Recovery Wizard**. In the **Recovery Wizard**, the **Review Recovery Selection** screen shows the selected items to be recovered.

1. On the **Specify Recovery Options** screen, do one of the following:

   - Select **Modify** to enable network bandwidth throttling. In the **Throttle** dialog box, select **Enable network bandwidth usage throttling** to turn it on. Once enabled, configure the **Settings** and **Work Schedule**.
   - Select **Next** to leave network throttling disabled.

1. On the **Select Recovery Type** screen, select **Next**. You can only recover your files or folders to a network folder.

1. On the **Specify Destination** screen, select **Browse** to find a network location for your files or folders. Azure Backup Server creates a folder where all recovered items are copied. The folder name has the prefix MABS_day-month-year. When you select a location for the recovered files or folder, the details for that location, such as **Destination**, **Destination path**, and **Space available**, are provided.

   ![Specify location to recover files](../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/specify-destination.png)

1. On the **Specify Recovery Options** screen, choose which security setting to apply. You can opt to modify the network bandwidth usage throttling, but throttling is disabled by default. Also, **SAN Recovery** and **Notification** aren't enabled.

1. On the **Summary** screen, review your settings and select **Recover** to start the recovery process. The **Recovery status** screen shows the progression of the recovery operation.
