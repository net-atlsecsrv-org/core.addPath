To use Azure VMware Solution, you must first register the resource provider with your subscription.

```
azurecli-interactive
az provider register -n Microsoft.AVS --subscription <your subscription ID>
```

>[!TIP]
>Alternatively, you can use the GUI to register the **Microsoft.AVS** resource provider.  For more information, see the [Register resource provider and types](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#register-resource-provider) article.
