Microsoft is responsible for lifecycle management of VMware software (ESXi, vCenter, PSC, and NXS) in the private cloud.

Software updates include:

- **Patches** - Security patches or bug fixes released by VMware
- **Updates** - Minor version change of a VMware stack component
- **Upgrades** - Major version change of a VMware stack component

Microsoft tests a critical security patch as soon as it becomes available from VMware.

Documented VMware workarounds are implemented in lieu of installing a corresponding patch until the next scheduled updates are deployed.
