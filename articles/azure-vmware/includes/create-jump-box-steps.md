   For more information on the fields, see the following table.

   | **Subscription** | Value is pre-populated with the Subscription belonging to the Resource Group. |
   | **Resource group** | Value is pre-populated for the current Resource Group, which you created in the preceding tutorial.  |
   | **Virtual machine name** | Enter a unique name for the VM. |
   | **Region** | Select the geographical location of the VM. |
   | **Availability options** | Leave the default value selected. |
   | **Image** | Select the VM image. |
