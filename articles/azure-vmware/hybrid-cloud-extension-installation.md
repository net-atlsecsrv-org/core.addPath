# Install HCX for Azure VMware Solution

In this article, we walk through procedures for setting up the VMWare HCX solution for your Azure VMWare Solution private cloud. HCX enables migration of your VMware workloads to the cloud, and other connected sites through various built-in HCX supported migration types.

HCX Advanced, the default installation, supports up to three site connections (on-premises or cloud to cloud). If more than three site connections are required, customers have the option to enable the HCX Enterprise add-on through Support, which is currently in preview. HCX Enterprise carries additional charges for customers after general availability (GA) but provides [additional features](https://cloud.vmware.com/community/2019/08/08/introducing-hcx-enterprise/).


Thoroughly review [Before you begin](#before-you-begin), [Software version requirements](#software-version-requirements), and [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) first. 

Then, we'll walk through all necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy the on-premises HCX OVA (Connector)
> * Activate and configure HCX
> * Configure the network uplink and service mesh
> * Complete setup by checking the appliance status

After completing the setup, you can follow the recommended next steps provided at the end of this article.  

## Before you begin
	
* Review the basic Azure VMware Solution Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) [tutorial series](tutorial-network-checklist.md).
* Review and reference the [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/index.html) including the HCX user guide.
* Review VMware docs [Migrating Virtual Machines with VMware HCX](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-D0CD0CC6-3802-42C9-9718-6DA5FEC246C6.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIBIGEAaACAtgSwOYCcwBcMB7AOxAF8g).
* Optionally review [VMware HCX Deployment Considerations](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/install-checklist/GUID-C0A0E820-D5D0-4A3D-AD8E-EEAA3229F325.html).
* Optionally review related VMware materials on HCX, such as the VMware vSphere [blog series](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/10/cloud-migration-series-part-2.html) on HCX. 
* Request an Azure VMware Solution HCX Enterprise activation through Azure VMware Solution support channels.

Sizing workloads against compute and storage resources is an essential planning step when you're preparing to use the Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud HCX solution. Address the sizing step as part of the initial private cloud environment planning. 

You also can size workloads by completing an [Azure VMware Solution Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/how-to-create-azure-vmware-solution-assessment) in the Azure Migrate portal.

## Software version requirements

Infrastructure components must be running the required minimum version. 
                                                         
| Component Type    | Source Environment Requirements    | Destination Environment Requirements   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vCenter Server   | 5.1<br/><br/>If using 5.5 U1 or earlier, use the standalone HCX user interface for HCX operations.  | 6.0 U2 and above   |
| ESXi   | 5.0    | ESXi 6.0 and above   |
| NSX    | For HCX Network Extension of logical switches at the source: NSXv 6.2+ or NSX-T 2.4+   | NSXv 6.2+ or NSX-T 2.4+<br/><br/>For HCX Proximity Routing: NSXv 6.4+ (Proximity Routing is not supported with NSX-T) |
| vCloud Director   | Not required - no interoperability with vCloud Director at the source site | When integrating the destination environment with vCloud Director, the minimum is 9.1.0.2.  |

## Prerequisites

* ExpressRoute Global Reach should be configured between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution SDDC ExpressRoute circuits.

* All required ports should be open between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution SDDC (see [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-E456F078-22BE-494B-8E4B-076EF33A9CF4.html)).

* One IP address for HCX Manager at on-premises and a minimum of two IP addresses for Interconnect (IX) and Network Extension (NE) appliance.

* On-premises HCX IX and NE appliances should be able to reach vCenter and ESXi infrastructure.

* To deploy the WAN Interconnect appliance, in addition to the /22 CIDR network address block used for SDDC deployment in the Azure portal, HCX requires a /29 block. Make sure to factor this requirement into your network planning.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Select specific clusters in which source VMs are targeted for migration using HCX.

1. Select **Datastore** and select **Continue**. 
      
   Select each compute and storage resource for deploying the HCX Interconnect appliances. When multiple resources are selected, HCX uses the first resource selected until its capacity is exhausted.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/hybrid-cloud-extension-installation/deployment-resources.png" alt-text="Select each compute and storage resource for deploying the HCX Interconnect appliances. When multiple resources are selected, HCX uses the first resource selected until its capacity is exhausted.":::

1. Select the management network profile created in **Network Profiles** and select **Continue**.  
      
   Select the network profile through which the management interface of vCenter and the ESXi hosts can be reached. If you haven't already defined such a network profile, you can create it here.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/hybrid-cloud-extension-installation/management-network-profile.png" alt-text="Select the network profile through which the management interface of vCenter and the ESXi hosts can be reached. If you haven't already defined such a network profile, you can create it here.":::

   Select one or more network profiles so that one of the following is true:  
   * The Interconnect Appliances on the remote site can be reached via this network  
   * The remote-side appliances can reach the local Interconnect Appliances via this network.  
    
   If you have point-to-point networks like Direct Connect which are not shared across multiple sites, you can skip this step, since compute profiles are shared with multiple sites. In such cases, Uplink Network profiles can be overridden and specified during the creation of the Interconnect Service mesh.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/hybrid-cloud-extension-installation/uplink-network-profile.png" alt-text="Select Network Uplink and select Continue.":::

## Configure Network Uplink

Now configure the network profile change in Azure VMware Solution SDDC for Network Uplink.

1. Sign in to SDDC NSX-T to create a new logical switch, or use an existing logical switch that can be used for Network Uplink between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution SDDC.

1. Create a network profile for HCX uplink in Azure VMware Solution SDDC that can be used for on-premises to Azure VMware Solution SDDC communication.
