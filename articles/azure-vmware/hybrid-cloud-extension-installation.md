# Install HCX for Azure VMware Solution

In this article, we walk through procedures for setting up the VMWare Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) solution for your Azure VMWare Solution (AVS) private cloud. HCX enables migration of your VMware workloads to the cloud, and other connected sites through various built-in HCX supported migration types.

HCX Advanced, the default installation, supports up to three vCenters. If more than three are required, customers have the option to enable the HCX Enterprise add-on through Support. HCX Enterprise installation carries additional charges for customers after general availability (GA) but provides [additional features](https://cloud.vmware.com/community/2019/08/08/introducing-hcx-enterprise/).


Thoroughly review [Before you begin](#before-you-begin), [Software version requirements](#software-version-requirements), and [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) first. 

Then, we'll walk through all necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy the on-premises HCX OVA
> * Activate and configure HCX
> * Configure the network uplink and service mesh
> * Complete setup by checking the appliance status

After completing the setup, you can follow the recommended next steps provided at the end of this article.  

## Before you begin
	
* Review the basic AVS Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) [tutorial series](tutorial-network-checklist.md).
* Review and reference the [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/index.html) including the HCX user guide.
* Review VMware docs [Migrating Virtual Machines with VMware HCX](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-D0CD0CC6-3802-42C9-9718-6DA5FEC246C6.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIBIGEAaACAtgSwOYCcwBcMB7AOxAF8g).
* Optionally review [VMware HCX Deployment Considerations](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/install-checklist/GUID-C0A0E820-D5D0-4A3D-AD8E-EEAA3229F325.html).
* Optionally review related VMware materials on HCX, such as the VMware vSphere [blog series](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/10/cloud-migration-series-part-2.html) on HCX. 
* Order an AVS HCX Enterprise activation through AVS support channels.

Sizing workloads against compute and storage resources is an essential planning step when preparing to use the AVS Private Cloud HCX solution. Address the sizing step as part of the initial private cloud environment planning.   

## Software version requirements
Infrastructure components must be running the required minimum version. 
                                                         
| Component Type    | Source Environment Requirements    | Destination Environment Requirements   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vCenter Server   | 5.1<br/><br/>If using 5.5 U1 or earlier, use the standalone HCX user interface for HCX operations.  | 6.0 U2 and above   |
| ESXi   | 5.0    | ESXi 6.0 and above   |
| NSX    | For HCX Network Extension of logical switches at the source: NSXv 6.2+ or NSX-T 2.4+   | NSXv 6.2+ or NSX-T 2.4+<br/><br/>For HCX Proximity Routing: NSXv 6.4+ (Proximity Routing is not supported with NSX-T) |
| vCloud Director   | Not required - no interoperability with vCloud Director at the source site | When integrating the destination environment with vCloud Director, the minimum is 9.1.0.2.  |

## Prerequisites

* ExpressRoute Global Reach should be configured between on-premises and AVS SDDC ExpressRoute circuits.

* All required ports should be open between on-premises and AVS SDDC (see [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-E456F078-22BE-494B-8E4B-076EF33A9CF4.html)).

* One IP address for HCX Manager at on-premises and a minimum of two IP addresses for Interconnect (IX) and Network Extension (NE) appliance.

* On-premises HCX IX and NE appliances should be able to reach vCenter and ESXi infrastructure.

* To deploy the WAN Interconnect appliance, in addition to the /22 CIDR network address block used for SDDC deployment in the Azure portal, HCX requires a /29 block. Make sure to factor this requirement into your network planning.
