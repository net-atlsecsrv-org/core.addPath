# Protect your Azure VMware Solution VMs with Azure Security Center integration

Azure native security tools provide a secure infrastructure for a hybrid environment of Azure, Azure VMware Solution, and on-premises virtual machines (VMs). This article shows you how to set up Azure tools for hybrid environment security. You'll use various tools to identify and address different types of threats.

## Azure native services

Here is a quick summary of each Azure native service:

- **Log Analytics workspace:** Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment to store log data. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration. Data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in a specific workspace.
- **Azure Security Center:** Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system. It strengthens the security posture of the data centers, and provides advanced threat protection across the hybrid workloads in the cloud or on premises.
- **Azure Sentinel:** Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. It provides intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across an environment. It is a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

## Topology

![A diagram showing the architecture of Azure integrated security.](media/azure-security-integration/azure-integrated-security-architecture.png)

The Log Analytics agent enables collection of log data from Azure, Azure VMware Solution, and on-premises VMs. The log data is sent to Azure Monitor Logs and is stored in a Log Analytics workspace. You can deploy the Log Analytics agent using Arc enabled servers [VM extensions support](../azure-arc/servers/manage-vm-extensions.md) for new and existing VMs. 

Once the logs are collected by the Log Analytics workspace, you can configure the Log Analytics workspace with Azure Security Center. Azure Security Center will assess the vulnerability status of Azure VMware Solution VMs and raise an alert for any critical  vulnerability. For instance, it assesses missing operating system patches, security misconfigurations, and [endpoint protection](../security-center/security-center-services.md).

You can configure the Log Analytics workspace with Azure Sentinel for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response. In the preceding diagram, Azure Security Center is connected to Azure Sentinel using Azure Security Center connector. Azure Security Center will forward the environment vulnerability to Azure Sentinel to create an incident and map with other threats. You can also create the scheduled rules query to detect unwanted activity and convert it to the incidents.

## Benefits

- Azure native services can be used for hybrid environment security in Azure, Azure VMware Solution, and on-premises services.
- Using a Log Analytics workspace, you can collect the data or the logs to a single point and present the same data to different Azure native services.
- Azure Security Center provides security features like file integrity monitoring, fileless attack detection, operating system patch assessment, security misconfigurations assessment, and endpoint protection assessment.
- Azure Sentinel allows you to:
    - Collect data at cloud scale across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on premises and in multiple clouds.
    - Detect previously undetected threats.
    - Investigate threats with artificial intelligence and hunt for suspicious activities at scale.
    - Respond to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.

## Create a Log Analytics workspace

You will need a Log Analytics workspace to collect data from various sources. See the steps in [Create a Log Analytics workspace from the Azure portal](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md).
