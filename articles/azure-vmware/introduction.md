# What is Azure VMware Solution Preview?

Azure VMware Solution provides you with private clouds in Azure. The private clouds contain vSphere clusters, built from dedicated bare-metal Azure infrastructure. You can scale private cloud clusters from 3 to 16 hosts, with the capability to have multiple clusters in a single private cloud. All private clouds are provisioned with vCenter Server, vSAN, vSphere, and NSX-T. You can migrate workloads from your on-premises environments, create or deploy new virtual machines, and consume Azure services from your private clouds.

Azure VMware Solution is a VMware validated solution with on-going validation and testing of enhancements and upgrades. The private cloud infrastructure and software are managed and maintained by Microsoft, allowing you to focus on developing and running workloads in your private clouds.

The following diagram shows the adjacency between private clouds and VNets in Azure, Azure services, and on-premises environments. Network access from private clouds to Azure services or VNets provides SLA-driven integration of Azure service endpoints. Private cloud access from on-premises environments uses ExpressRoute Global Reach for a private and secure connection.

## Hosts, clusters, and private clouds

Azure VMware Solution private clouds and clusters are built from a bare-metal, hyper-converged Azure infrastructure host. The high-end hosts have 576-GB RAM and dual Intel 18 core, 2.3-GHz processors. The HE hosts have two vSAN diskgroups with a total 15.36 TB (SSD) raw vSAN capacity tier, and a 3.2 TB (NVMe) vSAN cache tier.

New private clouds are deployed through the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

## Networking

When a private cloud is deployed, private networks for management, provisioning, and vMotion are created. These private networks are used for access to vCenter and NSX-T Manager, and for virtual machine vMotion or deployment. All of the private networks are accessible from a VNet in Azure or from on-premises environments. ExpressRoute Global Reach is used to connect private clouds to on-premises environments, and this connection requires a VNet with an ExpressRoute circuit in your subscription.

Access to the internet and Azure services are provisioned when a private cloud is deployed. The access is provided so that VMs on production workload networks can consume Azure or internet-based services. Internet access is disabled by default for new private clouds, and it can be enabled or disabled at any time.

For more information on networking and interconnectivity, see the [Networking concepts](concepts-networking.md) article.

## Access and security

For enhanced security, Azure VMware Solution private clouds use vSphere role-based access control. vSphere SSO LDAP capabilities can be integrated with Azure Active Directory. For more information on identity and privileges, see the [Access and Identity concepts](concepts-identity.md) article.

vSAN data-at-rest encryption is enabled by default and is used to provide vSAN datastore security. It's described in more detail in the [Storage concepts](concepts-storage.md) article.

## Host and software lifecycle maintenance

Regular upgrades of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud and VMware software ensures the latest security, stability, and feature sets are running in your private clouds. More details about platform maintenance and upgrades are available in the [upgrade concepts](concepts-upgrades.md) article.

## Monitoring your private cloud

You can use [Logs in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md) to collect logs on your virtual machines running in your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. You can [download and install the MMA agent](../azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent.md#installation-options) on Linux and Windows virtual machines running in your Azure VMware Solution private clouds, using the same queries that you run on your on-premises VMs. You can run the same queries you would normally run on your virtual machines just the same. To learn more about creating queries, see [how to write queries](../azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview.md#how-can-i-learn-how-to-write-queries).
