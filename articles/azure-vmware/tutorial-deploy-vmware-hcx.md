# Deploy and configure VMware HCX

In this article, we walk through the procedures to deploy and configure the on-premises VMware HCX Connector for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. With VMware HCX, you can migrate your VMware workloads to 
Azure VMware Solution and other connected sites through various migration types. Because Azure VMware Solution deploys and configures the HCX Cloud Manager, you must download, activate, and configure the HCX Connector in your on-premises VMware datacenter.

VMware HCX Advanced Connector is pre-deployed in Azure VMware Solution. It supports up to three site connections (on-premises to cloud, or cloud to cloud). If you need more than three site connections, submit a [support request](https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) to enable the [VMware HCX Enterprise](https://cloud.vmware.com/community/2019/08/08/introducing-hcx-enterprise/) add-on. The add-on is currently in preview. 

>[!NOTE]
>VMware HCX Enterprise Edition (EE) is available with Azure VMware Solution as a preview service. It's free and is subject to terms and conditions for a preview service. After the VMware HCX EE service is generally available, you'll get a 30-day notice that billing will switch over. You'll also have the option to turn off or opt out of the service.

First, thoroughly review the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin), [Software version requirements](#software-version-requirements), and [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) sections of this article. 

Then, we'll walk through all the necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy the on-premises VMware HCX OVA (HCX Connector).
> * Activate the VMware HCX Connector.
> * Pair your on-premises HCX Connector with your Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager.
> * Configure the interconnect (network profile, compute profile, and service mesh).
> * Complete setup by checking the appliance status and validating that migration is possible.

After you're finished, you can follow the recommended next steps at the end of this article.  

## Before you begin
   
* Review the basic Azure VMware Solution Software-Defined Datacenter (SDDC) [tutorial series](tutorial-network-checklist.md).
* Review and reference the [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/index.html), including the HCX user guide.
* Review [Migrating Virtual Machines with VMware HCX](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-D0CD0CC6-3802-42C9-9718-6DA5FEC246C6.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIBIGEAaACAtgSwOYCcwBcMB7AOxAF8g) on VMware Docs.
* Optionally review [VMware HCX Deployment Considerations](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/install-checklist/GUID-C0A0E820-D5D0-4A3D-AD8E-EEAA3229F325.html).
* Optionally review related VMware materials on HCX, such as the VMware vSphere [blog series](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/10/cloud-migration-series-part-2.html). 
* Optionally request an Azure VMware Solution HCX Enterprise activation through Azure VMware Solution support channels.
* Optionally [review network ports required for HCX](https://ports.vmware.com/home/VMware-HCX).
* Although the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager comes preconfigured from the /22 network that's provided for the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, the on-premises HCX Connector requires you to allocate network ranges from your on-premises network. These networks and ranges are described later in this article.

Sizing workloads against compute and storage resources is an essential planning step. Address the sizing step as part of the initial planning for a private cloud environment. 

You can size workloads by completing an [Azure VMware Solution assessment](../migrate/how-to-create-azure-vmware-solution-assessment.md) in the Azure Migrate portal.

## Software version requirements

Infrastructure components must be running the required minimum version. 
                                                         
| Component type    | Source environment requirements    | Destination environment requirements   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vCenter Server   | 5.1<br/><br/>If you're using 5.5 U1 or earlier, use the standalone HCX user interface for HCX operations.  | 6.0 U2 and later   |
| ESXi   | 5.0    | ESXi 6.0 and later   |
| NSX    | For HCX network extension of logical switches at the source: NSXv 6.2+ or NSX-T 2.4+.   | NSXv 6.2+ or NSX-T 2.4+<br/><br/>For HCX Proximity Routing: NSXv 6.4+. (Proximity Routing isn't supported with NSX-T.) |
| vCloud Director   | Not required. There's no interoperability with vCloud Director at the source site. | When you're integrating the destination environment with vCloud Director, the minimum is 9.1.0.2.  |

## Prerequisites

### Network and ports

* Configure [Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach](tutorial-expressroute-global-reach-private-cloud.md) between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution SDDC ExpressRoute circuits.

* [All required ports](https://ports.vmware.com/home/VMware-HCX) should be open for communication between on-premises components and Azure VMware Solution SDDC.

## Next steps

If you've reached this point and the appliance interconnect tunnel status is **UP** and green, you can migrate and protect Azure VMware Solution VMs by using VMware HCX. Azure VMware Solution supports workload migrations (with or without a network extension). You can still migrate workloads in your vSphere environment, along with on-premises creation of networks and deployment of VMs onto those networks.
