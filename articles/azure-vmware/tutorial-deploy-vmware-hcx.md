# Deploy and configure VMware HCX

In this article, we walk through the procedures to deploy and configure the VMware HCX for your Azure VMWare Solution private cloud. VMware HCX enables the migration of your VMware workloads to Azure VMware Solution and other connected sites through various migration types.

VMware HCX Advanced (pre-deployed in Azure VMware Solution) supports up to three site connections (on-premises to cloud, or cloud to cloud). If more than three site connections for VMware HCX Enterprise are required, you have the option to enable [VMware HCX Enterprise](https://cloud.vmware.com/community/2019/08/08/introducing-hcx-enterprise/) add-on (which is currently in *Preview*) by submitting a [support request](https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support). VMware HCX Enterprise Edition (EE) is available with Azure VMware Solution as a *Preview* function/service. While VMware HCX EE for Azure VMware Solution is in *Preview*, it is a free function/service and subject to Preview service terms and conditions. Once the VMware HCX EE service goes GA, you'll get a 30-day notice that billing will switch over. You'll also have the option to switch off/opt-out of the service.

Before beginning, thoroughly review [Before you begin](#before-you-begin), [Software version requirements](#software-version-requirements), and [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). 

Then, we'll walk through all the necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy the on-premises VMware HCX OVA (Connector)
> * Activate VMware HCX
> * Pair your on-premises environment with your Azure VMware Solution environment.
> * Configure the interconnect (compute profile, network profile(s) and service mesh)
> * Complete setup by checking the appliance status.

Once finished, you can follow the recommended next steps at the end of this article.  

## Before you begin
   
* Review the basic Azure VMware Solution Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) [tutorial series](tutorial-network-checklist.md).
* Review and reference the [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/index.html), including the HCX user guide.
* Review VMware docs [Migrating Virtual Machines with VMware HCX](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-D0CD0CC6-3802-42C9-9718-6DA5FEC246C6.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIBIGEAaACAtgSwOYCcwBcMB7AOxAF8g).
* Optionally review [VMware HCX Deployment Considerations](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/install-checklist/GUID-C0A0E820-D5D0-4A3D-AD8E-EEAA3229F325.html).
* Optionally review related VMware materials on HCX, such as the VMware vSphere [blog series](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/10/cloud-migration-series-part-2.html) on HCX. 
* Optionally request an Azure VMware Solution HCX Enterprise activation through Azure VMware Solution support channels.
* To deploy the WAN Interconnect appliance, specific CIDR ranges are already allocated from the customer provided `\22` for the private cloud creating.

Sizing workloads against compute and storage resources is an essential planning step. Address the sizing step as part of the initial private cloud environment planning. 

You also can size workloads by completing an [Azure VMware Solution Assessment](../migrate/how-to-create-azure-vmware-solution-assessment.md) in the Azure Migrate portal.

## Software version requirements

Infrastructure components must be running the required minimum version.

### Create network profiles

VMware HCX deploys a couple of virtual appliances (automated) but needs multiple IP segments.  When you create your network profiles, you define the IP segments, which you identified during the [VMware HCX Network Segments pre-deployment preparation and planning stage](production-ready-deployment-steps.md#vmware-hcx-network-segments).

You will create four network profiles:

   - Management
   - vMotion
   - Replication
   - Uplink

1. Under **Infrastructure**, select **Interconnect** > **Multi-Site Service Mesh** > **Network Profiles** > **Create Network Profile**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/network-profile-start.png" alt-text="Under Infrastructure, select Interconnect > Multi-Site Service Mesh > Network Profiles > Create Network Profile." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/network-profile-start.png":::

1. For each network profile, select the network, port group, provide a name, create the IP pool for that particular segment, and then select **Create**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/example-configurations-network-profile.png" alt-text="For the new network profile, enter the VMware HCX IX and NE IP address ranges (a minimum of two IP addresses is required for IX and NE appliances).":::

## Next steps

If you've reached this point and the appliance interconnect Tunnel Status is **UP** and green, you can migrate and protect Azure VMware Solution VMs using VMware HCX.  Azure VMware Solution supports workload migrations (with or with a network extension).  You can still do workload migrations in your vSphere environment on-premises creation of networks and deployment of VMs onto those networks.  For more information, see [VMware HCX documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/index.html) and [Migrating Virtual Machines with VMware HCX](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-D0CD0CC6-3802-42C9-9718-6DA5FEC246C6.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIBIGEAaACAtgSwOYCcwBcMB7AOxAF8g) in the VMware technical documentation for details on using HCX.
