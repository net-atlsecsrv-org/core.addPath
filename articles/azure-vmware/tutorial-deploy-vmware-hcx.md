# Deploy and configure VMware HCX

This article shows you how to deploy and configure the on-premises VMware HCX Connector for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. With VMware HCX, you can migrate your VMware workloads to Azure VMware Solution and other connected sites through various migration types. Because Azure VMware Solution deploys and configures the HCX Cloud Manager, you must download, activate, and configure the HCX Connector in your on-premises VMware datacenter.

VMware HCX Advanced Connector is pre-deployed in Azure VMware Solution. It supports up to three site connections (on-premises to cloud, or cloud to cloud). If you need more than three site connections, submit a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) to enable the [VMware HCX Enterprise](https://cloud.vmware.com/community/2019/08/08/introducing-hcx-enterprise/) add-on. The add-on is currently in preview. 

>[!TIP]
>Although the VMware Configuration Maximum tool describes site pairs maximum to be 25 between the on-premises Connector and Cloud Manager, the licensing limits this to three for Advanced and 10 for Enterprise Edition.

>[!NOTE]
>VMware HCX Enterprise is available with Azure VMware Solution as a preview service. It's free and is subject to terms and conditions for a preview service. After the VMware HCX Enterprise service is generally available, you'll get a 30-day notice that billing will switch over. You'll also have the option to turn off or opt-out of the service. There is no simple downgrade path from VMware HCX Enterprise to VMware HCX Advanced. If you decide to downgrade, you'll have to redeploy, incurring downtime.

First, review [Before you begin](#before-you-begin), [Software version requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/services/user-guide/GUID-54E5293B-8707-4D29-BFE8-EE63539CC49B.html), and the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). 

Then, we'll walk through all the necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download the VMware HCX Connector OVA.
> * Deploy the on-premises VMware HCX OVA (VMware HCX Connector).
> * Activate the VMware HCX Connector.
> * Pair your on-premises VMware HCX Connector with your Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager.
> * Configure the interconnect (network profile, compute profile, and service mesh).
> * Complete setup by checking the appliance status and validating that migration is possible.

After you're finished, follow the recommended next steps at the end of this article.
