# Azure VMware Solution (AVS) upgrade concepts

One of the key benefits of Azure VMware Solution (AVS) private clouds is that the platform is maintained for you. Platform maintenance includes automated upgrades to a VMware validated software bundle. The upgrades are done regularly, ensuring that you always have the latest validated versions of the software.

## AVS private cloud software upgrades

The AVS private cloud platform includes specific versions of VMware vSphere, ESXi, vSAN, and NSX-T software. The private cloud software bundle is validated for use in new private cloud installations, and for upgrades of existing private clouds.

The lifecycle management upgrade process doesn't require downtime for your private clouds. The upgrade process ensures you're automatically using the latest version of the validated AVS private cloud software. Upgrades are applied on regular cadence so that private clouds are never more than one version behind the latest release of the validated software bundle. You'll be notified of planned upgrades to your private cloud. You can defer the upgrade if your private cloud is within one version of the latest release.

Critical patches and updates are applied when they're validated. You'll be notified in advance of required critical upgrades. This policy ensures your private cloud has critical patches and updates applied immediately.

VMware software versions are provided in the [private clouds and clusters concept article](concepts-private-clouds-clusters.md) and the [FAQ](faq.md).
