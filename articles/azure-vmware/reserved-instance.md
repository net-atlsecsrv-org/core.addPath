# Save costs with Azure VMware Solution

When you commit to a reserved instance of [Azure VMware Solution](introduction.md), you save money.  The reservation discount is applied automatically to the running Azure VMware Solution hosts that match the reservation scope and attributes. A reserved instance purchase covers only the compute part of your usage and includes software licensing costs. 

## Purchase restriction considerations

Reserved instances are available with some exceptions.

-   **Clouds** - Reservations are available only in the regions listed on the [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=azure-vmware) page.

-   **Insufficient quota** - A reservation scoped to a single/shared subscription must have hosts quota available in the subscription for the new reserved instance. You can [create quota increase request](enable-azure-vmware-solution.md) to resolve this issue.

-   **Offer eligibility**- You'll need an [Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA)](../cost-management-billing/manage/ea-portal-agreements.md) with Microsoft.

-   **Capacity restrictions** - In rare circumstances, Azure limits the purchase of new reservations for Azure VMware Solution host SKUs because of low capacity in a region.

## Buy a reservation

You can buy a reserved instance of an Azure VMware Solution host instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/CreateBlade/referrer/documentation/filters/%7B%22reservedResourceType%22%3A%22VirtualMachines%22%7D).

You can pay for the reservation [up front or with monthly payments](../cost-management-billing/reservations/prepare-buy-reservation.md).

These requirements apply to buying a reserved dedicated host instance:

-   You must be in an *Owner* role for at least one EA subscription or a subscription with a pay-as-you-go rate.

-   For EA subscriptions, you must enable the **Add Reserved Instances** option in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/). If disabled, you must be an EA Admin for the subscription to enable it.

-   For subscription under a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Azure Plan, the partner must purchase the reserved instances in the Azure portal for the customer.

## Usage data and reservation usage

Your usage that gets a reservation discount has an effective price of zero. You can see which Azure VMware Solution instance received the reservation discount for each reservation.

For more information about how reservation discounts appear in usage data:

- For EA customers, see [Understand Azure reservation usage for your Enterprise enrollment](../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md)
- For individual subscriptions, see [Understand Azure reservation usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription](../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage.md)

## Change a reservation after purchase

You can make these changes to a reservation after purchase:

-   Update reservation scope

-   Instance size flexibility (if applicable)

-   Ownership

You can also split a reservation into smaller chunks or merge reservations. None of the changes cause a new commercial transaction or change the end date of the reservation.
