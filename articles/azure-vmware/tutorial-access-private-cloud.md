# Tutorial: Access an Azure VMware Solution private cloud

Azure VMware Solution doesn't allow you to manage your private cloud with your on-premises vCenter. You'll need to do additional setup and connection to a local vCenter instance through a jump box. 

In this tutorial, you'll create a jump box in the resource group you created in the [previous tutorial](tutorial-configure-networking.md) and sign into vCenter. The jump box is a Windows virtual machine (VM) on the same virtual network you created.  It provides access to vCenter and NSX Manager. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Login to vCenter from your virtual machine

## Connect to the local vCenter of your private cloud

1. From the jump box, sign in to vSphere Client with VMware vCenter SSO using a cloud admin username and verity that the user interface displays successfully.

1. In the Azure portal, select your private cloud and then in the **Overview** view, select **Identity > Default**. 

   The URLs and user credentials for private cloud vCenter and NSX-T Manager display.

1. Navigate to the VM you created in the preceding step and connect to the virtual machine. 

   If you need help with connecting to the VM, see [connect to a virtual machine](../virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon.md#connect-to-the-virtual-machine) for details.

1. In the Windows VM, open a browser and navigate to the vCenter and NSX-T Manger URLs in two tabs. 

1. In the vCenter tab, enter the `cloudadmin@vmcp.local` user credentials from the previous step.

1. In the second tab of the browser, sign in to NSX-T manager.
