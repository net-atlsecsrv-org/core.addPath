# Get help with Azure VMware Solution deployment or provisioning failures

In this article, you learn how to get help with Azure VMware Solution (AVS) deployment or provisioning failures on your private cloud by opening a service request (SR) in the Azure portal. First, though, you need to collect some key information in the Azure portal. In most cases, you need the:

- Correlation ID (of the failed deployment)
- ExpressRoute circuit ID (when trying to scale or peer an existing private cloud with the private cloud ExpressRoute circuit, and it fails)

## Collect the correlation ID
 
Let's look at the correlation ID first. When you create a private cloud (or any resource in Azure), an associated correlation ID is generated. Each Azure Resource Manager deployment also generates a unique correlation ID. This ID enables faster SR creation and resolution. 
 
Here is an example of the output from a failed private cloud deployment, with the correlation ID highlighted.

Copy and save this correlation ID to include in the service request. For details, see [Create your support request](#create-your-support-request) at the end of this article.

If the failure occurs in the pre-validation stages, before a private cloud is deployed, no correlation ID is generated. In this case, you can simply provide the information you used when creating the AVS private cloud, including:

- Location
- Resource group
- Resource name
 
### Collect a summary of errors

The details of any errors can also be helpful in resolving your issue. From the preceding screen, select **Click here for details** (highlighted) and a summary of errors opens, as shown in the following screenshot.
 
 :::image type="content" source="media/fix-deployment-provisioning-failures/summary-of-errors.png" alt-text="Summary of errors.":::

Again, copy and save this summary to include in the SR.
 
### Retrieve past deployments

You can retrieve past deployments, including failed ones, by searching in the deployment activity log accessed by selecting the notifications icon.

:::image type="content" source="media/fix-deployment-provisioning-failures/open-notifications.png" alt-text="Open notifications.":::

In Notifications, select **More events in the activity log**.

:::image type="content" source="media/fix-deployment-provisioning-failures/more-events-in-activity-log.png" alt-text="Link: More events in the activity log.":::

Then search on the name of the resource, or on another unique piece of information you used in creating the resource, to find the failed deployment and its correlation ID. The following example shows search results on a private cloud resource (pc03).
 
:::image type="content" source="media/fix-deployment-provisioning-failures/find-past-deployments.png" alt-text="Find past failed AVS deployments.":::
 
Selecting the operation name of the failed deployment opens a window with details. Select the JSON tab and look for correlationId. Copy and include in the SR. 
 
## Collect the ExpressRoute ID (URI)
 
Perhaps you already have a private cloud and you experience a failure when you are trying to scale it or peer with the private cloud ExpressRoute circuit. In that case, the ExpressRoute ID of the private cloud can be used to identify it when you create an SR.

When viewing a private cloud in the portal, select **Connectivity > ExpressRoute** and copy the **ExpressRoute ID** to your clipboard.
 
:::image type="content" source="media/fix-deployment-provisioning-failures/expressroute-id.png" alt-text="Collect an ExpressRoute ID."::: 
 
Paste the ExpressRoute ID into the appropriate field in the new support request. For more info, see the following section, [Create your support request](#create-your-support-request).
 
> [!NOTE]
> On occasion, pre-validation checks may fail prior to a deployment and the only information available will be the error and/or failure messages. These can be helpful in a number of failures, for instance quota-related issues, and it's important to include these messages in the support request. To collect these, see the earlier section, [Collect a summary of errors](#collect-a-summary-of-errors).

## Create your support request

For general guidance in creating your support request, see [How to create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md). 

Here is additional guidance specific to creating an SR for AVS deployment or provisioning failures.

1. Select the **Help** icon and then **+ New support request**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fix-deployment-provisioning-failures/open-sr-on-avs.png" alt-text="Collect an ExpressRoute ID.":::

2. Fill in all required fields, and on the **Basics** tab:

    - For **Problem type**, select **Configuration and Setup Issues**.

    - For **Problem subtype**, select **Provision a private cloud**.

3. On the **Details** tab:

    - Fill in all required fields.

    - Paste your Correlation ID or ExpressRoute ID into the specific fields provided. If you don't see a specific field for these, you can paste them into the text box under **Provide details about the issue.**

    - Paste any error details, including the summary of errors you copied, into the text box under **Provide details about the issue.**

4. Review and select **Create** to create your SR.
