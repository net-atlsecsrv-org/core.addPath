## Indicators

The device has a camera streaming indicator on the front of the device that can be disabled programmatically using the Sensor SDK.

The status LED behind the device indicates device state:

| When the light is     | It means                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Solid white           | Device is on and working properly.                         |
| Flashing white        | Device is on but doesn’t have a USB 3.0 data connection.   |
| Flashing amber        | Device doesn't have enough power to operate.               |
| Amber flashing white  | Firmware update or recovery in progress                    |

## Power device

The device can be powered in two ways:

1. Using the in-box power supply. Data is connected by a separate USB Type-C to Type-A cable.
2. Using a Type-C to Type-C cable for both power and data.

A Type-C to Type-C cable isn't included with the Azure Kinect DK.

> [!NOTE]
> - The in-box power supply cable is a USB Type-A to single post barrel connector. Use the provided wall-power supply with this cable. The device is capable of drawing more power than two standard USB Type-A ports can provide.
> - USB cables do matter and we recommended to use high-quality cables and verify functionality before deploying the unit remotely.

> [!TIP]
> To select a good Type-C to Type-C cable:
> - The [USB certified cable](https://www.usb.org/products) must support both power and data.
> - A passive cable should be less than 1.5m in length. If longer, use an active cable. 
> - The cable needs to support no less than >1.5A. Otherwise you need to connect an external power supply.

Verify cable:

- Connect device via the cable to the host PC.
- Validate that all devices enumerate correctly in Windows device manager. Depth and RGB camera should appear as shown in the example below.

  ![Azure Kinect DK in Device Manager](./media/resources/hardware-specs-media/device-manager.png)

- Validate that cable can stream reliably on all sensors in the Azure Kinect Viewer, with the  following settings:

  - Depth camera: NFOV unbinned
  - RGB Camera: 2160p
  - Microphones and IMU enabled

## Power consumption

Azure Kinect DK consumes up to 5.9 W; specific power consumption is use-case dependent.

## Calibration

Azure Kinect DK is calibrated at the factory. The calibration parameters for visual and inertial sensors may be queried programmatically through the Sensor SDK.

## External synchronization

The device includes 3.5-mm synchronization jacks that can be used to link multiple units together. When linked, cameras can coordinate the timing of Depth and RGB camera triggering. There are specific sync-in and sync-out jacks on the device, enabling easy daisy chaining. A compatible cable isn't included in box and must be purchased separately.

Cable requirements:

- 3.5-mm tip male-to-male cable ("3.5-mm audio cable")
- Maximum cable length < 10 m
- Both stereo and mono cable are supported

When using multiple depth camera's in synchronized captures, depth camera captures should be offset from one another by 160us or more to avoid depth cameras interference.

## Device recovery

Device firmware can be reset to original firmware using button underneath the lock pin.
