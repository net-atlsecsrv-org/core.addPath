# Quickstart: Record Azure Kinect sensor streams to a file

This quickstart provides information about how you can use the [Azure Kinect recorder](azure-kinect-recorder.md) tool to record data streams from the Sensor SDK to a file.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes:

- You have the Azure Kinect DK connected to your host PC and powered properly.
- You have finished [setting up](set-up-azure-kinect-dk.md) the hardware.

## Create recording

1. Open a command prompt, and provide the path to the [Azure Kinect recorder](azure-kinect-recorder.md), located in the installed tools directory as `k4arecorder.exe`. For example: `C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect SDK\tools\k4arecorder.exe`.
2. Record 5 seconds.

    `k4arecorder.exe -l 5 %TEMP%\output.mkv`

3. By default, the recorder uses the NFOV Unbinned depth mode and outputs 1080p RGB at 30 fps including IMU data. For a complete overview of recording options and tips, refer to [Azure Kinect recorder](azure-kinect-recorder.md).

## Play back recording

You can use the [Azure Kinect Viewer](azure-kinect-viewer.md) to play back a recording.

1. Launch [`k4aviewer.exe`](azure-kinect-viewer.md)
2. Unfold the **Open Recording** tab and open your recording.
