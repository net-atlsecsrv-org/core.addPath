# Access Azure Kinect DK microphone input data

The [Speech SDK quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service) provide examples of how to use the Azure Kinect DK microphone array in various programming languages.
For example, see the **Recognize speech in C++ on Windows by using the Speech SDK** quickstart. The code is available [from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/cpp-windows).

Access the microphone array also through Windows API. See the following docs for details on Windows documentation:

* [Windows Audio architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/windows-audio-architecture)
* [Windows.Media.Capture documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture)
* [Tutorial for webcam capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/basic-photo-video-and-audio-capture-with-mediacapture)
* [USB audio information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/usb-2-0-audio-drivers)

You can also review the [microphone array hardware specification](hardware-specification.md#microphone-array).
