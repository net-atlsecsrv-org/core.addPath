# Common Power BI Workspace Collection scenarios

Power BI Workspace Collections is focused on exposing the majority of existing Power BI API functionality as part of an Azure service for you to develop your applications with.  Additionally, you are able to programmatically provision, develop, and deploy the necessary resources and Power BI content. To learn more, see [Get started with Microsoft Power BI Workspace Collections](get-started.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power BI Workspace Collections is deprecated and is available until June 2018 or when your contract indicates. You are encouraged to plan your migration to Power BI Embedded to avoid interruption in your application. For information on how to migrate your data to Power BI Embedded, see [How to migrate Power BI Workspace Collections content to Power BI Embedded](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded/).

Here are some scenarios for using **Power BI Workspace Collections** in your applications.

* Fully interactive reports that were authored in the Power BI Desktop can be embedded within your own application using a new application token authentication model.
* Independent software vendors and customers building customer facing applications can use the **Power BI Workspace Collection** service, and the Power BI SDK, to embed interactive reports. To learn how, see [Get started with Microsoft Power BI Workspace Collections](get-started.md).
* As a developer, you can use the Power BI visualization framework to create custom visualizations that can be used in your own app. See [Extend Power BI with custom visuals](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/custom-visuals/).
