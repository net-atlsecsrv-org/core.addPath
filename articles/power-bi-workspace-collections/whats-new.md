# What's new in Power BI Workspace Collections

Updates to **Power BI Workspace Collections** are released on a regular basis. However, not every release includes new user-facing features; some releases are focused on back-end service capabilities. We highlight new user-facing capabilities here.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power BI Workspace Collections is deprecated and is available until June 2018 or when your contract indicates. You are encouraged to plan your migration to Power BI Embedded to avoid interruption in your application.
