# Tutorial: Find and display routes for different modes of travel using Azure Maps

This tutorial shows you how to use the Azure Maps [Route service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) and [Map control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-map-control) to display route directions for both private vehicles and commercial vehicles (trucks) with `USHazmatClass2` cargo type . In addition, we'll walk you through how to visualize real-time traffic data on a map. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and display the Map control on a web page
> * Render real-time traffic data on a map
> * Request and display private and commercial vehicle routes on a map

## Prerequisites

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. [Create an Azure Maps account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-azure-maps-account).

3. [Obtain a primary subscription key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account), also known as the primary key or the subscription key. For more information on authentication in Azure Maps, see [manage authentication in Azure Maps](how-to-manage-authentication.md).

You can obtain the full source code for the sample [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/blob/master/AzureMapsCodeSamples/Tutorials/truckRoute.html). A live sample can be found [here](https://azuremapscodesamples.azurewebsites.net/?sample=Multiple%20routes%20by%20mode%20of%20travel).

## Create a new web page using the map control API

The following steps show you how to create and display the Map control in a web page.

1. On your local machine, create a new file and name it **MapTruckRoute.html**.
2. Copy/paste the following HTML markup into the file.

    ```HTML
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Map Route</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

        <!-- Add references to the Azure Maps Map control JavaScript and CSS files. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas.min.css" type="text/css">
        <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas.min.js"></script>

        <!-- Add a reference to the Azure Maps Services Module JavaScript file. -->
        <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/service/2/atlas-service.min.js"></script>

        <script>
            var map, datasource, client;

            function GetMap() {
                //Add Map Control JavaScript code here.
            }
        </script>
        <style>
            html,
            body {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
                padding: 0;
                margin: 0;
            }

            #myMap {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body onload="GetMap()">
        <div id="myMap"></div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

     The HTML header includes the CSS and JavaScript resource files hosted by the Azure Map Control library. The body's `onload` event calls the `GetMap` function. In the next step, we'll add the Map control initialization code.

3. Add the following JavaScript code to the `GetMap` function. Replace the string `<Your Azure Maps Key>` with the primary key that you copied from your Maps account.

    ```JavaScript
    //Instantiate a map object
    var map = new atlas.Map("myMap", {
        //Add your Azure Maps subscription key to the map SDK. Get an Azure Maps key at https://azure.com/maps
        authOptions: {
            authType: 'subscriptionKey',
            subscriptionKey: '<Your Azure Maps Key>'
        }
    });
    ```

4. Save the file and open it in your browser. A simple is displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-prioritized-routes/basic-map.png" alt-text="Basic map rendering of Map control":::

## Render real-time traffic data on a map

1. Append the following JavaScript code in the `GetMap` function. This code implements the Map control's `ready` event handler. The rest of the code in this tutorial will be placed inside the `ready` event handler.

    ```javascript
    map.events.add("ready", function() {
        // Add Traffic Flow to the Map
        map.setTraffic({
            flow: "relative"
        });
    });
    ```

    In the map `ready` event handler, the traffic flow setting on the map is set to `relative`, which is the speed of the road relative to free-flow. For more traffic options, see [TrafficOptions interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-maps-control/atlas.trafficoptions?view=azure-maps-typescript-latest&preserve-view=false).

2. Save the **MapTruckRoute.html** file and refresh the page in your browser. If you zoom into any city, like Los Angeles, you will see that the streets display with current traffic flow data.

## Define route display rendering

In this tutorial, two routes will be calculated and rendered on the map. The first route will be calculated for a private vehicle (car). The second route will be calculated for a commercial vehicle (truck) to show the difference between the results. When rendered, the map will display a symbol icon for the start and end points of the route, and route line geometries with different colors for each route path. For more information on adding line layers, see [Add a line layer to a map](map-add-line-layer.md). To learn more about symbol layers, see [Add a symbol layer to a map](map-add-pin.md).

1. In the Map control's `ready` event handler, append the following code.

    ```JavaScript

    //Create a data source and add it to the map.
    datasource = new atlas.source.DataSource();
    map.sources.add(datasource);

    //Add a layer for rendering the route lines and have it render under the map labels.
    map.layers.add(new atlas.layer.LineLayer(datasource, null, {
        strokeColor: ['get', 'strokeColor'],
        strokeWidth: ['get', 'strokeWidth'],
        lineJoin: 'round',
        lineCap: 'round'
    }), 'labels');

    //Add a layer for rendering point data.
    map.layers.add(new atlas.layer.SymbolLayer(datasource, null, {
        iconOptions: {
            image: ['get', 'icon'],
            allowOverlap: true
        },
        textOptions: {
            textField: ['get', 'title'],
            offset: [0, 1.2]
        },
        filter: ['any', ['==', ['geometry-type'], 'Point'], ['==', ['geometry-type'], 'MultiPoint']] //Only render Point or MultiPoints in this layer.
    }));

    ```


    In the Map control's `ready` event handler, a data source is created to store the route from start to finish. [Expressions](data-driven-style-expressions-web-sdk.md) are used to retrieve the line width and color from properties on the route line feature. To ensure that the route line doesn't cover up the road labels, we've passed a second parameter with the value of `'labels'`.

    Next, a symbol layer is created and attached to the data source. This layer specifies how the start and end points are rendered.Expressions have been added to retrieve the icon image and text label information from properties on each point object. To learn more about expressions, see [Data-driven style expressions](data-driven-style-expressions-web-sdk.md).

2. Set the start point as a fictitious company in Seattle called Fabrikam, and the end point as a Microsoft office.  In the Map control's `ready` event handler, append the following code.


    ```JavaScript
    //Create the GeoJSON objects which represent the start and end point of the route.
    var startPoint = new atlas.data.Feature(new atlas.data.Point([-122.356099, 47.580045]), {
        title: 'Fabrikam, Inc.',
        icon: 'pin-blue'
    });

    var endPoint = new atlas.data.Feature(new atlas.data.Point([-122.201164, 47.616940]), {
        title: 'Microsoft - Lincoln Square',
        icon: 'pin-round-blue'
    });

    //Add the data to the data source.
    datasource.add([startPoint, endPoint]);

    //Fit the map window to the bounding box defined by the start and end positions.
    map.setCamera({
        bounds: atlas.data.BoundingBox.fromData([startPoint, endPoint]),
        padding: 100
    });

    ```

    This code creates two [GeoJSON Point objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) to represent start and end points, which are then added to the data source.

    The last block of code sets the camera view using the latitude and longitude of the start and end points. The start and end points are added to the data source. The bounding box for the start and end points is calculated using the `atlas.data.BoundingBox.fromData` function. This bounding box is used to set the map cameras view over the entire route using the `map.setCamera` function. Padding is added to compensate for the pixel dimensions of the symbol icons. For more information about the Map control's setCamera property, see [setCamera(CameraOptions | CameraBoundsOptions & AnimationOptions)](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-maps-control/atlas.map?view=azure-maps-typescript-latest#setcamera-cameraoptions---cameraboundsoptions---animationoptions-&preserve-view=false) property.

3. Save **TruckRoute.html** and refresh your browser. The map is now centered over Seattle. The teardrop blue pin marks the start point. The round blue pin marks the end point.

## Request and display private and commercial vehicle routes on a map

This section shows you how to use the Azure Maps Route service to get directions from one point to another, based on your mode of transport. We'll be using two modes of transport: truck and car.

>[!TIP]
>The Route service provides APIs to plan *fastest*, *shortest*, *eco*, or *thrilling* routes based on distance, traffic conditions, and mode of transport used. The service also lets users plan future routes based on historical traffic conditions. Users can see the prediction of route durations for any given time. For more information, see [Get Route directions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections).

1. In the `GetMap` function, inside the control's `ready` event handler, add the following to the JavaScript code.

    ```JavaScript
    // Use SubscriptionKeyCredential with a subscription key
    var subscriptionKeyCredential = new atlas.service.SubscriptionKeyCredential(atlas.getSubscriptionKey());

    // Use subscriptionKeyCredential to create a pipeline
    var pipeline = atlas.service.MapsURL.newPipeline(subscriptionKeyCredential);

    // Construct the RouteURL object
    var routeURL = new atlas.service.RouteURL(pipeline);
    ```

   The `SubscriptionKeyCredential` creates a `SubscriptionKeyCredentialPolicy` to authenticate HTTP requests to Azure Maps with the subscription key. The `atlas.service.MapsURL.newPipeline()` takes in the `SubscriptionKeyCredential` policy and creates a [Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-maps-rest/atlas.service.pipeline) instance. The `routeURL` represents a URL to Azure Maps [Route](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) operations.

2. After setting up credentials and the URL, add the following JavaScript code to construct a truck route route from start to end point. This route is created and displayed for a truck carrying `USHazmatClass2` classed cargo.

    ```JavaScript
    //Start and end point input to the routeURL
    var coordinates= [[startPoint.geometry.coordinates[0], startPoint.geometry.coordinates[1]], [endPoint.geometry.coordinates[0], endPoint.geometry.coordinates[1]]];

    //Make a search route request for a truck vehicle type
    routeURL.calculateRouteDirections(atlas.service.Aborter.timeout(10000), coordinates,{
        travelMode: 'truck',
        vehicleWidth: 2,
        vehicleHeight: 2,
        vehicleLength: 5,
        vehicleLoadType: 'USHazmatClass2'
    }).then((directions) => {
        //Get data features from response
        var data = directions.geojson.getFeatures();

        //Get the route line and add some style properties to it.  
        var routeLine = data.features[0];
        routeLine.properties.strokeColor = '#2272B9';
        routeLine.properties.strokeWidth = 9;

        //Add the route line to the data source. We want this to render below the car route which will likely be added to the data source faster, so insert it at index 0.
        datasource.add(routeLine, 0);
    });
    ```

    The code above queries the Azure Maps Route service through the [Azure Maps Route Directions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-maps-rest/atlas.service.routeurl#calculateroutedirections-aborter--geojson-position----calculateroutedirectionsoptions-). The route line is then extracted from the GeoJSON feature collection from the response that is extracted using the `geojson.getFeatures()` method. Finally, the route line is added to the data source. We are adding it at the index of 0, to ensure that the truck route is rendered before any other lines in the data source, because the truck route calculation will often be slower than a car route calculation. If the truck route line is added to the data source after the car route, it will render above it. Two properties are added to the truck route line: a blue stroke color, and a stroke width of nine pixels.

    >[!TIP]
    > To see all possible options and values for the Azure Maps Route Directions API, see [URI Parameters for Post Route Directions](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/postroutedirections#uri-parameters).

3. Now append the following JavaScript code to construct a route for a car.

    ```JavaScript
    routeURL.calculateRouteDirections(atlas.service.Aborter.timeout(10000), coordinates).then((directions) => {

        //Get data features from response
        var data = directions.geojson.getFeatures();

        //Get the route line and add some style properties to it.  
        var routeLine = data.features[0];
        routeLine.properties.strokeColor = '#B76DAB';
        routeLine.properties.strokeWidth = 5;

        //Add the route line to the data source. This will add the car route after the truck route.  
        datasource.add(routeLine);
    });
    ```

    The code above queries the Azure Maps routing service through the  [Azure Maps Route Directions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-maps-rest/atlas.service.routeurl#calculateroutedirections-aborter--geojson-position----calculateroutedirectionsoptions-) method. The route line is then extracted from the GeoJSON feature collection from the response that is extracted using the `geojson.getFeatures()` method. Finally, the route line is added to the data source. Two properties are added to the truck route line: a purple stroke color, and a stroke width of five pixels.

4. Save the **TruckRoute.html** file and refresh your web browser. The map should now display the truck and car routes.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-prioritized-routes/prioritized-routes.png" alt-text="Private and commercial vehicle routes on a map with Azure Route Service":::

    The truck route is displayed using a thick blue line. The car route is displayed using a thin purple line. The car route goes across Lake Washington via I-90, passing through tunnels beneath residential areas. Because the tunnels are close to residential areas, hazardous waste cargo is restricted. The truck route, which specifies a `USHazmatClass2` cargo type, is directed to use a different highway.
