# Create a store locator by using Azure Maps

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a simple store locator by using Azure Maps. Store locators are common. Many of the concepts that are used in this type of application are applicable to many other types of applications. Offering a store locator to customers is a must for most businesses that sell directly to consumers. In this tutorial, you learn how to:
    
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a new webpage by using the Azure Map Control API.
> * Load custom data from a file and display it on a map.
> * Use the Azure Maps Search service to find an address or enter a query.
> * Get the user's location from the browser and show it on the map.
> * Combine multiple layers to create custom symbols on the map.  
> * Cluster data points.  
> * Add zoom controls to the map.

Jump ahead to the [live store locator example](https://azuremapscodesamples.azurewebsites.net/?sample=Simple%20Store%20Locator) or [source code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/tree/master/AzureMapsCodeSamples/Tutorials/Simple%20Store%20Locator). 

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you first need to [create your Azure Maps account](./tutorial-search-location.md#createaccount) and follow the steps in [get primary key](./tutorial-search-location.md#getkey) to get the primary subscription key for your account.

## Design

Before you jump into the code, it's a good idea to begin with a design. Your store locator can be as simple or complex as you want it to be. In this tutorial, we create a simple store locator. We include some tips along the way to help you extend some functionalities if you choose to. We create a store locator for a fictional company called Contoso Coffee. The following figure shows a wireframe of the general layout of the store locator we build in this tutorial:

<br/>

To maximize the usefulness of this store locator, we include a responsive layout that adjusts when a user's screen width is smaller than 700 pixels wide. A responsive layout makes it easy to use the store locator on a small screen, like on a mobile device. Here's a wireframe of a small-screen layout:  

<br/>

The wireframes show a fairly straightforward application. The application has a search box, a list of nearby stores, a map that has some markers (symbols), and a pop-up window that displays additional information when the user selects a marker. In more detail, here are the features we build into this store locator in this tutorial:

* All locations from the imported tab-delimited data file are loaded on the map.
* The user can pan and zoom the map, perform a search, and select the My Location GPS button.
* The page layout adjusts based on the width of the device screen.  
* A header shows the store logo.  
* The user can use a search box and search button to search for a location, such as an address, postal code, or city. 
* A `keypress` event added to the search box triggers a search if the user presses Enter. This functionality often is overlooked, but it creates a better user experience.
* When the map moves, the distance to each location from the center of the map is calculated. The results list is updated to display the closest locations at the top of the map.  
* When you select a result in the results list, the map is centered over the selected location and information about the location appears in a pop-up window.  
* Selecting a specific location on the map also triggers a pop-up window.
* When the user zooms out, locations are grouped in clusters. Clusters are represented by a circle with a number inside the circle. Clusters form and separate as the user changes the zoom level.
* Selecting a cluster zooms in on the map two levels and centers over the location of the cluster.

## Create the store location dataset

Before we develop a store locator application, we need to create a dataset of the stores we want to display on the map. In this tutorial, we use a dataset for a fictitious coffee shop called Contoso Coffee. The dataset for this simple store locator is managed in an Excel workbook. The dataset contains 10,213 Contoso Coffee coffee shop locations spread across nine countries/regions: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain. Here's a screenshot of what the data looks like:

<br/>
<center>

![Screenshot of the store locator data in an Excel workbook](./media/tutorial-create-store-locator/StoreLocatorDataSpreadsheet.png)</center>

You can [download the Excel workbook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/tree/master/AzureMapsCodeSamples/Tutorials/Simple%20Store%20Locator/data). 

Looking at the screenshot of the data, we can make the following observations:
    
* Location information is stored by using the **AddressLine**, **City**, **Municipality** (county), **AdminDivision** (state/province), **PostCode** (postal code), and **Country** columns.  
* The **Latitude** and **Longitude** columns contain the coordinates for each Contoso Coffee coffee shop location. If you don't have coordinates information, you can use the Search services in Azure Maps to determine the location coordinates.
* Some additional columns contain metadata related to the coffee shops: a phone number, Boolean columns for Wi-Fi hotspot and wheelchair accessibility, and store opening and closing times in 24-hour format. You can create your own columns that contain metadata that’s more relevant to your location data.

> [!Note]
> Azure Maps renders data in the spherical Mercator projection "EPSG:3857" but reads data in "EPSG:4325" that use the WGS84 datum. 

There are many ways to expose the dataset to the application. One approach is to load the data into a database and expose a web service that queries the data and sends the results to the user’s browser. This option is ideal for large datasets or for datasets that are updated frequently. However, this option requires significantly more development work and has a higher cost. 

Another approach is to convert this dataset into a flat text file that the browser can easily parse. The file itself can be hosted with the rest of the application. This option keeps things simple, but it's a good option only for smaller datasets because the user downloads all the data. We use the flat text file for this dataset because the data file size is smaller than 1 MB.  

To convert the workbook to a flat text file, save the workbook as a tab-delimited file. Each column is delimited by a tab character, which makes the columns easy to parse in our code. You could use comma-separated value (CSV) format, but that option requires more parsing logic. Any field that has a comma around it would be wrapped with quotation marks. To export this data as a tab-delimited file in Excel, select **Save As**. In the **Save as type** drop-down list, select **Text (Tab delimited)(*.txt)**. Name the file *ContosoCoffee.txt*.

If you open the text file in Notepad, it looks similar to the following figure:

## Set up the project

To create the project, you can use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or the code editor of your choice. In your project folder, create three files: *index.html*, *index.css*, and *index.js*. These files define the layout, style, and logic for the application. Create a folder named *data* and add *ContosoCoffee.txt* to the folder. Create another folder named *images*. We use ten images in this application for icons, buttons, and markers on the map. You can [download these images](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/tree/master/AzureMapsCodeSamples/Tutorials/Simple%20Store%20Locator/data). Your project folder should now look like the following figure:

<br/>
<center>

![Screenshot of the Simple Store Locator project folder](./media/tutorial-create-store-locator/StoreLocatorVSProject.png)</center>

## Create the user interface

To create the user interface, add code to *index.html*:

1. Add the following `meta` tags to the `head` of *index.html*. The tags define the character set (UTF-8), tell Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge to use the latest browser versions, and specify a viewport that works well for responsive layouts.

    ```HTML
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="IE=Edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    ```

1. Add references to the Azure Maps web control JavaScript and CSS files:

    ```HTML
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas.min.css" type="text/css">
    <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas.min.js"></script>
    ```

1. Add a reference to the Azure Maps Services module. The module is a JavaScript library that wraps the Azure Maps REST services and makes them easy to use in JavaScript. The module is useful for powering search functionality.

    ```HTML
    <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/service/2/atlas-service.min.js"></script>
    ```

1. Add references to *index.js* and *index.css*:

    ```HTML
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" type="text/css">
    <script src="index.js"></script>
    ```

1. In the body of the document, add a `header` tag. Inside the `header` tag, add the logo and company name.

    ```HTML
    <header>
        <img src="images/Logo.png" />
        <span>Contoso Coffee</span>
    </header>
    ```

1. Add a `main` tag and create a search panel that has a text box and search button. Also, add `div` references for the map, the list panel, and the My Location GPS button.

    ```HTML
    <main>
        <div class="searchPanel">
            <div>
                <input id="searchTbx" type="search" placeholder="Find a store" />
                <button id="searchBtn" title="Search"></button>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="listPanel"></div>
        <div id="myMap"></div>
        <button id="myLocationBtn" title="My Location"></button>
    </main>
    ```

When you're finished, *index.html* should look like [this example index.html file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/blob/master/AzureMapsCodeSamples/Tutorials/Simple%20Store%20Locator/index.html).

The next step is to define the CSS styles. CSS styles define how the application components are laid out and the application's appearance. Open *index.css* and add the following code to it. The `@media` style defines alternate style options to use when the screen width is smaller than 700 pixels.  

   ```CSS
    html, body {
        padding: 0;
        margin: 0;
        font-family: Gotham, Helvetica, sans-serif;

    }

    header {

    }
   ```

If you run the application now, you see the header, search box, and search button, but the map isn't visible because it hasn’t been loaded yet. If you try to do a search, nothing happens. We need to set up the JavaScript logic that's described in the next section to access all the functionality of the store locator.

## Wire the application with JavaScript

At this point, everything is set up in the user interface. Now, we need to add the JavaScript to load and parse the data, and then render the data on the map. To get started, open *index.js* and add code to it, as described in the following steps.

1. Add global options to make settings easier to update. Also, define variables for the map, a pop-up window, a data source, an icon layer, an HTML marker that displays the center of a search area, and an instance of the Azure Maps search service client.

    ```JavaScript
    //The maximum zoom level to cluster data point data on the map.
    var maxClusterZoomLevel = 11;

    //The URL to the store location data.
    var storeLocationDataUrl = 'data/ContosoCoffee.txt';

    //The URL to the icon image.
    var iconImageUrl = 'images/CoffeeIcon.png';
    var map, popup, datasource, iconLayer, centerMarker, searchURL;
    ```

1. Add code to *index.js*. The following code initializes the map, adds an [event listener](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-maps-control/atlas.map?view=azure-iot-typescript-latest#events) that waits until the page is finished loading, wires up events to monitor the loading of the map, and powers the search button and My Location button.

   When the user selects the search button, or when the user presses Enter after entering a location in the search box, a fuzzy search against the user's query is initiated. Pass in an array of country ISO 2 values to the `countrySet` option to limit the search results to those countries/regions. Limiting the countries/regions to search helps increase the accuracy of the results that are returned. 
  
   When the search is finished, take the first result and set the map camera over that area. When the user selects the My Location button, use the HTML5 Geolocation API that's built into the browser to retrieve the user's location and center the map over their location.  

   > [!Tip]
   > When you use pop-up windows, it's best to create a single `Popup` instance and reuse the instance by updating its content and position. For every `Popup`instance you add to your code, multiple DOM elements are added to the page. The more DOM elements there are on a page, the more things the browser has to keep track of. If there are too many items, the browser might become slow.

    ```JavaScript
    function initialize() {
        //Initialize a map instance.
        map = new atlas.Map('myMap', {
            center: [-90, 40],
            zoom: 2,

            //Add your Azure Maps primary subscription key to the map SDK.
            authOptions: {
                authType: 'subscriptionKey',
                subscriptionKey: '<Your Azure Maps Key>'
            }
        });

        //Create a pop-up window, but leave it closed so we can update it and display it later.
        popup = new atlas.Popup();

        //Use SubscriptionKeyCredential with a subscription key
        const subscriptionKeyCredential = new atlas.service.SubscriptionKeyCredential(atlas.getSubscriptionKey());

        //Use subscriptionKeyCredential to create a pipeline
        const pipeline = atlas.service.MapsURL.newPipeline(subscriptionKeyCredential, {
            retryOptions: { maxTries: 4 } // Retry options
        });

        //Create an instance of the SearchURL client.
        searchURL = new atlas.service.SearchURL(pipeline);

        //If the user selects the search button, geocode the value the user passed in.
        document.getElementById('searchBtn').onclick = performSearch;

        //If the user presses Enter in the search box, perform a search.
        document.getElementById('searchTbx').onkeyup = function(e) {
            if (e.keyCode === 13) {
                performSearch();
            }
        };

        //If the user selects the My Location button, use the Geolocation API to get the user's location. Center and zoom the map on that location.
        document.getElementById('myLocationBtn').onclick = setMapToUserLocation;

        //Wait until the map resources are ready.
        map.events.add('ready', function() {

			//Add your post-map load functionality.

        });
    }

    //Create an array of country ISO 2 values to limit searches to. 
    var countrySet = ['US', 'CA', 'GB', 'FR','DE','IT','ES','NL','DK'];

    function performSearch() {
        var query = document.getElementById('searchTbx').value;

        //Perform a fuzzy search on the users query.
        searchURL.searchFuzzy(atlas.service.Aborter.timeout(3000), query, {
            //Pass in the array of country ISO2 for which we want to limit the search to.
            countrySet: countrySet
        }).then(results => {
            //Parse the response into GeoJSON so that the map can understand.
            var data = results.geojson.getFeatures();

            if (data.features.length > 0) {
                //Set the camera to the bounds of the results.
                map.setCamera({
                    bounds: data.features[0].bbox,
                    padding: 40
                });
            } else {
                document.getElementById('listPanel').innerHTML = '<div class="statusMessage">Unable to find the location you searched for.</div>';
            }
        });
    }

    function setMapToUserLocation() {
        //Request the user's location.
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            //Convert the Geolocation API position to a longitude and latitude position value that the map can interpret and center the map over it.
            map.setCamera({
                center: [position.coords.longitude, position.coords.latitude],
                zoom: maxClusterZoomLevel + 1
            });
        }, function(error) {
            //If an error occurs when the API tries to access the user's position information, display an error message.
            switch (error.code) {
                case error.PERMISSION_DENIED:
                    alert('User denied the request for geolocation.');
                    break;
                case error.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE:
                    alert('Position information is unavailable.');
                    break;
                case error.TIMEOUT:
                    alert('The request to get user position timed out.');
                    break;
                case error.UNKNOWN_ERROR:
                    alert('An unknown error occurred.');
                    break;
            }
        });
    }

    //Initialize the application when the page is loaded.
    window.onload = initialize;
    ```

1. In the map's `ready` event listener, add a zoom control and an HTML marker to display the center of a search area.

    ```JavaScript
    //Add a zoom control to the map.
    map.controls.add(new atlas.control.ZoomControl(), {
        position: 'top-right'
    });

    //Add an HTML marker to the map to indicate the center to use for searching.
    centerMarker = new atlas.HtmlMarker({
        htmlContent: '<div class="mapCenterIcon"></div>',
        position: map.getCamera().center
    });

    map.markers.add(centerMarker);
    ```

1. In the map's `ready` event listener, add a data source. Then, make a call to load and parse the dataset. Enable clustering on the data source. Clustering on the data source groups overlapping points together in a cluster. The clusters separate into individual points as the user zooms in. This makes a more fluid user experience and improves performance.

    ```JavaScript
    //Create a data source, add it to the map, and then enable clustering.
    datasource = new atlas.source.DataSource(null, {
        cluster: true,
        clusterMaxZoom: maxClusterZoomLevel - 1
    });

    map.sources.add(datasource);

    //Load all the store data now that the data source is defined.  
    loadStoreData();
    ```

1. After you load the dataset in the map's `ready` event listener, define a set of layers to render the data. A bubble layer is used to render clustered data points. A symbol layer is used to render the number of points in each cluster above the bubble layer. A second symbol layer renders a custom icon for individual locations on the map.

   Add `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to the bubble and icon layers to change the mouse cursor when the user hovers over a cluster or icon on the map. Add a `click` event to the cluster bubble layer. This `click` event zooms the map in two levels and centers the map over a cluster when the user selects any cluster. Add a `click` event to the icon layer. This `click` event displays a pop-up window that shows the details of a coffee shop when a user selects an individual location icon. Add an event to the map to monitor when the map is finished moving. When this event fires, update the items in the list panel.  

    ```JavaScript
    //Create a bubble layer to render clustered data points.
    var clusterBubbleLayer = new atlas.layer.BubbleLayer(datasource, null, {
        radius: 12,
        color: '#007faa',
        strokeColor: 'white',
        strokeWidth: 2,
        filter: ['has', 'point_count'] //Only render data points that have a point_count property; clusters have this property.
    });

    //Create a symbol layer to render the count of locations in a cluster.
    var clusterLabelLayer = new atlas.layer.SymbolLayer(datasource, null, {
        iconOptions: {
            image: 'none' //Hide the icon image.
        },

        textOptions: {
            textField: ['get', 'point_count_abbreviated'],
            size: 12,
            font: ['StandardFont-Bold'],
            offset: [0, 0.4],
            color: 'white'
        }
    });

    map.layers.add([clusterBubbleLayer, clusterLabelLayer]);

    //Load a custom image icon into the map resources.
    map.imageSprite.add('myCustomIcon', iconImageUrl).then(function() {

    //Create a layer to render a coffee cup symbol above each bubble for an individual location.
    iconLayer = new atlas.layer.SymbolLayer(datasource, null, {
        iconOptions: {
            //Pass in the ID of the custom icon that was loaded into the map resources.
            image: 'myCustomIcon',

            //Optionally, scale the size of the icon.
            font: ['SegoeUi-Bold'],

            //Anchor the center of the icon image to the coordinate.
            anchor: 'center',

            //Allow the icons to overlap.
            allowOverlap: true
        },

        filter: ['!', ['has', 'point_count']] //Filter out clustered points from this layer.
    });

    map.layers.add(iconLayer);

    //When the mouse is over the cluster and icon layers, change the cursor to a pointer.
    map.events.add('mouseover', [clusterBubbleLayer, iconLayer], function() {
        map.getCanvasContainer().style.cursor = 'pointer';
    });

    //When the mouse leaves the item on the cluster and icon layers, change the cursor back to the default (grab).
    map.events.add('mouseout', [clusterBubbleLayer, iconLayer], function() {
        map.getCanvasContainer().style.cursor = 'grab';
    });

    //Add a click event to the cluster layer. When the user selects a cluster, zoom into it by two levels.  
    map.events.add('click', clusterBubbleLayer, function(e) {
        map.setCamera({
            center: e.position,
            zoom: map.getCamera().zoom + 2
        });
    });

    //Add a click event to the icon layer and show the shape that was selected.
    map.events.add('click', iconLayer, function(e) {
        showPopup(e.shapes[0]);
    });

    //Add an event to monitor when the map is finished rendering the map after it has moved.
    map.events.add('render', function() {
        //Update the data in the list.
        updateListItems();
    });
    ```

1. When the coffee shop dataset is loaded, it must first be downloaded. Then, the text file must be split into lines. The first line contains the header information. To make the code easier to follow, we parse the header into an object, which we can then use to look up the cell index of each property. After the first line, loop through the remaining lines and create a point feature. Add the point feature to the data source. Finally, update the list panel.

    ```JavaScript
    function loadStoreData() {

    //Download the store location data.
    fetch(storeLocationDataUrl)
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(function(text) {

            //Parse the tab-delimited file data into GeoJSON features.
            var features = [];

            //Split the lines of the file.
            var lines = text.split('\n');

            //Grab the header row.
            var row = lines[0].split('\t');

            //Parse the header row and index each column to make the code for parsing each row easier to follow.
            var header = {};
            var numColumns = row.length;
            for (var i = 0; i < row.length; i++) {
                header[row[i]] = i;
            }

            //Skip the header row and then parse each row into a GeoJSON feature.
            for (var i = 1; i < lines.length; i++) {
                row = lines[i].split('\t');

                //Ensure that the row has the correct number of columns.
                if (row.length >= numColumns) {

                    features.push(new atlas.data.Feature(new atlas.data.Point([parseFloat(row[header['Longitude']]), parseFloat(row[header['Latitude']])]), {
                        AddressLine: row[header['AddressLine']],
                        City: row[header['City']],
                        Municipality: row[header['Municipality']],
                        AdminDivision: row[header['AdminDivision']],
                        Country: row[header['Country']],
                        PostCode: row[header['PostCode']],
                        Phone: row[header['Phone']],
                        StoreType: row[header['StoreType']],
                        IsWiFiHotSpot: (row[header['IsWiFiHotSpot']].toLowerCase() === 'true') ? true : false,
                        IsWheelchairAccessible: (row[header['IsWheelchairAccessible']].toLowerCase() === 'true') ? true : false,
                        Opens: parseInt(row[header['Opens']]),
                        Closes: parseInt(row[header['Closes']])
                    }));
                }
            }

            //Add the features to the data source.
            datasource.add(new atlas.data.FeatureCollection(features));

            //Initially, update the list items.
            updateListItems();
        });
    }
    ```

1. When the list panel is updated, the distance from the center of the map to all point features in the current map view is calculated. The features are then sorted by distance. HTML is generated to display each location in the list panel.

    ```JavaScript
    var listItemTemplate = '<div class="listItem" onclick="itemSelected(\'{id}\')"><div class="listItem-title">{title}</div>{city}<br />Open until {closes}<br />{distance} miles away</div>';

    function updateListItems() {
        //Hide the center marker.
        centerMarker.setOptions({
            visible: false
        });

        //Get the current camera and view information for the map.
        var camera = map.getCamera();
        var listPanel = document.getElementById('listPanel');

        //Check to see whether the user is zoomed out a substantial distance. If they are, tell the user to zoom in and to perform a search or select the My Location button.
        if (camera.zoom < maxClusterZoomLevel) {
            //Close the pop-up window; clusters might be displayed on the map.  
            popup.close(); 
            listPanel.innerHTML = '<div class="statusMessage">Search for a location, zoom the map, or select the My Location button to see individual locations.</div>';
        } else {
            //Update the location of the centerMarker property.
            centerMarker.setOptions({
                position: camera.center,
                visible: true
            });

            //List the ten closest locations in the side panel.
            var html = [], properties;

            });

            listPanel.innerHTML = html.join('');

1. When the user selects an item in the list panel, the shape to which the item is related is retrieved from the data source. A pop-up window is generated that's based on the property information stored in the shape. The map is centered over the shape. If the map is less than 700 pixels wide, the map view is offset so the pop-up window is visible.

    ```JavaScript
    //When a user selects a result in the side panel, look up the shape by its ID value and display the pop-up window.
    function itemSelected(id) {
        //Get the shape from the data source by using its ID.  
        var shape = datasource.getShapeById(id);
        showPopup(shape);

        //Center the map over the shape on the map.
        var center = shape.getCoordinates();
        var offset;

        //If the map is less than 700 pixels wide, then the layout is set for small screens.
        if (map.getCanvas().width < 700) {
            //When the map is small, offset the center of the map relative to the shape so that there is room for the popup to appear.
            offset = [0, -80];
        }

        map.setCamera({
            center: center,
            centerOffset: offset
        });
    }

    function showPopup(shape) {
        var properties = shape.getProperties();

        /* Generating HTML for the pop-up window that looks like this:

        );

            }

                html.push('<img src="images/WheelChair-small.png" title="Wheelchair Accessible"/>');

        });

        //Open the pop-up window.
        popup.open(map);
    }
    ```

Now, you have a fully functional store locator. In a web browser, open the *index.html* file for the store locator. When the clusters appear on the map, you can search for a location by using the search box, by selecting the My Location button, by selecting a cluster, or by zooming in on the map to see individual locations.

The first time a user selects the My Location button, the browser displays a security warning that asks for permission to access the user’s location. If the user agrees to share their location, the map zooms in on the user's location, and nearby coffee shops are shown. 

<br/>
<center>

![Screenshot of the browser's request to access the user's location](./media/tutorial-create-store-locator/GeolocationApiWarning.png)</center>

When you zoom in close enough in an area that has coffee shop locations, the clusters separate into individual locations. Select one of the icons on the map or select an item in the side panel to see a pop-up window that shows information for that location.

<br/>
<center>

![Screenshot of the finished store locator](./media/tutorial-create-store-locator/FinishedSimpleStoreLocator.png)</center>

If you resize the browser window to less than 700 pixels wide or open the application on a mobile device, the layout changes to be better suited for smaller screens.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learn how to create a basic store locator by using Azure Maps. The store locator you create in this tutorial might have all the functionality you need. You can add features to your store locator or use more advance features for a more custom user experience: 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Enable [suggestions as you type](https://azuremapscodesamples.azurewebsites.net/?sample=Search%20Autosuggest%20and%20JQuery%20UI) in the search box.  
> * Add [support for multiple languages](https://azuremapscodesamples.azurewebsites.net/?sample=Map%20Localization). 
> * Allow the user to [filter locations along a route](https://azuremapscodesamples.azurewebsites.net/?sample=Filter%20Data%20Along%20Route). 
> * Add the ability to [set filters](https://azuremapscodesamples.azurewebsites.net/?sample=Filter%20Symbols%20by%20Property). 
> * Add support to specify an initial search value by using a query string. When you include this option in your store locator, users can bookmark and share searches. It  also provides an easy method for you to pass searches to this page from another page.  
> * Deploy your store locator as an [Azure App Service Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html). 
> * Store your data in a database and search for nearby locations. To learn more, see the [SQL Server spatial data types overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/spatial/spatial-data-types-overview?view=sql-server-2017) and [Query spatial data for the nearest neighbor](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/spatial/query-spatial-data-for-nearest-neighbor?view=sql-server-2017).
