# Drawing package requirements

You can convert uploaded Drawing packages into map data by using the [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion). This article describes the Drawing package requirements for the Conversion API. To view a sample package, you can download the sample [Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

## Prerequisites

The Drawing package includes drawings saved in DWG format, which is the native file format for Autodesk's AutoCADÂ® software.

You can choose any CAD software to produce the drawings in the Drawing package.  

The [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion) converts the Drawing package into map data. The Conversion service works with the AutoCAD DWG file format. `AC1032` is the internal format version for the DWG files, and it's a good idea to select `AC1032` for the internal DWG file format version.  

## Glossary of terms

For easy reference, here are some terms and definitions that are important as you read this article.

| Term  | Definition |
|:-------|:------------|
| Layer | An AutoCAD DWG layer.|
| Level | An area of a building at a set elevation. For example, the floor of a building. |
| Xref  |A file in AutoCAD DWG file format (.dwg), attached to the primary drawing as an external reference.  |
| Feature | An object that combines a geometry with additional metadata information. |
| Feature classes | A common blueprint for features. For example, a *unit* is a feature class, and an *office* is a feature. |

## Drawing package structure

A Drawing package is a .zip archive that contains the following files:

* DWG files in AutoCAD DWG file format.
* A _manifest.json_ file for a single facility.

You can organize the DWG files in any way inside the folder, but the manifest file must live at the root directory of the folder. You must zip the folder in a single archive file, with a .zip extension. The next sections detail the requirements for the DWG files, the manifest file, and the content of these files.  

## DWG files requirements

A single DWG file is required for each level of the facility. The level's data must be contained in a single DWG file. Any external references (_xrefs_) must be bound to the parent drawing. Additionally, each DWG file:

* Must define the _Exterior_ and _Unit_ layers. It can optionally define the following optional layers: _Wall_, _Door_, _UnitLabel_, _Zone_, and _ZoneLabel_.
* Must not contain features from multiple levels.
* Must not contain features from multiple facilities.

The [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion) can extract the following feature classes from a DWG file:

* Levels
* Units
* Zones
* Openings
* Walls
* Vertical penetrations

All conversion jobs result in a minimal set of default categories: room, structure.wall, opening.door, zone, and facility. Additional categories are for each category name referenced by objects.  

A DWG layer must contain features of a single class. Classes must not share a layer. For example, units and walls can't share a layer.

DWG layers must also follow the following criteria:

* The origins of drawings for all DWG files must align to the same latitude and longitude.
* Each level must be in the same orientation as the other levels.
* Self-intersecting polygons are automatically repaired, and the [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion) raises a warning. You should manually inspect the repaired results, because they might not match the expected results.

All layer entities must be one of the following types: Line, PolyLine, Polygon, Circular Arc, Circle, or Text (single line). Any other entity types are ignored.

The following table outlines the supported entity types and supported features for each layer. If a layer contains unsupported entity types, then the [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion) ignores these entities.  

| Layer | Entity types | Features |
| :----- | :-------------------| :-------
| [Exterior](#exterior-layer) | Polygon, PolyLine (closed), Circle | Levels
| [Unit](#unit-layer) |  Polygon, PolyLine (closed), Circle | Vertical penetrations, Units
| [Wall](#wall-layer)  | Polygon, PolyLine (closed), Circle | Not applicable. For more information, see the [Wall layer](#wall-layer).
| [Door](#door-layer) | Polygon, PolyLine, Line, CircularArc, Circle | Openings
| [Zone](#zone-layer) | Polygon, PolyLine (closed), Circle | Zone
| [UnitLabel](#unitlabel-layer) | Text (single line) | Not applicable. This layer can only add properties to the unit features from the Units layer. For more information, see the [UnitLabel layer](#unitlabel-layer).
| [ZoneLabel](#zonelabel-layer) | Text (single line) | Not applicable. This layer can only add properties to zone features from the ZonesLayer. For more information, see the [ZoneLabel layer](#zonelabel-layer).

The next sections detail the requirements for each layer.

### Exterior layer

The DWG file for each level must contain a layer to define that level's perimeter. This layer is referred to as the *exterior* layer. For example, if a facility contains two levels, then it needs to have two DWG files, with an exterior layer for each file.

No matter how many entity drawings are in the exterior layer, the [resulting facility dataset](tutorial-creator-indoor-maps.md#create-a-feature-stateset) will contain only one level feature for each DWG file. Additionally:

* Exteriors must be drawn as Polygon, PolyLine (closed), or Circle.
* Exteriors can overlap, but are dissolved into one geometry.

If the layer contains multiple overlapping PolyLines, the PolyLines are dissolved into a single Level feature. Alternatively, if the layer contains multiple non-overlapping PolyLines, the resulting Level feature has a multi-polygonal representation.

You can see an example of the Exterior layer as the outline layer in the [sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

### Unit layer

The DWG file for each level defines a layer containing units. Units are navigable spaces in the building, such as offices, hallways, stairs, and elevators. The Units layer should adhere to the following requirements:

* Units must be drawn as Polygon, PolyLine (closed), or Circle.
* Units must fall inside the bounds of the facility exterior perimeter.
* Units must not partially overlap.
* Units must not contain any self-intersecting geometry.

Name a unit by creating a text object in the UnitLabel layer, and then place the object inside the bounds of the unit. For more information, see the [UnitLabel layer](#unitlabel-layer).

You can see an example of the Units layer in the [sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

### Wall layer

The DWG file for each level can contain a layer that defines the physical extents of walls, columns, and other building structure.

* Walls must be drawn as Polygon, PolyLine (closed), or Circle.
* The wall layer or layers should only contain geometry that's interpreted as building structure.

You can see an example of the Walls layer in the [sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

### Door layer

You can include a DWG layer that contains doors. Each door must overlap the edge of a unit from the Unit layer.

Door openings in an Azure Maps dataset are represented as a single-line segment that overlaps multiple unit boundaries. The following images show how to convert geometry in the Door layer to opening features in a dataset.

![Four graphics that show the steps to generate openings](./media/drawing-requirements/opening-steps.png)

### Zone layer

The DWG file for each level can contain a Zone layer that defines the physical extents of zones. A zone can be an indoor empty space or a back yard.

* Zones must be drawn as Polygon, PolyLine (closed), or Circle.
* Zones can overlap.
* Zones can fall inside or outside the facility's exterior perimeter.

Name a zone by creating a text object in the ZoneLabel layer, and placing the text object inside the bounds of the zone. For more information, see [ZoneLabel layer](#zonelabel-layer).

You can see an example of the Zone layer in the [sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

### UnitLabel layer

The DWG file for each level can contain a UnitLabel layer. The UnitLabel layer adds a name property to units extracted from the Unit layer. Units with a name property can have additional details specified in the manifest file.

* Unit labels must be single-line text entities.
* Unit labels must fall inside the bounds of their unit.
* Units must not contain multiple text entities in the UnitLabel layer.

You can see an example of the UnitLabel layer in the [sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

### ZoneLabel layer

The DWG file for each level can contain a ZoneLabel layer. This layer adds a name property to zones extracted from the Zone layer. Zones with a name property can have additional details specified in the manifest file.

* Zones labels must be single-line text entities.
* Zones labels must fall inside the bounds of their zone.
* Zones must not contain multiple text entities in the ZoneLabel layer.

You can see an example of the ZoneLabel layer in the [sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples).

## Manifest file requirements

The zip folder must contain a manifest file at the root level of the directory, and the file must be named **manifest.json**. It describes the DWG files to allow the [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion) to parse their content. Only the files identified by the manifest are ingested. Files that are in the zip folder, but aren't properly listed in the manifest, are ignored.

The file paths in the `buildingLevels` object of the manifest file must be relative to the root of the zip folder. The DWG file name must exactly match the name of the facility level. For example, a DWG file for the "Basement" level is "Basement.dwg." A DWG file for level 2 is named as "level_2.dwg." Use an underscore, if your level name has a space.

Although there are requirements when you use the manifest objects, not all objects are required. The following table shows the required and optional objects for version 1.1 of the [Azure Maps Conversion service](/rest/api/maps/conversion).
