## Azure Maps supported views

> [!Note]
> On August 1, 2019, Azure Maps was released in the following countries/regions:
>  * Argentina
>  * India
>  * Morocco
>  * Pakistan
>
> After August 1, 2019, the **View** parameter will define the returned map content for the new regions/countries listed above. Azure Maps **View** parameter (also referred to as “user region parameter”) is a two letter ISO-3166 Country Code that will show the correct maps for that country/region specifying which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including borders and labels displayed on the map. 

Make sure you set up the **View** parameter as required for the REST APIs and the SDKs, which your services are using.

>  Ensure that you have set up the **View** parameter as required, and you have the latest version of Web SDK and Android SDK. Affected SDKs:

By default, the View parameter is set to **Unified**, even if you haven’t defined it in the request. Determine the location of your users. Then, set the **View** parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you can set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP address of the request.  The **View** parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those laws about mapping of the country where maps, images, and other data and third-party content that you're authorized to access via Azure Maps is made available.
