# Request real-time public transit data using the Azure Maps Mobility Service

This article shows you how to use Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService) to request real-time public transit data.

In this article, you will learn how to request next real-time arrivals for all lines arriving at a given stop

## Prerequisites

You first need to have an Azure Maps account and a subscription key to make any calls to the Azure Maps public transit APIs. For information, follow instructions in [Create an account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-azure-maps-account) to create an Azure Maps account. Follow the steps in [get primary key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account) to obtain the primary key for your account. For more information on authentication in Azure Maps, see [manage authentication in Azure Maps](./how-to-manage-authentication.md).

This article uses the [Postman app](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to build REST calls. You can use any API development environment that you prefer.

## Request real-time arrivals for a stop

In order to request real-time arrivals data of a particular public transit stop, you'll need to make request to the [Real-time Arrivals API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityRealTimeArrivals) of the Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService). You'll need the **metroID** and **stopID** to complete the request. To learn more about how to request these parameters, see our guide on how to [request public transit routes](https://aka.ms/AMapsHowToGuidePublicTransitRouting).

Let's use "522" as our metro ID, which is the metro ID for the  "Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA" area. Use "522---2060603" as the stop ID, this bus stop is at "Ne 24th St & 162nd Ave Ne, Bellevue WA". To request the next five real-time arrivals data, for all next live arrivals at this stop, complete the following steps:

1. Open the Postman app, and let's create a collection to store the requests. Near the top of the Postman app, select **New**. In the **Create New** window, select **Collection**.  Name the collection and select the **Create** button.

2. To create the request, select **New** again. In the **Create New** window, select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request. Select the collection you created in the previous step, as the location in which to save the request. Then, select **Save**.

3. Select the **GET** HTTP method on the builder tab and enter the following URL to create a GET request. Replace `{subscription-key}`, with your Azure Maps primary key.

    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/realtime/arrivals/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&metroId=522&query=522---2060603&transitType=bus
    ```

4. After a successful request, you'll receive the following response.  Notice that parameter 'scheduleType' defines whether the estimated arrival time is based on real-time or static data.

    ```JSON
    {
        "results": [
