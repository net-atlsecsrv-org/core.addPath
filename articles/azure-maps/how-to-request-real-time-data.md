# Request real-time data using the Azure Maps Mobility Service

This article shows you how to use Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService) to request real-time transit data.

In this article you'll learn how to:


 * Request next real-time arrivals for all lines arriving at a given stop
 * Request real-time information for a given bike docking station.


## Prerequisites

You first need to have an Azure Maps account and a subscription key to make any calls to the Azure Maps public transit APIs. For information, follow instructions in [Create an account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-account-with-azure-maps) to create an Azure Maps account. Follow the steps in [get primary key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account) to obtain the primary key for your account. For more information on authentication in Azure Maps, see [manage authentication in Azure Maps](./how-to-manage-authentication.md).


This article uses the [Postman app](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to build REST calls. You can use any API development environment that you prefer.


## Request real-time arrivals for a stop

In order to request real-time arrivals data of a particular public transit stop, you'll need to make request to the [Real-time Arrivals API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityRealTimeArrivals) of the Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService). You'll need the **metroID** and **stopID** to complete the request. To learn more about how to request these parameters, see our guide on how to [request public transit routes](https://aka.ms/AMapsHowToGuidePublicTransitRouting). 

Let's use "522" as our metro ID, which is the metro ID for the  "Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA" area. Use "522---2060603" as the stop ID, this bus stop is at "Ne 24th St & 162nd Ave Ne, Bellevue WA". To request the next five real-time arrivals data, for all next live arrivals at this stop, complete the following steps:

1. Open the Postman app, and let's create a collection to store the requests. Near the top of the Postman app, select **New**. In the **Create New** window, select **Collection**.  Name the collection and select the **Create** button.

2. To create the request, select **New** again. In the **Create New** window, select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request. Select the collection you created in the previous step, as the location in which to save the request. Then, select **Save**.

3. Select the **GET** HTTP method on the builder tab and enter the following URL to create a GET request. Replace `{subscription-key}`, with your Azure Maps primary key.

    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/realtime/arrivals/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&metroId=522&query=522---2060603&transitType=bus
    ```

4. After a successful request, you'll receive the following response.  Notice that parameter 'scheduleType' defines whether the estimated arrival time is based on real-time or static data.

    ```JSON
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "arrivalMinutes": 8,

    }
    ```


## Real-time data for bike docking station

The [Get Transit Dock Info API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityTransitDock) allows users to request static and real-time information. For example, users can request availability and vacancy information for a bike, or a scooter docking station. The [Get Transit Dock Info API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityTransitDock) is also part of the Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService).

In order to make a request to the [Get Transit Dock Info API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityTransitDock), you'll need the **dockId** for that station. You can get the dock ID by making a search request to the [Get Nearby Transit API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityNearbyTransit) with the **objectType** parameter assigned to "bikeDock". Follow the steps below to get real-time data of a docking station for bikes.


### Get dock ID

To get **dockID**, follow the steps below to make a request to the Get Nearby Transit API:

1. In Postman, click **New Request** | **GET request** and name it **Get dock ID**.

2.  On the Builder tab, select the **GET** HTTP method, enter the following request URL, and click **Send**.
 
    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/transit/nearby/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&metroId=121&query=40.7663753,-73.9627498&radius=100&objectType=bikeDock
    ```

3. After a successful request, you'll receive the following response. Notice that we now have the **id** in the response, which can be used later as a query parameter in the request to the Get Transit Dock Info API.

    ```JSON
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "id": "121---4640799",
                "type": "bikeDock",
                "objectDetails": {
                    "availableVehicles": 0,
                    "vacantLocations": 31,
                    "lastUpdated": "2019-09-07T00:55:19Z",
                    "operatorInfo": {
                        "id": "121---80",
                        "name": "Citi Bike"
                    }
                },
                "position": {
                    "latitude": 40.767128,
                    "longitude": -73.962243
                },
                "viewport": {
                    "topLeftPoint": {
                        "latitude": 40.768039,
                        "longitude": -73.963413
                    },
                    "btmRightPoint": {
                        "latitude": 40.766216,
                        "longitude": -73.961072
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```


### Get real-time bike dock status

Follow the steps below to make a request to the Get Transit Dock Info API to get real-time data for the selected dock.

1. In Postman, click **New Request** | **GET request** and name it **Get real-time dock data**.

2.  On the Builder tab, select the **GET** HTTP method, enter the following request URL, and click **Send**.
 
    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/transit/dock/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&query=121---4640799
    ```

3. After a successful request, you'll receive a response of the following structure:

    ```JSON
    {
        "availableVehicles": 0,
        "vacantLocations": 31,
        "position": {
            "latitude": 40.767128,
            "longitude": -73.962246
        },
        "lastUpdated": "2019-09-07T00:55:19Z",
        "operatorInfo": {
            "id": "121---80",
            "name": "Citi Bike"
        }
    }
    ```
