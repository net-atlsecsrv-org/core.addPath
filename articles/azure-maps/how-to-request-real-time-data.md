# Request real-time data using the Azure Maps Mobility Service

This article shows you how to use Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService) to request real-time transit data.

In this article you will learn how to:


 * Request next real-time arrivals for all lines arriving at the given stop
 * Request real-time information for a given bike docking station.


## Prerequisites

To make any calls to the Azure Maps public transit APIs, you need a Maps account and key. For information on creating an account and retrieving a key, see [How to manage your Azure Maps account and keys](how-to-manage-account-keys.md).

This article uses the [Postman app](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to build REST calls. You can use any API development environment that you prefer.


## Request real-time arrivals for a stop

In order to request real-time arrivals data for a particular public transit stop, you will need to make a request to the [Real-time Arrivals API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityRealTimeArrivals) of the Azure Maps [Mobility Service](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityService). You will need the **metroID** and **stopID** to complete the request. To learn more about how to request these parameters, see our How-to guide to [request public transit routes](https://aka.ms/AMapsHowToGuidePublicTransitRouting). 

Let's use "522" as our metro ID, which is the metro ID for "Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA" area, and use the stop ID "2060603", which is a bus stop at "Ne 24th St & 162nd Ave Ne, Bellevue WA". To request next five real-time arrivals data for all next live arrivals at this stop, complete the following steps:

1. Create a collection in which to store the requests. In the Postman app, select **New**. In the **Create New** window, select **Collection**. Name the collection and select the **Create** button.

2. To create the request, select **New** again. In the **Create New** window, select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request, select the collection you created in the previous step as the location in which to save the request, and then select **Save**.

3. Select the GET HTTP method on the builder tab and enter the following URL to create a GET request.

    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/realtime/arrivals/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&metroId=522&query=2060603&transitType=bus
    ```

4. After a successful request, you will receive the following response.  Notice that parameter 'scheduleType' defines whether the estimated arrival time is based on real-time or static data.

    ```JSON
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "arrivalMinutes": 4,

                        "longitude": -122.125275
                    },

            }
        ]
    }


## Real-time data for bike docking station

The [Get Transit Dock Info API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityTransitDock) of the Azure Maps Mobility Service, allows to request static and real-time information such as availability and vacancy information for a given bike or scooter docking station. We will make a request to get real-time data for a docking station for bikes.

In order to make a request to the Get Transit Dock Info API, you will need the **dockId** for that station. You can get the dock ID by making a search request to the [Get Nearby Transit API](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsMobilityNearbyTransit) and setting the **objectType** parameter to "bikeDock". Follow the steps below to get real-time data of a docking station for bikes.


### Get dock ID

To get **dockID**, follow the steps below to make a request to the Get Nearby Transit API:

1. In Postman, click **New Request** | **GET request** and name it **Get dock ID**.

2.  On the Builder tab, select the **GET** HTTP method, enter the following request URL, and click **Send**.
 
    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/transit/nearby/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&metroId=121&query=40.7663753,-73.9627498&radius=100&objectType=bikeDock
    ```

3. After a successful request, you will receive the following response. Notice that we now have the **id** in the response, which can be used later as a query parameter in the request to the Get Transit Dock Info API.

    ```JSON
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "id": "121---4640799",
                "type": "bikeDock",
                "objectDetails": {
                    "availableVehicles": 0,
                    "vacantLocations": 30,
                    "lastUpdated": "2019-05-21T20:06:59-04:00",
                    "operatorInfo": {
                        "id": "80",
                        "name": "Citi Bike"
                    }
                },
                "position": {
                    "latitude": 40.767128,
                    "longitude": -73.962243
                },
                "viewport": {
                    "topLeftPoint": {
                        "latitude": 40.768039,
                        "longitude": -73.963413
                    },
                    "btmRightPoint": {
                        "latitude": 40.766216,
                        "longitude": -73.961072
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```


### Get real-time bike dock status

Follow the steps below to make a request to the Get Transit Dock Info API to get real-time data for the selected dock.

1. In Postman, click **New Request** | **GET request** and name it **Get real-time dock data**.

2.  On the Builder tab, select the **GET** HTTP method, enter the following request URL, and click **Send**.
 
    ```HTTP
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mobility/transit/dock/json?subscription-key={subscription-key}&api-version=1.0&query=121---4640799
    ```

3. After a successful request, you will receive a response of the following structure:

    ```JSON
    {
        "availableVehicles": 1,
        "vacantLocations": 29,
        "position": {
            "latitude": 40.767128,
            "longitude": -73.962246
        },
        "lastUpdated": "2019-05-21T20:26:47-04:00",
        "operatorInfo": {
            "id": "80",
            "name": "Citi Bike"
        }
    }
    ```
