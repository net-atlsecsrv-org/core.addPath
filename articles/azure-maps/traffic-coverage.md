# Azure Maps traffic coverage

Azure Maps provides rich traffic information in the form of traffic **flow** and **incidents**. This data can be visualized on maps or used to generate smarter routes that factor in real driving conditions.

However, Maps doesn't have the same level of information and accuracy for all countries or regions. The following table provides information about what kind of traffic information you can request from each country or region:
