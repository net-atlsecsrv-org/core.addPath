# Azure Maps geocoding coverage

The Azure Maps [Search service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search) supports geocoding, which means that your API request can have search terms, like an address or the name of a place, and returns the result as latitude and longitude coordinates. For example, the Azure Maps [Get Search Address API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress) receives queries that contain location information, and returns results as latitude and longitude coordinates.

However, the Azure Maps [Search service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search) doesn't have the same level of information and accuracy for all regions and countries. Use this article to determine what kind of locations you can reliably search for in each region.

The ability to geocode in a country/region is dependent upon the road data coverage and geocoding precision of the geocoding service. The following categorizations are used to specify the level of geocoding support in each country/region.

* **Address points** - Address data can be resolved to latitude/longitude coordinates within the address parcel (property boundary). Address points are often referred to as being 'Rooftop' accurate, which is the highest level of accuracy available for addresses.
* **House numbers** - Addresses are interpolated to a latitude/longitude coordinate on the street.
* **Street level** - Addresses are resolved to the latitude/longitude coordinate of the street that contains the address. The house number may not be processed.
* **City level** - City place names are supported.
