# Azure Maps render coverage

Azure Maps uses both raster tiles and vector tiles to create maps. At the lowest resolution, the entire world fits in a single tile. At the highest resolution, a single tile represents 38 square meters. You'll see more details about continents, regions, cities, and individual streets as you zoom in the map. For more information about tiles, see [Zoom levels and tile grid](zoom-levels-and-tile-grid.md).

However, Maps doesn't have the same level of information and accuracy for all regions. The following tables detail the level of information you can render for each region.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✓ | Region is represented with detailed data.   |
| Ø | Region is represented with simplified data. |
