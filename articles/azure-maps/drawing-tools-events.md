# Drawing tool events

When using drawing tools on a map, it is often useful to react to certain events as the user draws on the map. The following table lists all of the events supported by the `DrawingManager` class.

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `drawingchanged` | Fired when any coordinate in a shape has been added or changed. | 
| `drawingchanging` | Fired when any preview coordinate for a shape is being displayed. For example, will fire multiple times as a coordinate is dragged. | 
| `drawingcomplete` | Fired when a shape has finished being drawn or taken out of edit mode. |
| `drawingmodechanged` | Fired when the drawing mode has changed. The new drawing mode is passed into the event handler. |
| `drawingstarted` | Fired when the user starts drawing a shape or puts a shape into edit mode.  |

The following code shows how the events in the Drawing Tools module work. Draw shapes on the map and watch as the events fire.

## Examples

The following are examples of some common scenarios that use the drawing tools events.

### Select points in polygon area

The following code shows how to monitor the drawing of shapes that represent polygon areas (polygons, rectangles, and circles), and determine which data points on the map are within the drawn area. The `drawingcomplete` event is used to trigger the select logic. In the select logic, all data points on the map are looped through and tested for intersection with the polygon area of the drawn shape. This example makes use of the open-source [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/) library to perform a spatial intersection calculation.

### Draw and search in polygon area

The following code shows how to perform a search for points of interests inside a shape area after the user has finished drawing the shape. The `drawingcomplete` event is used to trigger the search logic. If the user draws a rectangle or polygon, a search inside geometry is performed. If a circle is drawn, the radius and center position is used to perform a point of interest search. The `drawingmodechanged` event is used to determine when the user is switching into a drawing mode, and clears the drawing canvas.

### Create a measuring tool

The following code shows how the drawing events can be used to create a measuring tool. The `drawingchanging` is used to monitor the shape as it is being drawn. As the user moves the mouse, the dimensions of the shape are calculated. The `drawingcomplete` event is used to do a final calculation on the shape after it has been drawn. The `drawingmodechanged` event is used to determine when the user is switching into a drawing mode, and clears the drawing canvas and old measurement information.
