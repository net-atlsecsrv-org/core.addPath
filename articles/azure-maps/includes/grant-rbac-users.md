## Grant role-based access for users to Azure Maps

You grant *role-based access control* (RBAC) by assigning either an Azure AD group or security principals to one or more Azure Maps access control role definitions. To view Azure role definitions that are available for Azure Maps, go to **Access control (IAM)**. Select **Roles**, and then search for roles that begin with *Azure Maps*.

* To efficiently manage a large amount of users' access to Azure Maps, see [Azure AD Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups).
* For users to be allowed to authenticate to the application, the users must be created in Azure AD. See [Add or Delete users using Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory).

Read more on [Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/) to effectively manage a directory for users.

1. Go to your **Azure Maps Account**. Select **Access control (IAM)** > **Role assignment**.

2. On the **Role assignments** tab, under **Role**, select a built in Azure Maps role definition such as **Azure Maps Data Reader** or **Azure Maps Data Contributor**. Under **Assign access to**, select **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**. Select the principal by name. Then select **Save**.

   * See details on [Add or remove role assignments](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

> [!WARNING]
> Azure Maps built-in role definitions provide a very large authorization access to many Azure Maps REST APIs. To restrict APIs for users to a minimum, see [create a custom role definition and assign users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) to the custom role definition. This will enable users to have the least privilege necessary for the application.
