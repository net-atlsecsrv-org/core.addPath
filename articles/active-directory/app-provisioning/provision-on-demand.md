# On-demand provisioning
Use on-demand provisioning to provision a user into an application in seconds. Among other things, you can use this capability to:

* Troubleshoot configuration issues quickly.
* Validate expressions that you've defined.
* Test scoping filters.

## How to use on-demand provisioning

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Go to **All services** > **Enterprise applications**.
3. Select your application, and then go to the provisioning configuration page.
4. Configure provisioning by providing your admin credentials.
5. Select **Provision on demand**.
6. Search for a user by first name, last name, display name, user principal name, or email address.
7. Select **Provision** at the bottom of the page.

## Understand the provisioning steps

The on-demand provisioning process attempts to show the steps that the provisioning service takes when provisioning a user. There are typically five steps to provision a user. One or more of those steps, explained in the following sections, will be shown during the on-demand provisioning experience.

### Step 1: Test connection

The provisioning service attempts to authorize access to the target application by making a request for a "test user". The provisioning service expects a  response that indicates that the service authorized to continue with the provisioning steps. This step is shown only when it fails. It's not shown during the on-demand provisioning experience when the step is successful.

#### Troubleshooting tips

* Ensure that you've provided valid credentials, such as the secret token and tenant URL, to the target application. The required credentials vary by application. For detailed configuration tutorials, see the [tutorial list](../saas-apps/tutorial-list.md). 
* Make sure that the target application supports filtering on the matching attributes defined in the **Attribute mappings** pane. You might need to check the API documentation provided by the application developer to understand the supported filters.
* For System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) applications, you can use a tool like Postman. Such tools help you ensure that the application responds to authorization requests in the way that the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provisioning service expects. Have a look at an [example request](./use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups.md#request-3).

### Step 2: Import user

Next, the provisioning service retrieves the user from the source system. The user attributes that the service retrieves are used later to:

* Evaluate whether the user is in scope for provisioning.
* Check the target system for an existing user.
* Determine what user attributes to export to the target system.

#### View details


The **View details** section shows the properties of the user that were imported from the source system (for example, Azure AD).

#### Troubleshooting tips

* Importing the user can fail when the matching attribute is missing on the user object in the source system. To resolve this failure, try one of these approaches:

  * Update the user object with a value for the matching attribute.
  * Change the matching attribute in your provisioning configuration.

* If an attribute that you expected is missing from the imported list, ensure that the attribute has a value on the user object in the source system. The provisioning service currently doesn't support provisioning null attributes.
* Make sure that the **Attribute mapping** page of your provisioning configuration contains the attribute that you expect.

### Step 3: Determine if user is in scope

Next, the provisioning service determines whether the user is in [scope](./how-provisioning-works.md#scoping) for provisioning. The service considers aspects such as:

* Whether the user is assigned to the application.
* Whether scope is set to **Sync assigned** or **Sync all**.
* The scoping filters defined in your provisioning configuration.  

#### View details

The **View details** section shows the scoping conditions that were evaluated. You might see one or more of the following properties:

* **Active in source system** indicates that the user has the property `IsActive` set to **true** in Azure AD.
* **Assigned to application** indicates that the user is assigned to the application in Azure AD.
* **Scope sync all** indicates that the scope setting allows all users and groups in the tenant.
* **User has required role** indicates that the user has the necessary roles to be provisioned into the application. 
* **Scoping filters** are also shown if you have defined scoping filters for your application. The filter is displayed with the following format: {scoping filter title} {scoping filter attribute} {scoping filter operator} {scoping filter value}.

#### Troubleshooting tips

* Make sure that you've defined a valid scoping role. For example, avoid using the [Greater_Than operator](./define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md#create-a-scoping-filter) with a non-integer value.
* If the user doesn't have the necessary role, review the [tips for provisioning users assigned to the default access role](./application-provisioning-config-problem-no-users-provisioned.md#provisioning-users-assigned-to-the-default-access-role).

### Step 4: Match user between source and target

In this step, the service attempts to match the user that was retrieved in the import step with a user in the target system.

#### View details

The **View details** page shows the properties of the users that were matched in the target system. The properties that you see in the context pane vary as follows:

* If no users are matched in the target system, you won't see any properties.
* If there's one user matched in the target system, you'll see the properties of that matched user from the target system.
* If multiple users are matched, you'll see the properties of both matched users.
* If multiple matching attributes are part of your attribute mappings, each matching attribute is evaluated sequentially and the matched users for that attribute are shown.

#### Troubleshooting tips

* The provisioning service might not be able to match a user in the source system uniquely with a user in the target. Resolve this problem by ensuring that the matching attribute is unique.
* Make sure that the target application supports filtering on the attribute that's defined as the matching attribute.  

### Step 5: Perform action

Finally, the provisioning service takes an action, such as creating, updating, deleting, or skipping the user.

Here's an example of what you might see after the successful on-demand provisioning of a user:

:::image type="content" source="media/provision-on-demand/success-on-demand-provision.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the successful on-demand provisioning of a user.":::

#### View details

The **View details** section displays the attributes that were modified in the target application. This display represents the final output of the provisioning service activity and the attributes that were exported. If this step fails, the attributes displayed represent the attributes that the provisioning service attempted to modify.

#### Troubleshooting tips

* Failures for exporting changes can vary greatly. Check the [documentation for provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md#error-codes) for common failures.

## Frequently asked questions

* **Do you need to turn provisioning off to use on-demand provisioning?** For applications that use a long-lived bearer token or a user name and password for authorization, no additional steps are required. Applications that use OAuth for authorization currently require the provisioning job to be stopped before using on-demand provisioning. Applications such as G Suite, Box, Workplace by Facebook, and Slack fall into this category. Work is in progress to support on-demand provisioning for all applications without having to stop provisioning jobs.

* **How long does on-demand provisioning take?** On-demand provisioning typically takes less than 30 seconds.

## Known limitations

There are currently a few known limitations to on-demand provisioning. Post your [suggestions and feedback](https://aka.ms/appprovisioningfeaturerequest) so we can better determine what improvements to make next.

> [!NOTE]
> The following limitations are specific to the on-demand provisioning capability. For information about whether an application supports provisioning groups, deletions, or other capabilities, check the tutorial for that application.

* Workday, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and SuccessFactors applications don't support on-demand provisioning. 
* On-demand provisioning of groups and roles isn't supported.
* On-demand provisioning supports disabling users that have been unassigned from the application. However, it doesn't support disabling or deleting users that have been disabled or deleted from Azure AD. Those users won't appear when you search for a user.
