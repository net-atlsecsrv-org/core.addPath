# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Zoho

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Zoho with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Zoho with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Zoho.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zoho (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Zoho, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Zoho single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Zoho supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Zoho from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zoho into Azure AD, you need to add Zoho from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Zoho from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Zoho**, select **Zoho** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Zoho in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Zoho based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zoho needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Zoho, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Zoho Single Sign-On](#configure-zoho-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Zoho test user](#create-zoho-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Zoho that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Zoho, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Zoho** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<company name>.zohomail.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Zoho Client support team](https://www.zoho.com/mail/contact.html) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Zoho tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Zoho for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
