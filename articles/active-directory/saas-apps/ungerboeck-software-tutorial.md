# Tutorial: Integrate Ungerboeck Software with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Ungerboeck Software with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Ungerboeck Software with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Ungerboeck Software.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Ungerboeck Software with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get one-month free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Ungerboeck Software single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Ungerboeck Software supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Ungerboeck Software from the gallery

To configure the integration of Ungerboeck Software into Azure AD, you need to add Ungerboeck Software from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Ungerboeck Software** in the search box.
1. Select **Ungerboeck Software** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Ungerboeck Software using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Ungerboeck Software.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Ungerboeck Software, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Ungerboeck Software SSO](#configure-ungerboeck-software-sso)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Ungerboeck Software test user](#create-ungerboeck-software-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Ungerboeck Software that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Ungerboeck Software** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    1. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.com/prod`

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    
    *  **For production environment**:

       - `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.com/prod`
       - `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.net/prod`
       - `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.io/prod`

   * **For test environment**:

     - `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.com/test`
     - `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.net/test`
     - `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.ungerboeck.io/test`

   > [!NOTE]
   > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier which is explained later in the **Configure Ungerboeck Software Single Sign-On** section of the tutorial.

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

	![Edit SAML Signing Certificate](common/edit-certificate.png)

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **Thumbprint** and save it on your computer.

    ![Copy Thumbprint value](common/copy-thumbprint.png)

1. On the **Set up Ungerboeck Software** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure Ungerboeck Software SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Ungerboeck Software** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Ungerboeck Software support team](mailto:Rhonda.Jannings@ungerboeck.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Ungerboeck Software.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Ungerboeck Software**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

### Create Ungerboeck Software test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Ungerboeck Software. Work withÂ [Ungerboeck Software support team](mailto:Rhonda.Jannings@ungerboeck.com) to add the users in the Ungerboeck Software platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test SSO

When you select the Ungerboeck Software tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Ungerboeck Software for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
