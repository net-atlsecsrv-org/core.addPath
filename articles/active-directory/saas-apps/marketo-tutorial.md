# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Marketo

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Marketo with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Marketo with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Marketo.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Marketo (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Marketo, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Marketo single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Marketo supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Marketo from the gallery

To configure the integration of Marketo into Azure AD, you need to add Marketo from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Marketo** in the search box.
1. Select **Marketo** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Marketo based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Marketo needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Marketo, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD SSO with Britta Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD SSO.
2. **[Configure Marketo SSO](#configure-marketo-sso)** - to configure the SSO settings on application side.
    * **[Create Marketo test user](#create-marketo-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Marketo that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Marketo** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://saml.marketo.com/sp`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.marketo.com/saml/assertion/\<munchkinid\>`

    c. In the **Relay State** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<munchkinid>.marketo.com/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Relay State. Contact [Marketo Client support team](https://investors.marketo.com/contactus.cfm) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

1. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Marketo tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Marketo for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Marketo you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
