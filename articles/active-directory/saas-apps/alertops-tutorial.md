# Tutorial: Integrate AlertOps with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate AlertOps with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate AlertOps with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to AlertOps.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to AlertOps with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* AlertOps single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. AlertOps supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Adding AlertOps from the gallery

To configure the integration of AlertOps into Azure AD, you need to add AlertOps from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **AlertOps** in the search box.
1. Select **AlertOps** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with AlertOps using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in AlertOps.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with AlertOps, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure AlertOps](#configure-alertops)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create AlertOps test user](#create-alertops-test-user)** to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in AlertOps that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **AlertOps** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.alertops.com`

    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.alertops.com/login.aspx`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.alertops.com/login.aspx`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [AlertOps Client support team](mailto:support@alertops.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Configure AlertOps

1. To automate the configuration within AlertOps, you need to install **My Apps Secure Sign-in browser extension** by clicking **Install the extension**.

	![My apps extension](common/install-myappssecure-extension.png)

2. After adding extension to the browser, click on **Setup AlertOps** will direct you to the AlertOps application. From there, provide the admin credentials to sign into AlertOps. The browser extension will automatically configure the application for you and automate steps 3-5.
