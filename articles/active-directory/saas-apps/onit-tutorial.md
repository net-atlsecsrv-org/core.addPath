# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Onit

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Onit with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Onit with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Onit.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Onit (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Onit, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Onit single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Onit supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Onit from the gallery

To configure the integration of Onit into Azure AD, you need to add Onit from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Onit from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Onit**, select **Onit** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Onit in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Onit based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Onit needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Onit, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Onit Single Sign-On](#configure-onit-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Onit test user](#create-onit-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Onit that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Onit, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Onit** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Onit Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<sub-domain>.onit.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<sub-domain>.onit.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Onit Client support team](https://www.onit.com/support) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. Onit application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, Onit application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| email | user.mail |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![image](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![image](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Ok**

	g. Click **Save**.

7. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Onit test user

In order to enable Azure AD users to log into Onit, they must be provisioned into Onit. In the case of Onit, provisioning is a manual task.

**To configure user provisioning, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign on to your **Onit** company site as an administrator.

2. Click **Add User**.
   
    ![Administration](./media/onit-tutorial/IC791180.png "Administration")

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Azure Active Directory account holder receives an email and follows a link to confirm their account before it becomes active.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Onit tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Onit for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
