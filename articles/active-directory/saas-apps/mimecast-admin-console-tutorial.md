# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Mimecast Admin Console

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Mimecast Admin Console with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Mimecast Admin Console with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Mimecast Admin Console.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Mimecast Admin Console (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Mimecast Admin Console, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Mimecast Admin Console single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Mimecast Admin Console supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Mimecast Admin Console from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mimecast Admin Console into Azure AD, you need to add Mimecast Admin Console from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Mimecast Admin Console from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Mimecast Admin Console**, select **Mimecast Admin Console** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Mimecast Admin Console based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Mimecast Admin Console needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Mimecast Admin Console, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Mimecast Admin Console Single Sign-On](#configure-mimecast-admin-console-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Mimecast Admin Console test user](#create-mimecast-admin-console-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Mimecast Admin Console that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Mimecast Admin Console, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Mimecast Admin Console** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

### Create Mimecast Admin Console test user

In order to enable Azure AD users to log into Mimecast Admin Console, they must be provisioned into Mimecast Admin Console. In the case of Mimecast Admin Console, provisioning is a manual task.

* You need to register a domain before you can create users.

**To configure user provisioning, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign on to your **Mimecast Admin Console** as administrator.

2. Go to **Directories \> Internal**.
   
	![Directories](./media/mimecast-admin-console-tutorial/ic795003.png "Directories")

3. Click **Register New Domain**.
   
	![Register New Domain](./media/mimecast-admin-console-tutorial/ic795004.png "Register New Domain")

	![New Address](./media/mimecast-admin-console-tutorial/ic795005.png "New Address")

5. In the new address dialog, perform the following steps:
   
	![Save](./media/mimecast-admin-console-tutorial/ic795006.png "Save")
   
	a. Type the **Email Address**, **Global Name**, **Password**, and **Confirm Password** attributes of a valid Azure AD account you want to provision into the related textboxes.

	b. Click **Save**.

>[!NOTE]
>You can use any other Mimecast Admin Console user account creation tools or APIs provided by Mimecast Admin Console to provision Azure AD user accounts. 

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Mimecast Admin Console tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Mimecast Admin Console for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
