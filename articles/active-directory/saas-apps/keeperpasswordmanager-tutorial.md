# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
This integration provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.


## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, you need:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault subscription, enabled for single sign-on (SSO).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault:

1. [Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable your users to use this feature.

    * [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    * [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.

1. [Configure Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault SSO](#configure-keeper-password-manager--digital-vault-sso) to configure the SSO settings on the application side.
    * [Create a Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault test user](#create-a-keeper-password-manager--digital-vault-test-user) to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault** application integration page, find the **Manage** section. Select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. For **Sign on URL**, type a URL that uses the following pattern:
    * For cloud SSO: `https://keepersecurity.com/api/rest/sso/saml/sso/<CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID>`
    * For on-premises SSO: `https://<KEEPER_FQDN>/sso-connect/saml/login`

    b. For **Identifier (Entity ID)**, type a URL that uses the following pattern:
    * For cloud SSO: `https://keepersecurity.com/api/rest/sso/saml/<CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID>`
    * For on-premises SSO: `https://<KEEPER_FQDN>/sso-connect`

    c. For **Reply URL**, type a URL that uses the following pattern:
    * For cloud SSO: `https://keepersecurity.com/api/rest/sso/saml/sso/<CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID>`
    * For on-premises SSO: `https://<KEEPER_FQDN>/sso-connect/saml/sso`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual sign-on URL, identifier, and reply URL. To get these values, contact the [Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault Client support team](https://keepersecurity.com/contact.html). You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. The Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot of User Attributes & Claims.](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition, the Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault application expects a few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. These are shown in the following table. These attributes are also pre-populated, but you can review them per your requirements.

	| Name | Source attribute|
	| ------------| --------- |
	| First | user.givenname |
	| Last | user.surname |
    | Email | user.mail |

5. On **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML**, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download**. This downloads **Federation Metadata XML** from the options per your requirement, and saves it on your computer.
