# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

* Once you configure Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault you can enforce Session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)
