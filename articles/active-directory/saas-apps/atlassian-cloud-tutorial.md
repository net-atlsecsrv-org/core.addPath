# Tutorial: Integrate Atlassian Cloud with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Atlassian Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Atlassian Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Atlassian Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Atlassian Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get one-month free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Atlassian Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* To enable Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) single sign-on for Atlassian Cloud products, you need to set up Atlassian Access. Learn more about [Atlassian Access]( https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/cloud/identity-manager).

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. 

* Atlassian Cloud supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Atlassian Cloud supports [Automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning](atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial.md)
* Once you configure Atlassian Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Atlassian Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Atlassian Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Atlassian Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Atlassian Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Atlassian Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Atlassian Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Atlassian Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Atlassian Cloud, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD with Atlassian Cloud SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use Azure AD based SAML SSO with Atlassian Cloud.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Create Atlassian Cloud test user](#create-atlassian-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Atlassian Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. To automate the configuration within Atlassian Cloud, you need to install **My Apps Secure Sign-in browser extension** by clicking **Install the extension**.

    ![My apps extension](common/install-myappssecure-extension.png)

1. After adding extension to the browser, click on **Set up Atlassian Cloud** will direct you to the Atlassian Cloud application. From there, provide the admin credentials to sign into Atlassian Cloud. The browser extension will automatically configure the application for you.

    ![Setup configuration](common/setup-sso.png)

1. If you want to setup Atlassian Cloud manually, log in to your Atlassian Cloud company site as an administrator and perform the following steps.

1. Before you start go to your Atlassian product instance and copy/save the Instance URL
   > [!NOTE]
   > url should fit `https://<instancename>.atlassian.net` pattern

      b. While Azure does not populate the **user.mail** attribute for users created in Azure AD tenants without Microsoft 365 licenses and stores the email for such users in **userprincipalname** attribute. Atlassian Cloud expects the **nameidentifier** (**Unique User Identifier**) to be mapped to the user's email (**user.userprincipalname**).  Edit the **Source attribute**  and change it to **user.userprincipalname**. Save the changes to the claim.

      ![image](./media/atlassian-cloud-tutorial/set-email.png)
         
      c. The final attribute mappings should look as follows.
