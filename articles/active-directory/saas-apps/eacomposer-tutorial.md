# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with EAComposer

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate EAComposer with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate EAComposer with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to EAComposer.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to EAComposer with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* EAComposer single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* EAComposer supports **SP** initiated SSO
* EAComposer supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding EAComposer from the gallery

To configure the integration of EAComposer into Azure AD, you need to add EAComposer from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **EAComposer** in the search box.
1. Select **EAComposer** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for EAComposer

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with EAComposer using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in EAComposer.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with EAComposer, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure EAComposer SSO](#configure-eacomposer-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create EAComposer test user](#create-eacomposer-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in EAComposer that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **EAComposer** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://www.eacomposer.com/solution/login.aspx`

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **Thumbprint Value** and save it on your computer.

    ![Copy Thumbprint value](common/copy-thumbprint.png)

1. On the **Set up EAComposer** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to EAComposer.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **EAComposer**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure EAComposer SSO

To configure single sign-on on **EAComposer** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint Value** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [EAComposer support team](mailto:support@eacomposer.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create EAComposer test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in EAComposer. EAComposer supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in EAComposer, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

1. Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to EAComposer Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

2. Go to EAComposer Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

3. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the EAComposer tile in the Access Panel, this will redirect to EAComposer Sign on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure EAComposer you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
