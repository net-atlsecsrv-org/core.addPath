# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with VeraSMART

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate VeraSMART with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate VeraSMART with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to VeraSMART.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to VeraSMART with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* VeraSMART single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* VeraSMART supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* VeraSMART supports **Just In Time** user provisioning
* Once you configure VeraSMART you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding VeraSMART from the gallery

To configure the integration of VeraSMART into Azure AD, you need to add VeraSMART from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **VeraSMART** in the search box.
1. Select **VeraSMART** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for VeraSMART

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with VeraSMART using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in VeraSMART.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with VeraSMART, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure VeraSMART SSO](#configure-verasmart-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create VeraSMART test user](#create-verasmart-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in VeraSMART that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **VeraSMART** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.calero.com/<DOMAIN_NAME>/VeraSMART`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.calero.com/<DOMAIN_NAME>/VeraSMART/Saml2/Acs`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.calero.com/<DOMAIN_NAME>/VeraSMART/SSO`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [VeraSMART Client support team](mailto:support@calero.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to VeraSMART.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **VeraSMART**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure VeraSMART SSO

1. Log in to the VeraSMART as an administrator.

1. Go to the **Administration** -> **Security** -> **Authentication Configuration**.

    ![Screenshot shows VeraSMART with Administration, then Security, then Authentication Configuration selected.](./media/verasmart-tutorial/configuration.png)

1. Perform the following steps in the following page:

    ![Configuration](./media/verasmart-tutorial/upload-metadata.png)

    a. Select **SAML2** as **Single sign-on method**  from the dropdown.

    b. In the **Metadata location** textbox, enter the metadata file URL.

    c. Click on **Process IDP metadata**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively you can also upload the **Metadata** file by clicking on the **Choose File** option.

    d. Select the **Entity ID** value from the Entity ID dropdown.

    e. Click on **Save**.

### Create VeraSMART test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in VeraSMART. VeraSMART supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in VeraSMART, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the VeraSMART tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the VeraSMART for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
