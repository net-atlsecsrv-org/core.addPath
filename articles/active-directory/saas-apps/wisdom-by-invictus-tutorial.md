# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Wisdom by Invictus

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Wisdom by Invictus with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Wisdom by Invictus with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Wisdom by Invictus.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Wisdom by Invictus with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Wisdom by Invictus single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Wisdom by Invictus supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Wisdom by Invictus you can enforce session control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Wisdom by Invictus, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Wisdom by Invictus SSO](#configure-wisdom-by-invictus-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Wisdom by Invictus test user](#create-wisdom-by-invictus-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Wisdom by Invictus that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO
