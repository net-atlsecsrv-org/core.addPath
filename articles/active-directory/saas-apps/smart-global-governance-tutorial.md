# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Smart Global Governance

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Smart Global Governance with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Smart Global Governance with Azure AD, you can:

* Use Azure AD to control who can access Smart Global Governance.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Smart Global Governance with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Smart Global Governance subscription with single sign-on (SSO) enabled.

## Tutorial description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

Smart Global Governance supports SP-initiated and IDP-initiated SSO.

After you configure Smart Global Governance, you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session controls extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Add Smart Global Governance from the gallery

To configure the integration of Smart Global Governance into Azure AD, you need to add Smart Global Governance from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a work or school account or with a personal Microsoft account.
1. In the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Go to **Enterprise applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add an application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Smart Global Governance** in the search box.
1. Select **Smart Global Governance** in the results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Smart Global Governance

You'll configure and test Azure AD SSO with Smart Global Governance by using a test user named B.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in Smart Global Governance.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Smart Global Governance, you'll take these high-level steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use the feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on.
    1. **[Grant access to the test user](#grant-access-to-the-test-user)** to enable the user to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Smart Global Governance SSO](#configure-smart-global-governance-sso)** on the application side.
    1. **[Create a Smart Global Governance test user](#create-a-smart-global-governance-test-user)** as a counterpart to the Azure AD representation of the user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify that the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Smart Global Governance** application integration page, in the **Manage** section, select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil button for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings:

   ![Pencil button for Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you want to configure the application in IDP-initiated mode, take the following steps.

    a. In the **Identifier** box, enter one of these URLs:

    - `https://eu-fr-south.console.smartglobalprivacy.com/platform/authentication-saml2/metadata`
    - `https://eu-fr-south.console.smartglobalprivacy.com/dpo/authentication-saml2/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** box, enter one of these URLs:

    - `https://eu-fr-south.console.smartglobalprivacy.com/platform/authentication-saml2/acs`
    - `https://eu-fr-south.console.smartglobalprivacy.com/dpo/authentication-saml2/acs`

1. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs** and complete the following step.

   - In the **Sign-on URL** box, enter one of these URLs:

    - `https://eu-fr-south.console.smartglobalprivacy.com/dpo`
    - `https://eu-fr-south.console.smartglobalprivacy.com/platform`

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Download** link for **Certificate (Raw)** to download the certificate and save it on your computer:

1. In the **Set up Smart Global Governance** section, copy the appropriate URL or URLs, based on your requirements:

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user called B.Simon in the Azure portal.

1. In the left pane of the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, complete these steps:
   1. In the **Name** box, enter **B.Simon**.  
   1. In the **User name** box, enter \<username>@\<companydomain>.\<extension>. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select **Show password**, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Select **Create**.

### Grant access to the test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting that user access to Smart Global Governance.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Smart Global Governance**.
1. In the app's overview page, in the **Manage** section, select **Users and groups**:

   ![Select Users and groups](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, and then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog box:

	![Select Add user](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog box, select **B.Simon** in the **Users** list, and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog box, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select **Assign**.

## Configure Smart Global Governance SSO

To configure single sign-on on the Smart Global Governance side, you need to send the downloaded raw certificate and the appropriate URLs that you copied from Azure portal to the [Smart Global Governance support team](mailto:support.tech@smartglobal.com). They configure the SAML SSO connection to be correct on both sides.

### Create a Smart Global Governance test user

Work with theÂ [Smart Global Governance support team](mailto:support.tech@smartglobal.com) to add a user named B.Simon in Smart Global Governance. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you'll test your Azure AD SSO configuration by using Access Panel.

When you select the Smart Global Governance tile in Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Smart Global Governance instance for which you set up SSO. For more information about Access Panel, see [Introduction to Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
