# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Everbridge

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Everbridge with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
When you integrate Everbridge with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Everbridge.
* Allow your users to be automatically signed in to Everbridge with their Azure AD accounts. This access control is called single sign-on (SSO).
* Manage your accounts in one central location by using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Everbridge, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Everbridge subscription that uses single sign-on.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Everbridge supports IDP-initiated SSO.

## Add Everbridge from the Gallery

To configure the integration of Everbridge into Azure AD, you need to add Everbridge from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Everbridge** in the search box.
1. Select **Everbridge** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Everbridge

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Everbridge using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Everbridge.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Everbridge, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Everbridge SSO](#configure-everbridge-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Everbridge test user](#create-everbridge-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Everbridge that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Everbridge** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

    >[!NOTE]
	>Configure the application either as the manager portal *or* as the member portal on both the Azure portal and the Everbridge portal.

4. To configure the **Everbridge** application as the **Everbridge manager portal**, in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, follow these steps:

    ![Everbridge domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    `https://sso.everbridge.net/<API_Name>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL that follows the pattern.
    `https://manager.everbridge.net/saml/SSO/<API_Name>/alias/defaultAlias`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL values. To get these values, contact the [Everbridge support team](mailto:support@everbridge.com). You also can refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. To configure the **Everbridge** application as the **Everbridge member portal**, in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, follow these steps:

  * If you want to configure the application in IDP-initiated mode, follow these steps:

	 ![Everbridge domain and URLs single sign-on information for IDP-initiated mode](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** box, enter a URL that follows the pattern `https://sso.everbridge.net/<API_Name>/<Organization_ID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL that follows the pattern `https://member.everbridge.net/saml/SSO/<API_Name>/<Organization_ID>/alias/defaultAlias`

   * If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs** and follow this step:

     ![Everbridge domain and URLs single sign-on information for SP-initiated mode](common/both-signonurl.png)

     a. In the **Sign on URL** box, enter a URL that follows the pattern `https://member.everbridge.net/saml/login/<API_Name>/<Organization_ID>/alias/defaultAlias?disco=true`

     > [!NOTE]
     > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign on URL values. To get these values, contact the [Everbridge support team](mailto:support@everbridge.com). You also can refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML**. Save it on your computer.

### Configure Everbridge as Everbridge member portal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Everbridge** as an **Everbridge member portal**, send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** to the [Everbridge support team](mailto:support@everbridge.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Everbridge test user

In this section, you create the test user Britta Simon in Everbridge. To add users in the Everbridge platform, work with the [Everbridge support team](mailto:support@everbridge.com). Users must be created and activated in Everbridge before you use single sign-on. 

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Everbridge for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Everbridge tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Everbridge for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Everbridge you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
