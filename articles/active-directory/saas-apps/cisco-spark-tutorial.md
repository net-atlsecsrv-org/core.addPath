# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory Single sign-on (SSO) integration with Cisco Webex

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cisco Webex with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Cisco Webex with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Cisco Webex.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco Webex single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Cisco Webex supports **SP** initiated SSO and supports **Automated** user provisioning.

## Adding Cisco Webex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Webex into Azure AD, you need to add Cisco Webex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco Webex** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco Webex** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Cisco Webex

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cisco Webex using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cisco Webex.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cisco Webex, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Cisco Webex](#configure-cisco-webex)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Cisco Webex test user](#create-cisco-webex-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco Webex that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Cisco Webex** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, upload the downloaded **Service Provider metadata** file and configure the application by performing the following steps:

	>[!Note]
	>You will get the Service Provider Metadata file from the **Configure Cisco Webex** section, which is explained later in the tutorial. 

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	c. After successful completion of uploading Service Provider metadata file the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section:

	In the **Sign on URL** textbox, paste the value of **Reply URL**, which gets autofilled by SP metadata file upload.

5. Cisco Webex  application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, Cisco Webex application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:
    
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|--------- |
	| uid | user.userprincipalname |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![image](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![image](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Ok**

	g. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

1. On the **Set up Cisco Webex** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

   ![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Cisco Webex.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Cisco Webex**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
