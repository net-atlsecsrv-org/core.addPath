# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Cisco Webex

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Cisco Webex with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Cisco Webex with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Cisco Webex.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Cisco Webex, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Cisco Webex single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cisco Webex supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Cisco Webex supports **Automated** user provisioning

## Adding Cisco Webex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Webex into Azure AD, you need to add Cisco Webex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Cisco Webex from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

4. In the search box, type **Cisco Webex**, select **Cisco Webex** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cisco Webex needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Cisco Webex Single Sign-On](#configure-cisco-webex-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Cisco Webex test user](#create-cisco-webex-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Cisco Webex that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Cisco Webex** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Cisco Webex Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL as:
    `https://web.ciscospark.com/#/signin`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://idbroker.webex.com/<Org Id>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> This Identifier value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier. If you have Service Provider Metadata, upload it in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section then the **Identifier (Entity ID)** value gets auto populated automatically.

5. Cisco Webex application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click on **Edit** icon to add the attributes.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, Cisco Webex application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:
    
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|--------- |
	| uid | user.userprincipalname |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![image](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![image](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Ok**

	g. Click **Save**.

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.
