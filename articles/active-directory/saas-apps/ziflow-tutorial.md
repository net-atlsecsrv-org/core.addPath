# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Ziflow

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Ziflow with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Ziflow with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Ziflow.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Ziflow (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Ziflow, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Ziflow single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Ziflow supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Ziflow from the gallery

To configure the integration of Ziflow into Azure AD, you need to add Ziflow from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Ziflow from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

4. In the search box, type **Ziflow**, select **Ziflow** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Ziflow based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Ziflow needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Ziflow, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Ziflow Single Sign-On](#configure-ziflow-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Ziflow test user](#create-ziflow-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Ziflow that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Ziflow, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Ziflow** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

    `https://ziflow-production.auth0.com/login/callback?connection=<UniqueID>`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `urn:auth0:ziflow-production:<UniqueID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The preceding values are not real. You will update the unique ID value in the Identifier and Sign on URL with actual value, which is explained later in the tutorial.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.
