# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Description

Use your Microsoft Azure Active Directory account with Atlassian JIRA server to enable single sign-on. This way all your organization users can use the Azure AD credentials to sign in into the JIRA application. This plugin uses SAML 2.0 for federation.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- JIRA Core and Software 6.4 to 8.11.0 or JIRA Service Desk 3.0 to 4.11.1 should installed and configured on Windows 64-bit version
- JIRA server is HTTPS enabled
- Note the supported versions for JIRA Plugin are mentioned in below section.
- JIRA server is reachable on internet particularly to Azure AD Login page for authentication and should able to receive the token from Azure AD
- Admin credentials are set up in JIRA
- WebSudo is disabled in JIRA
- Test user created in the JIRA server application

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment of JIRA. Test the integration first in development or staging environment of the application and then use the production environment.

To get started, you need the following items:

* Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
* JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Supported versions of JIRA

* JIRA Core and Software: 6.4 to 8.11.0
* JIRA Service Desk 3.0.0 to 4.11.1
* JIRA also supports 5.2. For more details, click [Microsoft Azure Active Directory single sign-on for JIRA 5.2](jira52microsoft-tutorial.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that our JIRA Plugin also works on Ubuntu Version 16.04 and Linux.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft from the gallery

1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft** in the search box.
1. Select **JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft SSO](#configure-jira-saml-sso-by-microsoft-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft test user](#create-jira-saml-sso-by-microsoft-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

	> [!TIP]
	> Ensure that there is only one certificate mapped against the app so that there is no error in resolving the metadata. If there are multiple certificates, upon resolving the metadata, admin gets an error.

	1. In the **Metadata URL** textbox, paste **App Federation Metadata Url** value which you have copied from the Azure portal and click the **Resolve** button. It reads the IdP metadata URL and populates all the fields information.

	1. Copy the **Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL** values and paste them in **Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL** textboxes respectively in **JIRA SAML SSO by Microsoft Domain and URLs** section on Azure portal.

	1. In **Login Button Name** type the name of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.
	
	1. In **Login Button Description** type the description of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.

	1. In **SAML User ID Locations** select either **User ID is in the NameIdentifier element of the Subject statement** or **User ID is in an Attribute element**.  This ID has to be the JIRA user ID. If the user ID is not matched, then system will not allow users to sign in.

	   > [!Note]
	   > Default SAML User ID location is Name Identifier. You can change this to an attribute option and enter the appropriate attribute name.

	1. If you select **User ID is in an Attribute element** option, then in **Attribute name** textbox type the name of the attribute where User ID is expected.

	1. If you are using the federated domain (like ADFS etc.) with Azure AD, then click on the **Enable Home Realm Discovery** option and configure the **Domain Name**.

	1. In **Domain Name** type the domain name here in case of the ADFS-based login.

	1. Check **Enable Single Sign out** if you wish to sign out from Azure AD when a user sign out from JIRA.
	
	1. Enable **Force Azure Login** checkbox, if you wish to sign in through Azure AD credentials only.
	
	   > [!Note]
	   > To enable the default login form for admin login on login page when force azure login is enabled, add the query parameter in the browser URL.
	   > `https://<domain:port>/login.jsp?force_azure_login=false`

	1. Click **Save** button to save the settings.
