# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with iProva

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate iProva with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate iProva with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to iProva.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iProva with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* iProva single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* iProva supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Once you configure iProva you can enforce session control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding iProva from the gallery

To configure the integration of iProva into Azure AD, you need to add iProva from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **iProva** in the search box.
1. Select **iProva** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for iProva

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with iProva using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in iProva.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with iProva, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Retrieve configuration information from iProva](#retrieve-configuration-information-from-iprova)** - as a preparation for the next steps.
1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Create iProva test user](#create-iprova-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in iProva that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Configure iProva SSO](#configure-iprova-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Retrieve configuration information from iProva

In this section, you retrieve information from iProva to configure Azure AD single sign-on.

1. Open a web browser, and go to the **SAML2 info** page in iProva by using the following URL pattern:

    ```https
    https://SUBDOMAIN.iprova.nl/saml2info
    https://SUBDOMAIN.iprova.be/saml2info
    ```

	![View the iProva SAML2 info page](media/iprova-tutorial/iprova-saml2-info.png)

1. Leave the browser tab open while you proceed with the next steps in another browser tab.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **iProva** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. Fill the **Sign-on URL** box with the value that's displayed behind the label **Sign-on URL** on the **iProva SAML2 info** page. This page is still open in your other browser tab.

	b. Fill the **Identifier** box with the value that's displayed behind the label **EntityID** on the **iProva SAML2 info** page. This page is still open in your other browser tab.

	c. Fill the **Reply-URL** box with the value that's displayed behind the label **Reply URL** on the **iProva SAML2 info** page. This page is still open in your other browser tab.

1. iProva application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, iProva application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute| Namespace  |
	| ---------------| -------- | -----|
	| `samaccountname` | `user.onpremisessamaccountname`| `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims`|

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.
