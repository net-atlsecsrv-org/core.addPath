# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SciQuest Spend Director

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SciQuest Spend Director with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating SciQuest Spend Director with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to SciQuest Spend Director.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SciQuest Spend Director (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SciQuest Spend Director, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* SciQuest Spend Director single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* SciQuest Spend Director supports **SP** initiated SSO
* SciQuest Spend Director supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SciQuest Spend Director based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SciQuest Spend Director needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SciQuest Spend Director, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure SciQuest Spend Director Single Sign-On](#configure-sciquest-spend-director-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create SciQuest Spend Director test user](#create-sciquest-spend-director-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SciQuest Spend Director that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SciQuest Spend Director, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **SciQuest Spend Director** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

### Create SciQuest Spend Director test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in SciQuest Spend Director.

You need to contact your [SciQuest Spend Director support team](https://www.jaggaer.com/contact-us/) and provide them with the details about your test account to get it created.

Alternatively, you can also leverage just-in-time provisioning, a single sign-on feature that is supported by SciQuest Spend Director.  
If just-in-time provisioning is enabled, users are automatically created by SciQuest Spend Director during a single sign-on attempt if they don't exist. This feature eliminates the need to manually create single sign-on counterpart users.

To get just-in-time provisioning enabled, you need to contact your [SciQuest Spend Director support team](https://www.jaggaer.com/contact-us/).

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the SciQuest Spend Director tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the SciQuest Spend Director for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
