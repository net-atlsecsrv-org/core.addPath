# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Blue Access for Members (BAM)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Blue Access for Members (BAM) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Blue Access for Members (BAM) with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Blue Access for Members (BAM).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Blue Access for Members (BAM) with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Blue Access for Members (BAM) single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.


* Blue Access for Members (BAM) supports **IDP** initiated SSO




## Adding Blue Access for Members (BAM) from the gallery

To configure the integration of Blue Access for Members (BAM) into Azure AD, you need to add Blue Access for Members (BAM) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Blue Access for Members (BAM)** in the search box.
1. Select **Blue Access for Members (BAM)** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Blue Access for Members (BAM)

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Blue Access for Members (BAM) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Blue Access for Members (BAM).

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Blue Access for Members (BAM), complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Blue Access for Members (BAM) SSO](#configure-blue-access-for-members-bam-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Blue Access for Members (BAM) test user](#create-blue-access-for-members-bam-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Blue Access for Members (BAM) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Blue Access for Members (BAM)** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `<Custom Domain Value>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMURL>/affwebservices/public/saml2assertionconsumer`

    c. Click **Set additional URLs**.

    d. In the **Relay State** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMURL>/BAMSSOServlet/sso/BamInboundSsoServlet`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Relay State. Contact [Blue Access for Members (BAM) Client support team](https://www.bcbstx.com/contact-us) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Blue Access for Members (BAM) application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Blue Access for Members (BAM) application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
	| ClientID | `<ClientID>` |
    | UID | `<UID>` |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Configure Blue Access for Members (BAM) SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Blue Access for Members (BAM)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Blue Access for Members (BAM) support team](https://www.bcbstx.com/contact-us). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Blue Access for Members (BAM) test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Blue Access for Members (BAM). Work withÂ [Blue Access for Members (BAM) support team](https://www.bcbstx.com/contact-us) to add the users in the Blue Access for Members (BAM) platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Blue Access for Members (BAM) tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Blue Access for Members (BAM) for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
