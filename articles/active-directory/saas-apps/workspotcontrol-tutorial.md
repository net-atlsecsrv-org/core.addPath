# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workspot Control

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Workspot Control with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Workspot Control with Azure AD, you can:

* Use Azure AD to control who has access to Workspot Control.
* Enable users to automatically sign in to Workspot Control (single sign-on [SSO]) by using their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

For more information about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure AD](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Workspot Control, you need the following things:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* A Workspot Control single sign-on-enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

> [!Note]
> Workspot Control supports SP-initiated and IDP-initiated SSO.


## Adding Workspot Control from the gallery

To configure integration of Workspot Control into Azure AD, you must add Workspot Control from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Workspot Control from the gallery, follow these steps:**

1. In the left pane of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Azure Active Directory**.

2. Go to **Enterprise Applications** and select **All Applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications pane](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. Select **New application** at the top of the window.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Workspot Control**, select **Workspot Control** from the results panel, and then select **Add**.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workspot Control for a test user, Britta Simon.
For single sign-on to work, you must establish a link between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workspot Control.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workspot Control, you must complete the following tasks:

1. [Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on) to enable your users to use the feature.
2. [Configure Workspot Control single sign-on](#configure-workspot-control-single-sign-on) to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
3. [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on for Britta Simon.
4. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. [Create a Workspot Control test user](#create-a-workspot-control-test-user) to establish a counterpart of Britta Simon in Workspot Control that's linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
6. [Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on) to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Workspot Control, follow these steps:

1. On the **Workspot Control** application integration page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. In the **Select a single sign-on method** window, select **SAML** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Select a single sign-on select method window](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the **Edit** (pencil) icon to access **Basic SAML Configuration**.

	![Edit icon highlighted in "Basic SAML Configuration"](common/edit-urls.png)

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you want to configure the application in IDP-initiated mode, follow these steps:

    ![Screenshot shows the Basic SAML Configuration, where you can enter Identifier, Reply U R L, and select Save.](common/idp-intiated.png)

    1. In the **identifier** text box, enter a URL in the following pattern:<br/>
    ***https://<<i></i>INSTANCENAME>-saml.workspot.com/saml/metadata***

    1. In the **reply URL** text box, enter a URL in the following pattern:<br/>
    ***https://<<i></i>INSTANCENAME>-saml.workspot.com/saml/assertion***

5. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs**.

    ![Screenshot shows Set additional U R Ls where you can enter a Sign on U R L.](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, enter a URL in the following pattern:<br/>
    ***https://<<i></i>INSTANCENAME>-saml.workspot.com/***

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Replace these values with the actual identifier, reply URL, and sign-on URL. Contact the [Workspot Control Client support team](mailto:support@workspot.com) to get these values. Or you can also refer to the patterns in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section of the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set Up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** to download **Certificate (Base64)** from the available options as per your requirements. Save it to your computer.

	![The Certificate (Base64) download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

7. In the **Set up Workspot Control** section, copy the appropriate URLs as per your requirements:

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)
