# Tutorial: Integrate Expensify with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Expensify with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Expensify with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Expensify.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Expensify with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Expensify single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Expensify supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Expensify from the gallery

To configure the integration of Expensify into Azure AD, you need to add Expensify from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Expensify** in the search box.
1. Select **Expensify** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Expensify

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Expensify using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Expensify.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Expensify, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Expensify SSO](#configure-expensify-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Expensify test user](#create-expensify-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Expensify that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Expensify** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://www.expensify.com/authentication/saml/login`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type the URL:
    `https://www.expensify.com`

    c. b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.expensify.com/authentication/saml/loginCallback?domain=<yourdomain>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Reply URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [Expensify Client support team](mailto:help@expensify.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Expensify.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Expensify**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Expensify SSO

To enable SSO in Expensify, you first need to enable **Domain Control** in the application. You can enable Domain Control in the application through the steps listed [here](https://help.expensify.com/domain-control). For additional support, work with [Expensify Client support team](mailto:help@expensify.com). Once you have Domain Control enabled, follow these steps:

![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/expensify-tutorial/domain-control.png)

1. Sign on to your Expensify application.

2. In the left panel, click **Settings** and navigate to **SAML**.

3. Toggle the **SAML Login** option as **Enabled**.

4. Open the downloaded Federation Metadata from Azure AD in notepad, copy the content, and then paste it into the **Identity Provider Metadata** textbox.

### Create Expensify test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Expensify. Work with [Expensify Client support team](mailto:help@expensify.com) to add the users in the Expensify platform.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Expensify Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Expensify Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Expensify tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Expensify Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Expensify you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
