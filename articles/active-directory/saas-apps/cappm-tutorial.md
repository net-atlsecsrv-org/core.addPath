# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Clarity

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Clarity with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Clarity with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Clarity.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Clarity with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Clarity single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Clarity supports **IDP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Clarity you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real-time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Clarity from the gallery

To configure the integration of Clarity into Azure AD, you need to add Clarity from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Clarity** in the search box.
1. Select **Clarity** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Clarity

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Clarity using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Clarity.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Clarity, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Clarity Single Sign-On](#configure-clarity-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Clarity test user](#create-clarity-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Clarity that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD single sign-on

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Clarity** application integration page,  find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML**.
3.  On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://ca.ondemand.saml.20.post.<companyname>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type as:
    `https://fedsso.ondemand.ca.com/affwebservices/public/saml2assertionconsumer`

	> [!NOTE]
	> This value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier. Contact [Clarity Client support team](mailto:catechnicalsupport@ca.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

6. On the **Set up Clarity** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Clarity.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Clarity**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button

## Configure Clarity Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Clarity** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Clarity support team](mailto:catechnicalsupport@ca.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Clarity test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Clarity. Work withÂ [Clarity support team](mailto:catechnicalsupport@ca.com) to add the users in the Clarity platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Clarity tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Clarity for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
