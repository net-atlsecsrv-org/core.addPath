# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Printix

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Printix with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Printix with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Printix
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Printix (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Printix, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Printix single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Printix from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Printix from the gallery
To configure the integration of Printix into Azure AD, you need to add Printix from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Printix from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Screenshot shows the Azure portal Enterprise Applications selected under Manage, with All applications selected.][2]
	
1. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Screenshot shows New application selected.][3]

1. In the search box, type **Printix**.

	![Screenshot shows searching for Printix in the Add from the gallery dialog box.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_search.png)

1. In the results panel, select **Printix**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Screenshot shows the Printix option selected.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Printix based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Printix is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Printix needs to be established.

In Printix, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Printix, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Creating a Printix test user](#creating-a-printix-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Printix that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Printix application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Printix, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Printix** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Screenshot shows Single sign-on selected under Manage in the Azure portal.][4]

1. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Screenshot shows SAML-based Sign-on Mode selected.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_samlbase.png)

1. On the **Printix Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Screenshot shows the Printix Domain and URLs section where you can specify a U R L for sign-on.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_url.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.printix.net`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Printix Client support team](mailto:support@printix.net) to get the value. 
 
1. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the SAML Signing Certificate pane where you can download a certificate.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_certificate.png) 

1. Click **Save** button.

	![Screenshot shows the Save button.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

1. Sign-on to your Printix tenant as an administrator.

1. In the menu on the top, click the icon at the upper right corner and select "**Authentication**".
   
    ![Screenshot shows Authentication selected from the menu.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_06.png)

1. On the **Setup** tab, select **Enable Azure/Office 365 authentication**
   
    ![Screenshot shows the Printix.net page where you can select Enable Azure/Office 365 authentication.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_07.png)

1. On the **Azure** tab, input federation metadata URL to the textbox of "**Federation metadata document**". 

    Attach the metadata xml file which you downloaded from Azure AD to [Printix support team](mailto:support@printix.net). Then they upload the xml file and provide a federation metadata URL.
   
    ![Screenshot shows the Printix.net page where you can specify a Federation metadata document.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_08.png)
   
1. Click the "**Test**" button and click "**OK**" button if the test was successful.
   
     Azure active directory page will show after clicking the **test** button. "The test was successful" here means after entering the credentials of your Azure test account it will pop up a message "Settings tested OK".Then click the **OK** button.
   
    ![Screenshot shows the results of the test.](./media/printix-tutorial/tutorial_printix_09.png)

1. Click the **Save** button on "**Authentication**" page.


> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)

### Creating a Printix test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Printix. Printix supports just-in-time provisioning, which is by default enabled.

There is no action item for you in this section. A new user is created during an attempt to access Printix if it doesn't exist yet. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to create a user manually, you need to contact the [Printix support team](mailto:support@printix.net).
> 

### Assigning the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Printix.

![Screenshot shows a user with default access.][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to Printix, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Screenshot shows Enterprise Applications selected under Manage, with All applications selected.][201]
