# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with GitHub

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate GitHub with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate GitHub with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to your GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization.
* Manage access to your GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with GitHub, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* A GitHub organization created in [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-products/#github-enterprise), which requires the [GitHub Enterprise billing plan](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-billing-plans/#billing-plans-for-organizations)

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* GitHub supports **SP** initiated SSO

* GitHub supports [**Automated** user provisioning (organization invitations)](github-provisioning-tutorial.md)
* Once you configure GitHub you can enforce Session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)

## Adding GitHub from the gallery

To configure the integration of GitHub into Azure AD, you need to add GitHub from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **GitHub** in the search box.
1. Select **GitHub** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for GitHub

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with GitHub using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in GitHub.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with GitHub, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure GitHub SSO](#configure-github-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create GitHub test user](#create-github-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in GitHub that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **GitHub** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

   a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://github.com/orgs/<Organization ID>/sso`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://github.com/orgs/<Organization ID>`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://github.com/orgs/<Organization ID>/saml/consume`


	> [!NOTE]
	> Please note that these are not the real values. You have to update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Here we suggest you to use the unique value of string in the Identifier. Go to GitHub Admin section to retrieve these values.

5. Your GitHub application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. GitHub application expects **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![Screenshot that shows the "User Attributes" section with the "Edit" icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

7. On the **Set up GitHub** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure Ad Identifier

	c. Logout URL

6. Click **Save**

> [!NOTE]
> Single sign-on in GitHub authenticates to a specific organization in GitHub and does not replace the authentication of GitHub itself. Therefore, if the user's github.com session has expired, you may be asked to authenticate with GitHub's ID/password during the single sign-on process.

### Create GitHub test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in GitHub. GitHub supports automatic user provisioning, which is by default enabled. You can find more details [here](github-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

**If you need to create user manually, perform following steps:**

1. Log in to your GitHub company site as an administrator.

2. Click **People**.

    ![Screenshot shows the GitHub site with People selected.](./media/github-tutorial/people.png "People")

3. Click **Invite member**.

    ![Invite Users](./media/github-tutorial/invite-member.png "Invite Users")

4. On the **Invite member** dialog page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Email** textbox, type the email address of Britta Simon account.

    ![Invite People](./media/github-tutorial/email-box.png "Invite People")

    b. Click **Send Invitation**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Invite member" dialog page with "Member" selected and the "Send invitation" button selected.](./media/github-tutorial/send-invitation.png "Invite People")

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Azure Active Directory account holder will receive an email and follow a link to confirm their account before it becomes active.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the GitHub tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the GitHub for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
