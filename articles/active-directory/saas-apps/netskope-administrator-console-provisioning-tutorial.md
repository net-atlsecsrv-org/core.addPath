# Tutorial: Configure Netskope User Authentication for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Netskope User Authentication and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Netskope User Authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Public Preview. For more information on the general Microsoft Azure terms of use for Preview features, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant
* [A Netskope User Authentication tenant](https://www.netskope.com/)
* A user account in Netskope User Authentication with Admin permissions.

## Assigning users to Netskope User Authentication

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Netskope User Authentication. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Netskope User Authentication by following the instructions here:
* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Netskope User Authentication

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Netskope User Authentication to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Netskope User Authentication, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Set up Netskope User Authentication for provisioning

1. Sign in to your [Netskope User Authentication Admin Console](https://netskope.goskope.com/). Navigate to **Home > Settings**.

## Add Netskope User Authentication from the gallery

Before configuring Netskope User Authentication for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Netskope User Authentication from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Netskope User Authentication from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the pane.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Netskope User Authentication**, select **Netskope User Authentication** in the results panel, and then click the **Add** button to add the application.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Netskope User Authentication 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Netskope User Authentication based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Netskope User Authentication by following the instructions provided in the [Netskope User Authentication Single sign-on tutorial](./netskope-cloud-security-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, although these two features complement each other.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about Netskope User Authentication's SCIM endpoint, refer [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n9P_TL98_kd1sx5PAvZL2HS6MQAqkQqd-OSkWAAU6ck/edit#heading=h.prxq74iwdpon).

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Netskope User Authentication in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Netskope User Authentication**.

	![The Netskope User Authentication link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input **SCIM Server URL** value retrieved earlier in **Tenant URL**. Input the **TOKEN** value retrieved earlier in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Netskope User Authentication. If the connection fails, ensure your Netskope User Authentication account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Netskope User Authentication**.

	![Netskope User Authentication User Mappings](media/netskope-administrator-console-provisioning-tutorial/usermappings.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Netskope User Authentication in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Netskope User Authentication for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Netskope User Authentication**.

	![Netskope User Authentication Group Mappings](media/netskope-administrator-console-provisioning-tutorial/groupmappings.png)

11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Netskope User Authentication in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Netskope User Authentication for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Netskope User Authentication Group Attributes](media/netskope-administrator-console-provisioning-tutorial/groupattributes.png)

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

13. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Netskope User Authentication, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Netskope User Authentication by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Netskope User Authentication.
