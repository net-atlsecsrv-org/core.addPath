# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with FCM HUB

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate FCM HUB with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate FCM HUB with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to FCM HUB.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to FCM HUB with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* FCM HUB single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* FCM HUB supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add FCM HUB from the gallery

To configure the integration of FCM HUB into Azure AD, you need to add FCM HUB from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **FCM HUB** in the search box.
1. Select **FCM HUB** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for FCM HUB

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with FCM HUB using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in FCM HUB.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with FCM HUB, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure FCM HUB SSO](#configure-fcm-hub-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create FCM HUB test user](#create-fcm-hub-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in FCM HUB that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal on the **FCM HUB** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://hub.fcm.travel/SsoSp/SpInit?clientid=<CUSTOMID>`

    > [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact account manager who is assigned to you or contact [FCM HUB Client support team](mailto:fcmssoadmin@us.fcm.travel) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Save**.

1. On the **Manage Claim** page, in the **User Attributes & Claims** section, add these custom attributes:
   - **Name**: PortalID
   - **Source**: Attribute
   - **Source Attribute**: PortalID, value provided by FCM

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, use the edit option to select or enter the following settings, and then select **Save**:
   - **Signing Option**: Sign SAML response
   - **Signing Algorithm**: SHA-256

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up FCM HUB** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to FCM HUB.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **FCM HUB**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure FCM HUB SSO

To configure single sign-on on **FCM HUB** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to your account manager who is assigned to you for the support or contact [FCM HUB Client support team](mailto:fcmssoadmin@us.fcm.travel). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create FCM HUB test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in FCM HUB. Work with your account manager or contact [FCM HUB Client support team](mailto:fcmssoadmin@us.fcm.travel) to add the users in the FCM HUB platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to FCM HUB Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to FCM HUB Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the FCM HUB for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the FCM HUB tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the FCM HUB for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure FCM HUB you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
