# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO into Azure AD, you need to add Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO SSO](#configure-cisco-umbrella-admin-sso-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO test user](#create-cisco-umbrella-admin-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

    a. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    b. Click **Set additional URLs**.

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type the URL: `https://login.umbrella.com/sso`

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO SSO

1. In a different browser window, sign-on to your Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO company site as administrator.

2. From the left side of menu, click **Admin** and navigate to **Authentication** and then click on **SAML**.

    f. In the **Confirm Password** field, re-enter your password.

    g. Click **CREATE**.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
