# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with BlueJeans for Azure AD

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate BlueJeans for Azure AD with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate BlueJeans for Azure AD with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to BlueJeans for Azure AD.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BlueJeans for Azure AD with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* BlueJeans for Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* BlueJeans for Azure AD supports **SP** initiated SSO

* BlueJeans for Azure AD supports [**Automated** user provisioning](bluejeans-provisioning-tutorial.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding BlueJeans for Azure AD from the gallery

To configure the integration of BlueJeans for Azure AD into Azure AD, you need to add BlueJeans for Azure AD from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **BlueJeans for Azure AD** in the search box.
1. Select **BlueJeans for Azure AD** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for BlueJeans for Azure AD

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with BlueJeans for Azure AD using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in BlueJeans for Azure AD.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with BlueJeans for Azure AD, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure BlueJeans for Azure AD SSO](#configure-bluejeans-for-azure-ad-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create BlueJeans for Azure AD test user](#create-bluejeans-for-azure-ad-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in BlueJeans for Azure AD that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **BlueJeans for Azure AD** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.bluejeans.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [BlueJeans for Azure AD Client support team](https://support.bluejeans.com/contact) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
