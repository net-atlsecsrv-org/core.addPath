# Tutorial: Configure Airstack for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Airstack and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Airstack.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Public Preview. For more information on the general Microsoft Azure terms of use for Preview features, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant
* [An Airstack tenant](https://airstack.com/pricing/)
* A user account in Airstack with Admin permissions.

## Assigning users to Airstack

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Airstack. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Airstack by following the instructions here:
* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Airstack

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Airstack to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Airstack, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Setup Airstack for provisioning

1. Sign in to your [Airstack Admin Console](https://airstack-qa.lenovosoftware.com/). Navigate to **Settings**.

2.	Navigate to **Azure Config** on the menu located to the left side of the screen.

3.	Click on **Generate** button. Copy the **Secret Token for Azure**. This value will be entered in the Secret Token field in the Provisioning tab of your Airstack application in the Azure portal.

## Add Airstack from the gallery

Before configuring Airstack for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Airstack from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Airstack from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the pane.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Airstack**, select **Airstack** in the results panel, and then click the **Add** button to add the application.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Airstack 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Airstack based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Airstack, following the instructions provided in the [Airstack Single sign-on tutorial](./airstack-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features compliment each other

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Airstack in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Airstack**.

	![The Airstack link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input `https://api-as.lenovosoftware.com/0/as/common/scim` in **Tenant URL**. Input the **SCIM Authentication Token** value retrieved earlier in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Airstack. If the connection fails, ensure your Airstack account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Airstack**.

	![Airstack User Mappings](media/airstack-provisioning-tutorial/mappings.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Airstack in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Airstack for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Airstack User Attributes](media/airstack-provisioning-tutorial/attributes.png)

10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

11. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Airstack, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

12. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Airstack by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

13. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Airstack.
