# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Oracle PeopleSoft - Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Oracle PeopleSoft - Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Oracle PeopleSoft - Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Oracle PeopleSoft - Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Oracle PeopleSoft - Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.
* This tutorial covers instructions for Oracle PeopleSoft ELM.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

1. An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
1. Oracle PeopleSoft - Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

1. Deploying the joint solution requires the following license:

## Setting up F5 Big-IP APM to support Single Logout from PeopleSoft application

To add single logout support for all PeopleSoft users,please follow these steps:

1. Determine the correct logout URL for PeopleSoft portal
    * To determine the address that the PeopleSoft application uses to end a user session, you need to open the portal using any web browser and enable browser debug tools, as shown in the example below:

        ![logout URL for PeopleSoft portal ](./media/oracle-peoplesoft-protected-by-f5-big-ip-apm-tutorial/sign-out.png)

    * Find the element with the `PT_LOGOUT_MENU` id and save the URL path with the query parameters. In our example, we got the following value: `/psp/ps/?cmd=logout`

1. Create LTM iRule that will redirect the user to the APM logout URL: `/my.logout.php3`

    * Navigate to **Local Traffic > iRule**, click **Create**, complete the following information and click **Finished**.

        Name: `<Name>`  
        Definition:  
                    _when HTTP_REQUEST {  
                        switch -glob -- [HTTP::uri] {  
                            `/psp/ps/?cmd=logout` {  
                                HTTP::redirect `/my.logout.php3`  
                            }  
                        }  
                    }_

1. Assign the created iRule to the Virtual Server

    * Navigate to **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers > Virtual Server List > PeopleSoftApp > Resources**. Click the **Manage…** button:   

    * Specify `<Name>` as Enabled iRule and click **Finished**

        ![_iRule_PeopleSoftApp ](./media/oracle-peoplesoft-protected-by-f5-big-ip-apm-tutorial/irule-people-soft.png)

    * Give the **Name** textbox value as `<Name>` 

        ![_iRule_PeopleSoftApp finished](./media/oracle-peoplesoft-protected-by-f5-big-ip-apm-tutorial/common-irule.png)


### Create Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM. Work with [Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM support team](https://support.f5.com) to add the users in the Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Oracle PeopleSoft-Protected by F5 BIG-IP APM for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
