# Tutorial: Configure Atlassian Cloud for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Atlassian Cloud and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Atlassian Cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/user-provisioning.md).


## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant
* [An Atlassian Cloud tenant](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/cloud)
* A user account in Atlassian Cloud with Admin permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure AD provisioning integration relies on the **Atlassian Cloud SCIM API**, which is available to Atlassian Cloud teams.

## Add Atlassian Cloud from the gallery

Before configuring Atlassian Cloud for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Atlassian Cloud from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Atlassian Cloud from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

## Assigning users to Atlassian Cloud

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Atlassian Cloud. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Atlassian Cloud by following the instructions here:

* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to Atlassian Cloud

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Atlassian Cloud to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Atlassian Cloud, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Atlassian Cloud 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Atlassian Cloud based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Atlassian Cloud, following the instructions provided in the [Atlassian Cloud single sign-on tutorial](atlassian-cloud-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features compliment each other.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Atlassian Cloud in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **Atlassian Cloud**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Atlassian Cloud**.

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-tab.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/credentials.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** of your Atlassian Cloud's account. Examples of these values are:

   * In the **Tenant URL** field, fill the specific tenant endpoint you receive from the Atlassian, as described in Step 6. For Example: `https://api.atlassian.com/scim/directory/{directoryId}`.

   * In the **Secret Token** field, populate the secret token as described in Step 6.

6. Navigate to [Atlassian Organization Manager](https://admin.atlassian.com) **> User Provisioning** and click on **Create a Token**. Copy the **Directory base URL** and **Bearer Token** to the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** fields respectively.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/secret-token-3.png)

7. Upon populating the fields shown in Step 5, click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Atlassian Cloud. If the connection fails, ensure your Atlassian Cloud account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/test-connection.png)

8. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/notification.png)

9. Click **Save**.

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Atlassian Cloud**.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/provision-users.png)

11. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Atlassian Cloud in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Atlassian Cloud for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/user-mapping.png)

12. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Atlassian Cloud**.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/provision-groups.png)

13. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Atlassian Cloud in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Atlassian Cloud for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/group-mapping.png)

14. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../manage-apps/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

15. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Atlassian Cloud, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-on.png)

16. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Atlassian Cloud by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-options.png)

17. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Atlassian Cloud Provisioning](./media/atlassian-cloud-provisioning-tutorial/save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Atlassian Cloud.

For more information on how to read the Azure AD provisioning logs, see [Reporting on automatic user account provisioning](../manage-apps/check-status-user-account-provisioning.md).

## Connector Limitations

* Atlassian Cloud allows provisioning of users only from [verified domains](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/organization-administration-938859734.html).
* Atlassian Cloud does not support group renames today. This means that any changes to the displayName of a group in Azure AD will not be updated and reflected in Atlassian Cloud.
* The value of the **mail** user attribute in Azure AD is only populated if the user has a Microsoft Exchange Mailbox. If the user does not have one, it is recommended to map a different desired attribute to the **emails** attribute in Atlassian Cloud.
