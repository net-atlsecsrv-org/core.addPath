# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Percolate

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Percolate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

This integration provides these benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to Percolate.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to Percolate (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you start.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Percolate, you need to have:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Percolate subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Percolate supports SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO.

## Add Percolate from the gallery

To configure the integration of Percolate into Azure AD, you need to add Percolate from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**:

	![Select Azure Active Directory](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**:

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add an application, select **New application** at the top of the window:

	![Select New application](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Percolate**. Select **Percolate** in the search results and then select **Add**.

	 ![Search results](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Percolate by using a test user named Britta Simon.
To enable single sign-on, you need to establish a relationship between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in Percolate.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Percolate, you need to complete these steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable the feature for your users.
2. **[Configure Percolate single sign-on](#configure-percolate-single-sign-on)** on the application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Azure AD single sign-on for the user.
5. **[Create a Percolate test user](#create-a-percolate-test-user)** that's linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Percolate, take these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Percolate** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**:

    ![Select single sign-on](common/select-sso.png)

2. In the **Select a single sign-on method** dialog box, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on:

    ![Select a single sign-on method](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the **Edit** icon to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box:

	![Edit icon](common/edit-urls.png)

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box, you don't need to take any action to configure the application in IdP-initiated mode. The app is already integrated with Azure.

    ![Percolate Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/preintegrated.png)

5. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs** and, in the **Sign on URL** box, enter **https://percolate.com/app/login**:

   ![Percolate Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)
6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Copy** icon to copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**. Save this URL.

	![Copy the App Federation Metadata URL](common/copy-metadataurl.png)

7. In the **Set up Percolate** section, copy the appropriate URLs, based on your requirements.

	![Copy the configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	1. **Login URL**.

	1. **Azure AD Identifier**.

	1. **Logout URL**.

### Configure Percolate single sign-on

1. In a new web browser window, sign in to Percolate as an admin.

2. On the left side of the home page, select **Settings**:
	
	![Select Settings](./media/percolate-tutorial/configure01.png)

3. In the left pane, select **SSO** under **Organization**:

	![Select SSO under Organization](./media/percolate-tutorial/configure02.png)

	1. In the **Login URL** box, paste the **Login URL** value that you copied from the Azure portal.

	1. In the **Entity ID** box, paste the **Azure AD Identifier** value that you copied from the Azure portal.

	1. In Notepad, open the base-64 encoded certificate that you downloaded from the Azure portal. Copy its content and paste it into the **x509 certificates** box.

	1. In the **Email attribute** box, enter **emailaddress**.

	1. The **Identity provider metadata URL** box is an optional field. If you copied an **App Federation Metadata Url** from the Azure portal, you can paste it into this box.

	1. In the **Should AuthNRequests be signed?** list, select **No**.

	1. In the **Enable SSO auto-provisioning** list, select **No**.

	1. Select **Save**.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user named Britta Simon in the Azure portal.

### Test single sign-on

Now you need to test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration by using the Access Panel.

When you select the Percolate tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Percolate instance for which you set up SSO.
