# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Deskradar

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Deskradar with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Deskradar with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Deskradar.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Deskradar with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Deskradar single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.



* Deskradar supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO



## Adding Deskradar from the gallery

To configure the integration of Deskradar into Azure AD, you need to add Deskradar from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Deskradar** in the search box.
1. Select **Deskradar** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Deskradar

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Deskradar using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Deskradar.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Deskradar, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Deskradar SSO](#configure-deskradar-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Deskradar test user](#create-deskradar-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Deskradar that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Deskradar** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<YOURDOMAIN>.deskradar.cloud`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<YOURDOMAIN>.deskradar.cloud/auth/sso/saml/consume`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<YOURDOMAIN>.deskradar.cloud/auth/sso/saml/login`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Replace **YOURDOMAIN** with your Deskradar instance domain. Contact [Deskradar Client support team](mailto:support@deskradar.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Deskradar application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Deskradar application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |
	| Email | user.userprincipalname |
	| | |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
