# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with 8x8

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate 8x8 with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate 8x8 with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to 8x8.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to 8x8 with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An 8x8 subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* 8x8 supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

* Once you configure 8x8 you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding 8x8 from the gallery

To configure the integration of 8x8 into Azure AD, you need to add 8x8 from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **8x8** in the search box.
1. Select **8x8** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for 8x8

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with 8x8 using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in 8x8.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with 8x8, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure 8x8 SSO](#configure-8x8-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create 8x8 test user](#create-8x8-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in 8x8 that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **8x8** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL: `https://sso.8x8.com/saml2`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL: `https://sso.8x8.com/saml2`

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer. You will use the certificate later in the tutorial in the **Configure 8x8 SSO** section.

1. On the **Set up 8x8** section, copy the URL(s) and you will use these URL values later in the tutorial.

	![Copy configuration URLs](./media/8x8virtualoffice-tutorial/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to 8x8.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **8x8**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
