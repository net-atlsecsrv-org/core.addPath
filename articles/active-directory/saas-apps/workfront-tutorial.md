# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workfront

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Workfront with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Workfront with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Workfront.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Workfront with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Workfront, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Workfront single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Workfront supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Workfront from the gallery

To configure the integration of Workfront into Azure AD, you need to add Workfront from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Workfront** in the search box.
1. Select **Workfront** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Workfront

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Workfront using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workfront.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Workfront, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Workfront SSO](#configure-workfront-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Workfront test user](#create-workfront-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Workfront that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Workfront** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.attask-ondemand.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.attasksandbox.com/SAML2`

	> [!NOTE]

Contact [Workfront Client support team](https://www.workfront.com/services-and-support) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Workfront tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Workfront Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Workfront you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
