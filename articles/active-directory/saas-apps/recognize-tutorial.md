# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Recognize

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Recognize with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Recognize with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Recognize.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Recognize (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Recognize, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Recognize single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Recognize supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Recognize from the gallery

To configure the integration of Recognize into Azure AD, you need to add Recognize from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Recognize from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Recognize**, select **Recognize** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Recognize based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Recognize needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Recognize, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Recognize Single Sign-On](#configure-recognize-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Recognize test user](#create-recognize-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Recognize that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Recognize, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Recognize** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file**, perform the following steps:

	>[!NOTE]
	>You will get the **Service Provider metadata file** from the **Configure Recognize Single Sign-On** section of the tutorial.

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

	![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** value get auto populated in Basic SAML Configuration section.

    ![Recognize Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	 In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://recognizeapp.com/<your-domain>/saml/sso`

    > [!Note]
	> If the **Identifier** value do not get auto populated, you will get the Identifier value by opening the Service Provider Metadata URL from the SSO Settings section that is explained later in the **Configure Recognize Single Sign-On** section of the tutorial. The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Recognize Client support team](mailto:support@recognizeapp.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

6. On the **Set up Recognize** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure Recognize Single Sign-On

    ![Screenshot shows a text box with plain text X M L where you can get the entity I D.](./media/recognize-tutorial/tutorial_recognize_004.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user 

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Recognize test user

In order to enable Azure AD users to log into Recognize, they must be provisioned into Recognize. In the case of Recognize, provisioning is a manual task.

This app doesn't support SCIM provisioning but has an alternate user sync that provisions users. 

**To provision a user account, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign into your Recognize company site as an administrator.

2. On the upper right corner, click **Menu**. Go to **Company Admin**.

3. On the left navigation pane, click **Settings**.

4. Perform the following steps on **User Sync** section.
   
	![New User](./media/recognize-tutorial/tutorial_recognize_005.png "New User")
   
	a. As **Sync Enabled**, select **ON**.
   
	b. As **Choose sync provider**, select **Microsoft / Office 365**.
   
	c. Click **Run User Sync**.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Recognize tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Recognize for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
