# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SECURE DELIVER

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SECURE DELIVER with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating SECURE DELIVER with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to SECURE DELIVER.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SECURE DELIVER (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SECURE DELIVER, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* SECURE DELIVER single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* SECURE DELIVER supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding SECURE DELIVER from the gallery

To configure the integration of SECURE DELIVER into Azure AD, you need to add SECURE DELIVER from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SECURE DELIVER from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SECURE DELIVER based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SECURE DELIVER needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SECURE DELIVER, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure SECURE DELIVER Single Sign-On](#configure-secure-deliver-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create SECURE DELIVER test user](#create-secure-deliver-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SECURE DELIVER that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SECURE DELIVER, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **SECURE DELIVER** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    `https://<companyname>.i-securedeliver.jp/sd/<tenantname>/jsf/login/sso`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.i-securedeliver.jp/sd/<tenantname>/postResponse`

### Configure SECURE DELIVER Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **SECURE DELIVER** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [SECURE DELIVER support team](mailto:iw-sd-support@fujifilm.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create SECURE DELIVER test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in SECURE DELIVER. Work withÂ [SECURE DELIVER support team](mailto:iw-sd-support@fujifilm.com) to add the users in the SECURE DELIVER platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the SECURE DELIVER tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the SECURE DELIVER for which you set up SSO.
