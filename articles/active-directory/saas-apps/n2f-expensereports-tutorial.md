# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with N2F - Expense reports

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate N2F - Expense reports with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating N2F - Expense reports with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to N2F - Expense reports.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to N2F - Expense reports (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with N2F - Expense reports, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* N2F - Expense reports single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* N2F - Expense reports supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding N2F - Expense reports from the gallery

To configure the integration of N2F - Expense reports into Azure AD, you need to add N2F - Expense reports from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add N2F - Expense reports from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **N2F - Expense reports**, select **N2F - Expense reports** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with N2F - Expense reports based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in N2F - Expense reports needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with N2F - Expense reports, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure N2F - Expense reports Single Sign-On](#configure-n2f---expense-reports-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create N2F - Expense reports test user](#create-n2f---expense-reports-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in N2F - Expense reports that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with N2F - Expense reports, perform the following steps:

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, the user does not have to perform any steps as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

    ![Screenshot shows the SAML-based Sign-on page with Basic SAML Configuration.](common/preintegrated.png)

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:
