# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Adobe Creative Cloud

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Adobe Creative Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Adobe Creative Cloud with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Adobe Creative Cloud.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Adobe Creative Cloud (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Adobe Creative Cloud, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Adobe Creative Cloud single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Adobe Creative Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Adobe Creative Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Adobe Creative Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Adobe Creative Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Adobe Creative Cloud from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Adobe Creative Cloud**, select **Adobe Creative Cloud** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Adobe Creative Cloud based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Adobe Creative Cloud needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Adobe Creative Cloud, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Adobe Creative Cloud Single Sign-On](#configure-adobe-creative-cloud-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Adobe Creative Cloud test user](#create-adobe-creative-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Adobe Creative Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Adobe Creative Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Adobe Creative Cloud** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Adobe Creative Cloud Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the value as:
    `https://adobe.com`.

	b. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Identifier value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier. Contact [Adobe Creative Cloud Client support team](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud/business/teams/plans.html) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. Adobe Creative Cloud application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** button to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:

	| Name | Source Attribute|

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Adobe Creative Cloud test user

In order to enable Azure AD users to log into Adobe Creative Cloud, they must be provisioned into Adobe Creative Cloud. In the case of Adobe Creative Cloud, provisioning is a manual task.

### To provision a user accounts, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) site as an administrator.

2. Add the user within Adobeâ€™s console as Federated ID and assign them to a Product Profile. For detailed information on adding users, see [Add users in Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/users.html#Addusers) 

3. At this point, type your email address/upn into the Adobe signin form, press tab, and you should be federated back to Azure AD:
   * Web access: www\.adobe.com > sign-in
   * Within the desktop app utility > sign-in
   * Within the application > help > sign-in

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Adobe Creative Cloud tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Creative Cloud for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
