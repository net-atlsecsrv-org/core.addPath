# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Thoughtworks Mingle

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Thoughtworks Mingle with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Thoughtworks Mingle with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Thoughtworks Mingle.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Thoughtworks Mingle (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Thoughtworks Mingle, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Thoughtworks Mingle single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Thoughtworks Mingle supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Thoughtworks Mingle from the gallery

To configure the integration of Thoughtworks Mingle into Azure AD, you need to add Thoughtworks Mingle from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Thoughtworks Mingle from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Thoughtworks Mingle based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Thoughtworks Mingle needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Thoughtworks Mingle, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Thoughtworks Mingle Single Sign-On](#configure-thoughtworks-mingle-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Thoughtworks Mingle test user](#create-thoughtworks-mingle-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Thoughtworks Mingle that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
