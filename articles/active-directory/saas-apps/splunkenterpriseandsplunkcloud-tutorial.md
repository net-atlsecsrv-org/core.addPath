# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Add Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud SSO](#configure-splunk-enterprise-and-splunk-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud test user](#create-splunk-enterprise-and-splunk-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)
4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following pattern:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<splunkserverUrl>/app/launcher/home`

    b. In the **Identifier** box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `<splunkserverUrl>`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<splunkserver>/saml/acs`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Client support team](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/contact-us.html) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud SSO

  To configure single sign-on on **Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud support team](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/contact-us.html). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. Work with [Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud support team](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/contact-us.html) to add the users in the Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app)
