# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with SAP Cloud for Customer

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SAP Cloud for Customer with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate SAP Cloud for Customer with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SAP Cloud for Customer.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SAP Cloud for Customer with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SAP Cloud for Customer single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* SAP Cloud for Customer supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding SAP Cloud for Customer from the gallery

To configure the integration of SAP Cloud for Customer into Azure AD, you need to add SAP Cloud for Customer from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SAP Cloud for Customer** in the search box.
1. Select **SAP Cloud for Customer** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for SAP Cloud for Customer

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with SAP Cloud for Customer using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SAP Cloud for Customer.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SAP Cloud for Customer, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SAP Cloud for Customer SSO](#configure-sap-cloud-for-customer-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SAP Cloud for Customer test user](#create-sap-cloud-for-customer-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP Cloud for Customer that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **SAP Cloud for Customer** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server name>.crm.ondemand.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server name>.crm.ondemand.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [SAP Cloud for Customer Client support team](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements.sap-cloud-services-customers.html) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. SAP Cloud for Customer application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

	b. Select **Transformation** as **source**.

	c. From the **Transformation** list, select **ExtractMailPrefix()**.

	d. From the **Parameter 1** list, select the user attribute you want to use for your implementation.
    For example, if you want to use the EmployeeID as unique user identifier and you have stored the attribute value in the ExtensionAttribute2, then select user.extensionattribute2.

	e. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
