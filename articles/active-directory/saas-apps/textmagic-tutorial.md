# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with TextMagic

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate TextMagic with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating TextMagic with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to TextMagic.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TextMagic (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with TextMagic, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* TextMagic single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* TextMagic supports **IDP** initiated SSO
* TextMagic supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding TextMagic from the gallery

To configure the integration of TextMagic into Azure AD, you need to add TextMagic from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add TextMagic from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with TextMagic based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in TextMagic needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with TextMagic, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure TextMagic Single Sign-On](#configure-textmagic-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create TextMagic test user](#create-textmagic-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in TextMagic that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with TextMagic, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **TextMagic** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![TextMagic Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-identifier.png)

    In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:
    `https://my.textmagic.com/saml/metadata`

5. Your TextMagic application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. TextMagic application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, TextMagic application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name |   Source Attribute| Namespace  |
	| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
	| company | user.companyname | http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims |
	| firstName 			  | user.givenname |  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims |
	| lastName 			  | user.surname |  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims |
	| phone 			  | user.telephonenumber |  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims |
	| | |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.
