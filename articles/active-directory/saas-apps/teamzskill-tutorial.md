# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with TeamzSkill

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TeamzSkill with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate TeamzSkill with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to TeamzSkill.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TeamzSkill with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TeamzSkill single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* TeamzSkill supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* TeamzSkill supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding TeamzSkill from the gallery

To configure the integration of TeamzSkill into Azure AD, you need to add TeamzSkill from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TeamzSkill** in the search box.
1. Select **TeamzSkill** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for TeamzSkill

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with TeamzSkill using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in TeamzSkill.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with TeamzSkill, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TeamzSkill SSO](#configure-teamzskill-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TeamzSkill test user](#create-teamzskill-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TeamzSkill that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **TeamzSkill** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER_SUBDOMAIN>.teamzskill.com/login/callback`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER_SUBDOMAIN>.teamzskill.com/login/callback`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER_SUBDOMAIN>.teamzskill.com/login/callback`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [TeamzSkill Client support team](mailto:support@teamzskill.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. TeamzSkill application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, TeamzSkill application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
	| Firstname | user.givenname |
	| Lastname | user.surname |
	| jobtitle | user.jobtitle |
	| department | user.department |
    | employeeid | user.employeeid |
	| postalcode | user.postalcode |
	| country | user.country |
    | role | user.assignedroles |

    > [!NOTE]
    > TeamzSkill expects roles for users assigned to the application. Please set up these roles in Azure AD so that users can be assigned the appropriate roles. To understand how to configure roles in Azure AD, see [here](../develop/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management.md).

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    b. Paste the **Federation Metadata XML** Value, which you have copied from the Azure portal into **XML Metadata** field.
     
    c. Then click **Save**.

### Create TeamzSkill test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in TeamzSkill. TeamzSkill supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in TeamzSkill, a new one is created when you attempt to access TeamzSkill.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to TeamzSkill Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to TeamzSkill Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the TeamzSkill tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next Steps

Once you configure TeamzSkill you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
