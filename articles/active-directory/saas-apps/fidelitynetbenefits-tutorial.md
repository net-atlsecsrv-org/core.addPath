## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Fidelity NetBenefits based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Fidelity NetBenefits needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Fidelity NetBenefits, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Fidelity NetBenefits Single Sign-On](#configure-fidelity-netbenefits-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Fidelity NetBenefits test user](#create-fidelity-netbenefits-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Fidelity NetBenefits that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Fidelity NetBenefits, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Fidelity NetBenefits** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, perform the following steps:

    ![Fidelity NetBenefits Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

    For Testing Environment:
	`urn:sp:fidelity:geninbndnbparts20:uat:xq1`

	For Production Environment:
	`urn:sp:fidelity:geninbndnbparts20`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL that to be provided by Fidelity at time of implementation or contact your assigned Fidelity Client Service Manager.

5. Fidelity NetBenefits application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Fidelity NetBenefits application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **employeeid** or any other claim which is applicable to your Organization as **nameidentifier**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	>[!Note]
	>Fidelity NetBenefits support Static and Dynamic Federation. Static means it will not use SAML based just in time user provisioning and Dynamic means it supports just in time user provisioning. For using JIT based provisioning customers have to add some more claims in Azure AD like user's birthdate etc. These details are provided by the your assigned **Fidelity Client Service Manager** and they have to enable this dynamic federation for your instance.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create Fidelity NetBenefits test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Fidelity NetBenefits. If you are creating Static federation, please work with your assigned **Fidelity Client Service Manager** to create users in Fidelity NetBenefits platform. These users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.
