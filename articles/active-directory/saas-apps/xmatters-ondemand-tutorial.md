# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with xMatters OnDemand

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate xMatters OnDemand with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating xMatters OnDemand with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to xMatters OnDemand (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with xMatters OnDemand, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* xMatters OnDemand single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* xMatters OnDemand supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding xMatters OnDemand from the gallery

To configure the integration of xMatters OnDemand into Azure AD, you need to add xMatters OnDemand from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for xMatters OnDemand

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with xMatters OnDemand using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in xMatters OnDemand.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with xMatters OnDemand, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	2. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure xMatters OnDemand SSO](#configure-xmatters-ondemand-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create xMatters OnDemand test user](#create-xmatters-ondemand-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in xMatters OnDemand that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.
