# Workday and Azure Active Directory

Connect Workday with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) using our pre-built integration and automatically provision or de-provision user accounts when employees join, move, or leave.

## What can you do with Workday and Azure AD?

- **Automate user provisioning** - Automatically assign applications to employees based on their group, role, or other attributes in Workday.
- **Synchronize employee profiles** - Ensure employee data stays up-to-date between Azure AD and Workday.
- **Simplify onboarding and offboarding** - Automatically provision user accounts for new hires so they can be productive on day one and decrease security risks by automatically de-provisioning user accounts when employees leave.
- **Easy single sign-on** Eliminate username and passwords and allow users to sign in using their organizational accounts hosted in Azure AD.

## Get started

Set up [user provisioning](https://aka.ms/WorkdayProvisioning) and [single sign-on](https://aka.ms/WorkdaySSODoc) for Workday with our easy configuration guides.
