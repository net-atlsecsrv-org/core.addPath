# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Add MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration from the gallery

To configure the integration of MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration into Azure AD, you need to add MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration** in the search box.
1. Select **MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration SSO](#configure-moveit-transfer---azure-ad-integration-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration test user](#create-moveit-transfer---azure-ad-integration-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file**, perform the following steps:

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

    ![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** value gets auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section:

    ![MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier-reply.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://contoso.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The **Sign-on URL** value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration Client support](https://community.ipswitch.com/s/support) team to get the value. You can download the **Service Provider Metadata file** from the **Service Provider Metadata URL** which is explained later in the **Configure MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration Single Sign-On** section of the tutorial. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration. MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration supports just-in-time provisioning, which you have enabled. There is no action item for you in this section. A new user is created during an attempt to access MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration if it doesn't exist yet.

>[!NOTE]
>If you need to create a user manually, you need to contact the [MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration Client support team](https://community.ipswitch.com/s/support).

### Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure MOVEit Transfer - Azure AD integration you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
