# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with UNIFI

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate UNIFI with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate UNIFI with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to UNIFI.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to UNIFI with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* UNIFI single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* UNIFI supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* UNIFI supports **Automated** user provisioning.

## Add UNIFI from the gallery

To configure the integration of UNIFI into Azure AD, you need to add UNIFI from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **UNIFI** in the search box.
1. Select **UNIFI** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for UNIFI

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with UNIFI using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in UNIFI.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with UNIFI, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure UNIFI SSO](#configure-unifi-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create UNIFI test user](#create-unifi-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in UNIFI that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **UNIFI** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL: `INVIEWlabs`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://app.discoverunifi.com/login`

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

7. On the **Set up UNIFI** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to UNIFI.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **UNIFI**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure UNIFI SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign on to your **UNIFI** company site as administrator.

2. Click on the **Users**.

3. Click on the **Add New Identity Provider**.

	![Screenshot shows Ad New Identity Provider selected.](./media/unifi-tutorial/app-2.png)

4. In the **Add Identity Provider** section, perform the following steps:

	![Screenshot shows the Add Identity Provider where you can enter the values described.](./media/unifi-tutorial/app-3.png) 

	a. In the **Provider Name** textbox, type the name of the Identity Provider..

	b. In the **Provider URL** textbox paste the **Login URL** value, which you have copied from Azure portal.

	c. Open the Certificate that you have downloaded from the Azure portal in notepad, remove the **---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---** and **---END CERTIFICATE---** tag and then paste the remaining content in the **Certificate** textbox.

	d. Select the **is Default Provider** checkbox.

### Create UNIFI test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon. **UNIFI** supports automatic user provisioning so no manual steps are required. Users are created automatically after successful authentication from the Azure AD.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to UNIFI Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to UNIFI Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the UNIFI for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the UNIFI tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the UNIFI for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure UNIFI you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
