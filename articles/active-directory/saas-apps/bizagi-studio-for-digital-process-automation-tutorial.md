# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Bizagi for Digital Process Automation

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Bizagi for Digital Process Automation Services or Server with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Bizagi for Digital Process Automation with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to a Bizagi project for Digital Process Automation Services or Server.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to a project of Bizagi for Digital Process AutomationServices or Server with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Bizagi project using Automation Services or Server. 
* Have your own certificates for SAML assertion signatures. This certificates must be generate in p12 or pfx format.
* Have a metadata file in XML format generated from the Bizagi project. 

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a Bizagi project using Automation services or server.

* Bizagi for Digital Process Automation supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Bizagi for Digital Process Automation you can enforce session controls, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Bizagi for Digital Process Automation from the gallery

To configure the integration of Bizagi for Digital Process Automation into Azure AD, you need to add Bizagi for Digital Process Automation from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Bizagi for Digital Process Automation** in the search box.
1. Select **Bizagi for Digital Process Automation** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Bizagi for Digital Process Automation

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Bizagi for Digital Process Automation using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in the Bizagi project.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Bizagi for Digital Process Automation, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Bizagi for Digital Process Automation SSO](#configure-bizagi-for-digital-process-automation-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Bizagi for Digital Process Automation test user](#create-bizagi-for-digital-process-automation-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Bizagi for Digital Process Automation that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Bizagi for Digital Process Automation** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. Upload the Bizagi metadata file in the **Upload metadata file** option.
1. Review the configuration. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL of your Bizagi project:
    `https://<COMPANYNAME>.bizagi.com/<PROJECTNAME>`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type the URL of your Bizagi project:
    `https://<COMPANYNAME>.bizagi.com/<PROJECTNAME>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL and Identifier. Contact [Bizagi for Digital Process Automation support team](mailto:jarvein.rivera@bizagi.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/copy-metadataurl.png)
	
	This metadata URL must be registered in the authentication options of your Bizagi project.
	
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML**page, click the edit/pen icon for **User Attributes & Claims** to edit the Unique User Identifier.
	
	Set the Unique User Identifier as the user.mail.

### Create an Azure AD test 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Bizagi for Digital Process Automation.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Bizagi for Digital Process Automation**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Bizagi for Digital Process Automation SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Bizagi for Digital Process Automation** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Bizagi for Digital Process Automation support team](mailto:jarvein.rivera@bizagi.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Bizagi for Digital Process Automation test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Bizagi for Digital Process Automation. Work with [Bizagi for Digital Process Automation support team](mailto:jarvein.rivera@bizagi.com) to add the users in the Bizagi for Digital Process Automation platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Bizagi for Digital Process Automation tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the portal of Bizagi for Digital Process Automation for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
