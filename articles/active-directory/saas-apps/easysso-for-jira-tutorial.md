# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with EasySSO for Jira

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate EasySSO for Jira with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate EasySSO for Jira with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to EasySSO for Jira.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to EasySSO for Jira with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* EasySSO for Jira single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* EasySSO for Jira supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* EasySSO for Jira supports **Just In Time** user provisioning
* Once you configure EasySSO for Jira you can enforce session control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding EasySSO for Jira from the gallery

To configure the integration of EasySSO for Jira into Azure AD, you need to add EasySSO for Jira from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **EasySSO for Jira** in the search box.
1. Select **EasySSO for Jira** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for EasySSO for Jira

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with EasySSO for Jira using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in EasySSO for Jira.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with EasySSO for Jira, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure EasySSO for Jira SSO](#configure-easysso-for-jira-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create EasySSO for Jira test user](#create-easysso-for-jira-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in EasySSO for Jira that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **EasySSO for Jira** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server-base-url>/plugins/servlet/easysso/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server-base-url>/plugins/servlet/easysso/saml`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server-base-url>/jirasso/login.jsp`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [EasySSO for Jira Client support team](mailto:support@techtime.co.nz) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. EasySSO for Jira application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, EasySSO for Jira application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- | --------- |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1 | | user.userprincipalname |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 | | user.userprincipalname |
	| urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.241 | | user.displayname |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.4 | | user.surname |
    | urn:oid:2.5.4.42 | | user.givenname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to EasySSO for Jira.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **EasySSO for Jira**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure EasySSO for Jira SSO

To configure single sign-on on **EasySSO for Jira** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [EasySSO for Jira support team](mailto:support@techtime.co.nz). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create EasySSO for Jira test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in EasySSO for Jira. EasySSO for Jira supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in EasySSO for Jira, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the EasySSO for Jira tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the EasySSO for Jira for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
