# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Mitel Connect app to integrate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform. The Mitel Connect app is available in the Azure Gallery. Integrating Azure AD with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control users' access to MiCloud Connect apps and to CloudLink apps in Azure AD by using their enterprise credentials.
* You can enable users on your account to be automatically signed in to MiCloud Connect or CloudLink (single sign-on) by using their Azure AD accounts.

For details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin the integration of Azure AD with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with MiCloud Connect, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Mitel MiCloud Connect account or Mitel CloudLink account, depending on the application you want to configure.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on (SSO).

* Mitel Connect supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Mitel Connect you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Add Mitel Connect from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mitel Connect into Azure AD, you need to add Mitel Connect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps in the Azure portal.

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All Applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. Select **New application**.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. Type **Mitel Connect** in the search field, select **Mitel Connect** from results panel, and then select **Add**.

	 ![Mitel Connect in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform based on a test user named **_Britta Simon_**. For single sign-on to work, a link must be established between the user in Azure AD portal and the corresponding user on the Mitel platform. Refer to the following sections for information about configuring and testing Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform.
* Configure and test Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect
* Configure and test Azure AD SSO with CloudLink Platform

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with MiCloud Connect:

1. **[Configure MiCloud Connect for SSO with Azure AD](#configure-micloud-connect-for-sso-with-azure-ad)** - to enable your users to use this feature and to configure the SSO settings on the application side.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
4. **[Create a Mitel MiCloud Connect test user](#create-a-mitel-micloud-connect-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon on your MiCloud Connect account that is linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure MiCloud Connect for SSO with Azure AD

In this section, you'll enable Azure AD single sign-on for MiCloud Connect in the Azure portal and configure your MiCloud Connect account to allow SSO using Azure AD.

To configure MiCloud Connect with SSO for Azure AD, it is easiest to open the Azure portal and the Mitel Account portal side by side. You'll need to copy some information from the Azure portal to the Mitel Account portal and some from the Mitel Account portal to the Azure portal.


1. To open the configuration page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

    1. On the **Mitel Connect** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

       ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

    1. In the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog box, select **SAML**.
    
       ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

  (Example: [brittasimon@contoso.com](mailto:brittasimon@contoso.com); the userâ€™s username is typically the same as the userâ€™s business email address)

> [!NOTE]
> The userâ€™s MiCloud Connect username must be identical to the userâ€™s email address in Azure.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you'll test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the Mitel Connect tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically redirected to sign in to the MiCloud Connect application you configured as your default in the **Sign-on URL** field. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO with CloudLink Platform

This section describes how to enable Azure AD SSO for CloudLink platform in the Azure portal and how to configure your CloudLink platform account to allow single sign-on using Azure AD.

To configure CloudLink platform with single sign-on for Azure AD, it is recommended that you  open the Azure portal and the CloudLink Accounts portal side by side as you will need to copy some information from the Azure portal to the CloudLink Accounts portal and vice versa.
