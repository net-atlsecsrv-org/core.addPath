# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Icertis Contract Management Platform

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Icertis Contract Management Platform with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Icertis Contract Management Platform with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Icertis Contract Management Platform.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Icertis Contract Management Platform with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Icertis Contract Management Platform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Icertis Contract Management Platform supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Icertis Contract Management Platform from the gallery

To configure the integration of Icertis Contract Management Platform into Azure AD, you need to add Icertis Contract Management Platform from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Icertis Contract Management Platform** in the search box.
1. Select **Icertis Contract Management Platform** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Icertis Contract Management Platform

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Icertis Contract Management Platform using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Icertis Contract Management Platform.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Icertis Contract Management Platform, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Icertis Contract Management Platform SSO](#configure-icertis-contract-management-platform-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Icertis Contract Management Platform test user](#create-icertis-contract-management-platform-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Icertis Contract Management Platform that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Icertis Contract Management Platform** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    `https://<company name>.icertis.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<company name>.icertis.com`

	> [!NOTE]

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Icertis Contract Management Platform.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Icertis Contract Management Platform**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Icertis Contract Management Platform SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Icertis Contract Management Platform** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Icertis Contract Management Platform support team](https://www.icertis.com/company/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Icertis Contract Management Platform test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Icertis Contract Management Platform. Work with [Icertis Contract Management Platform support team](https://www.icertis.com/company/contact/) to add the users in the Icertis Contract Management Platform platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Icertis Contract Management Platform Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Icertis Contract Management Platform Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Icertis Contract Management Platform tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Icertis Contract Management Platform Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

## Next steps

Once you configure Icertis Contract Management Platform you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
