# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Catchpoint

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Catchpoint with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Catchpoint with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Catchpoint.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Catchpoint with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Catchpoint single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Catchpoint supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Catchpoint supports **Just In Time** user provisioning
* Once you configure Catchpoint you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Catchpoint from the gallery

To configure the integration of Catchpoint into Azure AD, you need to add Catchpoint from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Catchpoint** in the search box.
1. Select **Catchpoint** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Catchpoint

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Catchpoint using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Catchpoint.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Catchpoint, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Catchpoint SSO](#configure-catchpoint-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Catchpoint test user](#create-catchpoint-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Catchpoint that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Catchpoint** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Setup single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL:
    `https://portal.catchpoint.com/SAML2`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://portal.catchpoint.com/ui/Entry/SingleSignOn.aspx`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://portal.catchpoint.com/ui/Entry/SingleSignOn.aspx`

1. Catchpoint application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Catchpoint application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
	| namespace | user.assignedrole |

    > [!NOTE]
    > namespace claim needs to be mapped with the account name. This account name should be setup as the roles in Azure AD which will be passed back in SAML response. Please refer this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management) to learn how to setup the roles

1. On the **Setup single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Catchpoint** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Catchpoint.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Catchpoint**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

### Create Catchpoint test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Catchpoint. Catchpoint supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Catchpoint, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Catchpoint tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Catchpoint for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> When you are sign into the Catchpoint application through the login page, after providing **Catchpoint Credentials**, enter the valid **Namespace** value in the **Company Credentials(SSO)** textbox and click **Login**.
