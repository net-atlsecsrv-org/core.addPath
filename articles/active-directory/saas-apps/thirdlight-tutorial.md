# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with ThirdLight

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ThirdLight with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This integration provides these benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to ThirdLight.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to ThirdLight (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

If you want to learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with ThirdLight, you need to have:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A ThirdLight subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* ThirdLight supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Add ThirdLight from the gallery

To set up the integration of ThirdLight into Azure AD, you need to add ThirdLight from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**:

	![Select Azure Active Directory](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**:

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add an application, select **New application** at the top of the window:

	![Select New application](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **ThirdLight**. Select **ThirdLight** in the search results and then select **Add**.

	 ![Search results](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ThirdLight by using a test user named Britta Simon.
To enable single sign-on, you need to establish a relationship between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in ThirdLight.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ThirdLight, you need to complete these steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable the feature for your users.
2. **[Configure ThirdLight single sign-on](#configure-thirdlight-single-sign-on)** on the application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Azure AD single sign-on for the user.
5. **[Create a ThirdLight test user](#create-a-thirdlight-test-user)** that's linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with ThirdLight, take these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the ThirdLight application integration page, select **Single sign-on**:

    ![Select single sign-on](common/select-sso.png)

2. In the **Select a single sign-on method** dialog box, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on:

    ![Select a single sign-on method](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the **Edit** icon to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box:

	![Edit icon](common/edit-urls.png)

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box, complete the following steps.

    ![Basic SAML Configuration dialog box](common/sp-identifier.png)

	1. In the **Sign on URL** box, enter a URL in this pattern:
    
          `https://<subdomain>.thirdlight.com/`

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** box, enter a URL in this pattern:

       `https://<subdomain>.thirdlight.com/saml/sp`

	   > [!NOTE]
	   > These values are placeholders. You need to use the actual sign-on URL and identifier. Contact the [ThirdLight support team](https://www.thirdlight.com/support) to get the values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Download** link next to **Federation Metadata XML**, per your requirements, and save the file on your computer:

	![Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

6. In the **Set up ThirdLight** section, copy the appropriate URLs, based on your requirements:

	![Copy the configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	1. **Login URL**.

	1. **Azure AD Identifier**.

	1. **Logout URL**.

### Configure ThirdLight single sign-on

1. In a new web browser window, sign in to your ThirdLight company site as an admin.

1. Go to **Configuration** > **System Administration** > **SAML2**:

### Test single sign-on

Now you need to test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration by using the Access Panel.

When you select the ThirdLight tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ThirdLight instance for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Access and use apps on the My Apps portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
