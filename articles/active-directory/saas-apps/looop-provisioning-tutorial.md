# Tutorial: Configure Looop for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Looop and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Looop.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Public Preview. For more information on the general Microsoft Azure terms of use for Preview features, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant
* [A Looop tenant](https://www.looop.co/pricing/)
* A user account on a Looop with Administrator permissions.

## Assign users to Looop

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called assignments to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Looop. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Looop by following the instructions here:

* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to Looop

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Looop to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Looop, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Set up Looop for provisioning

Before configuring Looop for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you will need to retrieve some provisioning information from Looop.

1. Sign in to your [Looop Admin Console](https://app.looop.co/#/login) and select **Account**. Under **Account Settings** select **Authentication**.

2. Generate a new token by clicking **Reset Token** under **SCIM Integration**.

	:::image type="content" source="media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/resettoken.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the S C I M integration section of a page in the Looop admin console. The Reset token button is highlighted." border="false":::

3. Copy the **SCIM Endpoint** and the **Token**. These values will be entered in the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** fields in the Provisioning tab of your Looop application in the Azure portal.

## Add Looop from the gallery

To configure Looop for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Looop from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the pane.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Looop**, select **Looop** in the results panel. 

	![Looop in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

5. Select the **Sign-up for Looop** button which will redirect you to Looop's login page. 

	![Looop OIDC Add](media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/signup.png)

6. As Looop is an OpenIDConnect app, choose to login to Looop using your Microsoft work account.

	![Looop OIDC login](media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/msftlogin.png)

7. After a successful authentication, accept the consent prompt for the consent page. The application will then be automatically added to your tenant and you will be redirected to your Looop account.

## Configure automatic user provisioning to Looop 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Looop based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Looop in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Looop**.

	![The Looop link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input `https://<organisation_domain>.looop.co/scim/v2` in **Tenant URL**. For example `https://demo.looop.co/scim/v2`. Input the value that you retrieved and saved earlier from Looop in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Looop. If the connection fails, ensure your Looop account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Looop**.

	![Looop User Mappings](media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/usermappings.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Looop in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Looop for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Looop User Attributes](media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/userattributes.png)

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Meta Networks Connector**.

	![Looop Group Mappings](media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/groupmappings.png)

11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Meta Networks Connector in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Meta Networks Connector for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Looop Group Attributes](media/looop-provisioning-tutorial/groupattributes.png)

10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

11. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Looop, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

12. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Looop by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

13. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Looop.
