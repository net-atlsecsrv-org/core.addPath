* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Access to Account Center in your LinkedIn Talent Solutions dashboard

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* LinkedIn Talent Solutions supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* LinkedIn Talent Solutions supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for LinkedIn Talent Solutions

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with LinkedIn Talent Solutions using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in LinkedIn Talent Solutions.

    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure LinkedIn Talent Solutions SSO](#configure-linkedin-talent-solutions-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create LinkedIn Talent Solutions test user](#create-linkedin-talent-solutions-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in LinkedIn Talent Solutions that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

### Create LinkedIn Talent Solutions test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in LinkedIn Talent Solutions. LinkedIn Talent Solutions supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in LinkedIn Talent Solutions, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to LinkedIn Talent Solutions Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to LinkedIn Talent Solutions Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the LinkedIn Talent Solutions for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the LinkedIn Talent Solutions tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the LinkedIn Talent Solutions for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

## Next steps

Once you configure LinkedIn Talent Solutions you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
