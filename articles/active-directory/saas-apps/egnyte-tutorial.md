# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Egnyte

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Egnyte with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Egnyte with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Egnyte.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Egnyte with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Egnyte single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Egnyte supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Egnyte you can enforce Session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Egnyte from the gallery

To configure the integration of Egnyte into Azure AD, you need to add Egnyte from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Egnyte** in the search box.
1. Select **Egnyte** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Egnyte based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Egnyte needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Egnyte, you need to complete the following building blocks:

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Egnyte, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Egnyte SSO](#configure-egnyte-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Egnyte test user](#create-egnyte-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Egnyte that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Egnyte** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Egnyte Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-signonurl.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.egnyte.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.egnyte.com/samlconsumer/AzureAD`
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL and Reply URL. Contact [Egnyte Client support team](https://www.egnyte.com/corp/contact_egnyte.html) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Egnyte tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Egnyte for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
