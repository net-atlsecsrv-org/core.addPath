# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with New Relic

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate New Relic with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate New Relic with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to New Relic.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to New Relic with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A New Relic subscription that's enabled for single sign-on (SSO).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* New Relic supports SSO that's initiated by either the service provider or the identity provider.
* After you configure New Relic, you can enforce session control, which protects against exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Add New Relic from the gallery

To configure the integration of New Relic into Azure AD, you need to add **New Relic (By Organization)** from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. Select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. On the **Browse Azure AD Gallery** page, type **New Relic (By Organization)** in the search box.
1. Select **New Relic (By Organization)** from the results, and then select **Create**. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for New Relic

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with New Relic by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in New Relic.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with New Relic:

1. [Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. [Configure New Relic SSO](#configure-new-relic-sso) to configure the single sign-on settings on the New Relic side.
   1. [Create a New Relic test user](#create-a-new-relic-test-user) to have a counterpart for B.Simon in New Relic linked to the Azure AD user.
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **New Relic by Organization** application integration page, find the **Manage** section. Then select **Single sign-on**.

1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot of Set up Single Sign-On with SAML, with pencil icon highlighted.](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, fill in values for **Identifier** and **Reply URL**.

   * Retrieve these values by using the New Relic **My Organization** application. To use this application:
      1. [Sign in](https://login.newrelic.com/) to New Relic.
      1. On the top menu, select **Apps**.
      1. In the **Your apps** section, select **My Organization** > **Authentication domains**.
      1. Choose the authentication domain to which you want Azure AD SSO to connect (if you have more than one authentication domain). Most companies only have one authentication domain called **Default**. If there's only one authentication domain, you don't need to select anything.
      1. In the **Authentication** section, **Assertion consumer URL** contains the value to use for **Reply URL**.
      1. In the **Authentication** section, **Our entity ID** contains the value to use for **Identifier**.

1. In the **User Attributes & Claims** section, make sure **Unique User Identifier** is mapped to a field that contains the email address being used at New Relic.

   * The default field **user.userprincipalname** will work for you if its values are the same as the New Relic email addresses.
   * The field  **user.mail** might work better for you if **user.userprincipalname** isn't the New Relic email address.

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save its value for later use.

1. In the **Set up New Relic by Organization** section, copy **Login URL** and save its value for later use.

### Create an Azure AD test user

Here's how to create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Select **Users** > **New user**.
1. On the **New user** page:
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the `username@companydomain.extension`. For example, `b.simon@contoso.com`. This should match the email address you'll use on the New Relic side.
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. Select **Show password**, and then save the value that is shown.
   1. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

Here's how to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on by granting access to the New Relic by Organization application.

1. From the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Select **Enterprise applications** > **New Relic by Organization**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section, and select **Users and groups**.

   ![Screenshot of Manage section, with Users and groups highlighted.](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**. In **Add Assignment**, select **Users and groups** (or **Users**, depending on your plan level).

   ![Screenshot of Add user option.](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In **Users and groups** (or **Users**), select **B.Simon** from the **Users** list, and then choose **Select** at the bottom of the screen.
1. In **Add Assignment**, select **Assign**.

## Configure New Relic SSO

Follow these steps to configure SSO at New Relic.

1. [Sign in](https://login.newrelic.com/) to New Relic.

1. On the top menu, select **Apps**.

1. In the **Your apps** section, select **My Organization** > **Authentication domains**.

1. Choose the authentication domain to which you want Azure AD SSO to connect (if you have more than one authentication domain). Most companies only have one authentication domain called **Default**. If there's only one authentication domain, you don't need to select anything.

1. In the **Authentication** section, select **Configure**.

   1. For **Source of SAML metadata**, enter the value you previously saved from the Azure AD **App Federation Metadata Url** field.

   1. For **SSO target URL**, enter the value you previously saved from the Azure AD **Login URL** field.

   1. After verifying that settings look good on both the Azure AD and New Relic sides, select **Save**. If both sides are not properly configured, your users won't be able to sign in to New Relic.

### Create a New Relic test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in New Relic.

1. [Sign in](https://login.newrelic.com/) to New Relic.

1. On the top menu, select **Apps**.

1. In the **Your apps** section, select **User Management**.

1. Select **Add user**.

   1. For **Name**, enter **B.Simon**.
   
   1. For **Email**, enter the value that will be sent by Azure AD SSO.
   
   1. Choose a user **Type** and a user **Group** for the user. For a test user, **Basic User** for Type and **User** for Group are reasonable choices.
   
   1. To save the user, select **Add User**.

## Test SSO 

Here's how to test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration by using the Access Panel.

When you select **New Relic by Organization** in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed into New Relic. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Sign in and start apps from the My Apps portal](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
