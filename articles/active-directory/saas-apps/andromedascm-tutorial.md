# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Andromeda

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Andromeda with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Andromeda with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Andromeda.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Andromeda (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Andromeda, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Andromeda single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Andromeda supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Andromeda supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Andromeda from the gallery

To configure the integration of Andromeda into Azure AD, you need to add Andromeda from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Andromeda from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Andromeda**, select **Andromeda** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Andromeda based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Andromeda needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Andromeda, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Andromeda Single Sign-On](#configure-andromeda-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Andromeda test user](#create-andromeda-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Andromeda that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Andromeda, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Andromeda** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![Andromeda Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenantURL>.ngcxpress.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenantURL>.ngcxpress.com/SAMLConsumer.aspx`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![Andromeda Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenantURL>.ngcxpress.com/SAMLLogon.aspx`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. You will update the value with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL which is explained later in the tutorial.

6. Andromeda application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** button to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

	> [!Important]
	> Clear out the NameSpace definitions while setting these up.

7. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, edit the claims by using **Edit icon** or add the claims by using **Add new claim** to configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps: 

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------ | -----------|
	| role 		  | App specific role |
	| type 		  | App Type |

### Create Andromeda test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Andromeda. Andromeda supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Andromeda, a new one is created after authentication. If you need to create a user manually, contact [Andromeda Client support team](https://www.ngcsoftware.com/support/).

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Andromeda tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Andromeda for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
