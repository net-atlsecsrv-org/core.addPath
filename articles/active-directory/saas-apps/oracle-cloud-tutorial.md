# Tutorial: Integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console from the gallery

To configure the integration of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console into Azure AD, you need to add Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** in the search box.
1. Select **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console using a test user called **B. Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B. Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console](#configure-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-console)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console test user](#create-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-console-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B. Simon in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, enter the values for the following fields:

   > [!NOTE]
   > You will get the Service Provider metadata file from the **Configure Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console Single Sign-On** section of the tutorial.
	
   1. Click **Upload metadata file**.

   1. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

   1. Once the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section textbox.
	
      > [!NOTE]
      > If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values do not get auto polulated, then fill in the values manually according to your requirement.

      In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
      `https://console.<REGIONNAME>.oraclecloud.com/`

      > [!NOTE]
      > The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console Client support team](https://www.oracle.com/support/advanced-customer-support/products/cloud.html) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

1. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

   ![image1](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Attributes & Claims** section on the **Group Claims (Preview)** dialog, perform the following steps:

   1. Click the **pen** next to **Name identifier value**.

   1. Select **Persistent** as **Choose name identifier format**.
 
   1. Click **Save**.
