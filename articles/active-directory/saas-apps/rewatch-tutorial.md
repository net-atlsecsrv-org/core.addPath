# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Rewatch

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Rewatch with Azure Active. Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Rewatch with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Rewatch.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Rewatch with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Rewatch single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Rewatch supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Rewatch supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Rewatch from the gallery

To configure the integration of Rewatch into Azure AD, you need to add Rewatch from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Rewatch** in the search box.
1. Select **Rewatch** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Rewatch

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Rewatch using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Rewatch.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Rewatch, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Rewatch SSO](#configure-rewatch-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Rewatch test user](#create-rewatch-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Rewatch that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Rewatch** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://rewatch.tv/login`

1. Rewatch application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Rewatch application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| --------------- | --------- |
	| Group | user.groups |


1. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Rewatch** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Rewatch.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Rewatch**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Rewatch SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign in to your Rewatch company site as an administrator.

1. Click on **Admin Console** in the left side menu.

    ![Rewatch admin console in the home page.](./media/rewatch-tutorial/admin-console.png)

1. Go to the **Security** and perform the below steps in the **SAML single sign-on** section.

    ![saml single sign-on section.](./media/rewatch-tutorial/security.png)

    a. In the **IdP SSO target URL** textbox, paste the **Login URL** value which you have copied from the Azure portal.

    b. Open the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** from the Azure portal into Notepad and paste the content into the **IdP certificate** textbox.

    c. Check **Enable SAML login for this channel** and click on **Save**.

### Create Rewatch test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Rewatch. Rewatch supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Rewatch, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Rewatch Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Rewatch Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Rewatch for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Rewatch tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Rewatch for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Rewatch you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
