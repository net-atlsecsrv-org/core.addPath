# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with ICIMS

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate ICIMS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating ICIMS with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to ICIMS.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ICIMS (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with ICIMS, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* ICIMS single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* ICIMS supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding ICIMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of ICIMS into Azure AD, you need to add ICIMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add ICIMS from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

4. In the search box, type **ICIMS**, select **ICIMS** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ICIMS based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ICIMS needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ICIMS, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure ICIMS Single Sign-On](#configure-icims-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create ICIMS test user](#create-icims-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in ICIMS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with ICIMS, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **ICIMS** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![ICIMS Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant name>.icims.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant name>.icims.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [ICIMS Client support team](https://www.icims.com/contact-us) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

6. On the **Set up ICIMS** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure Ad Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure ICIMS Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **ICIMS** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [ICIMS support team](https://www.icims.com/contact-us). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

2. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.

    ![New user Button](common/new-user.png)

3. In the User properties, perform the following steps.

    ![The User dialog box](common/user-properties.png)

    a. In the **Name** field enter **BrittaSimon**.
  
    b. In the **User name** field type **brittasimon\@yourcompanydomain.extension**  
    For example, BrittaSimon@contoso.com

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to ICIMS.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **ICIMS**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **ICIMS**.

	![The ICIMS link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. In the menu on the left, select **Users and groups**.

    ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

4. Click the **Add user** button, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

    ![The Add Assignment pane](common/add-assign-user.png)

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create ICIMS test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in ICIMS. Work withÂ [ICIMS support team](https://www.icims.com/contact-us) to add the users in the ICIMS platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the ICIMS tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ICIMS for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
