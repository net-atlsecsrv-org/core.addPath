# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Podbean

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Podbean with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Podbean with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Podbean.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Podbean with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Podbean single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Podbean supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Podbean supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Podbean from the gallery

To configure the integration of Podbean into Azure AD, you need to add Podbean from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Podbean** in the search box.
1. Select **Podbean** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Podbean

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Podbean using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Podbean.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Podbean, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Podbean SSO](#configure-podbean-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Podbean test user](#create-podbean-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Podbean that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Podbean** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.podbean.com/sso/<CUSTOM_ID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Podbean Client support team](mailto:support@podbean.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Podbean** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Podbean.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Podbean**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Podbean SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign in to Podbean as an Administrator.

1. Click **Settings** -> **SSO Login** on the left sidebar.

1. Click on the URL, which is showing in the below image to download the **Podbean SSO Metadata File** and save it in your computer.

1. Upload the **Federation Metadata XML** file in the **SSO IDP Metadata File**.

1. Set your **Email domain**, **SSO Organization Name** and click on **Submit**.

### Create Podbean test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Podbean. Podbean supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Podbean, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

1. Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Podbean Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

2. Go to Podbean Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

3. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Podbean tile in the Access Panel, this will redirect to Podbean Sign-on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Podbean you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
