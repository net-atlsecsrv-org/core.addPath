# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with TurboRater

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate TurboRater with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating TurboRater with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to TurboRater.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to TurboRater (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

For details about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with TurboRater, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* A TurboRater subscription with single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

TurboRater supports IDP-initiated single sign-on (SSO).

## Add TurboRater from the Azure Marketplace

To configure the integration of TurboRater into Azure AD, you need to add TurboRater from the Azure Marketplace to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. In the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

    ![The Azure Active Directory option](common/select-azuread.png)

1. Go to **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All Applications**.

    ![The Enterprise applications option](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. To add a new application, select **+ New application** at the top of the pane.

    ![The New application option](common/add-new-app.png)

1. In the search box, enter **TurboRater**. In the search results, select **TurboRater**, and then select **Add** to add the application.

    ![TurboRater in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with TurboRater based on a test user named  **B Simon**. For single sign-on to work, you must establish a link between an Azure AD user and the related user in TurboRater.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with TurboRater, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Configure TurboRater single sign-on](#configure-turborater-single-sign-on)** to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B. Simon.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Create a TurboRater test user](#create-a-turborater-test-user)** so that there's a user named B. Simon in TurboRater who's linked to the Azure AD user named B. Simon.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with TurboRater, take the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **TurboRater** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on option](common/select-sso.png)

1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** pane, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select **Edit** (the pencil icon) to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane.

    ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane, do the following steps:

    ![TurboRater domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** box, enter a URL:

       `https://www.itcdataservices.com`

    1. In the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** box, enter a URL by using the following pattern:

       | Environment | URL |
       | ---------------| --------------- |
       | Test  | `https://ratingqa.itcdataservices.com/webservices/imp/saml/login` |
       | Live  | `https://www.itcratingservices.com/webservices/imp/saml/login` |

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual identifier and reply URL. To get these values, contact the [TurboRater support team](https://www.getitc.com/support). You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options and save it on your computer.

    ![The Federation Metadata XML download option](common/metadataxml.png)

1. In the **Set up TurboRater** section, copy the URL or URLs that you need:

   * **Login URL**
   * **Azure AD Identifier**
   * **Logout URL**

    ![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Configure TurboRater single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on the TurboRater side, you need to send the downloaded Federation Metadata XML and the appropriate copied URLs from the Azure portal to the [TurboRater support team](https://www.getitc.com/support). The TurboRater team will make sure the SAML SSO connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you create a test user named Britta Simon in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**   > **Users** > **All users**.

    ![The Users and "All users" options](common/users.png)

1. At the top of the screen, select **+ New user**.

    ![New user option](common/new-user.png)

1. In the **User** pane, do the following steps:

    ![The User pane](common/user-properties.png)

    1. In the **Name** box, enter **BSimon**.
  
    1. In the **User name** box, enter **BSimon\@\<yourcompanydomain>.\<extension>**. For example, **BSimon\@contoso.com**.

    1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.

    1. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable B. Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting their access to TurboRater.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise applications** > **All applications** > **TurboRater**.

    ![Enterprise applications pane](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **TurboRater**.

    ![TurboRater in the applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. In the left pane, under **MANAGE**, select **Users and groups**.

    ![The "Users and groups" option](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **+ Add user**, and then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** pane.

    ![The Add Assignment pane](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** pane, select **B. Simon** in the **Users** list, and then choose **Select** at the bottom of the pane.

1. If you're expecting a role value in the SAML assertion, then in the **Select Role** pane, select the appropriate role for the user from the list. At the bottom of the pane, choose **Select**.

1. In the **Add Assignment** pane, select **Assign**.

### Create a TurboRater test user

In this section, you create a user called B. Simon in TurboRater. Work withÂ the [TurboRater support team](https://www.getitc.com/support) to add B. Simon as a user in TurboRater. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration by using the My Apps portal.

When you select **TurboRater** in the My Apps portal, you should be automatically signed in to the TurboRater subscription for which you set up single sign-on. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Access and use apps on the My Apps portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
