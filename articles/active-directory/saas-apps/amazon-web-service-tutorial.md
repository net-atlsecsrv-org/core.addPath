# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Amazon Web Services (AWS) (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

![Amazon Web Services (AWS)](./media/amazon-web-service-tutorial/tutorial_amazonwebservices_image.png)

You can configure multiple Identifiers for multiple instances as below.

* `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml#1`

* `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml#2`

With these values, Azure AD will remove the value of **#** and send the correct value `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml` as the Audience URL in the SAML Token.

**We recommend to use this approach for the following reasons:**

a. Each application will provide you the unique X509 certificate and so each instance can have a different certificate expiry date and you can manage this on the individual AWS account basis. Overall certificate rollover will be easy in this case.

b. You can enable User Provisioning with AWS app in Azure AD and then our service will fetch all the roles from that AWS account. You don’t have to manually add or update the AWS roles on the app.

c. You can assign the app owner individually for the app who can manage the app directly in Azure AD.

> [!Note]
> Make sure you use only Gallery App

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

> [!Note]
> If you want to integrate multiple AWS accounts to one Azure account for Single Sign on, please refer [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-aws-multi-accounts-tutorial) article.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the gallery

To configure the integration of Amazon Web Services (AWS) into Azure AD, you need to add Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Amazon Web Services (AWS) based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Amazon Web Services (AWS) needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Amazon Web Services (AWS), you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) Single Sign-On](#configure-amazon-web-services-aws-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Amazon Web Services (AWS) test user](#create-amazon-web-services-aws-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

3. In the User properties, perform the following steps.

    ![The User dialog box](common/user-properties.png)

    a. In the **Name** field enter **BrittaSimon**.
  
    b. In the **User name** field type **brittasimon\@yourcompanydomain.extension**  
    For example, BrittaSimon@contoso.com

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, type and select **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

	![The Amazon Web Services (AWS) link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. In the menu on the left, select **Users and groups**.

    ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

4. Click the **Add user** button, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Amazon Web Services (AWS) test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon Web Services (AWS) doesn't need a user to be created in their system for SSO, so you don't need to perform any action here.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Amazon Web Services (AWS) tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

## Known issues

 * In the **Provisioning** section, the **Mappings** sub-section will show a "Loading..." message and never display the attribute mappings. The only provisioning workflow supported today is the import of roles from AWS into Azure AD for selection during user/group assignment. The attribute mappings for this are predetermined and not configurable.
 
 * The **Provisioning** section only supports entering one set of credentials for one AWS tenant at a time. All imported roles are written to the appRoles property of the Azure AD [servicePrincipal object](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta) for the AWS tenant. Multiple AWS tenants (represented by servicePrincipals) can be added to Azure AD from the gallery for provisioning, however there is a known issue with not being able to automatically write all of the imported roles from the multiple AWS servicePrincipals used for provisioning into the single servicePrincipal used for single sign-on. As a workaround, the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta) can be used to extract all of the appRoles imported into each AWS servicePrincipal where provisioning is configured. These role strings can be subsequently added to the AWS servicePrincipal where single sign-on is configured.
