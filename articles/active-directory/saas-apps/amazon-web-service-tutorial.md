# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Amazon Web Services (AWS) with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

![Diagram of Azure AD and AWS relationship](./media/amazon-web-service-tutorial/tutorial_amazonwebservices_image.png)

You can configure multiple identifiers for multiple instances. For example:

* `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml#1`

* `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml#2`

With these values, Azure AD removes the value of **#**, and sends the correct value `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml` as the audience URL in the SAML token.

We recommend this approach for the following reasons:

- Each application provides you with a unique X509 certificate. Each instance of an AWS app instance can then have a different certificate expiry date, which can be managed on an individual AWS account basis. Overall certificate rollover is easier in this case.

- You can enable user provisioning with an AWS app in Azure AD, and then our service fetches all the roles from that AWS account. You don't have to manually add or update the AWS roles on the app.

- You can assign the app owner individually for the app. This person can manage the app directly in Azure AD.

> [!Note]
> Make sure you use a gallery application only.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An AWS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) you can enforce Session Control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real-time. Session Control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the gallery

To configure the integration of Amazon Web Services (AWS) into Azure AD, you need to add Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a work account, school account, or personal Microsoft account.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Within the Azure Active Directory overview menu, choose **Enterprise Applications** > **All applications**.
1. Select **New application** to add an application.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** in the search box.
1. Select **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Amazon Web Services (AWS) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Amazon Web Services (AWS), complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) SSO](#configure-amazon-web-services-aws-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Amazon Web Services (AWS) test user](#create-amazon-web-services-aws-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
    1. **[How to configure role provisioning in Amazon Web Services (AWS)](#how-to-configure-role-provisioning-in-amazon-web-services-aws)**
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, update both **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL** with the same default value: `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`. You must select **Save** to save the configuration changes.

1. When you are configuring more than one instance, provide an identifier value. From second instance onwards, use the following format, including a **#** sign to specify a unique SPN value.

    `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml#2`

1. AWS application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, AWS application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name  | Source attribute  | Namespace |
	| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
	| RoleSessionName | user.userprincipalname | `https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes` |
	| Role 			  | user.assignedroles |  `https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes` |
	| SessionDuration 			  | "provide a value between 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 43200 seconds (12 hours)" |  `https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes` |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** (Step 3) dialog box, select **Add a certificate**.

    ![Create new SAML Certificate](common/add-saml-certificate.png)

1. Generate a new SAML signing certificate, and then select **New Certificate**. Enter an email address for certificate notifications.
   
    ![New SAML Certificate](common/new-saml-certificate.png) 

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![The Certificate download link](./media/amazon-web-service-tutorial/certificate.png)

1. In the **Set up Amazon Web Services (AWS)** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

    ![Screenshot of Admin Credentials dialog box](./media/amazon-web-service-tutorial/provisioning1.png)

    a. Enter the AWS user access key in the **clientsecret** field.

    b. Enter the AWS user secret in the **Secret Token** field.

    c. Select **Test Connection**.

    d. Save the setting by selecting **Save**.

3. In the **Settings** section, for **Provisioning Status**, select **On**. Then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of Settings section, with On highlighted](./media/amazon-web-service-tutorial/provisioning2.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The provisioning service imports roles only from AWS to Azure AD. The service does not provision users and groups from Azure AD to AWS.

> [!NOTE]
> After you save the provisioning credentials, you must wait for the initial sync cycle to run. Sync usually takes around 40 minutes to finish. You can see the status at the bottom of the **Provisioning** page, under **Current Status**.

### Create Amazon Web Services (AWS) test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called B.Simon in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon Web Services (AWS) doesn't need a user to be created in their system for SSO, so you don't need to perform any action here.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Amazon Web Services (AWS) tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Known issues

 * In the **Provisioning** section, the **Mappings** subsection shows a "Loading..." message, and never displays the attribute mappings. The only provisioning workflow supported today is the import of roles from AWS into Azure AD for selection during a user or group assignment. The attribute mappings for this are predetermined, and aren't configurable.

 * The **Provisioning** section only supports entering one set of credentials for one AWS tenant at a time. All imported roles are written to the `appRoles` property of the Azure AD [`servicePrincipal` object](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta) for the AWS tenant.

   Multiple AWS tenants (represented by `servicePrincipals`) can be added to Azure AD from the gallery for provisioning. There's a known issue, however, with not being able to automatically write all of the imported roles from the multiple AWS `servicePrincipals` used for provisioning into the single `servicePrincipal` used for SSO.

   As a workaround, you can use the [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta) to extract all of the `appRoles` imported into each AWS `servicePrincipal` where provisioning is configured. You can subsequently add these role strings to the AWS `servicePrincipal` where SSO is configured.

* Roles must meet the following requirements to be eligible to be imported from AWS into Azure AD:

  * Roles must have exactly one saml-provider defined in AWS
