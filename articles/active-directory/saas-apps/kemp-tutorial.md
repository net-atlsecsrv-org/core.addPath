# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration supports **IDP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration from the gallery

To configure the integration of Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration into Azure AD, you need to add Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration** in the search box.
1. Select **Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Kemp LoadMaster Azure AD integration.
