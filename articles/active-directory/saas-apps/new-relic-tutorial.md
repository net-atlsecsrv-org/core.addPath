# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with New Relic by Account

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate New Relic by Account with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate New Relic by Account with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to New Relic by Account.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to New Relic by Account with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* New Relic by Account single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* New Relic by Account supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Once you configure the New Relic by Account you can enforce session controls, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session controls extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding New Relic by Account from the gallery

To configure the integration of New Relic by Account into Azure AD, you need to add New Relic by Account from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **New Relic by Account** in the search box.
1. Select **New Relic by Account** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for New Relic by Account

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with New Relic by Account using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in New Relic by Account.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with New Relic by Account, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure New Relic by Account SSO](#configure-new-relic-by-account-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create New Relic by Account test user](#create-new-relic-by-account-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in New Relic by Account that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **New Relic by Account** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)
1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

    `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/{acc_id}/sso/saml/login` - Be sure to substitute `acc_id` with your own Account ID of New Relic by Account.

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL:
    `rpm.newrelic.com`

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to New Relic by Account.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **New Relic by Account**.
