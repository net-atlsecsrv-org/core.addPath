# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with DigiCert

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate DigiCert with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating DigiCert with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to DigiCert.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to DigiCert (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with DigiCert, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* DigiCert single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* DigiCert supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding DigiCert from the gallery

To configure the integration of DigiCert into Azure AD, you need to add DigiCert from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add DigiCert from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with DigiCert based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in DigiCert needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with DigiCert, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure DigiCert Single Sign-On](#configure-digicert-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create DigiCert test user](#create-digicert-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in DigiCert that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with DigiCert, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **DigiCert** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![DigiCert Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-identifier.png)

    In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:
    `https://www.digicert.com/sso`

5. DigiCert application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** button to open **User Attributes** dialog.

6. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, edit the claims by using **Edit icon** or add the claims by using **Add new claim** to configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps: 

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| nameidentifier | user.userprincipalname |
	| company | < companycode > |
	| digicertrole | CanAccessCertCentral |

    > [!Note]
	> The value of **company** attribute is not real. Update this value with actual company code. To get the value of **company** attribute contact [DigiCert support team](mailto:support@digicert.com).

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![Screenshot that shows the "User claims" section with the "Add new claim" and "Save" buttons highlighted.](common/new-save-attribute.png)
