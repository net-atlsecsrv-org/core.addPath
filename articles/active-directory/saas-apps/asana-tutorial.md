# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Asana

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Asana with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Asana with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Asana.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Asana with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Asana single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Asana supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Asana supports [**Automated** user provisioning](asana-provisioning-tutorial.md)

## Add Asana from the gallery

To configure the integration of Asana into Azure AD, you need to add Asana from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Asana** in the search box.
1. Select **Asana** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Asana

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Asana using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Asana.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Asana, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Asana SSO](#configure-asana-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Asana test user](#create-asana-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Asana that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Asana** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

* Go to Asana Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Asana tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Asana Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Asana you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
