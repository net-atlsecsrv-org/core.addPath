# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

* Once you configure Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions from the gallery

To configure the integration of Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions into Azure AD, you need to add Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions** in the search box.
1. Select **Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions SSO](#configure-serraview-space-utilization-software-solutions-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions test user](#create-serraview-space-utilization-software-solutions-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Serraview Space Utilization Software Solutions** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.
