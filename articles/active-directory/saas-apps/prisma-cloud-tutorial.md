# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Prisma Cloud SSO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Prisma Cloud SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Prisma Cloud SSO with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Prisma Cloud SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Prisma Cloud SSO with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Prisma Cloud SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Prisma Cloud SSO supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

* Prisma Cloud SSO supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Prisma Cloud SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of Prisma Cloud SSO into Azure AD, you need to add Prisma Cloud SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Prisma Cloud SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **Prisma Cloud SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Prisma Cloud SSO

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Prisma Cloud SSO using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Prisma Cloud SSO.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Prisma Cloud SSO, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Prisma Cloud SSO](#configure-prisma-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Prisma Cloud SSO test user](#create-prisma-cloud-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Prisma Cloud SSO that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Prisma Cloud SSO** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://app2.prismacloud.io/customer/<CUSTOMERID>`

    b. The **Reply URL** values are fixed and already pre-populated in Azure portal. You need to select the appropriate URL according to your requirement.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Identifier value is not real. Update the value with the actual Identifier. Contact [Prisma Cloud SSO Client support team](mailto:support@paloaltonetworks.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Prisma Cloud SSO** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Prisma Cloud SSO.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Prisma Cloud SSO**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Prisma Cloud SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Prisma Cloud SSO** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Prisma Cloud SSO support team](mailto:support@paloaltonetworks.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Prisma Cloud SSO test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Prisma Cloud SSO. Prisma Cloud SSO supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Prisma Cloud SSO, a new one is created when you attempt to access Prisma Cloud SSO.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Prisma Cloud SSO for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Prisma Cloud SSO tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Prisma Cloud SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Prisma Cloud SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
