# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Proxyclick

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Proxyclick with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
This integration provides these benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to Proxyclick.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to Proxyclick (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Proxyclick, you need to have:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can sign up for a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* A Proxyclick subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Proxyclick supports SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO.

## Add Proxyclick from the gallery

To set up the integration of Proxyclick into Azure AD, you need to add Proxyclick from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**:

	![Select Azure Active Directory](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**:

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add an application, select **New application** at the top of the window:

	![Select New application](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Proxyclick**. Select **Proxyclick** in the search results and then select **Add**.

	 ![Search results](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Proxyclick by using a test user named Britta Simon.
To enable single sign-on, you need to establish a relationship between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in Proxyclick.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Proxyclick, you need to complete these steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable the feature for your users.
2. **[Configure Proxyclick single sign-on](#configure-proxyclick-single-sign-on)** on the application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Azure AD single sign-on for the user.
5. **[Create a Proxyclick test user](#create-a-proxyclick-test-user)** that's linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Proxyclick, take these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the Proxyclick application integration page, select **Single sign-on**:

    ![Select single sign-on](common/select-sso.png)

2. In the **Select a single sign-on method** dialog box, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on:

    ![Select a single sign-on method](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the **Edit** icon to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box:

	![Edit icon](common/edit-urls.png)

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box, if you want to configure the application in IdP-initiated mode, take the following steps.

    ![Basic SAML Configuration dialog box](common/idp-intiated.png)

    1. In the **Identifier** box, enter a URL in this pattern:
   
       `https://saml.proxyclick.com/init/<companyId>`

    1. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL in this pattern:

       `https://saml.proxyclick.com/consume/<companyId>`

5. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs**. In the **Sign on URL** box, enter a URL in this pattern:
   
   `https://saml.proxyclick.com/init/<companyId>`

    ![Proxyclick Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are placeholders. You need to use the actual identifier, reply URL, and sign-on URL. Steps for getting these values are described later in this tutorial.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Download** link next to **Certificate (Base64)**, per your requirements, and save the certificate on your computer:

	![Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

7. In the **Set up Proxyclick** section, copy the appropriate URLs, based on your requirements:

	![Copy the configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)
