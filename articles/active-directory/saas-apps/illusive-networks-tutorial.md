# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Illusive Networks

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Illusive Networks with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Illusive Networks with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Illusive Networks.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Illusive Networks with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Illusive Networks single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Illusive Networks supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Illusive Networks from the gallery

To configure the integration of Illusive Networks into Azure AD, you need to add Illusive Networks from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Illusive Networks** in the search box.
1. Select **Illusive Networks** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Illusive Networks

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Illusive Networks using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Illusive Networks.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Illusive Networks, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Illusive Networks SSO](#configure-illusive-networks-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Illusive Networks test user](#create-illusive-networks-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Illusive Networks that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Illusive Networks** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ILLUSIVE-MGMT-SERVER>.<DOMAIN>.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ILLUSIVE-MGMT-SERVER>.<DOMAIN>.com/saml2/splogin/<CUSTOM_ID>`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ILLUSIVE-MGMT-SERVER>.<DOMAIN>.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Illusive Networks Client support team](mailto:support@illusivenetworks.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Illusive Networks** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Illusive Networks.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Illusive Networks**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Illusive Networks SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Illusive Networks** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Illusive Networks support team](mailto:support@illusivenetworks.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Illusive Networks test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Illusive Networks. Work with [Illusive Networks support team](mailto:support@illusivenetworks.com) to add the users in the Illusive Networks platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Illusive Networks Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Illusive Networks Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Illusive Networks for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Illusive Networks tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Illusive Networks for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure Illusive Networks you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
