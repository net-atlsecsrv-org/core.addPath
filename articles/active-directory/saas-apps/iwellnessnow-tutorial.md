# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with iWellnessNow

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate iWellnessNow with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating iWellnessNow with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to iWellnessNow.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to iWellnessNow (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with iWellnessNow, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An iWellnessNow single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding iWellnessNow from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding iWellnessNow from the gallery
To configure the integration of iWellnessNow into Azure AD, you need to add iWellnessNow from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add iWellnessNow from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
1. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

1. In the search box, type **iWellnessNow**, select **iWellnessNow** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with iWellnessNow based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in iWellnessNow is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in iWellnessNow needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with iWellnessNow, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Create an iWellnessNow test user](#create-an-iwellnessnow-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in iWellnessNow that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your iWellnessNow application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with iWellnessNow, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **iWellnessNow** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

1. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/iwellnessnow-tutorial/tutorial_iwellnessnow_samlbase.png)

1. On the **iWellnessNow Domain and URLs** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file** and wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

	![iWellnessNow Domain and URLs single sign-on upload](./media/iwellnessnow-tutorial/tutorial_iwellnessnow_upload.png)

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

	![iWellnessNow Domain and URLs single sign-on uploadconfig](./media/iwellnessnow-tutorial/tutorial_iwellnessnow_uploadconfig.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.
	
	c. After successful completion of uploading **Service Provider metadata file** the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **iWellnessNow Domain and URLs** section textbox as shown below:

	![iWellnessNow Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/iwellnessnow-tutorial/tutorial_iwellnessnow_url3.png)

1. If you don't have **Service Provider metadata file** and wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

	![iWellnessNow Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/iwellnessnow-tutorial/tutorial_iwellnessnow_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `http://<CustomerName>.iwellnessnow.com`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<CustomerName>.iwellnessnow.com/ssologin`

1. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![iWellnessNow Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/iwellnessnow-tutorial/tutorial_iwellnessnow_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<CustomerName>.iwellnessnow.com/`
	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL. Contact [iWellnessNow Client support team](mailto:info@iwellnessnow.com) to get these values.

1. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.
