# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with M-Files

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate M-Files with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating M-Files with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to M-Files.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to M-Files (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with M-Files, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* M-Files single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* M-Files supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding M-Files from the gallery

To configure the integration of M-Files into Azure AD, you need to add M-Files from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add M-Files from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

4. In the search box, type **M-Files**, select **M-Files** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with M-Files based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in M-Files needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with M-Files, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure M-Files Single Sign-On](#configure-m-files-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create M-Files test user](#create-m-files-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in M-Files that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with M-Files, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **M-Files** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)
