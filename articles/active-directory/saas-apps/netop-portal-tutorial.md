# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Netop Portal

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Netop Portal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Netop Portal with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Netop Portal.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Netop Portal (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Netop Portal, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Netop Portal single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Netop Portal supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Netop Portal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Netop Portal into Azure AD, you need to add Netop Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Netop Portal from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Netop Portal based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Netop Portal needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Netop Portal, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Netop Portal Single Sign-On](#configure-netop-portal-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Netop Portal test user](#create-netop-portal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Netop Portal that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Netop Portal, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Netop Portal** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

    ![Netop Portal Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/preintegrated.png)

5. Your Netop Portal application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, Netop Portal application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| NRC-ACCOUNT-ID | "adfs-demo" |
	| NRC-EMAIL | user.userprincipalname |
	| NRC-GIVEN-NAME | user.givenname |
	| NRC-SURNAME | user.surname |
	| NRC-USERNAME | user.userprincipalname |
	| nameidentifier | user.userprincipalname |
	| | |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. In the **Namespace** textbox, type https:\//secure.netop.com.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Ok**

	g. Click **Save**.

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.
