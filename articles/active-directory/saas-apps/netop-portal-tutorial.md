# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Netop Portal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Netop Portal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Netop Portal with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Netop Portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Netop Portal with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Netop Portal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Netop Portal supports **IDP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Netop Portal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Netop Portal into Azure AD, you need to add Netop Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Netop Portal** in the search box.
1. Select **Netop Portal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Netop Portal

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Netop Portal using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Netop Portal.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Netop Portal, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Netop Portal SSO](#configure-netop-portal-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Netop Portal test user](#create-netop-portal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Netop Portal that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Netop Portal** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured in **IDP** initiated mode and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by clicking the **Save** button.

1. Netop Portal application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Netop Portal application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| NRC-ACCOUNT-ID | "adfs-demo" |
	| NRC-EMAIL | user.userprincipalname |
	| NRC-GIVEN-NAME | user.givenname |
	| NRC-SURNAME | user.surname |
	| NRC-USERNAME | user.userprincipalname |
	| nameidentifier | user.userprincipalname |
	| | |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Netop Portal** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Netop Portal.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Netop Portal**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Netop Portal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Netop Portal** side, you need to the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and the Login URL from Azure portal. Follow the instructions in Step 3 of the documentation [here](https://kb.netop.com/assets/netop_portal_adfs_and_azure_ad_integration.pdf) to configure NetOp Portal for Azure AD authentication.

### Create Netop Portal test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Netop Portal. Work with [Netop Portal support team](mailto:casemanager@netop.com) to add the users in the Netop Portal platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Netop Portal tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Netop Portal for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
