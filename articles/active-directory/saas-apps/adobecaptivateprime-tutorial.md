# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Adobe Captivate Prime

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Adobe Captivate Prime with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Adobe Captivate Prime with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Adobe Captivate Prime.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Adobe Captivate Prime with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Adobe Captivate Prime single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Adobe Captivate Prime supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Adobe Captivate Prime from the gallery

To configure the integration of Adobe Captivate Prime into Azure AD, you need to add Adobe Captivate Prime from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Adobe Captivate Prime** in the search box.
1. Select **Adobe Captivate Prime** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Adobe Captivate Prime

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Adobe Captivate Prime using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Adobe Captivate Prime.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Adobe Captivate Prime, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Adobe Captivate Prime SSO](#configure-adobe-captivate-prime-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Adobe Captivate Prime test user](#create-adobe-captivate-prime-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Adobe Captivate Prime that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Adobe Captivate Prime** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    `https://captivateprime.adobe.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://captivateprime.adobe.com/saml/SSO`

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Adobe Captivate Prime.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Adobe Captivate Prime**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Adobe Captivate Prime SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Adobe Captivate Prime** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML**, copied **User access URL** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Adobe Captivate Prime support team](mailto:captivateprimesupport@adobe.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Adobe Captivate Prime test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Adobe Captivate Prime. Work with [Adobe Captivate Prime support team](mailto:captivateprimesupport@adobe.com) to add the users in the Adobe Captivate Prime platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Captivate Prime for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Adobe Captivate Prime tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Captivate Prime for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Adobe Captivate Prime you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
