# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with ekarda

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ekarda with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate ekarda with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ekarda.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to ekarda by using their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [What is single sign-on (SSO)?](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An ekarda subscription enabled for single sign-on (SSO).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* ekarda supports SP-initiated and IDP-initiated SSO.
* ekarda supports just-in-time user provisioning.
* After you configure ekarda, you can enforce session control. This precaution protects against exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access App Control. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Add ekarda from the gallery

To configure the integration of ekarda into Azure AD, add ekarda from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.

1. On the left pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Go to **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add the new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ekarda** in the search box.
1. Select **ekarda** from results panel, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for ekarda

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with ekarda by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ekarda.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with ekarda, complete the following steps:

1. [Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable your users to use this feature.

    1. [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. [Configure ekarda SSO](#configure-ekarda-sso) to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * [Create an ekarda test user](#create-an-ekarda-test-user) to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ekarda that's linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps in the Azure portal to enable Azure AD SSO:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. On the **ekarda** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil icon to edit the **Basic SAML Configuration** settings.

   ![Screenshot of Set up Single Sign-On with SAML page, with the pencil icon highlighted.](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you see **Service Provider metadata file**, follow these steps:
    1. Select **Upload metadata file**.
    1. Select the folder icon to select the metadata file, and then select **Upload**.
    1. When the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the values for **Identifier** and **Reply URL** appear automatically in the ekarda section text box.

    > [!Note]
    > If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values don't appear automatically, fill in the values manually according to your requirements.

1. If you don't see **Service Provider metadata file** in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section and you want to configure the application in IDP-initiated mode, enter values for the following fields:

    1. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL that follows this pattern:
    `https://my.ekarda.com/users/saml_metadata/<COMPANY_ID>`
    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL that follows this pattern:
    `https://my.ekarda.com/users/saml_acs/<COMPANY_ID>`

1. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs** and do this:

    * In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL that follows this pattern:
    `https://my.ekarda.com/users/saml_sso/<COMPANY_ID>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values in the two preceding steps aren't real. Update them with the actual identifier, reply URL, and sign-on URL values. Contact the [ekarda Client support team](mailto:contact@ekarda.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** to save **Certificate (Base64)** on your computer.

    ![Screenshot of the SAML Signing Certificate section of the Set up Single Sign-On with SAML page, with download link highlighted for the Base64 certificate.](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. In the **Set up ekarda** section, copy the appropriate URLs based on your requirements.

    ![Screenshot of the Set up ekarda section of the Set up Single Sign-On with SAML page, with the URL copy links highlighted.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll use the Azure portal to create a test user called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **All users**.

1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:

    ![Screenshot of the Users and groups section, with Add user highlighted.](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog box, select **B.Simon** from the list of users. Then, choose **Select** at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you expect any role value in the SAML assertion, select the appropriate role for the user from the list in the **Select Role** dialog box. Then, choose **Select** at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select **Assign**.

## Configure ekarda SSO

1. In a different web-browser window, sign in to your ekarda company site as an administrator.

    1. Select the **Enable SLO** check box in the **OPTIONS** section.
    1. Select **Update**.

### Create an ekarda test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in ekarda. ekarda supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. You have no action to take in this section. If a user named B.Simon doesn't already exist in ekarda, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration by using the My Apps portal.

When you select the ekarda tile in the My Apps portal, you should be automatically signed in to the ekarda site for which you set up SSO. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Introduction to the My Apps portal](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
