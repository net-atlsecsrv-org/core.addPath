# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with FM:Systems

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate FM:Systems with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating FM:Systems with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to FM:Systems.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to FM:Systems (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with FM:Systems, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* FM:Systems single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* FM:Systems supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding FM:Systems from the gallery

To configure the integration of FM:Systems into Azure AD, you need to add FM:Systems from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add FM:Systems from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

4. In the search box, type **FM:Systems**, select **FM:Systems** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with FM:Systems based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in FM:Systems needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with FM:Systems, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure FM:Systems Single Sign-On](#configure-fmsystems-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create FM:Systems test user](#create-fmsystems-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in FM:Systems that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with FM:Systems, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **FM:Systems** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![FM:Systems Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/both-replyurl.png)

	In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.fmshosted.com/fminteract/ConsumerService2.aspx`
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> This value is not real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [FM:Systems Client support team](https://fmsystems.com/support-services/) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

6. On the **Set up FM:Systems** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure FM:Systems Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **FM:Systems** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [FM:Systems support team](https://fmsystems.com/support-services/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

2. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.

    ![New user Button](common/new-user.png)

3. In the User properties, perform the following steps.

    a. In the **Name** field enter **BrittaSimon**.
  
    b. In the **User name** field type `brittasimon@yourcompanydomain.extension`. For example, BrittaSimon@contoso.com

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to FM:Systems.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **FM:Systems**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create FM:Systems test user

1. In a web browser window, sign into your FM:Systems company site as an administrator.

2. Go to **System Administration \> Manage Security \> Users \> User list**.
   
    ![System Administration](./media/fm-systems-tutorial/ic795905.png "System Administration")

    b. Click **Next**.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the FM:Systems tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the FM:Systems for which you set up SSO.
