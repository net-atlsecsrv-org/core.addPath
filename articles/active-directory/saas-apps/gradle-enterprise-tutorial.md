# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Gradle Enterprise

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Gradle Enterprise with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Gradle Enterprise with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Gradle Enterprise.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Gradle Enterprise with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Gradle Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Gradle Enterprise supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Gradle Enterprise from the gallery

To configure the integration of Gradle Enterprise into Azure AD, you need to add Gradle Enterprise from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Gradle Enterprise** in the search box.
1. Select **Gradle Enterprise** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Gradle Enterprise

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Gradle Enterprise using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Gradle Enterprise.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Gradle Enterprise, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Gradle Enterprise SSO](#configure-gradle-enterprise-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Gradle Enterprise test user](#create-gradle-enterprise-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Gradle Enterprise that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Gradle Enterprise** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CLIENT_DOMAIN>`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CLIENT_DOMAIN>/keycloak/realms/gradle-enterprise`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CLIENT_DOMAIN>/keycloak/realms/gradle-enterprise/broker/saml/endpoint`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Gradle Enterprise Client support team](https://gradle.com/brand/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Gradle Enterprise** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Gradle Enterprise.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Gradle Enterprise**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Gradle Enterprise SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Gradle Enterprise** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Gradle Enterprise support team](https://gradle.com/brand/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Gradle Enterprise test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Gradle Enterprise. Work with [Gradle Enterprise support team](https://gradle.com/brand/) to add the users in the Gradle Enterprise platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

1. Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Gradle Enterprise Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

2. Go to Gradle Enterprise Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

3. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Gradle Enterprise tile in the Access Panel, this will redirect to Gradle Enterprise Sign-on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure Gradle Enterprise you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
