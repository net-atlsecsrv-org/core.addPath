# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with BambooHR

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate BambooHR with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate BambooHR with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to BambooHR.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BambooHR with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* BambooHR single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* BambooHR supports **SP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.


## Adding BambooHR from the gallery

To configure the integration of BambooHR into Azure AD, you need to add BambooHR from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **BambooHR** in the search box.
1. Select **BambooHR** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for BambooHR

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with BambooHR using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in BambooHR.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with BambooHR, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure BambooHR SSO](#configure-bamboohr-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    * **[Create BambooHR test user](#create-bamboohr-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in BambooHR that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **BambooHR** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<company>.bamboohr.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

    | Reply URL |
    |-----------|
    | `https://<company>.bamboohr.com/saml/consume.php` |
    | `https://<company>.bamboohr.co.uk/saml/consume.php` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with actual sign-on URL and Reply URL. Contact [BambooHR Client support team](https://www.bamboohr.com/contact.php) to get the values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

## Next steps

Once you configure BambooHR you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
