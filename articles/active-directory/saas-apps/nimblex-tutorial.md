# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Nimblex

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Nimblex with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Nimblex with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Nimblex.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Nimblex (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Nimblex, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Nimblex single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Nimblex supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Nimblex supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Nimblex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Nimblex into Azure AD, you need to add Nimblex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Nimblex from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

4. In the search box, type **Nimblex**, select **Nimblex** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Nimblex based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Nimblex needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Nimblex, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Nimblex Single Sign-On](#configure-nimblex-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Nimblex test user](#create-nimblex-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Nimblex that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Nimblex, perform the following steps:

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Nimblex tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Nimblex for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
