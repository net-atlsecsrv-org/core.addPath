# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with LiquidFiles

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate LiquidFiles with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating LiquidFiles with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to LiquidFiles.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to LiquidFiles (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with LiquidFiles, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* LiquidFiles single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* LiquidFiles supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding LiquidFiles from the gallery

To configure the integration of LiquidFiles into Azure AD, you need to add LiquidFiles from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add LiquidFiles from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **LiquidFiles**, select **LiquidFiles** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with LiquidFiles based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in LiquidFiles needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with LiquidFiles, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure LiquidFiles Single Sign-On](#configure-liquidfiles-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create LiquidFiles test user](#create-liquidfiles-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in LiquidFiles that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.
