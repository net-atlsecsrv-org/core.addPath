# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with mindWireless

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate mindWireless with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate mindWireless with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to mindWireless.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to mindWireless with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* mindWireless single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* mindWireless supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding mindWireless from the gallery

To configure the integration of mindWireless into Azure AD, you need to add mindWireless from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **mindWireless** in the search box.
1. Select **mindWireless** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for mindWireless

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with mindWireless using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in mindWireless.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with mindWireless, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure mindWireless SSO](#configure-mindwireless-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create mindWireless test user](#create-mindwireless-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in mindWireless that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **mindWireless** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.mwsmart.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.mwsmart.com/SAML/AssertionConsumerService.aspx`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [mindWireless Client support team](mailto:sdulloor@mindwireless.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. mindWireless application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, mindWireless application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

    | Name | Namespace  |  Source Attribute|
	| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------|
	| Employee ID | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims`| user.employeeid |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The claim name always be **Employee ID** and the value of which we have mapped to **user.employeeid**, which contains the EmployeeID of the user. Here the user mapping from Azure AD to mindWireless is done on the EmployeeID but you can map it to a different value also based on your application settings. You can work with the [mindWireless support team](mailto:sdulloor@mindwireless.com) first to use the correct identifier of a user and map that value with the **Employee ID** claim.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up mindWireless** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to mindWireless.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **mindWireless**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure mindWireless SSO

To configure single sign-on on **mindWireless** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [mindWireless support team](mailto:sdulloor@mindwireless.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create mindWireless test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in mindWireless. Work withÂ [mindWireless support team](mailto:sdulloor@mindwireless.com) to add the users in the mindWireless platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the mindWireless tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the mindWireless for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
