# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Check Point Identity Awareness

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Check Point Identity Awareness with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Check Point Identity Awareness with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Check Point Identity Awareness.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Check Point Identity Awareness with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Check Point Identity Awareness single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Check Point Identity Awareness supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Check Point Identity Awareness from the gallery

To configure the integration of Check Point Identity Awareness into Azure AD, you need to add Check Point Identity Awareness from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Check Point Identity Awareness** in the search box.
1. Select **Check Point Identity Awareness** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Check Point Identity Awareness

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Check Point Identity Awareness using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Check Point Identity Awareness.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Check Point Identity Awareness, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Check Point Identity Awareness SSO](#configure-check-point-identity-awareness-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Check Point Identity Awareness test user](#create-check-point-identity-awareness-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Check Point Identity Awareness that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Check Point Identity Awareness** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<GATEWAY_IP>/connect/spPortal/ACS/ID/<IDENTIFIER_UID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<GATEWAY_IP>/connect/spPortal/ACS/Login/<IDENTIFIER_UID>`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<GATEWAY_IP>/connect`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Check Point Identity Awareness Client support team](mailto:support@checkpoint.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Check Point Identity Awareness.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Check Point Identity Awareness**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Check Point Identity Awareness SSO

1. Sign in to the Check Point Identity Awareness company site as an administrator.

1. In SmartConsole > **Gateways & Servers** view, click **New > More > User/Identity > Identity Provider**.

    e. Select **Import Metadata File** to upload the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** from the Azure portal.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively you can also select **Insert Manually** to paste manually the **Entity ID** and **Login URL** values into the corresponding fields, and to upload the **Certificate File** from the Azure portal.

    f. Click **OK**.

### Create Check Point Identity Awareness test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Check Point Identity Awareness. Work with [Check Point Identity Awareness support team](mailto:support@checkpoint.com) to add the users in the Check Point Identity Awareness platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Check Point Identity Awareness Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Check Point Identity Awareness Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Check Point Identity Awareness tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Check Point Identity Awareness Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Check Point Identity Awareness you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
