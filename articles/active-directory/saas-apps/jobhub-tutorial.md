# Tutorial: Integrate JOBHUB with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate JOBHUB with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate JOBHUB with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to JOBHUB.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to JOBHUB with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get one-month free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* JOBHUB single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. JOBHUB supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding JOBHUB from the gallery

To configure the integration of JOBHUB into Azure AD, you need to add JOBHUB from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **JOBHUB** in the search box.
1. Select **JOBHUB** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with JOBHUB using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in JOBHUB.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with JOBHUB, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure JOBHUB SSO](#configure-jobhub-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create JOBHUB test user](#create-jobhub-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in JOBHUB that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **JOBHUB** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:
    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://pasona.jobhub.jp/saml/init`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [JOBHUB Client support team](mailto:platform@pasonagroup.co.jp) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

	![Edit SAML Signing Certificate](common/edit-certificate.png)

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **Thumbprint** and save it on your computer.

    ![Copy Thumbprint value](common/copy-thumbprint.png)

1. On the **Set up JOBHUB** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure JOBHUB SSO

To configure single sign-on on **JOBHUB** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [JOBHUB support team](mailto:platform@pasonagroup.co.jp). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `Britta Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `BrittaSimon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to JOBHUB.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **JOBHUB**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **Britta Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

### Create JOBHUB test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in JOBHUB. Work withÂ [JOBHUB support team](mailto:platform@pasonagroup.co.jp) to add the users in the JOBHUB platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test SSO

When you select the JOBHUB tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the JOBHUB for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
