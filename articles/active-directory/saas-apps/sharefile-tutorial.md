# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Citrix ShareFile

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Citrix ShareFile with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Citrix ShareFile with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Citrix ShareFile.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Citrix ShareFile (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Citrix ShareFile, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Citrix ShareFile single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Citrix ShareFile supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Citrix ShareFile from the gallery

To configure the integration of Citrix ShareFile into Azure AD, you need to add Citrix ShareFile from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Citrix ShareFile** in the search box.
1. Select **Citrix ShareFile** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Citrix ShareFile based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Citrix ShareFile needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Citrix ShareFile, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	
	* **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	* **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Citrix ShareFile SSO](#configure-citrix-sharefile-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	* **[Create Citrix ShareFile test user](#create-citrix-sharefile-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Citrix ShareFile that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Citrix ShareFile** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.com/saml/login`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:

    - `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.com`
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.com/saml/info`
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile1.com/saml/info`
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile1.eu/saml/info`
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.eu/saml/info`

	c. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.com/saml/acs`
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.eu/saml/<URL path>`
	- `https://<tenant-name>.sharefile.com/saml/<URL path>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Citrix ShareFile Client support team](https://www.citrix.co.in/products/citrix-content-collaboration/support.html) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

2. Go to Citrix ShareFile Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

3. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Citrix ShareFile tile in the Access Panel, this will redirect to Citrix ShareFile Sign-on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Citrix ShareFile you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
