# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Cornerstone OnDemand

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Cornerstone OnDemand with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Cornerstone OnDemand with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Cornerstone OnDemand.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cornerstone OnDemand (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Cornerstone OnDemand, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Cornerstone OnDemand single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cornerstone OnDemand supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Cornerstone OnDemand supports [Automated user provisioning](cornerstone-ondemand-provisioning-tutorial.md)

## Adding Cornerstone OnDemand from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cornerstone OnDemand into Azure AD, you need to add Cornerstone OnDemand from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Cornerstone OnDemand from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Cornerstone OnDemand**, select **Cornerstone OnDemand** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Cornerstone OnDemand in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cornerstone OnDemand based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cornerstone OnDemand needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cornerstone OnDemand, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Cornerstone OnDemand Single Sign-On](#configure-cornerstone-ondemand-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Cornerstone OnDemand test user](#create-cornerstone-ondemand-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Cornerstone OnDemand that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Cornerstone OnDemand, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Cornerstone OnDemand** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Cornerstone OnDemand Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<company>.csod.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<company>.csod.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Cornerstone OnDemand Client support team](mailto:moreinfo@csod.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

6. On the **Set up Cornerstone OnDemand** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure Ad Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure Cornerstone OnDemand Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Cornerstone OnDemand** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Cornerstone OnDemand support team](mailto:moreinfo@csod.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Cornerstone OnDemand test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Cornerstone OnDemand. Cornerstone OnDemand supports automatic user provisioning, which is by default enabled. You can find more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/cornerstone-ondemand-provisioning-tutorial) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

**If you need to create user manually, perform following steps:**

To configure user provisioning, send the information (e.g.: Name, Email) about the Azure AD user you want to provision to the [Cornerstone OnDemand support team](mailto:moreinfo@csod.com).

>[!NOTE]
>You can use any other Cornerstone OnDemand user account creation tools or APIs provided by Cornerstone OnDemand to provision AAD user accounts.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Cornerstone OnDemand tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Cornerstone OnDemand for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
