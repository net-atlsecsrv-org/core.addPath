# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Form.com

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Form.com with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Form.com with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Form.com.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Form.com (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Form.com, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Form.com single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Form.com supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Form.com from the gallery

To configure the integration of Form.com into Azure AD, you need to add Form.com from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Form.com from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

4. In the search box, type **Form.com**, select **Form.com** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Form.com based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Form.com needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Form.com, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Form.com Single Sign-On](#configure-formcom-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Form.com test user](#create-formcom-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Form.com that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Form.com, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Form.com** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.wa-form.com`

    b. In the **Identifier** box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.form.com`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    
    | |
	|--|
	| `https://<subdomain>.wa-form.com/Member/UserAccount/SAML2.action` |
	| `https://<subdomain>.form.com/Member/UserAccount/SAML2.action` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL, Identifier and Reply URL.

You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** and click the copy **icon** to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Configure Form.com Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Form.com** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)**, **App Federation Metadata Url** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Form.com support team](https://form.com/about/company/contact-us/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **Form.com**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Form.com test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Form.com. Work withÂ [Form.com support team](https://form.com/about/company/contact-us/) to add the users in the Form.com platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on
