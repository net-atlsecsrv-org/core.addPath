# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with AppNeta Performance Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate AppNeta Performance Manager with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate AppNeta Performance Manager with Azure AD, you can:

- Control in Azure AD who has access to AppNeta Performance Manager.
- Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to AppNeta Performance Manager with their Azure AD accounts.
- Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- AppNeta Performance Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

- AppNeta Performance Manager supports **SP** initiated SSO

- AppNeta Performance Manager supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding AppNeta Performance Manager from the gallery

To configure the integration of AppNeta Performance Manager into Azure AD, you need to add AppNeta Performance Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **AppNeta Performance Manager** in the search box.
1. Select **AppNeta Performance Manager** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for AppNeta Performance Manager

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with AppNeta Performance Manager using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in AppNeta Performance Manager.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with AppNeta Performance Manager, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure AppNeta Performance Manager SSO](#configure-appneta-performance-manager-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create AppNeta Performance Manager test user](#create-appneta-performance-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AppNeta Performance Manager that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **AppNeta Performance Manager** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

   a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://<subdomain>.pm.appneta.com`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [AppNeta Performance Manager Client support team](mailto:support@appneta.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. AppNeta Performance Manager application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

   ![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, AppNeta Performance Manager application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

   | Name      | Source Attribute       |
   | --------- | ---------------------- |
   | firstName | user.givenname         |
   | lastName  | user.surname           |
   | email     | user.userprincipalname |
   | name      | user.userprincipalname |
   | groups    | user.assignedroles     |
   | phone     | user.telephonenumber   |
   | title     | user.jobtitle          |
   |           |                        |

   > [!NOTE]
   > **groups** refers to the security group in Appneta which is mapped to a **Role** in Azure AD. Please refer to [this](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md#app-roles-ui) doc which explains how to create custom roles in Azure AD.

   1. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

   1. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

   1. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

   1. Select Source as **Attribute**.

   1. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

   1. Click **Ok**

   1. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to AppNeta Performance Manager.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **AppNeta Performance Manager**.

## Configure AppNeta Performance Manager SSO

To configure single sign-on on **AppNeta Performance Manager** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [AppNeta Performance Manager support team](mailto:support@appneta.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create AppNeta Performance Manager test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in AppNeta Performance Manager. AppNeta Performance Manager supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in AppNeta Performance Manager, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!Note]
> If you need to create a user manually, contact [AppNeta Performance Manager support team](mailto:support@appneta.com).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to AppNeta Performance Manager Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

- Go to AppNeta Performance Manager Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the AppNeta Performance Manager tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to AppNeta Performance Manager Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure AppNeta Performance Manager you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
