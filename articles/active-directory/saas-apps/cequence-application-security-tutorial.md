# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Cequence Application Security

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cequence Application Security with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Cequence Application Security with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Cequence Application Security.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cequence Application Security with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cequence Application Security single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Cequence Application Security supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Cequence Application Security supports **Just In Time** user provisioning


## Adding Cequence Application Security from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cequence Application Security into Azure AD, you need to add Cequence Application Security from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cequence Application Security** in the search box.
1. Select **Cequence Application Security** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Cequence Application Security

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cequence Application Security using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cequence Application Security.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cequence Application Security, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cequence Application Security SSO](#configure-cequence-application-security-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cequence Application Security test user](#create-cequence-application-security-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cequence Application Security that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Cequence Application Security** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMERNAME>.s.cequence.cloud`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMERNAME>.s.cequence.cloud:443/saml/metadata`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Cequence Application Security Client support team](mailto:support@cequence.ai) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Cequence Application Security application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Cequence Application Security application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| --------------- | --------- |
	| Group | user.groups |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Cequence Application Security.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Cequence Application Security**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Cequence Application Security SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cequence Application Security** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Cequence Application Security support team](mailto:support@cequence.ai). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cequence Application Security test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Cequence Application Security. Cequence Application Security supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Cequence Application Security, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

1. Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Cequence Application Security Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

2. Go to Cequence Application Security Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

3. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Cequence Application Security tile in the Access Panel, this will redirect to Cequence Application Security Sign-on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure Cequence Application Security you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
