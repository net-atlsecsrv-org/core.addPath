## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Infogix Data3Sixty Govern based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Infogix Data3Sixty Govern needs to be established.

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Infogix Data3Sixty Govern Single Sign-On](#configure-infogix-data3sixty-govern-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Infogix Data3Sixty Govern test user](#create-infogix-data3sixty-govern-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Infogix Data3Sixty Govern that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
