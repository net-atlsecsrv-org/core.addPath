# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Pingboard

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Pingboard with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Pingboard with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Pingboard.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pingboard (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Pingboard, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Pingboard single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Pingboard supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO

* Pingboard supports [Automated user provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/pingboard-provisioning-tutorial) 

## Adding Pingboard from the gallery

To configure the integration of Pingboard into Azure AD, you need to add Pingboard from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Pingboard from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

4. In the search box, type **Pingboard**, select **Pingboard** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Pingboard based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Pingboard needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Pingboard, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Pingboard Single Sign-On](#configure-pingboard-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Pingboard test user](#create-pingboard-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Pingboard that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Pingboard, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Pingboard** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Basic S A M L Configuration" with the "Identifier" and "Reply U R L" text boxes highlighted and the "Save" button selected.](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:
    `http://app.pingboard.com/sp`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<entity-id>.pingboard.com/auth/saml/consume`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![Pingboard Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<sub-domain>.pingboard.com/sign_in`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Pingboard Client support team](https://support.pingboard.com/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

7. On the **Set up Pingboard** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure Pingboard Single Sign-On

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Pingboard tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Pingboard for which you set up SSO.
