# Tutorial: Configure Juno Journey for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Juno Journey and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Juno Journey](https://www.junojourney.com/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Juno Journey
> * Remove users in Juno Journey when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Juno Journey
> * [Single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/juno-journey-tutorial) to Juno Journey (recommended)

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles) to configure provisioning (e.g. Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
*  A [Juno Journey tenant](https://www.junojourney.com/getstarted).
*  A user account in Juno Journey with Admin permissions.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/user-provisioning).
2. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
3. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Juno Journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/customize-application-attributes). 

## Step 2. Configure Juno Journey to support provisioning with Azure AD

1. For **Secret Token**  and **Tenant URL** contact Juno Journey support team at support@the-juno.com. This value will be entered in the **Secret Token**  and **Tenant URL** fields respectively in the Provisioning tab of your Juno Journey application in the Azure portal. 

## Step 3. Add Juno Journey from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Juno Journey from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Juno Journey. If you have previously setup Juno Journey for SSO you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-gallery-app). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts). 

* When assigning users and groups to Juno Journey, you must select a role other than **Default Access**. Users with the Default Access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can [update the application manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps) to add additional roles. 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts). 


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Juno Journey 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Juno Journey in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Juno Journey**.

	![The Juno Journey link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the tenant URL value retrieved earlier in **Tenant URL**. Input the secret token value retrieved earlier in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Juno Journey. If the connection fails, ensure your Juno Journey account has admin permissions and try again.

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Select **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Juno Journey**.

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Juno Journey in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Juno Journey for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/customize-application-attributes), you will need to ensure that the Juno Journey API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:costCenter|String|
   urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:division|String|
   urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:manager|String|
   urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:organization|String|


10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../manage-apps/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

11. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Juno Journey, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

12. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Juno Journey by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

13. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-provisioning-quarantine-status).
