# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Bridgeline Unbound

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Bridgeline Unbound with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Bridgeline Unbound with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Bridgeline Unbound.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Bridgeline Unbound (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Bridgeline Unbound, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Bridgeline Unbound single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Bridgeline supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Bridgeline Unbound supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Bridgeline Unbound from the gallery

To configure the integration of Bridgeline Unbound into Azure AD, you need to add Bridgeline Unbound from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Bridgeline Unbound from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	 ![Bridgeline Unbound in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Bridgeline Unbound based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Bridgeline Unbound needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Bridgeline Unbound, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Bridgeline Unbound Single Sign-On](#configure-bridgeline-unbound-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Bridgeline Unbound test user](#create-bridgeline-unbound-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Bridgeline Unbound that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Bridgeline Unbound, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Bridgeline Unbound** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![Bridgeline Unbound Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `iApps_UPSTT_<ENVIRONMENTNAME>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.iapps.com/SAMLAssertionService.aspx`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![Bridgeline Unbound Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.iapps.com/CommonLogin/login?<INSTANCENAME>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Bridgeline Unbound Client support team](mailto:support@iapps.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

7. On the **Set up Bridgeline Unbound** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Configure Bridgeline Unbound Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Bridgeline Unbound** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Bridgeline Unbound support team](mailto:support@iapps.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
