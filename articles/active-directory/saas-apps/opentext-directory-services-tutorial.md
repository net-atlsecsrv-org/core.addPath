# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with OpenText Directory Services

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate OpenText Directory Services with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate OpenText Directory Services with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to OpenText Directory Services.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to OpenText Directory Services with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* OpenText Directory Services single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* OpenText Directory Services supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* OpenText Directory Services supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add OpenText Directory Services from the gallery

To configure the integration of OpenText Directory Services into Azure AD, you need to add OpenText Directory Services from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **OpenText Directory Services** in the search box.
1. Select **OpenText Directory Services** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for OpenText Directory Services

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with OpenText Directory Services using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in OpenText Directory Services.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with OpenText Directory Services, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OpenText Directory Services SSO](#configure-opentext-directory-services-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create OpenText Directory Services test user](#create-opentext-directory-services-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in OpenText Directory Services that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **OpenText Directory Services** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.opentext.com/<OTDSTENANT>/<TENANTID>/login`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.opentext.com/<OTDSTENANT>/<TENANTID>/login?authhandler=<HANDLERID>`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.opentext.com/<OTDSTENANT>/<TENANTID>/login?authhandler=<HANDLERID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [OpenText Directory Services Client support team](mailto:support@opentext.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to OpenText Directory Services.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **OpenText Directory Services**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure OpenText Directory Services SSO

To configure single sign-on on **OpenText Directory Services** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [OpenText Directory Services support team](mailto:support@opentext.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create OpenText Directory Services test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in OpenText Directory Services. OpenText Directory Services supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OpenText Directory Services, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to OpenText Directory Services Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to OpenText Directory Services Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the OpenText Directory Services for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the OpenText Directory Services tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the OpenText Directory Services for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure OpenText Directory Services you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
