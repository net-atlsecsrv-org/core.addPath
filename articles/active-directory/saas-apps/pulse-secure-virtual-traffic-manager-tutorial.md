# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager supports **SP** initiated SSO
