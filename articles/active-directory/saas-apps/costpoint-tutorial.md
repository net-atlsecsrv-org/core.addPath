# Tutorial: Integrate Costpoint with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Costpoint with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Costpoint with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Costpoint.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Costpoint with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Costpoint single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Costpoint supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Costpoint from the gallery

To configure the integration of Costpoint into Azure AD, you need to add Costpoint from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Costpoint** in the search box.
1. Select **Costpoint** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Costpoint using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Costpoint.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Costpoint, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Costpoint](#configure-costpoint)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Costpoint test user](#create-costpoint-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Costpoint that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Costpoint** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CostpointURI>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CostpointURI>/LoginServlet.cps`

    c. Click **Set additional URLs**.

    d. In the **Relay State** text box, type a value using the following pattern:`<SYSTEM VALUE>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Relay State. Contact [Costpoint Client support team](https://www.deltek.com/about/contact-us) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode perform the following step:

	In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL:
    `https://costpointteea.deltek.com/cpweb/cploginform.htm`

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your Notepad.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/copy-metadataurl.png)

1. On the **Set up Costpoint** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

   ![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Configure Costpoint

To configure single sign-on on **Costpoint** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Costpoint Client support team](https://www.deltek.com/about/contact-us). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Costpoint.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Costpoint**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

### Create Costpoint test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Costpoint. Work withÂ [Costpoint Client support team](https://www.deltek.com/about/contact-us) to add the users in the Costpoint platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on. 

### Test SSO

When you select the Costpoint tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Costpoint for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
