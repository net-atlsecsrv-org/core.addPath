# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with RightCrowd Workforce Management

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate RightCrowd Workforce Management with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate RightCrowd Workforce Management with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to RightCrowd Workforce Management.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to RightCrowd Workforce Management with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* RightCrowd Workforce Management single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.



* RightCrowd Workforce Management supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* RightCrowd Workforce Management supports **Just In Time** user provisioning


## Adding RightCrowd Workforce Management from the gallery

To configure the integration of RightCrowd Workforce Management into Azure AD, you need to add RightCrowd Workforce Management from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **RightCrowd Workforce Management** in the search box.
1. Select **RightCrowd Workforce Management** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for RightCrowd Workforce Management

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with RightCrowd Workforce Management using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in RightCrowd Workforce Management.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with RightCrowd Workforce Management, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure RightCrowd Workforce Management SSO](#configure-rightcrowd-workforce-management-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create RightCrowd Workforce Management test user](#create-rightcrowd-workforce-management-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in RightCrowd Workforce Management that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **RightCrowd Workforce Management** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type one of the following URLs: 
    `http://<SUBDOMAIN>.rightcrowdcustomerdomain.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.rightcrowdcustomerdomain.com/RightCrowd/Saml2/Auth/AssertionComsumerService`


1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:
    `http://<SUBDOMAIN>.rightcrowdcustomerdomain.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [RightCrowd Workforce Management support team](mailto:info@rightcrowd.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to RightCrowd Workforce Management.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **RightCrowd Workforce Management**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure RightCrowd Workforce Management SSO

To configure single sign-on on **RightCrowd Workforce Management** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [RightCrowd Workforce Management support team](mailto:info@rightcrowd.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create RightCrowd Workforce Management test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in RightCrowd Workforce Management. RightCrowd Workforce Management supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in RightCrowd Workforce Management, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to RightCrowd Workforce Management Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to RightCrowd Workforce Management Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the RightCrowd Workforce Management for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the RightCrowd Workforce Management tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the RightCrowd Workforce Management for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure RightCrowd Workforce Management you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
