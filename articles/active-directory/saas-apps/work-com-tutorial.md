# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Work.com

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Work.com with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Work.com with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Work.com.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Work.com (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Work.com, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Work.com single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Work.com supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Work.com from the gallery

To configure the integration of Work.com into Azure AD, you need to add Work.com from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Work.com from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Work.com based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Work.com needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Work.com, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Work.com Single Sign-On](#configure-workcom-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Work.com test user](#create-workcom-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Work.com that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

>[!NOTE]
>To configure single sign-on, you need to setup a custom Work.com domain name yet. You need to define at least a domain name, test your domain name, and deploy it to your entire organization.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Work.com, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Work.com** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.
