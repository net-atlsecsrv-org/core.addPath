# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Zscaler Two

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zscaler Two with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Zscaler Two with Azure AD, you can:

- Control in Azure AD who has access to Zscaler Two.
- Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zscaler Two with their Azure AD accounts.
- Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Zscaler Two, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Zscaler Two single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

- Zscaler Two supports **SP** initiated SSO.

- Zscaler Two supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Zscaler Two from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zscaler Two into Azure AD, you need to add Zscaler Two from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zscaler Two** in the search box.
1. Select **Zscaler Two** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Zscaler Two

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zscaler Two using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zscaler Two.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zscaler Two, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Zscaler Two SSO](#configure-zscaler-two-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Zscaler Two test user](#create-zscaler-two-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Zscaler Two that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Zscaler Two** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

   In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type the URL used by your users to sign-on to your ZScaler Two application.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Zscaler Two Client support team](https://www.zscaler.com/company/contact) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your Zscaler Two application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

   ![Screenshot shows User Attributes with the Edit icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Zscaler Two application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

   | Name     | Source Attribute   |
   | -------- | ------------------ |
   | memberOf | user.assignedroles |

   a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

   ![Screenshot shows User claims with the option to Add new claim.](common/new-save-attribute.png)
