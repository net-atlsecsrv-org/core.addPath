# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SuccessFactors

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SuccessFactors with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating SuccessFactors with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to SuccessFactors.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SuccessFactors (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SuccessFactors, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* SuccessFactors single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* SuccessFactors supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding SuccessFactors from the gallery

To configure the integration of SuccessFactors into Azure AD, you need to add SuccessFactors from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SuccessFactors from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

4. In the search box, type **SuccessFactors**, select **SuccessFactors** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![SuccessFactors in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SuccessFactors based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SuccessFactors needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SuccessFactors, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure SuccessFactors Single Sign-On](#configure-successfactors-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create SuccessFactors test user](#create-successfactors-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SuccessFactors that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SuccessFactors, perform the following steps:

    d. Select **Assertion** as **Require Mandatory Signature**.

    e. Select **Enabled** as **Enable SAML Flag**.

    f. Select **No** as **Login Request Signature(SF Generated/SP/RP)**.

    g. Select **Browser/Post Profile** as **SAML Profile**.

    h. Select **No** as **Enforce Certificate Valid Period**.

    i. Copy the content of the downloaded certificate file from Azure portal, and then paste it into the **SAML Verifying Certificate** textbox.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > The certificate content must have begin certificate and end certificate tags.

5. Navigate to SAML V2, and then perform the following steps:

    ![Configuring single sign-on on app side][13]

    a. Select **Yes** as **Support SP-initiated Global Logout**.

	c. Click **Save**.

	> [!NOTE]
    > If you try to enable this, the system checks if it creates a duplicate SAML login name. For example if the customer has usernames User1 and user1. Taking away case sensitivity makes these duplicates. The system gives you an error message and does not enable the feature. The customer needs to change one of the usernames so itâ€™s spelled different.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
