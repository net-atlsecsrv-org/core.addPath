# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Qumu Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Qumu Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Qumu Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Qumu Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Qumu Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Qumu Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Qumu Cloud supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

* Qumu Cloud supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Qumu Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Qumu Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Qumu Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Qumu Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Qumu Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Qumu Cloud

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Qumu Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Qumu Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Qumu Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Qumu Cloud SSO](#configure-qumu-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Qumu Cloud test user](#create-qumu-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Qumu Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Qumu Cloud** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.qumucloud.com/saml/SSO`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.qumucloud.com/saml/SSO`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.qumucloud.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Qumu Cloud Client support team](mailto:support@qumu.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. Qumu Cloud application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![Screenshot shows User Attributes with the Edit icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png)

7. In addition to above, Qumu Cloud application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |    
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.42 | user.givenname |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.4 | user.surname |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 | user.mail |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1 | user.userprincipalname |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![Screenshot shows User claims with the option to Add new claim.](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![Screenshot shows the Manage user claims dialog box where you can enter the values described.](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Save**.

8. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Qumu Cloud.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Qumu Cloud**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Qumu Cloud SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Qumu Cloud** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Qumu Cloud support team](mailto:support@qumu.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Qumu Cloud test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Qumu Cloud. Qumu Cloud supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Qumu Cloud, a new one is created after authentication.

>[!Note]
>If you need to create a user manually, contact [Qumu Cloud Client support team](mailto:support@qumu.com).

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Qumu Cloud Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Qumu Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Qumu Cloud for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Qumu Cloud tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Qumu Cloud for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Qumu Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
