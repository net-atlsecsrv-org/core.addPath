# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with SurveyMonkey Enterprise

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SurveyMonkey Enterprise with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate SurveyMonkey Enterprise with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SurveyMonkey Enterprise.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SurveyMonkey Enterprise with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SurveyMonkey Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* SurveyMonkey Enterprise supports **IDP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding SurveyMonkey Enterprise from the gallery

To configure the integration of SurveyMonkey Enterprise into Azure AD, you need to add SurveyMonkey Enterprise from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SurveyMonkey Enterprise** in the search box.
1. Select **SurveyMonkey Enterprise** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for SurveyMonkey Enterprise

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with SurveyMonkey Enterprise using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SurveyMonkey Enterprise.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SurveyMonkey Enterprise, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SurveyMonkey Enterprise SSO](#configure-surveymonkey-enterprise-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SurveyMonkey Enterprise test user](#create-surveymonkey-enterprise-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SurveyMonkey Enterprise that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **SurveyMonkey Enterprise** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by clicking the **Save** button.

1. SurveyMonkey Enterprise application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

    ![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, SurveyMonkey Enterprise application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

    | Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| Email | user.mail |
    | FirstName | user.givenname |
    | LastName | user.surname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up SurveyMonkey Enterprise** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to SurveyMonkey Enterprise.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **SurveyMonkey Enterprise**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure SurveyMonkey Enterprise SSO

To configure single sign-on on **SurveyMonkey Enterprise** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [SurveyMonkey Enterprise support team](mailto:support@selerix.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create SurveyMonkey Enterprise test user

It is not necessary to create a test user in SurveyMonkey Enterprise. User accounts will be provisioned, if the user chooses to create a new account, based on the SAML assertion. Your SurveyMonkey Enterprise Customer Success Manager will provide steps to complete this process after your Azure metadata has been added to the SurveyMonkey Enterprise configuration and it's ready to be validated.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the SurveyMonkey Enterprise tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the SurveyMonkey Enterprise for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
