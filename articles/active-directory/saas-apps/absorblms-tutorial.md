# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Absorb LMS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Absorb LMS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Absorb LMS with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Absorb LMS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Absorb LMS with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Absorb LMS, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Absorb LMS single sign-on enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Absorb LMS supports **IDP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Absorb LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Absorb LMS into Azure AD, you need to add Absorb LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Absorb LMS** in the search box.
1. Select **Absorb LMS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Absorb LMS

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Absorb LMS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Absorb LMS.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Absorb LMS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Absorb LMS SSO](#configure-absorb-lms-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Absorb LMS test user](#create-absorb-lms-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Absorb LMS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Absorb LMS** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** button to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

    If you are using **Absorb 5 - UI** use the following configuration:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern::
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.myabsorb.com/account/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern::
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.myabsorb.com/account/saml`

    If you are using **Absorb 5 - New Learner Experience** use the following configuration:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.myabsorb.com/api/rest/v2/authentication/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern: :
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.myabsorb.com/api/rest/v2/authentication/saml`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Absorb LMS Client support team](https://support.absorblms.com/hc/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**.

Also please note that User Provisioing is only available on **Absorb 5 - New Learner Experience** with ACS URL-`https://company.myabsorb.com/api/rest/v2/authentication/saml`

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Absorb LMS for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Absorb LMS tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Absorb LMS for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Absorb LMS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
