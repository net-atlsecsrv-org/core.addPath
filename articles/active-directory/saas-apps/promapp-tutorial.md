# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Nintex Promapp

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Nintex Promapp with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Nintex Promapp with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Nintex Promapp.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Nintex Promapp with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Nintex Promapp single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Nintex Promapp supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Nintex Promapp supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Nintex Promapp from the gallery

To configure the integration of Nintex Promapp into Azure AD, you need to add Nintex Promapp from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Nintex Promapp** in the search box.
1. Select **Nintex Promapp** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Nintex Promapp

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Nintex Promapp using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Nintex Promapp.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Nintex Promapp, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Nintex Promapp SSO](#configure-nintex-promapp-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Nintex Promapp test user](#create-nintex-promapp-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Nintex Promapp that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Nintex Promapp** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    1. In the **Identifier** box, enter a URL in this pattern:

        ```https
        https://go.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/
        https://au.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/
        https://us.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/
        https://eu.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/
        https://ca.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/
        ```

	   > [!NOTE]
	   > Azure AD integration with Nintex Promapp is currently configured only for service-initiated authentication. (That is, going to a Nintex Promapp URL initiates the authentication process.) But the **Reply URL** field is a required field.

    1. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL in this pattern:

       `https://<DOMAINNAME>.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/saml/authenticate.aspx`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign on URL** box, enter a URL in this pattern: `https://<DOMAINNAME>.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/saml/authenticate`

    > [!NOTE]
	> These values are placeholders. You need to use the actual identifier, reply URL, and sign-on URL. Contact the [Nintex Promapp support team](https://www.promapp.com/about-us/contact-us/) to get the values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Nintex Promapp** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Nintex Promapp.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Nintex Promapp**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Nintex Promapp SSO

1. Sign in to your Nintex Promapp company site as an admin.

2. In the menu at the top of the window, select **Admin**:

    ![Select Admin][12]

3. Select **Configure**:

    ![Select Configure][13]

4. In the **Security** dialog box, take the following steps.

    ![Security dialog box][14]

	1. Paste the **Login URL** that you copied from the Azure portal into the **SSO-Login URL** box.

	1. In the **SSO - Single Sign-on Mode** list, select **Optional**. Select **Save**.

       > [!NOTE]
	   > Optional mode is for testing only. After you're happy with the configuration, select **Required** in the **SSO - Single Sign-on Mode** list to force all users to authenticate with Azure AD.

	1. In Notepad, open the certificate that you downloaded in the previous section. Copy the contents of the certificate without the first line (**-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----**) or the last line (**-----END CERTIFICATE-----**). Paste the certificate content into the **SSO-x.509 Certificate** box, and then select **Save**.

### Create Nintex Promapp test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Nintex Promapp. Nintex Promapp supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Nintex Promapp, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Nintex Promapp tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Nintex Promapp for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
