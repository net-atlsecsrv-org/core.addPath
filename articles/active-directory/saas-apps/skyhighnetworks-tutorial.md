# Tutorial: Integrate MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get one-month free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.


## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Dropbox you can enforce Session Control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real-time. Session Control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)

## Adding MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration from the gallery

To configure the integration of MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration into Azure AD, you need to add MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration** in the search box.
1. Select **MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration SSO](#configure-mvision-cloud-azure-ad-sso-configuration-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration test user](#create-mvision-cloud-azure-ad-sso-configuration-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Datadog** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)


4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ENV>.myshn.net/shndash/saml/Azure_SSO`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ENV>.myshn.net/shndash/response/saml-postlogin`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ENV>.myshn.net/shndash/saml/Azure_SSO`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration Client support team](mailto:support@skyhighnetworks.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.


## Configure MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration SSO

To configure single sign-on on **MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration support team](mailto:support@skyhighnetworks.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.


### Create MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration. Work with [MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration support team](mailto:support@skyhighnetworks.com) to add the users in the MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the MVISION Cloud Azure AD SSO Configuration for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
