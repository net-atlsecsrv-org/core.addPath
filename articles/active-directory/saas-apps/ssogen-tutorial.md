# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Once you configure the SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE you can enforce session controls, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session controls extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SSOGEN Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E Business Suite EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE SSO](#configure-ssogen-azure-ad-sso-gateway-for-oracle-e-business-suite-ebs-peoplesoft-and-jde-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create SSOGEN Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E Business Suite EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE test user](#create-ssogen-azure-ad-sso-gateway-for-oracle-e-business-suite-ebs-peoplesoft-and-jde-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<customer_name>.ssogen.com/ssogen/login?client_name=<customer_name>`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<customer_name>.ssogen.com/ssogen/login?client_name=<customer_name>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-On URL. Contact [SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE Client support team](mailto:support@ssogen.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. SSOGEN - Azure AD SSO Gateway for Oracle E-Business Suite - EBS, PeopleSoft, and JDE application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.onpremisessamaccountname**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.
