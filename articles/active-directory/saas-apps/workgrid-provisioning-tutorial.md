# Tutorial: Configure Workgrid  for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Workgrid  and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Workgrid.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Public Preview. For more information on the general Microsoft Azure terms of use for Preview features, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant.
* [A Workgrid tenant](https://www.workgrid.com/)
* A user account in Workgrid  with Admin permissions.

## Assigning users to Workgrid 

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Workgrid. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Workgrid  by following the instructions here:
* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Workgrid 

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Workgrid  to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Workgrid, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Set up Workgrid for provisioning

Before configuring Workgrid  for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you will need to enable SCIM provisioning on Workgrid.

1. Log in into Workgrid. Navigate to **Users > User Provisioning**.

2. Under **Account Management API**, click **Create Credentials**.

	![Workgrid](media/Workgrid-provisioning-tutorial/scim.png)

3. Copy the **SCIM Endpoint** and **Access Token** values. These will be entered in the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** field in the Provisioning tab of your Workgrid application in the Azure portal.

## Add Workgrid  from the gallery

To configure Workgrid  for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Workgrid  from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Workgrid  from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the pane.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Workgrid**, select **Workgrid** in the results panel, and then click the **Add** button to add the application.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Workgrid  

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Workgrid  based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Workgrid  , following the instructions provided in the [Workgrid  Single sign-on tutorial](Workgrid-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features compliment each other

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Workgrid  in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Workgrid**.

	![The Workgrid  link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the Admin Credentials section, input the **SCIM Endpoint** and **Access Token** values retrieved earlier in **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** respectively. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Workgrid. If the connection fails, ensure your Workgrid account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Workgrid**.

	![Workgrid User Mappings](media/Workgrid-provisioning-tutorial/usermapping.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Workgrid  in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Workgrid  for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Workgrid  User Attributes](media/Workgrid-provisioning-tutorial/userattribute.png)

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Workgrid**

	![Workgrid User Mappings](media/Workgrid-provisioning-tutorial/groupmapping.png)

12. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Workgrid  in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Workgrid  for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Workgrid User Mappings](media/Workgrid-provisioning-tutorial/groupattribute.png)

13. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

14. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Workgrid, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

15. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Workgrid  by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

16. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs. For more information on how long it will take for users and/or groups to provision, see [How long will it take to provision users](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md#how-long-will-it-take-to-provision-users).

You can use the **Current Status** section to monitor progress and follow links to your provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Workgrid. For more information, see [Check the status of user provisioning](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md). To read the Azure AD provisioning logs, see [Reporting on automatic user account provisioning](../app-provisioning/check-status-user-account-provisioning.md).
