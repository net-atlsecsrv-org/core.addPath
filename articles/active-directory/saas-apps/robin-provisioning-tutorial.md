# Tutorial: Configure Robin for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Robin and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Robin.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Public Preview. For more information on the general Microsoft Azure terms of use for Preview features, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant
* [A Robin tenant](https://robinpowered.com/pricing/)
* A user account in Robin with Admin permissions.

## Assigning users to Robin

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Robin. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Robin by following the instructions here:
* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Robin

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Robin to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Robin, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Set up Robin for provisioning

1. Sign in to your [Robin Admin Console](https://dashboard.robinpowered.com/login). Navigate to **Manage > Integrations > SCIM > Manage**.

2.	Generate a new organization token. If you lose this token, you can always make a new one without affecting existing users.

	![robin powered Add SCIM](media/robin-provisioning-tutorial/robin-token.png)

3.	Copy the **SCIM Authentication Token**. This value will be entered in the Secret Token field in the Provisioning tab of your Robin application in the Azure portal.



## Add Robin from the gallery

Before configuring Robin for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Robin from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Robin from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the pane.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Robin**, select **Robin** in the results panel, and then click the **Add** button to add the application.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Robin 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Robin based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Robin, following the instructions provided in the [Robin Single sign-on tutorial](./robin-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features compliment each other

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Robin in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Robin**.

	![The robin powered link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input `https://api.robinpowered.com/v1.0/scim-2` in **Tenant URL**. Input the **SCIM Authentication Token** value retrieved earlier in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Robin. If the connection fails, ensure your Robin account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Robin**.

	![robin powered User Mappings](media/robin-provisioning-tutorial/robin-user-mapping.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Robin in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Robin for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![robin powered User Attributes](media/robin-provisioning-tutorial/robin-user-attribute-mapping.png)

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Robin**.

	![robin powered Group Mappings](media/robin-provisioning-tutorial/robin-group-mapping.png)

11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Robin in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Robin for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![robin powered Group Attributes](media/robin-provisioning-tutorial/robin-group-attribute-mapping.png)

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

13. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Robin, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Robin by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Robin.
