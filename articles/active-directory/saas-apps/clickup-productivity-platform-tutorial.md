# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with ClickUp Productivity Platform

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ClickUp Productivity Platform with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate ClickUp Productivity Platform with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ClickUp Productivity Platform.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ClickUp Productivity Platform with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ClickUp Productivity Platform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* ClickUp Productivity Platform supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add ClickUp Productivity Platform from the gallery

To configure the integration of ClickUp Productivity Platform into Azure AD, you need to add ClickUp Productivity Platform from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ClickUp Productivity Platform** in the search box.
1. Select **ClickUp Productivity Platform** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for ClickUp Productivity Platform

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with ClickUp Productivity Platform using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ClickUp Productivity Platform.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with ClickUp Productivity Platform, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ClickUp Productivity Platform SSO](#configure-clickup-productivity-platform-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ClickUp Productivity Platform test user](#create-clickup-productivity-platform-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ClickUp Productivity Platform that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **ClickUp Productivity Platform** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.
