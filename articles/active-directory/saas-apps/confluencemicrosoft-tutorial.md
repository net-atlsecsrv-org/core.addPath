# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Description:

Use your Microsoft Azure Active Directory account with Atlassian Confluence server to enable single sign-on. This way all your organization users can use the Azure AD credentials to sign in into the Confluence application. This plugin uses SAML 2.0 for federation.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- Confluence server application installed on a Windows 64-bit server (on-premises or on the cloud IaaS infrastructure)
- Confluence server is HTTPS enabled
- Note the supported versions for Confluence Plugin are mentioned in below section.
- Confluence server is reachable on internet particularly to Azure AD Login page for authentication and should able to receive the token from Azure AD
- Admin credentials are set up in Confluence
- WebSudo is disabled in Confluence
- Test user created in the Confluence server application

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment of Confluence. Test the integration first in development or staging environment of the application and then use the production environment.

To get started, you need the following items:

* Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Supported versions of Confluence

As of now, following versions of Confluence are supported:

- Confluence: 5.0 to 5.10
- Confluence: 6.0.1 to 6.15.9
- Confluence: 7.0.1 to 7.1.0

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that our Confluence Plugin also works on Ubuntu Version 16.04

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft from the gallery

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft SSO](#configure-confluence-saml-sso-by-microsoft-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft test user](#create-confluence-saml-sso-by-microsoft-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/confluencemicrosoft-tutorial/addon54.png)

	> [!TIP]
	> Ensure that there is only one certificate mapped against the app so that there is no error in resolving the metadata. If there are multiple certificates, admin gets an error upon resolving the metadata.

	1. In the **Metadata URL** textbox, paste **App Federation Metadata Url** value which you have copied from the Azure portal and click the **Resolve** button. It reads the IdP metadata URL and populates all the fields information.

	1. Copy the **Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL** values and paste them in **Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL** textboxes respectively in **Basic SAML Configuration** section on Azure portal.

	1. In **Login Button Name** type the name of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.
	
	1. In **Login Button Description** type the description of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.

	1. In **SAML User ID Locations**, select either **User ID is in the NameIdentifier element of the Subject statement** or **User ID is in an Attribute element**.  This ID has to be the Confluence user ID. If the user ID is not matched, then system will not allow users to sign in. 

	   > [!Note]
	   > Default SAML User ID location is Name Identifier. You can change this to an attribute option and enter the appropriate attribute name.

	1. If you select **User ID is in an Attribute element** option, then in **Attribute name** textbox type the name of the attribute where User ID is expected. 

	1. If you are using the federated domain (like ADFS etc.) with Azure AD, then click on the **Enable Home Realm Discovery** option and configure the **Domain Name**.

	1. In **Domain Name** type the domain name here in case of the ADFS-based login.

	1. Check **Enable Single Sign out** if you wish to sign out from Azure AD when a user signs out from Confluence. 

	1. Enable **Force Azure Login** checkbox, if you wish to sign in through Azure AD credentials only.

	   > [!Note]
	   > To enable the default login form for admin login on the login page when the force azure login is enabled, add the query parameter in the browser URL.
	   > `https://<domain:port>/login.action?force_azure_login=false`

	1. Click **Save** button to save the settings.

	   > [!NOTE]
