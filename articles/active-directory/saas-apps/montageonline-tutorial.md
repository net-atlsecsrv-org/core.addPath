# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Montage Online

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Montage Online with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Montage Online with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Montage Online.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Montage Online (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Montage Online single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Montage Online supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Montage Online based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Montage Online needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Montage Online, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Montage Online Single Sign-On](#configure-montage-online-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Montage Online test user](#create-montage-online-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Montage Online that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.
