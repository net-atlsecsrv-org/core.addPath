# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Spotinst

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Spotinst with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Spotinst with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Spotinst.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Spotinst with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Spotinst single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Spotinst supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Spotinst from the gallery

To configure the integration of Spotinst into Azure AD, you need to add Spotinst from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Spotinst** in the search box.
1. Select **Spotinst** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Spotinst

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Spotinst using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Spotinst.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Spotinst, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Spotinst SSO](#configure-spotinst-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Spotinst test user](#create-spotinst-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Spotinst that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Spotinst** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you want to configure the application in IDP initiated mode, complete these steps:

   1. Make sure **Reply URL** is set to: https://console.spotinst.com/auth/saml.
   1. In **Relay State**, enter your Spotinst Organization ID, which you can also confirm on the **SSO** tab.
   1. **Sign-on URL** must be empty.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Spotinst application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Spotinst application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| -----| --------------- |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Spotinst tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Spotinst for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
