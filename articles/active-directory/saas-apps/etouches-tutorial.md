# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with etouches

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate etouches with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating etouches with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to etouches.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to etouches (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with etouches, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* etouches single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* etouches supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding etouches from the gallery

To configure the integration of etouches into Azure AD, you need to add etouches from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add etouches from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **etouches**, select **etouches** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with etouches based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in etouches needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with etouches, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure etouches Single Sign-On](#configure-etouches-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create etouches test user](#create-etouches-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in etouches that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with etouches, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **etouches** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set-up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![etouches Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.eiseverywhere.com/saml/accounts/?sso&accountid=<ACCOUNTID>`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.eiseverywhere.com/<instance name>`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. You update the value with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier, which is explained later in the tutorial.
	> 

5. Your etouches application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click on **Edit** icon to add the attributes.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, etouches application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------------------- | -------------------- |
	| Email | user.mail | 

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![image](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![image](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Ok**

	g. Click **Save**.

7. On the **Set-up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

8. On the **Set up etouches** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure Ad Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure etouches Single Sign-On

1. To get SSO configured for your application, perform the following steps in the etouches application: 

    ![etouches configuration](./media/etouches-tutorial/tutorial_etouches_06.png) 

    a. Sign in to **etouches** application using the Admin rights.
   
    b. Go to the **SAML** Configuration.

    c. In the **General Settings** section, open your downloaded certificate from Azure portal in notepad, copy the content, and then paste it into the IDP metadata textbox. 

    d. Click on the **Save & Stay** button.
  
    e. Click on the **Update Metadata** button in the SAML Metadata section. 

    f. This opens the page and performs SSO. Once the SSO is working then you can set up the username.

    g. In the Username field, select the **emailaddress** as shown in the image below. 

    h. Copy the **SP entity ID** value and paste it into the **Identifier**  textbox, which is in **Basic SAML Configuration** section on Azure portal.

	i. Copy the **SSO URL / ACS** value and paste it into the **Sign-on URL** textbox, which is in **Basic SAML Configuration** section on Azure portal.
   
### Create an Azure AD test user 

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)
