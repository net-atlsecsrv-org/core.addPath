# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Hightail

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Hightail with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Hightail with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Hightail.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Hightail (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Hightail, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Hightail single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Hightail supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Hightail supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Hightail from the gallery

To configure the integration of Hightail into Azure AD, you need to add Hightail from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Hightail from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Hightail**, select **Hightail** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Hightail in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Hightail based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Hightail needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Hightail, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Hightail Single Sign-On](#configure-hightail-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Hightail test user](#create-hightail-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Hightail that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Hightail, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Hightail** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following step:

    ![Hightail Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/both-replyurl.png)

	In the **Reply URL** text box, type the URL as:
    `https://www.hightail.com/samlLogin?phi_action=app/samlLogin&subAction=handleSamlResponse`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Reply URL value is not real value. You will update the Reply URL value with the actual Reply URL, which is explained later in the tutorial.

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![Hightail Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/both-signonurl.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL as:
    `https://www.hightail.com/loginSSO`

6. Your Hightail application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

7. In addition to above, Hightail application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| -------- |-------- |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| UserIdentity | user.mail |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![image](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![image](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Ok**

	g. Click **Save**.

8. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

9. On the **Set up Hightail** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure Ad Identifier

	c. Logout URL

	> [!NOTE]
    > Before configuring the Single Sign On at Hightail app, please white list your email domain with Hightail team so that all the users who are using this domain can use Single Sign On functionality.

### Create Hightail test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Hightail. Hightail supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Hightail, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to create a user manually, you need to contact the [Hightail support team](mailto:support@hightail.com).

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Hightail tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Hightail for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
