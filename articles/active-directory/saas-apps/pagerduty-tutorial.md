# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with PagerDuty

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate PagerDuty with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate PagerDuty with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to PagerDuty.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to PagerDuty with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* PagerDuty single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* PagerDuty supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure PagerDuty you can enforce session control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding PagerDuty from the gallery

To configure the integration of PagerDuty into Azure AD, you need to add PagerDuty from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **PagerDuty** in the search box.
1. Select **PagerDuty** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for PagerDuty

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with PagerDuty using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in PagerDuty.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with PagerDuty, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure PagerDuty SSO](#configure-pagerduty-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create PagerDuty test user](#create-pagerduty-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in PagerDuty that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **PagerDuty** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.pagerduty.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.pagerduty.com`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.pagerduty.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [PagerDuty Client support team](https://www.pagerduty.com/support/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
