# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Reward Gateway

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Reward Gateway with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Reward Gateway with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Reward Gateway.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Reward Gateway (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Reward Gateway, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Reward Gateway single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Reward Gateway supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Reward Gateway from the gallery

To configure the integration of Reward Gateway into Azure AD, you need to add Reward Gateway from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Reward Gateway from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

4. In the search box, type **Reward Gateway**, select **Reward Gateway** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Reward Gateway based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Reward Gateway needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Reward Gateway, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Reward Gateway Single Sign-On](#configure-reward-gateway-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Reward Gateway test user](#create-reward-gateway-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Reward Gateway that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Reward Gateway, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Reward Gateway** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, perform the following steps:

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Reward Gateway.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **Reward Gateway**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

### Create Reward Gateway test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Reward Gateway. Work withÂ [Reward Gateway support team](mailto:clientsupport@rewardgateway.com) to add the users in the Reward Gateway platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Reward Gateway tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Reward Gateway for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
