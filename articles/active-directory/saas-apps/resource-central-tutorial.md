# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Resource Central

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Resource Central with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Resource Central with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Resource Central.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Resource Central with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Resource Central single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Resource Central supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Resource Central supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Add Resource Central from the gallery

To configure the integration of Resource Central into Azure AD, you need to add Resource Central from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add a new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, in the search box, enter **Resource Central**.
1. Select **Resource Central** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Resource Central

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Resource Central using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Resource Central.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Resource Central, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
    1. **[Create Resource Central test user](#create-resource-central-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Resource Central that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Configure Resource Central SSO](#configure-resource-central-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Resource Central** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In **Basic SAML Configuration**, enter the values for the following fields:

   1. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<DOMAIN_NAME>/ResourceCentral`

   1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:  `https://<DOMAIN_NAME>/ResourceCentral`

   1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<DOMAIN_NAME>/ResourceCentral/ExAuth/Saml2Authentication/Acs`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not literal values. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL, Identifier, and Reply URL values. Contact [Resource Central Client support team](mailto:st@aod.vn) to get these values.  You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in **SAML Signing Certificate**,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user called B.Simon in the Azure portal.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the `username@companydomain.extension`. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Resource Central.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Resource Central**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** pane.
1. In the **Users and groups** pane, select **B.Simon** from the **Users** list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it in **Select a role**. If no role has been set up for this app, you see **Default Access** role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** pane, click the **Assign** button.

### Create Resource Central test user

In this section, a user called **B.Simon** is created in **Resource Central**.

1. In Resource Central, select **Security** > **Persons** > **New**.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration. To test single sign-on, you have three options:

* In the Azure portal, select **Test this application**. The link redirects to the Resource Central sign-on URL, where you can initiate login.

* Go to the Resource Central sign-on URL directly and initiate login.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/resource-central/test.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Resource Central single sign-on test webpage.":::

* Use the My Apps portal from Microsoft. In the My Apps portal, select the **Resource Central** tile to redirect to the Resource Central sign-on URL. For more information, see [Sign in and start apps from the My Apps portal](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

After you set up Resource Central for single sign-on with Azure AD, you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
