# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Sedgwick CMS

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Sedgwick CMS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Sedgwick CMS with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Sedgwick CMS.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Sedgwick CMS (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Sedgwick CMS, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Sedgwick CMS single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Sedgwick CMS supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Sedgwick CMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Sedgwick CMS into Azure AD, you need to add Sedgwick CMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Sedgwick CMS from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sedgwick CMS based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Sedgwick CMS needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sedgwick CMS, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Sedgwick CMS Single Sign-On](#configure-sedgwick-cms-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Sedgwick CMS test user](#create-sedgwick-cms-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Sedgwick CMS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Sedgwick CMS, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Sedgwick CMS** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

### Configure Sedgwick CMS Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Sedgwick CMS** side, you need to send the downloaded **FederationMetadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Sedgwick CMS support team](https://www.sedgwick.com/help).
