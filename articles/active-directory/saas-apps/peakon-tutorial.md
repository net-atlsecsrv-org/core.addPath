# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Peakon

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Peakon with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Peakon with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Peakon.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Peakon (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Peakon, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Peakon single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Peakon supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Peakon from the gallery

To configure the integration of Peakon into Azure AD, you need to add Peakon from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Peakon from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Peakon**, select **Peakon** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Peakon based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Peakon needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Peakon, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Peakon Single Sign-On](#configure-peakon-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Peakon test user](#create-peakon-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Peakon that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Peakon, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Peakon** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

    `https://app.peakon.com/saml/<companyid>/assert`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Set additional U R Ls" selected with the "Sing on U R L" text box highlighted.](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL:
    `https://app.peakon.com/login`
