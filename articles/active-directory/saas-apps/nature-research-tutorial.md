# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Nature Research

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Nature Research with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Nature Research with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Nature Research.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Nature Research with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Nature Research single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Nature Research supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Nature Research from the gallery

To configure the integration of Nature Research into Azure AD, you need to add Nature Research from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Nature Research** in the search box.
1. Select **Nature Research** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Nature Research

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Nature Research using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Nature Research.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Nature Research, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Nature Research SSO](#configure-nature-research-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Nature Research** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, the Identifier and Reply URL values are already pre-populated with Azure but you need to enter the Relay State value.

	In the **Relay State** text box, type the URL:
    `https://www.nature.com`  
    click **save**.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://sp.nature.com/saml/login?idp=<IDP_ENTITY_ID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Sign-On URL value is not real. `<IDP_ENTITY_ID>` is the Azure AD Identifier copied from the **Set up Nature Research** section. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the Basic SAML Configuration section in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Nature Research.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Nature Research**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Nature Research SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Nature Research** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Nature Research support team](mailto:onlineservice@springernature.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Nature Research Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Nature Research Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Nature Research for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the Nature Research tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Nature Research for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure Nature Research you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
