# Tutorial: Integrate Knowledge Anywhere LMS with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Knowledge Anywhere LMS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Knowledge Anywhere LMS with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Knowledge Anywhere LMS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Knowledge Anywhere LMS with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Knowledge Anywhere LMS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Knowledge Anywhere LMS supports **SP** initiated SSO and supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Adding Knowledge Anywhere LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Knowledge Anywhere LMS into Azure AD, you need to add Knowledge Anywhere LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Knowledge Anywhere LMS** in the search box.
1. Select **Knowledge Anywhere LMS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Knowledge Anywhere LMS using a test user called **B. Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Knowledge Anywhere LMS.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Knowledge Anywhere LMS, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Knowledge Anywhere LMS](#configure-knowledge-anywhere-lms)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B. Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Knowledge Anywhere LMS test user](#create-knowledge-anywhere-lms-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B. Simon in Knowledge Anywhere LMS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Knowledge Anywhere LMS** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CLIENTNAME>.knowledgeanywhere.com/`

    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CLIENTNAME>.knowledgeanywhere.com/SSO/SAML/Response.aspx?<IDPNAME>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL, which is explained later in the tutorial.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CLIENTNAME>.knowledgeanywhere.com/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Knowledge Anywhere LMS Client support team](https://knowany.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000469034-SAML-2-0-Single-Sign-On-SSO-Set-Up-Guide) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up Knowledge Anywhere LMS** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.
